      <P>I have received notice from Senator Tuffy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to give an update on its monitoring of the implementation of South Dublin County Council's Traveller accommodation programme and the delivery of same.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Feighan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to make a statement on developments on the proposed decentralisation of 10,000 Government jobs to areas which have not previously benefited from decentralisation.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree with the Order of Business as proposed by the Leader. Will the Leader arrange a debate in this House following the results of the Northern Ireland Assembly elections last week? I believe I speak for many people in this country in saying the results are depressing, because those who have tried to wreck the Good Friday Agreement since 1998 are now in the ascendancy and those who have attempted to use the agreement for their own party political gain are also in the ascendancy in the other community. We have to reflect on these <Col N="1586" />matters. I ask the Leader to organise a debate and to arrange for either the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Taoiseach to come to the House. In the current situation Dr. Paisley is entitled to become the First Minister in Northern Ireland and I do not believe he is fit to hold that office. I do not believe he or his party have been a source of good in Northern Ireland politics. In one way or another, both Governments have to confront that situation collectively, with the support of both Parliaments in both jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>While there has been criticism of our Government's position, particularly on its decision to exclude the SDLP at a critical stage in the negotiations, it is now ultimately a matter for the people of Northern Ireland to live with the consequences if they select parties which have such a rejectionist tone and are intent on not healing the divide which is evident in Northern Ireland. Governments in Dublin and London can only do so much. Any decision by the Government to advance the process and promote some initiative at this stage will be supported by this side of the House.</P>
      <P>As the Cathaoirleach will be aware, I wrote to him this morning requesting him to consider convening a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to consider how, by discussion and agreement, we can proceed with the appointment of the three Members of this House to serve on the new Oireachtas Commission. I ask him to consider that request in the bipartisan, co-operative way in which it has been put. It would be useful to discuss how we can advance this issue and come to agreement on all sides.</P>

      <P>I wish to point out to Senator Brian Hayes that, in the absence of any authorisation under section 8(iii)(b) of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Act 2003, I do not regard this as an appropriate matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. Perhaps the Senator can find another way of raising the matter, perhaps by way of a substantive motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree we should have an immediate debate on developments in Northern Ireland. However, I disagree fundamentally with Senator Brian Hayes on this matter. It behoves us, as democrats, to accept the outcome of the election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a joke among politicians that election results would be excellent if one could change the electorate. This is a classic example of such a joke. I am as depressed as anyone else about the outcome of last week's elections, however the people have spoken. It is important that this House debates the election outcome because it will be made clear to Dr. Pais<Col N="1587" />ley, and the DUP, that now he has been elected, he has a responsibility and we want to see how he will cope with it. I have seen, in the many stages of my life, how people change when they are given a responsibility to make decisions and how they can compromise. There has not been a year in my life when I have noted where one man's renegotiation is another man's clarification. We have had this many times in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>There are ways of moving this process forward. I have listened to various discussions with Dr. Paisley on the BBC and other broadcasters over the last number of years. There is nothing that cannot be sorted out if people have a will to sit down together. I agree with Senator Brian Hayes that some people may not have the will, but we must wait and see. Parliament on this part of the island must make it clear to the people of Northern Ireland that it accepts their decision and will work with them for the best for all the people of the island. I would welcome an early debate on the Northern Ireland elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reluctant to say much on the Northern Ireland elections because everybody has said everything that can be said. My views on Ian Paisley are colourful and I will not express them in the House. However, I am not aware of any member of his party who has been convicted of shooting, bombing or killing anyone. We must not make partial statements about who is culpable for what. Nothing in Northern Ireland was ever that bad that it justified the killing of a single human being. If we are going to talk about who is fit, we will be going into dangerous territory. I do not have a brief for the DUP for reasons to do with the exploitation of sectarianism. However, we must not go into the territory of who said what because many people with a major role to play in Northern Ireland are in grave danger of being accused of worse offences than sectarianism.</P>
      <P>It is time we had a debate on education and I ask the Leader to arrange one. Last Sunday, Rupert Murdoch's flagship organ in this country published what it claimed to be a survey of the best secondary schools in Ireland. It was nothing but a travesty of the achievement of schools. The newspaper informed us that going private can pay as Ireland's best schools are mostly fee-paying. I am happy that the schools my children attended, even according to the incorrect figures in <i>The Sunday Times</i>, are in the top 20 of the list, yet neither of them were fee-paying. I have no idea from where <i>The Sunday Times</i> drew the conclusion that the best schools are fee-paying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a lecturer in an institute of technology, I profoundly resent the suggestion that somehow going to university is a better achievement than going to an institute of technology. It is wrong and misleading to suggest that drifting into a pass B.Sc. at a university is superior to doing a degree in engineering at an institute of technology. That <Col N="1588" />is an offence to common intelligence. Only people who do not understand education could write such an article. We need a debate on education to rectify public perceptions on what is worthwhile in our education system.</P>
    <P>I remember when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. If a person was imprisoned in the Soviet Union following a protest we would have screamed blue murder. However, there is a Cork man in Limerick Prison for two months because he committed the offence of trespassing on Shannon Airport. He was fined &euro;750 and <i>in lieu</i> of non-payment he was given two months in prison. Two months in prison is a serious term of imprisonment&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Senator A Senator">
      <NameTxt>A Senator</NameTxt>
      <P>He should have paid the fine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>He chose on principle not to, which is something those on the Government side of the House would not understand. I will watch Fianna Fáil's principles over the community employment scheme. I have never underestimated that party. It will run away from its principles. The issue of proportionality arises here. In normal circumstances somebody like this, a first-time offender in prison for the first time, would end up in the training unit in Glengarriff Parade here in Dublin living in comparative ease, where Deputy Joe Higgins spent his four weeks. Is this man being treated differently because his offence concerned the war in Iraq?</P>
      <P>On a lighter note, I often wondered why the Progressive Democrats did not ask me to join its party when I arrived in Cork. I now know this is because it will not accept foreigners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised Senator Ryan should have to wonder why he was not invited to join the Progressive Democrats.</P>
      <P>I agree that it would be desirable for the House to discuss events in Northern Ireland and the outcome of the election there. I strongly endorse Senator O'Toole's comment that while we might not like the result, it is the democratic right of the people. We accept that right and have to go forward from here. We have known for many years what Dr. Paisley is against; we will now have to find out what he is for. While this is a central issue, on the other side there has to be a desire that the guns and semtex be put permanently out of use in a verifiable way. The Belfast Agreement must stand. While it may be subject to review, it is the template on which everything is based. I hope the democratic parties in the North will recognise this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak about a different matter, the recently released annual competitiveness review. Out of the 15 developed countries, Ireland and Finland are now the most expensive. We are fourth highest in insurance, <Col N="1589" />third highest in electricity cost, third highest in landfill cost and, once the local authority estimates are completed, I would not be surprised if we move to the top in landfill costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>The vintners' representatives now concede there is a rip-off in soft drinks prices throughout the country. As we approach Christmas and try to encourage drivers to stay away from drink, why are soft drinks now far more expensive than alcohol? It is a disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on education. Perhaps we might include in that debate the problem of dropping out from school and its links with juvenile crime. Many of the barriers to social inclusion and educational attainment lie outside the school gates. Schools are desperately trying to deal with social issues that are profoundly ingrained. It is naïve in the extreme to regard the National Educational Welfare Board as the panacea to all these ills. Its fundamental function is curative rather than preventive.</P>
      <P>With regard to the lacuna or otherwise concerning community based organisations, a whole industry of community based organisations promoting social inclusion is receiving massive funding from the taxpayer comprising a plethora of individual empires and disparate groups, voluntary and statutory. On the other hand we have a home school liaison service, which by all accounts is working extremely effectively. Through the Leader I call for an immediate and thorough evaluation of the effectiveness of all these community based organisations in the context of their individual and collective contribution to social inclusion to be followed immediately by fundamental and appropriate amendments to the Education Welfare Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on Northern Ireland. However, as my colleague, Senator O'Toole has suggested, it is not possible to second-guess the electorate. I am not at all upset by the result of the election; it is probably quite a good thing. These are the two parties causing all the trouble. Let them get into office and face the realities of life. They might be more effective being presented with the realities of Government than being a totally destructive Opposition. It is the price of Dr. Paisley and the Shinners. My attitude is, now they have it, let them get on with it. I wish them well because the people of Northern Ireland have suffered enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader of the House take a certain action with regard to the meeting of committees? <Col N="1590" />Once again, the meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport, of which both she and I are members, is neatly timed to coincide with the Order of Business. I do not think that is acceptable. We should organise a boycott. Seanad Members should refuse to go to these meetings until the Order of Business is over. Meetings cannot be held without a Member of the Seanad being present, as they will not be quorate. That is a simple and effective way of putting manners on them. This is an important committee and as we are debarred from attending it, we should have a good debate in the House about transport.</P>
    <P>The Luas works will be held up for five weeks because of Christmas. It is a complete and utter nonsense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>We should have a debate on that matter.</P>
      <P>Yesterday was international AIDS day. We should have a debate on this subject as many young people have lost contact with the disastrous reality of this disease. Without, I hope, being too offensive, I was very sorry to see the Vatican once again put out a statement yesterday to commemorate it in which it undermined the use of condoms. I find that extremely foolish. Perhaps a little hint could be dropped to the Vatican's ambassador, the Papal Nuncio, to have a moratorium on statements on human sexuality for one year. They should give the rest of us a break&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the request for a debate on Northern Ireland in the wake of the post-election situation. However, I disagree with Senator Brian Hayes. There is a danger in denigrating political parties because one may appear to denigrate the people who elected them. In life one plays the hand one is dealt and if the cards fall that way, then that is the position. The two parties which have appeared as leaders on either side are classic outsiders who have now come inside. The challenge to them is to behave con<Col N="1591" />structively as insiders. My recipe for the Government in the short term would not be feverish activity, but masterly inactivity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. Now that Ireland has the highest inflation rate in Europe, can we reasonably expect that the Government will not do anything tomorrow to fuel it further?</P>
      <P>I would also welcome a debate on Northern Ireland following the elections. It behoves us as democrats &ndash; we are all true democrats &ndash; that, whatever our private views, we allow for the possibility of change. Once the DUP engages with both Governments, the tune might change. Perhaps Dr. Paisley is a mighty mouse and what he says in north Antrim might not be the same as what he says when he goes to London, or, please God, to Dublin. We have to allow for that possibility. I would welcome a debate on the matter.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for the compliments. Will the Leader invite the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to the House prior to the Christmas recess to discuss the European working time directive in regard to non-consultant hospital doctors? In his capacity as president of the Council of Health Ministers, Deputy Martin should get a further derogation to allow units at Roscommon, Nenagh, Ennis and elsewhere to employ sufficient staff to maintain crucial 24 hour accident and emergency services. I further ask the Minister to confirm, as he confirmed to me at the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting, that he will open the accident and emergency unit in Roscommon after Christmas, that it will operate 24 hours per day and that the Hanly report will not affect it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
      <P>The House should note the signing of the Geneva Accord by moderate Israelis and Palestinians. We should support this welcome initiative. Although the act is symbolic, the symbolism is very important to counter the idea that there can be no peace or agreement between Israel and Palestine. That peace is inevitable and vital should be borne in mind, particularly when no progress is being made. Those on both sides recognise the inevitability and necessity of peace and are prepared to put themselves on the line by signing the accord. We have asked the Leader for a debate on this issue several times, but the Minister has yet to come in. As we approach the Presidency, it is extremely important that Ireland contributes to movements towards peace between Israel and Palestine.</P>

This could occur at any point on our coastline. It is important to hold a debate on this matter as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Senator Brian Hayes called for debate on Northern Ireland. He spoke about the results being depressing and asked for the Taoiseach or the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come to the House to debate the issue. He also asked about convening a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to deal with the appointment of the Members to serve on the new Oireachtas Commission and the Cathaoirleach replied that it was not appropriate for that committee. I too wish we could have clarity on this issue. If the Cathaoirleach can think of another forum or medium through which we can receive clarification, I would be glad to know of it. We should put our heads together on the matter.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole said we must accept the decision of the electorate and we must do so. We may cavil at the methods through which it came about, but we cannot cavil at the result. We are all strong exponents of democracy but if we turn about and say we do not like what came out of the ballot box, we are not democrats.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan asked for a debate on Northern Ireland. He also spoke about the report on education in <i>The Sunday Times</i>. I read that report too, which was awful. I was never in favour of benchmarking schools. Should schools turn out a prototype student who will get A, B C, D or E or should they turn out a rounded person? We cannot measure one against the other. Parents want decent results &ndash; we wanted them and we understand that &ndash; but at the same time many more qualities go to make up the character of a person and these are provided within the school ambience. To coldly name a school as being the top is completely wrong. If we go that way, we will create two-tier education and ghettos in education, which is wrong.</P>
      <P>The Senator also talked about trespassing in Shannon and asked why a person was fined. That is a court matter and concerns the person who delivered the fine. We do not engage in court issues here. The Senator said the maxim of proportionality entered into the issue.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis said we should discuss Northern Ireland and I agree. Senator Finucane mentioned the annual competitiveness review, which was published recently.

    <P>Senator Norris said there is a need for a debate on Northern Ireland. He also mentioned the scheduling of meetings of the Joint Committee on Transport. I cannot attend meetings of the joint committee because they take place at 2.30 p.m., which is quite ridiculous. Perhaps a boycott might work. The Senator also asked us to express our support for international AIDS day. He made some remarks about the church.</P>
    <P>Senator Maurice Hayes asked for a debate on Northern Ireland. I agree with his assertion that one must play the hand one is dealt. One must live with the hand one is dealt. I think the two parties will face up to each other to a much greater extent than we thought they would. They are now responsible for doing something rather than complaining about what others are doing. I appreciate the Senator's suggestion that we should have masterly inactivity from the Government, rather than frenetic running around.</P>

    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;3.&ndash;Section 10(1) of the Principal Act is amended by the substitution of &lsquo;not later than two weeks before the end of the expected week of confinement' for &lsquo;not later than four weeks before the end of the expected week of confinement'.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>This amendment seeks to amend section 10(1) of the principal Act to provide for the reduction in the compulsory period of pre-confinement maternity leave from four weeks to two weeks. Senators may recall that, during the debate on Second Stage, I undertook to examine the possibility of reducing the pre-confinement period of maternity leave. I am aware that the current four-week compulsory pre-confinement period of maternity leave has given rise to a situation where many <Col N="1599" />pregnant employees collude with their doctors to have a false confinement date inserted into their medical certificates so that they can avail of a longer period of maternity leave after the birth.</P>
      <P>This amendment arises from updated legal advice which states that, provided employees can avail of non-compulsory pre-confinement leave in excess of the two-week period, the reduction in the period of compulsory pre-confinement leave in section 10(1) of the Maternity Protection Act 1994 to two weeks does not reduce the level of protection and is not prohibited by Article 1(3) of the pregnant workers' directive. This amendment will effectively allow new mothers to take up to 16 weeks of their paid maternity leave after the birth of their child and offers them greater flexibility in managing their leave entitlements in a way which best suits their personal circumstances.</P>

Since entering this House in 1987, I have been attempting to have the change in question made to the legislation. I had discussions with the then Attorney General, Deputy McDowell, and the previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue. The current Minister clearly took the attitude that a right was no good if people did not treat it as such.</P>
      <P>This was a practical attitude to solving a problem which was forcing doctors and women to provide false evidence in regard to confinement dates. This is a welcome Bill and I thank the Minister of State on a personal and political note for his foresight in addressing this issue.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 9, after &ldquo;terminate&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or postpone&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 5 deals with the termination of additional maternity leave in the event of sickness of the mother. As I have already said, this may be in breach of Council Directive 92/85 on pregnant workers. The section provides that where a woman falls ill on maternity leave, such leave will be terminated and her illness will be treated as sick leave, as would be the case with any other employee. While this is acceptable for other employees, it is unfair to a mother who has given birth.</P>
      <P>This Bill specifies in section 5(4)(<i>b</i>) that &ldquo;the employee shall not be entitled to the additional maternity leave, or part of it not taken by her at the date of such termination&rdquo;. This is illogical and unjust. There is no reason the employee should not be entitled to avail of the balance of the maternity leave which had been suspended because of her illness. Will the Minister comment on the proposed amendment?</P>

      <P>I support Senator Terry. It seems hard-hearted that we allow for maternity leave but, if someone gets sick, we take that leave away again. I accept that women will not be at work because they will be on sick leave. However, it might be a good idea to give this additional time, to which a woman would have been entitled had she not become sick, to ensure that she is in the best possible health when she returns to work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the thinking behind the amendments. There are, however, two reasons which prevent us from accepting them. As Members are aware, what the working group, which consisted of a number of interested parties, agreed is, in effect, a compromise. Employers were asked to agree to certain things and while they did not consent to everything, they acceded to a number of points. Trade union representatives also obtained part of what they were seeking. As already stated, what emerged was a compromise.</P>
      <P>There are more substantial legal reasons for not accepting the amendments. I will read into the record the briefing note supplied by the Department and if any Member wishes to ask questions afterwards, I will be glad to deal with them.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 is inconsistent with the recommendations of the maternity review group. That group recommended that in the event of illness an employee should, subject to the agreement of the employer, be able to transfer from additional maternity leave to sick leave. If an employee transfers from additional maternity leave to sick leave, she will forfeit her right to any additional maternity leave not taken at the date of commencement of the sick leave. This recommendation is part of a composite set of recommendations made by the working group following negotiations between the social partners and Government Departments. To depart from this would be a significant variation from the package of compromises agreed, even if the legal situation allowed it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of a transfer from additional maternity leave to sick leave and the entitlement to the balance of the additional leave was also considered specifically by the working group. In this regard it was noted that the European Court of Justice stated, in Margaret Boyle and Others <i>v.</i> the Equal Opportunities Commission, that &ldquo;in order for a woman on maternity leave to qualify <Col N="1602" />for sick leave, she may be required to terminate the period of supplementary maternity leave granted to her by the employer&rdquo;. Where an employee terminates additional maternity leave in order to have her absence from work treated in the same manner as any other absence from work due to sickness, she may benefit from payment in respect of sick leave, depending on the sick leave arrangements available under her employment contract, whereas an absence on additional maternity leave does not attract payment.</P>
    <P>The pregnant workers directive prohibits the dismissal of an employee from the beginning of her pregnancy to the end of her maternity leave, save in exceptional circumstances not connected with the employee's condition. The Maternity Protection Act extends this protection to the end of the additional maternity leave period. An employee is, therefore, protected from dismissal in respect of pregnancy-related sick leave from the beginning of the pregnancy to the end of the additional maternity leave period.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, it is necessary to include in the Bill a mechanism to deal with situations where an employee who falls ill wishes to benefit with her employer's agreement from sick leave arrangements rather than unpaid additional maternity leave. She must forfeit her right to the additional maternity leave that has not been taken. Otherwise, in view of the legal protection in place up to the end of the additional maternity leave, employers will not agree to allow employees split their additional maternity leave due to the risk of potentially extending maternity protection for the duration of a prolonged period of sick leave. The maternity review group, which included employer and employee representatives, clearly recognised the legal consequences of the transfer from additional maternity leave and its recommendation was construed accordingly.</P>

      <P>I would need some time to read carefully through the Minister of State's reply. That is the difficulty we face when we deal with amendments and Ministers provide their reasons for accepting or rejecting them.</P>
      <P>It still makes sense for a woman who gets sick during maternity leave to postpone rather than terminate her leave. The legislation is behind the times. The Minister of State has addressed the recommendations in the report of the working group on the review and improvement of the maternity protection legislation. When this legislation was introduced, the Department of Health and Children's national breastfeeding policy recommended that all women should be encouraged to breastfeed for at least four months. However, since then maternity leave has been extended to 18 weeks paid leave and eight weeks unpaid leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children's optimal infant and young child nutrition policy has changed and mothers are now recommended to <Col N="1603" />exclusively breastfeed for the first six months and to continue breastfeeding thereafter in combination with solids for up to two years. The legislation does not meet the latest recommendation and the termination of maternity leave instead of its postponement is not a good step.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Under legislation to protect women's rights, particularly in the area of maternity leave, difficulties for employers cannot be created. They will question whether they should employ women if an environment is created in which their rights are onerous. Most employers work as hard as they can to create an environment whereby they can organise locum cover for women on maternity leave. Many companies operate fair maternity leave policies and pay full benefits to those on maternity leave. There is an option to transfer from unpaid maternity leave to a sick pay scheme, which presumably will not be taken unless the person can be paid for sick leave. If the maternity leave is extended, it results in additional costs to the employer. A step by step approach is important in these cases. Significant changes have been made in protection for mothers but further changes must be introduced stage by stage.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister of State on postponing maternity leave at the conclusion of sick leave; otherwise, there would be an onerous burden on employers. Employers must examine such issues on an economic basis because they must pay wages at the end of the day and make a profit to do so. We must be as fair as we can to ensure businesses have an opportunity. That is the real world and I have no doubt that is reflected in the working group's compromise. Perhaps this issue should be pursued in the context of paid parental leave in future as the rights of women are expanded and protected.</P>

      <P>Did the review group examine the possibility of a woman taking unpaid leave while not covered by maternity protection if she took up the provisions of the section? The woman who gets sick and takes advantage of these provisions loses out on paid maternity leave, which is unfair.</P>

      <P>I had children at a time maternity leave did not exist. It was considered that the world would come to an end if maternity leave was introduced but that did not happen and women became more popular as employees because they were needed in the workforce. Did the Minister of State's advisers take into account that the average family size is 2.1 children? It is not as if women will seek extra leave six times or more during their careers and, hopefully, not many will get sick anyway so the scenario will not arise where vast numbers of women will discommode employers by getting sick. I understand Senator Cox's point but this legislation should be <Col N="1604" />as strong as possible in order that we do not have to revisit it in a short while.</P>

      <P>Senator Terry referred to the breastfeeding provisions. Following her contribution on Second Stage, I undertook to discuss this issue with my officials and various other parties to ascertain whether I could table an amendment to address the Senator's well argued point. However, I have tabled an amendment to meet the Senator's concerns, which we will discuss later.</P>
      <P>There are several types of legislation but I categorise legislation in two ways. I could introduce legislation, for example, to reform the libel laws or the law relating to possessory title over which the two Houses of the Oireachtas have autonomy. We have free licence to draft the law as we wish. If the Opposition tables amendments, which the Government is convinced are good, they can be made. However, this legislation falls into a slightly different category because it is intended to reflect agreement by the social partners on certain measures that will cost employers while giving female workers who become pregnant extra rights.</P>
      <P>The working group worked out a compromise. It would not be morally correct for the House to unilaterally change a fundamental provision in a compromise hammered out between the social partners, which puts female workers at an advantage and employers at a disadvantage. Given that the legislation is supposed to reflect the hard fought and difficult compromise worked out over a long time by the working group, it should not be unilaterally changed in a dramatic way.</P>
      <P>The difficulty from the employer's point of view is that the EU directive provides protection against dismissal of a female employee from the beginning to the end of maternity leave. The Government has amended the directive to extend it to cover paid maternity leave and an additional eight weeks unpaid maternity leave. If an employee falls ill while on unpaid maternity leave, she can opt to go on sick leave but, if at the end of sick leave, she still has unused additional maternity leave, great uncertainty will be created for the employer because he or she will not know how long the female employee will be out sick and there is still an issue relating to unused maternity leave. An employer could be stuck with an employee for years following protracted sick leave. The Unfair Dismissals Tribunal, the objectivity of which is not questioned by anybody, has decided in a number of cases that if somebody in normal employment falls ill and after a set period is unable to say when she can return, which depends on the conditions of employment, the employer is justified in terminating the employment and this is not an unfair dismissal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the reason the employers were so worried and that this was such a sticking point was that they did not want the spectre of an almost indefinite period of sick leave being totally <Col N="1605" />protected, by law, against dismissal. That might be acceptable for big multinational companies, but a great deal of our employment is provided by small and medium sized companies. The measure would create a very strong disincentive in such cases. That is the reasoning behind the concerns. While I can understand the logic and humanity behind the proposed amendments, I regret I cannot accept them.</P>

      <P>This amendment is necessary to reflect more closely the intention of the maternity working group and to ensure consistency with the Parental Leave Act 1998. Currently, section 5 of the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill 2003 provides that determination of additional maternity leave, in the event of sickness of the mother, must be at the discretion of the employer. However, the intention of the maternity working group was to mirror section 7 of the Parental Leave Act 1998, which provides that parental leave may be taken in a broken manner, with the agreement of the employer, rather than in a single block of 14 weeks. In other words, it is a change of emphasis. The basic rule is that the leave may be taken in parts, rather than as a block. However, we have to write in the provision that it must be cleared with the employer.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1607" />The Labour Party proposes the deletion of subsection (2), which we regard as an unnecessary restriction on the right created by the section. I fail to understand the need for such a restriction, whereby it only applies if the maternity leave not taken is not less than 14 weeks. I would like to hear the comments of the Minister of State on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 6(2) of the Bill provides that an employee may request to postpone her maternity leave with effect from a date she selects, but only if the period of maternity leave concerned which she has taken on that date is not less than 14 weeks and that not less than four of those weeks are taken after the end of the week of confinement. The pregnant workers' directive, No. 92/85/EEC, provides for a continuous period of 14 weeks maternity leave to be allocated before and-or after confinement, in accordance with national legislation and-or practice.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General's office has advised that the directive does not allow for the splitting of the 14 week maternity leave period. Implementation of the directive may also not have the effect of reducing the level of protection already in existence in member states on the date the directive was adopted. As the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act 1981 provides that the maternity leave period shall not end earlier after the end of the expected week of confinement, it is not possible to reduce this level of protection.</P>
      <P>I was also concerned about this when I looked at it. We consulted the Attorney General's office and were informed that, unfortunately, nothing could be done about it because, under the EU directive, there is provision for the protection of a pregnant employee for a continuous period of 14 weeks from the date of confinement. The advice we have received is that we cannot do anything in domestic legislation which would effectively weaken the protection given in that regard. In this context, splitting the period of leave would be interpreted as a weakening of it.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, on the basis of the advice received from the Attorney General's office, it appears that we cannot do anything about this issue. However, we received advice from the Attorney General's office previously on a matter which we are now in the process of amending as a result of further legal advice in the meantime. I will undertake to have some legal experts look at the matter again to see if we can do anything about it.</P>

      <P>It is necessary for legal reasons for the employee to choose to take resumed leave or to forfeit that leave. The directive on pregnant workers prohibits the dismissal of an employee from the beginning of her pregnancy to the end of her maternity leave, save in exceptional circumstances not connected with the employee's condition. The Maternity Protection Act 1994 extends this protection to the end of the additional maternity leave period. The European Court of Justice has held in a series of cases that &ldquo;the dismissal of a female worker on account of <Col N="1609" />pregnancy, or essentially, on account of pregnancy can affect only women and therefore constitutes direct discrimination on grounds of sex&rdquo;. An employee is therefore protected from dismissal in respect of pregnancy-related sick leave from the beginning of the pregnancy to the end of the maternity leave period.</P>
      <P>It was felt necessary to include in the Bill a mechanism to deal with a situation where an employee falls ill after she has returned to work on a temporary basis. She must resume her maternity and-or additional maternity leave, as appropriate, or forfeit the right to the leave. Otherwise, due to the legal protection in place up to the end of additional maternity leave, employers will not allow employees to postpone or split their maternity leave due to the risk of potentially extending maternity protection for the duration of a prolonged period of sick leave.</P>
      <P>Section 6(6) is constructed so that an employee who has returned to work temporarily due to the hospitalisation of her child, who is then absent from work due to sickness, must at the time she notifies her employer of her illness in the normal way also indicate she is taking sick leave. Otherwise, she will be automatically deemed to be on resumed maternity leave. This construction leaves the option with the employee of choosing either resumed maternity leave or sick leave.</P>

      <P>The way in which the section is constructed obscures what is effectively a compromise between the social partners who deliberated on the matter. The working group recommended that provision be made in legislation or in regulations for paid time off for mothers to attend one complete set of antenatal classes. At least, three of the classes are to be taken during the pre-confinement maternity leave period. The current position is that employees are not entitled to any paid time off to attend antenatal classes.</P>
      <P>Employers' representatives on the working group agreed to a number of commitments, which have a direct cost implication for them, including this one. The compromise reached was that employers would pay employees for time off to attend antenatal classes apart from the last three, some of which may be taken during the pre-confinement maternity leave period. Time off to attend the remaining classes will be at the employee's own expense unless the employer agrees otherwise, which is often the case in any event.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Senator that the last three classes might not necessarily fall into the pre-confinement period, which has now been reduced to a fortnight. There was wheeling and dealing and it was generally agreed at the meetings of the working group that a woman would need six to eight antenatal classes. They suggested that it be taken as being six, for half of which they would pay. This was agreed and is now reflected in this section.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Tuffy's amendment. I am familiar with antenatal classes in the Western Health Board region. In many cases there are four classes. It is always recommended that these take place prior to month eight in case anything happens in the last four weeks and the delivery is premature. Given the small cost to employers of these classes, many of them will facilitate the employee by allowing her to have time off. To stop the last three would discriminate against women in areas like the Western Health Board region where it would mean not being paid for time off for three out of the four classes. The difficulty is not with the good employers but with the bad ones who do not implement rights and fight them all the way. While I accept this tiny issue is part of a larger agreement, I call on the Minister to reconsider it.</P>

      <P>To maintain consistency with national breastfeeding policy, which was changed by the Minister for Health and Children on 5 August 2003 to promote exclusive infant breastfeeding for the first six months, I propose to amend the provisions contained in section 8 to now provide an entitlement to breastfeeding breaks in the workplace or reduced hours to breastfeeding employees who have given birth within the previous six months.</P>
      <P>A breastfeeding employee is defined in section 2 of the principal Act as &ldquo;An employee whose date of confinement was not more then 26 weeks earlier, who is breastfeeding and who has informed her employer of her condition&rdquo;. As this definition encompasses the six month period, I am advised it is not necessary to make specific reference to six months in the amendment to section 8 of the Bill. While I am not too hung up about it, this is the advice I have received. The main thing is that we are changing it from four months to six months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite" hpid="Ms White Ms White">
      <NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am not trying to be awkward, I wish to draw attention to a problem. I do not know how a woman can work and breastfeed at the same time. It is an impossibility and would be very detrimental to the mother's health. I breastfed my daughter for seven and a half months and I do not know how a woman could work and breastfeed.</P>
      <P>Figures produced by La Lèche League show that Ireland has the lowest percentage of mothers breastfeeding in Europe. Why is this the case? I was the only one out of 20 in my prenatal class in 1970 who breastfed. At that stage I thought every mother breastfed. There is something radically wrong in our culture. Breastfeeding is the greatest way for a mother and child to bond. As life is hard enough and we all have our trials and tribulations, we should all encourage mothers to breastfeed. In Ireland 31% of mothers breastfeed at birth in comparison to 98% in Denmark, 97% in Sweden and 69% in the UK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Breastfeeding gives the child the emotional stability to survive the struggles and problems life puts in all our paths. I stayed here today specifically to make this point. There is something seriously wrong in our country if we have the low<Col N="1614" />est breastfeeding rate in Europe. Some 33 years ago I was the only one out of 20 breastfeeding. I would prefer those present not to ridicule my opinion about working mothers. It would be unfair to a mother to breastfeed and to go to work. How can a mother go home to breastfeed and then come back to work again? Breastfeeding would not work like that; a mother needs to mind herself and protect herself when she is breastfeeding.</P>
    <P>The nutrients in breast milk are much better than those in processed formula milk. Nutrition is key to the formative stage of the baby's brain. Breastfeeding benefits emotional stability and physical and intellectual development. I am an advocate of breastfeeding. It is a tragedy that 33 years later we are still behind the times here. I would be interested in hearing Senator Henry's opinion as to why we have the lowest rate in Europe. I apologise for diverting to this topic. However, it is an important social point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator White's comments on the value of breastfeeding. It is very important physically, psychologically, intellectually, etc. It is very sad that the incidence of breastfeeding is so low in this country and worse still that it goes down for mothers lower on the socio-economic scale. A child in social class one is much more likely to be breastfed than a child in social class five.</P>
      <P>I take the Senator's point that it is more difficult for women to work and breastfeed. We must remember that in most of the world women do most of the agricultural work and breastfeed babies at the same time. The baby on the back who is being breastfed is the lucky one rather than the one who is a year older and has to be left at home and is getting goodness knows what from a dirty bottle. While I fully support her sentiments, we must recognise that many women have to work and breastfeed. It is more difficult in industry, schools or hospitals than it is in a country where women work in agriculture. However, it is a very big improvement to have employers play their part in encouraging breastfeeding, which has been a real problem here.</P>
      <P>Refugees soon realise that breasts in the western world are considered sexual attributes rather than organs of nutrition. Frequently, they feel that it is not socially desirable to breastfeed and rather than being a good example to us, they stop doing it also.</P>

I accept that it is difficult for mothers who work and breastfeed. I admit that I am part of the age group that had to give up work on getting married. We stayed at home to work and rear children. We generally had more children than women have today and we breastfed them. It is <Col N="1615" />difficult, but women are adaptable and can manage.</P>
      <P>It is also difficult for women to work when they have young children, regardless of whether they breastfeed. I wish more women would breastfeed. It is our job to encourage them to do so, by enacting legislation to make it easier for women to work and breastfeed.</P>

      <P>As I said, it is a question of education. Women are not encouraged to breastfeed by the medical profession. It is a great pity that it is generally not a popular thing to do at present. It is our duty to improve working conditions for breastfeeding mothers. Indeed, I would like to improve working conditions for all mothers. Fathers have a big part to play in this but only female Members are in the House. Where are all the Members who are fathers? Again, it is women who bear the brunt.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister is trying to tackle this problem and he recognises that we must make allowances for women. We have encouraged women back into the workforce in which they are a great asset. They contributed enormously to the development of the Celtic tiger. That said, women give birth and have to look after children, particularly in their early months. Employers and the Government need to recognise that there is a cost in providing for mothers with young babies. We are not going far enough. As in other European countries where breastfeeding is more common, we should also give mothers with young babies more time off work. This is a start but we should do more.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State's amendment covers what I am trying to achieve. We have a new and dreadful problem of obesity in children. Obesity in babies is much less likely if they are breastfed. The national breastfeeding policy has extended the amount of time a child should be breastfed before solids are introduced into the diet. It is a serious health issue and what the Minister of State has done will fulfil my objectives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept the position of Senator White and the other views put forward. I brought my child to Dublin to breastfeed and continued to breastfeed when I was back working in Galway. It is a huge challenge and we need to recognise the efforts of many women to continue breastfeeding for as long as they can. The amendment recognises the change in policy and this is most welcome. While it is not the ideal solution, it makes life easier. It would be lovely if mothers could stay at home with their children and not to have to work, but this is the real world and that is not the case.</P>
      <P>Women do not breastfeed for different reasons. Sometimes it does not work out for them, or it is not convenient and so on. It is important to point out that mothers who do not breastfeed are not inferior. It is important to bring balance to the discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members for their comments. I agree that there is something ingrained in Irish culture which results in us being at the bottom end of the breastfeeding league. We compare unfavourably to some continental countries in which levels are as high as 99%. However, we are starting from a low base. Ten years ago, some of those countries with levels in excess of 90% had levels of approximately 65% to 70%. At that time we were between 10% and 15% but now we <Col N="1617" />have levels in excess of 30%. We are moving in the right direction. The amendment represents a small step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>In regard to the general comments about the feasibility of breastfeeding and working at the same time, we have looked at the experience and legislation in continental countries. In some countries, an hour's break is provided twice a day while in other countries it is a single two hour break in the day. Such legislation reflects the fact that increasing numbers of working women are breastfeeding. I am aware that amendments have been tabled on the timescale and the hours that will be provided. This will be done by way of regulation once the legislation is enacted.</P>
      <P>I thank Members for what was a most informative discussion. I do not know if I am any wiser as a result, but I am certainly better informed.</P>

      <P>On the subject of why more women are not breastfeeding &ndash; I accept that this does not come within the remit of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform &ndash; at its clinics, the Department of Health and Children hands out formula milk to new mothers. This is well and good for those mothers who have made a decision to bottle feed for whatever reasons but the matter needs to be examined. If clinics are giving free formula, there is no encouragement to breastfeed. I would much prefer the clinics to concentrate on encouraging women to breastfeed. I take it the matter does not arise here but as we are discussing encouraging more women to breastfeed, this is an area which should be examined.</P>

      <P>Section 8 provides for breastfeeding breaks where facilities are available in the workplace. Where they are not available, the mother will get additional time off. I seek to delete certain words to effect a change whereby the section provides simply that a mother will get time off work for the purpose of breastfeeding in accordance with the regulations. Many workplaces do not have breastfeeding facilities. Will the Minister of State consider providing additional time to mothers who breastfeed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment also seeks to change the wording in section 8 to make it positive. The only facility required for breastfeeding <Col N="1618" />is a chair to permit the mother to sit down. I do not see why employers should not have to provide a chair. Nothing else is needed. If the chair was in the corner of an office or where other people have coffee, that would be fine. It is not as though this is a big deal. It would encourage people to look on breastfeeding as a natural process if we provided that some attempt had to be made to put something as simple as a chair in place. I am not looking for a room to be provided. If a woman wishes to feed on the job rather than keep going in and out, there should be a chair. There will not be dozens of women sitting around breastfeeding. Babies are very quiet when they are this young. It is only when they begin to move around that one begins to run into trouble with them. In respect of this legislation, we are discussing babies who could fit in a basket.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be useful if employers had to provide facilities. The Bill, as drafted, does not oblige employers to provide breastfeeding facilities. The wording in section 8 is unnecessary. Why does the Bill provide that an employer shall not be required to make provisions? If he or she is not required to make the provision anyway, why not leave the section out? Perhaps the section is included to keep some employers represented on the working group happy. It is not good legislative drafting to include a completely unnecessary subsection. It has a negative tone.</P>

      <P>Senator Henry's amendment No. 35 relates to the definition of &ldquo;special&rdquo;. It is important to ensure that we do not establish the right to a special room. If employers believe they have to provide special facilities in the form of air-conditioned rooms, they will say they cannot do so. Elsewhere in the Bill, a section provides that employers do not have to go to extreme costs. Senator Henry's point makes sense. Facilities do not need to be special. It is important that employers bear that in mind and that the legislation does not preclude anything.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>While I understand what she is aiming at, Senator Terry's amendment would have the effect of reducing the employee's rights under the Bill. Her amendment is contrary to the recommendations of the maternity working group. While I acknowledge it probably was not the intention, as it stands the amendment would restrict breastfeeding breaks to the workplace. It takes no account whatsoever of employment situations where it might not be possible or feasible to provide suitable breastfeeding facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill implements in full the recommendations of the working group on bre<Col N="1619" />astfeeding. It provides that an employee who is breastfeeding and has informed her employer accordingly will be entitled for the purpose of breastfeeding to either breaks where facilities are provided or a reduction of working hours. The employer in each case decides whether breastfeeding breaks or a reduction in working hours will be available to the breastfeeding employee. Such time off work will attract payment as normal. Section 8 of the Bill is also consistent with Article 10 of the International Labour Convention on Maternity Protection which was adopted in Geneva in June 2000. Article 10 of the convention provides that a woman shall be provided with a right to one or more daily breaks or a daily reduction of hours worked to breastfeed her child.</P>
    <P>Section 8(2) of the Bill provides that an employer shall not be required to provide facilities for breastfeeding in the workplace if the provision of such facilities would give rise to a cost other than a nominal cost to the employer. Where an employer chooses not to provide facilities for breastfeeding in the workplace to avoid a greater than nominal cost, the employer will be required to agree to a reduction of working hours for the employee to facilitate her in continuing to breastfeed after her maternity leave has ended.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court ruled in a case relating to the Employment Equality Act that one can only place social obligations in the public interest on private property owners where no more than nominal costs will be incurred. This judgment has been reflected in the wording used in section 8(2) of the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill. We have sought legal advice regarding whether we could go beyond the Supreme Court ruling in this legislation. The advice was that we may not. Where an employer does not provide breastfeeding facilities in the workplace, the employer will be required to agree, as I have said, to a reduction in the working hours of the employee.</P>
    <P>The court's ruling was a constitutional interpretation of the Employment Equality Act. Under Article 43 of the Constitution, which deals with private property, a person in the private sector cannot be obliged to provide facilities like this if it will involve more than a nominal cost. We recognise that this provides an out for employers. They can invoke the protection of Article 43 of the Constitution. In the case of a small operation with a low general cost base, an employer could say the provision of breastfeeding facilities would incur a more than nominal cost adding significantly to that cost base. To get around this, we are providing the alternative that the employer will be obliged and compelled to give breastfeeding employees time off with full pay to breastfeed their children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Henry's amendment could be amended to provide that while facilities must be provided in the workplace, they need not be <Col N="1620" />special breastfeeding facilities. The Bill states an employer shall not be required to provide breastfeeding facilities in the workplace if the provision of such facilities would give rise to a cost other than a nominal cost. We must define the facilities. They do not need to include a glorified, air-conditioned room. A definition of this sort would protect the employer as well as the employee. Otherwise, it could be the case that if I wished to breastfeed and my employer said I could use a chair in a room, I might decide the facilities provided were not good enough.</P>
      <P>If the childminder is close to the workplace, many employees might prefer to have their child brought to them. The issue is the definition of &ldquo;special&rdquo; as it relates to appropriate facilities for a mother who chooses to breastfeed at work.</P>

      <P>Now that we have explained all we are looking for is a chair, will the Minister of State look at this again because I certainly do not want to get into a tangle with the Supreme Court? A chair would be a nominal amount. Senator Tuffy spoke about making this positive. People breastfeeding babies on aeroplanes, boats or elsewhere do not expect some special room &ndash; they just sit there and feed the child. It is not expected that people should have such facilities and it would be ridiculous. It would run totally counter to what the Bill is trying to do, namely, to encourage breastfeeding and not isolate people in some air-conditioned room, as Senator Cox said. Perhaps the Minister of State will look at this between now and Report Stage. Even if all the great powers say it will not do, perhaps the Minister of State might be able to do something to make it look a bit more positive.</P>

      <P>To go back to what Senator Henry said, we are trying to provide for an either-or situation &ndash; either employers provide breastfeeding facilities in the workplace or they do not. I imagine many employees would prefer the option of a break to go away and breastfeed somewhere else if the facilities in the premises in which they work are not adequate. Where breastfeeding facilities are provided, I am totally hostile to the idea of delineating what should be in place in primary legislation. As Members know, we will bring in regulations to deal with all these matters and I will see if we can impose some minimum standards in the regulations.</P>
      <P>As I interpret the situation &ndash; we might consider some way to tighten it up to provide for this &ndash; in circumstances where an employer says he has breastfeeding facilities which are clearly unsuitable or insufficient, the employee can say those facilities are not suitable and choose to avail of option B. The employer is bound by that. That is my interpretation of the situation. If we need to change the wording in any way to make it clear that is our interpretation, I am prepared to look at that.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to put a dampener on this again but we may be leaving ourselves open to challenge. I am an employer and I breastfed my daughter for seven and a half months. I accept all one needs is a chair but I am concerned about the conditions. If an employee brought a baby to work, I could imagine them saying that it is not an adequate place for their baby to be kept. I am being realistic. I am talking about the conditions in which the baby is looked after in the interim. If this happened in our company, people would spend the day looking at the baby. We have many staff who have babies and when they bring them in to show them off, the whole place stops. How many work facilities are appropriate for caring for a baby in between breastfeeds? If a person works in the East Wall and lives in Clondalkin, how long would it take to bring the baby in? It would be better to let the person go home and breastfeed there.</P>
      <P>Senator Terry made the point about good companies. As an employer, the relationship with staff is mutually beneficial. Employers need staff and staff need employers. I do not see it as a conflicting situation but as one to be faced together. There are companies, however, which would not have the same view. Our company is run by two women and we were very maternalistic for the first ten years but we could not continue to mind everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where would one mind a baby? I know what Senators Henry and Terry are doing &ndash; they are trying to push out the boundaries for the future whereby maternity leave may be extended beyond what it is at present. However, we need to be careful. Somebody could be awkward and <Col N="1622" />ask whether a room is appropriate for a baby. A former Head of State visited our company out of curiosity and his wife brought her baby with her and breastfed during the visit. It would be diplomatic not to mention the name of the country of which he was president. I am talking about staff and about where a baby would be looked after. Could somebody take a case? A company may not be able to afford a crèche.</P>

      <P>There are two options. The employer must provide the facilities or, if he cannot do so for some reason or other, he must give the employee paid time off to avail of breastfeeding facilities. Due to the nature of the business we do in Leinster House, I imagine the facilities will be provided. I am a busy constituency Deputy and a busy Minister of State, so I will not personally make the arrangements. I thank the Senator for offering me the job but it will be up to other people to make the arrangements. I am only taking the Bill through the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>It would be best if employers tried to make arrangements within the workplace. From an economic point of view, this would be the best way to try to address the situation. This is an added reason to remove the subsection, as proposed by the Labour Party amendment. An employer is not obliged to provide facilities, but it is not necessary to say that in the legislation. It should be the other way round. We should be trying to promote the provision of facilities such as a crèche. I do not think we have a crèche in Leinster House, but perhaps I am wrong.</P>

      <P>(<i>a</i>) by the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (1):</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(1) If a woman who has been delivered of a living child (in this section referred to as &ldquo;the mother&rdquo;) dies at any time before the expiry of the twenty-fourth week following the week of her confinement, the father of the child (if he is employed under a contract of employment) shall be entitled in accordance with this section to leave from his employment for a period ending as follows&ndash;</P>

    <P>(<i>b</i>) if the mother dies at any time after the expiry of that sixteenth week, the period ends, subject to sections 16A and 16B, at the end of <Col N="1625" />the twenty-fourth week following the week of her confinement.',</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>) by the substitution of the following subsections for subsections (3) and (4):</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(3) Subject to section 16B, the period of leave under subsection (1) shall commence within 7 days of the mother's death; and in this section and sections 16A and 16B&ndash;</P>

    <P>(<i>b</i>) a period of leave which ends as mentioned in paragraph (<i>b</i>) of that subsection is referred to as &ldquo;subsection (1)(<i>b</i>) leave&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>(<i>b</i>) 8 weeks, all or part of which is postponed in accordance with section 16B, commencing either in accordance with that section or immediately after the end of his subsection (1)(<i>a</i>) leave, as may be appropriate.',</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>(<i>c</i>) in subsection (5), by the substitution of &lsquo;Subject to section 16B, entitlement to further leave under subsection (4)' for &lsquo;Entitlement to further leave under subsection (4)'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposes to delete section 9 of the Bill, as initiated, in order to remove subsections (1A)(<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>), (<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>) and any consequential references and to insert a new section 9 in the Bill which applies the appropriate increases to the periods of fathers' leave under section 16 of the principal Act, consequential to a previous Government amendment.</P>
      <P>Subsections (1A)(<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>), (<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>) of section 9 as initiated create an unintended link between the father's leave entitlement and the mother's leave entitlement. This is inconsistent with section 16 of the principal Act which provides for certain leave entitlements for a father in his own right, if he is in a contract of employment, in the event of the death of the mother within 22 weeks of the birth of a living child. For example, subsection (1A)(<i>a</i>) provides that if the mother terminated her additional maternity leave under section 14A of the Bill and subsequently died, then the father, provided he is employed under a contract of employment, would not be entitled to leave from his employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1626" />Linking the father's entitlement to the mother's in this manner would have the effect of denying the father his leave entitlement in his own right, as provided for under section 16 of the principal Act. A similar issue arises in subsection (1A)(<i>d</i>). Subsections (1A)(<i>b</i>), and (<i>c</i>) also give rise to inconsistencies in section 16 of the principal Act by tying the father's entitlement to leave to the mother's leave which has been postponed.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment of section 10 of the principal Act, to reduce the compulsory period of pre-confinement maternity leave by two weeks, effectively increasing the post-confinement period to 16 weeks, gives rise to the consequential amendment of section 16 of the principal Act which makes provisions for father's leave in the event of the death of the mother. The new section 9 of the Bill incorporates these consequential amendments. Accordingly, I propose to delete the existing section 9 and to insert an amended section 9 which removes the entire subsection (1A) and any consequential references to it.</P>
    <P>This amendment also gives rise to a number of consequential technical amendments to sections 10 to 13, inclusive, of the Bill and to the application of any consequential increases to the father's leave entitlements arising from the appropriate amendment. There was an unintentional tie-up between the mother's leave entitlements and the father's leave entitlement to which he should be entitled in his own right. This tie-up reduced the father's leave entitlement in the sad situation where a mother dies within a certain period. It is to get rid of that and to improve the situation regarding parental leave that this amendment has been introduced.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister of State for some advice on this area and to put some scenarios to him. Amendment No. 40, which is proposed by the Government, contains the phrase &ldquo;if he is employed under a contract of employment&rdquo;. I would like the Minister of State to clarify some concerns I have about this provision. When a mother dies during childbirth, for example, the father may not be entitled to anything under the social welfare code because he is self-employed or he is the director of a company in which he owns more than 15% of the shares. I am concerned about the payment of maternity leave benefit to a person who is self-employed or a director. Can such payments be paid to a father? Can benefit payments be transferred to a father if he is under a contract of employment? Legislation relating to fixed-term employment was passed some months ago. The rights of workers are now provided for under the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act. The legislation provides that the rights of a person employed under fixed-term contract law will be <Col N="1627" />commensurate with those of a permanent employee. I am interested in the effect of the &ldquo;under a contract of employment&rdquo; proviso in the areas I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>The maternity protection and paternity leave schemes are concessions granted by employers to employees. The schemes apply only to people who are employed, as we understand the term &ldquo;employed&rdquo;. A person who is self-employed is, in effect, employed by himself or herself. It is possible that a person who forms a company or is the managing director of a company is under a contract of employment from the company. It is obvious that the paternity leave provisions would apply to such people. The provisions apply to persons who are employed under fixed-term contracts.</P>
      <P>I did not anticipate that I would be asked about the payment of maternity benefit under the social welfare code. I do not have the social welfare code with me to help me to answer the question. One's entitlements depend on the contributions one has made and, for example, if one has paid the contributions at the appropriate rate over the appropriate period. I cannot answer the question. I will get the answer to Senator Cox's question from the Department of Social and Family Affairs. If a father is receiving social welfare at the time the mother dies, I presume he is entitled to the benefit mentioned by Senator Cox. My opinion is based on my recollection of the social welfare code, but I will get a proper answer from the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Tuffy asked about her amendment, which is substantially the same as the Government amendment. Amendment No. 40 achieves substantially what the Labour Party's amendment sought to do. The consequential amendments have been proposed as technical amendments. They will make the appropriate changes to take into account the fact that we have taken out an entire section and replaced it, in effect. The consequential amendments do not have any sub<Col N="1628" />stance. They will make the technical changes which arise from the substantial amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask about leave and the payment of benefit. One of the benefits I mentioned relates to the payment of maternity benefit, which reaches a maximum of &euro;175 per week. If a mother who is in receipt of maternity benefit dies when her child is very young, the father should inherit her right to receive payments, even if he is in employment and has the right to take time off. Perhaps this is outside the Minister of State's jurisdiction. If we are to transfer certain rights, we should also transfer the right to receive payments. A father who has to take time off work in such circumstances may not be paid by his employer because it is unlikely that the employer will have a paternity benefit pay scheme. As a consequence, such a father may depend on the payment of maternity benefit to a greater extent.</P>

      <P>This makes no substantive change to the law. Section 22 of the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill 2003 provides for the amendment of Schedule 3, paragraph 5 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 to take account of the new rights to time off to attend antenatal classes and breastfeed. The proposed amendments to section 22 are necessary to ensure consistency with the new provisions contained in section 12 of the Redundancy Payments Act 2003, which was enacted in May 2003 after the publication of the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill 2003. The commencement of the provisions contained in this amendment are subject to the commencements of the relevant subsections of section 12 of the Redundancy Payments Act 2003. We are simply saying that, when it comes to calculating people's rights to redundancy payments, time spent on parental leave, at antenatal classes and breastfeeding is all accountable, something to which no one can object.</P>

      <P>Next Tuesday, subject to the agreement of the Whips. I said on the first amendment that it was indicative of the Minister's commitment to this area and the whole equality agenda that he took on board the issues we raised with him regarding the points made here on Second Stage. However, I am still very concerned about the issue of maternity rights for Members of the Oireachtas and local authorities. We have not come to terms with the issue of providing for the Members of this House the right to be absent herefrom during the period of the maternity confinement, either for the mothers having the babies or for the fathers whose wives or partners might have babies who do not live. If I allow this opportunity to pass, I give up all the reasons for which I thought it important to have women here. One can see the changes that we have made to the legislation today and those made to previous legislation that affects the rights of women, children and many other issues where the contributions of female Oireachtas Members were extremely important.</P>
      <P>I once again appeal to the Minister. Perhaps this legislation is not the right vehicle, but I ask him to put this matter on his equality agenda so that, by the time this session finishes, we may have some sort of recognition that the women of this House &ndash; the mothers and would-be mothers &ndash; have an entitlement to take the appropriate time off just like every other woman in this State without losing out on anything by doing so, and without the Government or Opposition losing out either. If we do not reflect that at some stage in how we treat Members of the Oireachtas and the duly elected people who come before us, we fail ourselves and the Constitution and do not protect women. We are entitled to protection in the same way as every other woman in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for listening to the previous debate on this Bill and coming forward with changes today. I also fully support Senator Cox in what she has said on many occasions about securing rights for the women of the Houses of the Oireachtas. I ask the Minister to make the necessary changes to make it easier for women to combine child rearing with their work, including breastfeeding. We must make life easier, and we should be setting the scene for that, showing private sector companies that we can look after women in the workplace. We should have our own crèche in this House for staff and members. It is a cause of shame to us that we have not provided that facility. We encourage others to do so but do not do it ourselves. We should take the lead on that, and I ask the Minister to try to make progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank him for the time that he has given to this Bill. It will certainly make an improvement, <Col N="1637" />but we still have a long way to go. I would like to see more time available to women to take off work when their children are very young. It would benefit children, society and everyone in the long term if those mothers who wish to stay at home with their children when they are young were facilitated. I would like to see that in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite" hpid="Ms White Ms White">
      <NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister and his officials for listening so attentively today and for the vision for the women of the next generation shown in the Chamber. As I said, I feel very strongly that mothers should not have to work and breastfeed. I maintain my position that, if they are breastfeeding for six months, they are entitled to be at home. Regarding the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, given the Minister's position as Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, perhaps it would be a good idea to put crèche facilities for the ladies of the House on the agenda &ndash; both the current young women who are going to have babies and new women coming in. Another important point relates to the hours the Seanad and Dáil sit in the evening. The night-time hours of this House are not family friendly. Therefore, the House should be open early in the morning. I park my car outside at 7.30 a.m. but I have to leave the car park and have coffee in Buswell's. I am then not able to get back in until 8.30 a.m. It might suit mothers better to be on the go early in the morning.</P>
      <P>I asked why participation in breastfeeding by Irish women is the lowest in the EU according to La Lèche League figures. I have a good idea of the reason that is the case but this is too public an arena in which to state it. I was unable to be in the House on the last occasion this issue was discussed because I had to attend a committee. Like Senator Tuffy, I am here as a woman, rather than as a spokesperson on the issue, and because the role of breastfeeding is critical to the development of children. I am not inferring that, if a mother does not breastfeed, she is any less of a mother but it is natural and better for the baby. There is an ignorance which, as Senator Terry said, we should address, particularly if the Department of Health and Children is pushing powdered milk on mothers.</P>

      <P>I am here in my capacity as justice spokesperson, but I am interested in the issue as a woman and as a person. I would like us to develop longer maternity leave but we also need to examine other European countries where there is paternity leave. This would mean the leave could be interchangeable between parents, which would be helpful to many Oireachtas and local authority members. In this case, if women members did not want to take the leave, perhaps fathers could do so and it could work both ways and in different ways for different families. The recent census figures indicated that an increasing number of men are staying at home to be the home-makers. That is the way in which society is moving and it is a fact we must recognise in legislation.</P>
      <P>I agree that the Civil Service should show the way not just in legislation, but in terms of the facilities it provides. In many ways it has done so. The public service took the lead on job-sharing and so on but more can be done, particularly in Leinster House. It is not just woman unfriendly, but family unfriendly and father unfriendly in the way it is organised and we need to examine it.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for the changes he made which followed on issues we raised in our amendments &ndash; for example, the allocation of six months as opposed to four months for breastfeeding breaks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy" hpid="Ms Tuffy Ms Tuffy">
      <NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to know whether the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has monitored the progress of South Dublin County Council, of which I was previously a member, in terms of the delivery of its Traveller accommodation programme. There does not seem to have been much progress in respect of this programme, which was adopted almost five years ago and which is due for completion in 2004.</P>
      <P>There has been a reduction in the number of dwellings and halting sites bays provided by South Dublin County Council in that period. There are different reasons for that, particularly in cases where sites had to be closed down and new ones opened elsewhere and where emergency accommodation had to be provided, etc. However, there is a problem in terms of delivery. The Government has required local authorities to put in place Traveller accommodation programmes, etc. The situation is similar to that relating to housing programmes. Is the county council being given the necessary support to allow it to deliver on its targets or is the council at fault in some way? Progress has been extremely slow.</P>
      <P>The situation in respect of housing has improved. In my county council area, we are starting to see delivery of such housing but this took some time to achieve. The same cannot be said, however, with regard to the Traveller accommodation programme. This is leading to a lack of faith on the part of the settled and Traveller communities. Many members of the Traveller community do not have anywhere to stay or do not have proper accommodation. These people were given hope when the accommodation programme was adopted, but the closer we come to the completion date, and in the absence of delivery, they are losing that hope.</P>
      <P>Members of the settled community do not really understand that some of the illegal sites in their areas only came into being because enough permanent accommodation has not been provided. I accept that there are small numbers of Travellers who are not indigenous and who come here to stay for a couple of weeks on illegal or unauthorised sites and leave a mess which has to be cleared up by the county council. These people cause a great deal of distress to local communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1640" />Delivery in respect of the accommodation programme must be achieved in order that everyone remains on board. County councillors in my area are generally supportive of the Traveller accommodation programme in individual proposals. However, in the absence of delivery and the consequential pressure from both sides, it is difficult for councillors to continue to do so. I await the Minister of State's response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD" hpid="Mr. Parlon Mr. Parlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The role of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in respect of Traveller accommodation is to ensure that there is an adequate legislative and financial framework in place within which local authorities, including South Dublin County Council, can provide accommodation for Travellers. The Department supports local authorities in undertaking Traveller specific accommodation projects through the provision of guidelines on the standards to be achieved for the various types of Traveller-specific accommodation and by providing 100% funding for the provision of new Traveller accommodation and the refurbishment of existing accommodation.</P>
      <P>The implementation of its five year programmes is a matter for each local authority. The Department monitors progress on the implementation of these programmes through reports from local authorities, through each local authority's return on the annual count of Traveller families within its area, including details of their accommodation circumstances, and from ongoing contacts with local authorities. South Dublin County Council also makes available to the Department ongoing progress reports in respect of emerging proposals for Traveller accommodation.</P>
      <P>South Dublin County Council adopted its 2000-2004 Traveller accommodation programme in March 2000. At that time, the council estimated that over the lifetime of the programme, additional accommodation would be required for 315 Traveller families. It estimated that a further 62 families would be accommodated on halting site bays vacated by families moving to group houses. It is understood that the council's assessment of need indicated that 74 families would opt for standard local authority accommodation and that 240 units of Traveller-specific accommodation would be required. However, it is understood from the council that the rate of new family formations has been less than originally estimated and that the requirement for Traveller-specific accommodation during the course of the programmes will in fact be 160 units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date, the council has provided 59 of the required 74 units of standard accommodation, completed 19 new units of Traveller-specific accommodation and recently signed a contract for the construction of a further ten units at Belgard. In addition, it has completed planning approval stages for 68 units. It is expected that <Col N="1641" />the plans for a further 26 units will proceed to the consultation phase early in 2004. The council has also identified three further sites for the remaining 17 units and is at the early stages of developing accommodation proposals for these sites. As the provision of new units of accommodation has not been at the rate which had been originally hoped, the council has provided up to 50 temporary halting site bays and is in the process of upgrading other temporary units of accommodation pending the provision of the required permanent facilities.</P>
    <P>Since the adoption of the programme, the Department has provided a total of &euro;9.29 million to South Dublin County Council for such schemes. This is in addition to expenditure on the provision of standard local authority accommodation in which Traveller families are being accommodated. The latter represents considerable investment in the provision and refurbishment of Traveller-specific accommodation in south Dublin. The council is in the process of rolling out its comprehensive accommodation programme. While it accepts that it is unlikely that the full programme will be completely rolled out before the end of the five year period, the council proposes to continue to make considerable progress on the complete programme.</P>

      <P>It is with great anger that I again raise this issue on the Adjournment. I have raised it on numerous occasions in the past. As the Minister of State is aware, four years ago the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, announced that 10,000 jobs would be decentralised to areas which had not already benefited from decentralisation. The town in which I live in County Roscommon made submissions in respect of this programme. However, four years have passed and nothing has happened. I raised this matter on the Adjournment six months ago and a special debate on decentralisation has also taken place. Why has a decision not been made?</P>
      <P>I appreciate that it has been necessary to spend time consulting widely with staff interests and management. However, in order to create a more even spread of public service jobs and to save some smaller rural areas from oblivion, it is time to make a decision in respect of decentralisation. Two months ago, the Taoiseach stated that an announcement would be made before Christmas. The people of County Roscommon and other rural areas are dissatisfied with false promises and false dawns. I hope the Minister of State will indicate that favourable decisions will be made in respect of areas such as that which I represent.<i></i></P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate on behalf of the Minister for Finance. I fully appreciate the keen interest in the issue of decentralisation, both within and outside the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1642" />The Government's commitment to introducing a new programme of decentralisation has been copper-fastened by its inclusion in An Agreed Programme for Government. We have undertaken to move forward the progressive decentralisation of Government offices and agencies. The commitment in the programme for Government requires us to take into account the national spatial strategy, which is aimed at ensuring all regions develop to their potential.</P>
    <P>It has been clear from the outset that a wide range of important issues must be taken into consideration before arriving at a decision, which the Minister for Finance has reiterated in the Dáil on many occasions in reply to parliamentary questions. As the Minister has frequently made clear, it is not and cannot be as simple as identifying a set of criteria on the basis of which all decisions relating to a new programme of decentralisation can be taken.</P>
    <P>As with the previous programme of decentralisation, which made such a significant contribution to many communities across the country, a new programme of decentralisation has the potential to act as a tremendous economic catalyst with the Government leading the way and providing the capability of delivering public services effectively from locations outside Dublin. One hopes the private sector will follow the public sector and, as it reduces its dependence on locating in the capital city, there will be increased evidence of balanced regional development, which is not only desirable but essential.</P>
    <P>It would have been preferable that a decision on a new programme could have been made sooner but, given the level of interest in the matter and the many and varied issues involved, it has taken longer than had been originally anticipated. However, given its importance, complexity and great significance, I trust the Senator will agree it has been appropriate for the Government to afford this matter the high level of consideration it deserves before reaching a final decision. As Members will be aware, more than 130 urban centres throughout every county have expressed interest in being part of the new programme.</P>
    <P>I assure the Senator and all other Members that all submissions and representations on behalf of towns received by the Department of Finance will be given full consideration as part of the decision-making process. The Government is determined that, as with the previous programme, a new programme should have regard to the desire to promote regional development, economic growth and the creation of a more even spread of public service jobs around the country. The Government is equally concerned to ensure decentralisation should not compromise the efficient delivery of public services.</P>
    <P>Decentralisation is, as much as anything else, a quality of life issue. Increasingly, people undertake longer commutes to and from work and this is not sustainable in the longer term. Decentralisation offers the opportunity to do something <Col N="1643" />about this by bringing work and home closer together. The Government is seriously committed to developing a coherent and comprehensive programme. I thank Senator Feighan for raising this important issue and I am pleased to have had the opportunity to restate the Government's position.</P>
