      <P>I have received notice from Senator Ulick Burke that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to establish an independent inquiry into the pollution of the Owendullagh river at Derrybrien, Loughrea, County Galway; and if funding will be made available to Galway County Council for costs incurred due to pollution and to provide for restocking of fish in the river and lake at Lough Cutra, Gort, County Galway.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator McHugh of the following matter:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Education and Science to outline what plans are envisaged in relation to St. Mura's national school, Buncrana, County Donegal, and Monreagh national school, Carrigan, County Donegal with regard to the provision of new buildings.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Brian Hayes of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to consider an application from the STAY Project in Tallaght, which is attempting to build on an existing youth diversionary programme, when he will be in a position to respond positively to this application and to make a statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, which is a referral motion whereby the subject matter of No. 13 on today's Order Paper is being <Col N="1646" />referred to the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, concerning the licence fees to be payable in respect of salmon, eel and oyster commercial fishing licences and salmon, eel, mollusc and shellfish dealers' licences issued or renewed for the period commencing on or after 1 January 2004, to be taken without debate; No. 2, the Sea Pollution (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2003 &ndash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 11.45 a.m; No. 3, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Powers and Functions) Bill 2003 &ndash; Second Stage, to be taken at 11.45 a.m. and to conclude not later than 2 p.m, with the contributions of spokespersons on Second Stage not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes, Senators may share time and the Minister is to be called upon to reply not later than ten minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage; and No. 17, motion No. 26, to be taken from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. There will be an extended sos today because of the Budget Statement.</P>

      <P>Does the Leader agree that the GAA's gesture to move the date of the 2006 all-Ireland football final from the last Sunday in September to facilitate the holding of the Ryder Cup is a magnanimous gesture that should be welcomed by everyone? Many of us are critical of the GAA, but it has shown great foresight in this matter. The Ryder Cup will be a huge sporting event for this country with a worldwide audience of more than 700 million which will bring considerable tourism opportunities. I congratulate this excellent decision by the GAA. The decision by the then Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy Enda Kenny, to bring the tournament to Ireland was also a great act of foresight.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader organise a debate on the Government's proposal to introduce a press council? There would be much merit in having a wide-ranging debate in this House given the experience and knowledge of many Members who either write or work for newspapers. The Government has a viewpoint, which is contested by the Opposition, that the press council should be appointed by the Cabinet. Before a decision is made on the membership of the press council, a debate in the House would be useful. The considerable experience of colleagues on all sides would add to such a debate.</P>

      <P>As today's Private Members' motion is on the budget and will take place within an hour and a quarter of the beginning of the Minister for Finance's Budget Statement, will the Leader ensure the proposer and seconder of the motion and spokespersons receive a copy of the budget speech as soon as it is distributed? This will give us time to prepare our speeches.</P>
      <P>The Kyoto Agreement is becoming a global issue with the news that Russia has now decided that it will not sign up to it. Russia and the US are outside of the agreement, on a day when France has had huge floods and the winter has hardly started. I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, to take up this issue in Europe. It must be dealt with and Ireland can be an honest broker. Europe has acted responsibly on this issue in the past and needs to do so again. It is not just about the two big superpowers. The US must be convinced that it is a part of the world, not some separate place, and must play its part, as well as Russia.</P>
      <P>This House passed a resolution in May on auctioneering practices. The Government agreed to pursue a report into the auctioneering sector and to ensure young people buying houses are treated properly. I ask the Leader to find out the position on this report. In other countries, developments have been made on the process of buying and selling of houses. One of the huge costs for people making a bid is the survey. In some countries, house surveys now have to be paid for by the vendor. This makes for a fair auction. People cannot be allowed to put their houses on the market with no intention of selling, as happens regularly in Ireland, to find out what price it will make so they can talk about it down the pub on Saturday night. Young people are being dragged along by these difficulties in the auctioneering area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In <i>The Irish Times</i> today, the President of the European Commission, in an interview, states that any country that does not ratify the next treaty will have to leave the Union. He says that one cannot allow one country to hold up the progress of 25. I thought the bedrock of the European Union and the reason we all were comfortable with it was that nothing could be done dramatically against our interests or wishes, but by negotiation and agreement. It is a tedious process but it has worked. Some Members know more about it as they were involved in the tedium. If the President of the European Commission makes statements such as this, we need to have regular debates in this House to respond and hear the Government's position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1648" />It cannot be a coincidence that a country which voted against the Nice treaty is treated to an interview like this by the President of the Commission. We need to debate the processes by which the EU makes its decisions if the threat of having to leave the Union if they disagree is hanging over every individual country during the ratification of a major treaty. That will mean it is no longer a genuine free choice. This is not the way for the European project to go and win popular approval. Such a threat increases the possibility of a future treaty being rejected in this country because people will get annoyed.</P>
    <P>We regularly get requests for debates on competitiveness. As I have often said, the problem with such debates is that they return to the single issue of price and cost competitiveness. Yesterday's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> carried a grim report on foreign managers working in Ireland and their perception of their Irish counterparts. They saw Irish managers as essentially being unimaginative, unstructured and paying little or no attention to deadlines etc., whereas Irish mangers thought they were doing a great job. If we are to debate competitiveness, I would like it to encompass all aspects. Forfás reports correctly highlight the cost of living but this is not the only issue in competitiveness.</P>
    <P>At Christmas, there are regular demands that those who were forced to leave Northern Ireland should be allowed to return without threat. All Members agree with this. However, one man forced into exile who had an impeccable record and did wonderful work is Bishop Eamon Casey. I appeal to the Catholic Church to lift this exile in order that an ageing man can return home to the country in which he served so well.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange at the earliest opportunity a detailed debate in this regard. Along with Finland, Ireland now has the highest prices in the euro zone, which is some record for a country of our size. Our prices are higher than those in Italy, France or any of those high price countries.</P>
      <P>I draw the Leader's attention to the serious allegation that Tesco has pressurised vegetable producers in north County Dublin to deny supply to the low cost companies Aldi and Lidl. This matter should be raised with the Competition Authority. Pressure should not be placed on suppliers to these low cost companies, which do not offer enough Irish goods on their shelves. In fact, they import most of their goods. If they are trying to buy Irish goods, they should be encouraged and not be threatened through some type of mafia operation to prevent them supplying the Aldi or Lidl supermarkets. Those companies have a 7% share.</P>

      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's point about the Kyoto Protocol. Ireland tries to conform to this protocol even though it is only a small economy compared to the US and Russia. The implications of the Kyoto Protocol, in particular the emissions directives and carbon taxes, will be felt severely by businesses in Ireland in the very near future. Given that President Bush is beholden to the oil industry, it is horrendous that a major economy such as the United States of America will not conform to the Kyoto Protocol. In the long-term interest of the environment, Europe should lead an initiative to encourage such countries to conform to these protocols.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Hayes's request for a debate on a press council, which would be very useful. We should also have a rounded debate on competitiveness. While I have not read the National Competitiveness Council's report, I note from the headlines that we have one of the highest industrial electricity costs. However, we have relatively low domestic electricity costs. Sometimes the negatives are exaggerated and the positives are ignored.</P>

      <P>It was reported on the radio yesterday that a judge, in sentencing a man for downloading images, said he would be particularly harsh because he had strong feelings in this area. While I am not addressing the issue on which the sentence was handed down, it is a matter of concern if somebody is sentenced on the basis of a judge's feelings. They should implement the law of the land. I remember a previous case when a judge said he was implementing the law of God. This judge may have been misreported. However, the law of the land should be implemented, not the feelings of a judge or the law of God. We should have a debate on the application of the law and the Judiciary in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I strongly support a proposed press council, which is very important. I take the opportunity to congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, who, in an excellent article in the past week, made some strong points about the right of people to defend their good names against the strong forces of the media. Newspapers and other media sources should tell the truth or pay the price. It is not good enough that they are able to destroy people's reputations and claim it is in the <Col N="1651" />public interest. The public interest has been so broadened as a concept that it is now absolutely and utterly meaningless.</P>

      <P>I have an interest to declare as a director of Independent News and Media. I support Senator Brian Hayes's request for a debate on the proposal for a press council and ombudsman. This is an ideal debate for the Seanad at this time as it would be a pre-White Paper debate before matters are cast in concrete. Senator Brian Hayes, I am sure entirely inadvertently, was unfair to the Minister. I was at a conference on Monday attended by the Minister who, even to the satisfaction of the newspaper journalists there, showed he had an open mind on this matter, which is still subject to discussion.</P>

      <P>As today is budget day, which will involve considerable debate on both sides of the House, I do not want to go into this matter yet. However, the staff at Letterkenny General Hospital are experiencing a serious work overload. The nurses there are working at 110% of capacity. For the past two days they have had to close the day care unit because they do not have 40 beds which were promised by the Department of Health and Children. Rather than asking for the Minister to come to the House, I ask for the Leader's indulgence in trying to contact somebody in the Department. The nurses went public yesterday to express their concern about not only the staffing problems, but also patient care.</P>

Some 40 <Col N="1652" />million people are suffering from this disease and 5 million people became infected in the past year alone. Some 95% of those 5 million came from what are euphemistically called developing countries. Given that we have a very young population with a growing multi-ethnic element, this issue should be discussed as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The matter raised by Senator McHugh was ignored by Mr. Hanly in his report. I support the call for a debate on a press council. There has been some very useful debate in the media in recent weeks, including some excellent contributions by Members of the other House on this matter. It is time to have such a debate, which I think would be a very well informed one and for which there is cross-party support.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at the remarks of Romano Prodi, as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> today. They certainly ups the ante on the debate on the new European constitution. His remarks were not helpful. It is important, particularly in view of the imminent commencement of the Irish Presidency, that we receive clarity from the Government on its response to Mr. Prodi's remarks.</P>

      <P>I again ask the Leader to provide time for a debate on credit institutions. As interest rates are expected to rise, the Central Bank has issued guidelines and requested the compliance of credit institutions to ensure that young people do not overextend themselves in borrowing. It would be timely for the House to participate in such a debate to ensure that rising interest rates do not catch out young people.</P>
      <P>It struck me with regard to the Kyoto Protocol that due to Russia having large tracts of land in Siberia, sub-Arctic and Arctic regions, including the cities of Murmansk, Archangel and Verkuta at minus 40º Celsius, the Russians might find some positive aspects in global warming.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate about telephone charges, with specific reference to the cost of mobile telephone charges? There has been an indication this week of a price war between various companies which might bring a reduction in land line charges, but mobile telephone costs in Ireland remain the highest in Europe, if not the world. The costs are inexplicably high and the Leader would do everybody a favour if she were to arrange a debate on the matter.</P>

      <P>Since the 1970s we have been warned that thinning of the ozone layer would lead to an increase in skin cancer. In this part of the world in the past ten years there has been a 64% increase in melanoma in men and a 54% increase in women. Surely this demonstrates that a debate on the Kyoto Protocol is urgently required in order to try to bring some sense into the American stance on the matter.</P>
      <P>It is ten months since the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform brought the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill before the House. Why bring Bills just to Second Stage? Although some Members tabled amendments, it appears we are not going any further with the Bill. It will be a year since the introduction of the Bill if Committee Stage is not taken before Christmas. Will the Leader find out what is happening with this important legislation?</P>

      <P>I call for a debate on the stealth taxes being imposed on local authorities throughout the country, namely development levies. A number of confidential letters went to county managers in May, July and October this year, over the heads of elected representatives. The development levies are both unjust and unfair and will have a negative effect on our competitiveness. Young people trying to start up business enterprises will be affected, as will young people building their first home as a charge of &euro;12,000 will be imposed on new homes.</P>

      <P>I welcome the words of Romano Prodi, the President of the European Commission, yesterday as a wake-up call. His comment that any country which does not vote in favour of the new constitution should leave should serve as a reminder to us. Senators O'Meara and Ryan spoke about their concerns, with which I agree, but we can do something about them. We need to sell the benefits we have had from the European Union well ahead of the next referendum. This will be called upon in the future. It is difficult to envisage a European Union of 25 or 27 nations allowing 1% of members to stop a development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the benefits of EU membership has been infrastructural investment. However, investment in the M50 seems to have created a huge parking lot. Operation Freeflow appears to work well in Dublin but the M50 is blocked every morning. We spent a huge sum of money, both Irish and European on the M50 but it does not <Col N="1654" />appear to be effective. Day after day we hear of tailbacks extending for many kilometres. Something can be done about this. I am not sure what the solution is, but the matter needs our attention.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Toole also raised the matter of the Kyoto Protocol which the Russians will not sign. As we know, the USA will not sign it either. The Senator said the Department of Foreign Affairs should take up the matter. He also asked about the report on auctioneering and I will inquire as to its status and the point about the vendor carrying out the survey. I notice that a Government sponsored pack is available in the UK which provides any person who wishes to buy a property with the advice he or she needs.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan mentioned Commissioner Prodi. The leader of the Commission is sometimes very enthusiastic in what he says &ndash; I use the word &ldquo;enthusiastic&rdquo; as a code word. He sometimes says things which are a little off centre. To take up Senator Quinn's point, it is a wake-up call which tells us all that we must watch it. On the other hand, one cannot be dictatorial. All countries are meant to be brought along in consensus. There was also a call for a rounded debate on competitiveness. Senator Ryan raised the matter of the former Bishop Eamon Casey. The Cathaoirleach decided the matter was not to be discussed.</P>
      <P>Senator Leyden raised the competitiveness report which we should seek to have debated in the House. He says Tesco is putting pressure on its producers to stop supplying Aldi. The Senator may have information on the matter, but I do not. Senator Leyden also praised Senator Quinn.</P>
      <P>Senator Finucane supported Senator O'Toole's position on the Kyoto Protocol. Senator Finucane noted that the USA was almost the worst offender and it has now been joined by Russia. What hope do small nations have of making their contribution to Kyoto when two large countries have opted out?</P>
      <P>Senator Mansergh spoke about procedural motions. Such motions should be considered as part of Seanad reform. I thank the Senator for bringing that to the attention of the House. The Senator also called for a rounded debate on competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris raised a matter related to the Judiciary. I do not intend to speak about the Judiciary, although I acknowledge the Senator called for a comprehensive debate on the matter. He does not want the personal feelings of judges to influence the sentences they hand down. Senator Norris praised the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Hanafin, on an article she wrote recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Maurice Hayes called for a debate on the press council. It is something else if the Minister was able to persuade the members of the <Col N="1657" />press that he still had an open mind on the matter. Like stem cell research, this is an issue on which debate would be compatible with the ambience of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Senator McHugh raised the matter of staffing levels at Letterkenny General Hospital. The matter is a suitable one to raise on the Adjournment. However, if the Senator wishes me to make an inquiry, I will oblige him.</P>
    <P>Senator Brady called for a debate on HIV and AIDS. He remarked on the fact that last Monday was an international day of consideration of the issue. A debate on the matter would be useful. Senator O'Meara also called for a debate on the press council and referred to Commissioner Prodi's remarks.</P>
    <P>Senator Hanafin was concerned and angry at remarks which were made about the church of which he is a member. The Senator called for a debate on the credit institutions. Senator Cummins brought a related matter to my attention yesterday which was quite startling. The ESB is lending people up to &euro;3,000 with no strings attached and no need to provide references or fill in a form. Senator Hanafin also brought up the issue of global warming.</P>
    <P>Senator Bradford spoke about the cost of mobile phones and mobile phone bills. Senator Henry said that in the past ten years, there has been a huge increase in skin cancer due to global warming. A debate on Kyoto is definitely warranted. Skin cancer is an angle we would not have considered, but the case it makes is very strong. I did not know such a huge increase had taken place.</P>
    <P>As I told the House last week, 200 submissions have been made in respect of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill. I cannot tell Members when the Bill will come before the House. It is remarkable that almost one year on we still have not got to the next Stage.</P>

      <P>37.&ndash;The Merchant Shipping Act 1992 is amended&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) in section 9 by inserting after subsection (2) the following:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;2(A) Where the Minister revokes or suspends a certificate in respect of a particular vessel, and is of opinion that it is in the interests of safety that the holder of the certificate should not be the holder of a certificate or licence in relation to other vessels, then the Minister may revoke or suspend any other certificate or licence held by the holder in relation to any other vessel.&rdquo;, and</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) in section by inserting after subsection (2) the following:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;2(A) Where the Minister revokes or suspends a licence in respect of a particular vessel under subsection (2), and is of opinion that it is in the interests of safety that the holder of the licence should not be the holder of a licence or certificate in relation to other vessels, then the Minister may revoke or suspend any other licence or certificate held by the holder in relation to any other vessel.&rdquo;                     '.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment refers to section 37, which amends section 16 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1992. This enables the Minister to revoke any or all passenger boat licences held by an individual who has been found guilty of an offence even when the offence has occurred on another passenger boat. A further amendment is now proposed to enable the Minister to revoke any or all <Col N="1660" />passenger boat licences and passenger ship certificates held by an individual who has been found guilty of an offence even when the offence occurs on another vessel. The earlier amendment would only have allowed the Minister to act in respect of any passenger boat licence and would not have been sufficient to enable the Minister to take action against an individual who owns both a passenger boat and a passenger ship.</P>
    <P>At present, section 8(5) of the Merchant Shipping Act empowers the Minister to refuse to grant a certificate to the owner of a passenger ship who has been convicted of an offence. Section 9(2) gives the Minister the powers to suspend or revoke a certificate where an owner fails or refuses to comply with a condition of a certificate but this provision only applies to the vessel to which the certificate applies. The Minister has no power in regard to any vessel the owner may have &ndash; that is, the Minister can only act in regard to the passenger ship in respect of which the convictions were made and cannot do anything about any additional ships or passenger boats the owner may have.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment will enable the Minister to revoke any or all passenger ship certificates and passenger boat licences held by an individual who has been found guilty of an offence even when the offence has occurred on another vessel. Senator Tuffy raised this issue on Committee Stage and we have taken her concerns on board. This amendment is preferable to the Labour Party's one because it is stronger.</P>

I approve of the Minister of State's acceptance of the amendment and its tone.</P>

The Minister of State said that if an individual is convicted, the Minister cannot issue a licence in respect of another vessel. Does that individual have to be convicted of an offence in Irish or EU waters? What is the position if an individual is convicted of an offence in some far-flung place? The Minister of State said a licence cannot be issued to an individual who has been convicted. What happens if an individual who applies for a licence is before the courts for a breach but the case has not come up and he or she has not been convicted and may not be? Can an interim certificate or otherwise be issued to get over that intervening period?</P>

      <P>On the last occasion the Minister of State was here, we raised the issue of the boats coming from the United States to the United Kingdom. Perhaps this issue was raised before I came in but it is the cause of much concern, especially in coastal areas. It appears these ghost ships or whatever one wishes to call them, which are in ports in the United Kingdom, may go back to the United States. I would like some assurance from the Minister of State that we have legislation to deal with this situation, especially when such ships are outside our territorial area. What type of surveillance is being kept by the Irish authorities in terms of the passage of these vessels, especially their passage back to the United States which will come very close to the Irish coastline? Is surveillance taking place? Is there legislation capable of dealing with this situation, especially in the event of a crisis?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope we always listen to Senators and their suggestions and ideas. We do not have the monopoly on what constitutes the best legislation. Until now, where an individual holds a licence or certificate for more than one vessel and has been found guilty of an offence in respect of any, the Minister cannot revoke the licence and-or certificate for any remaining vessels the individual may possess. Under the amendment put forward by Senator Tuffy, which we have taken on board, the Minister will now have powers to revoke the licence but can only do so in regard to ships operating from Irish ports and within Irish waters. Irish vessels are licensed and certified to operate in Irish waters but we do not have the power to revoke licences of those operating outside Irish waters.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Daly for raising the particular issue which is of grave concern to people throughout the country. He can rest assured that the Minister, with the Government agencies under his control, will take every precaution to deal with the movement of these ships which are currently based in Hartlepool. He has met the United Kingdom's ambassador here and expressed the Irish concerns and his officials will meet United Kingdom transport officials shortly to express our concerns. The Senator can rest assured the Government is doing everything possible to ensure these ghost ships, as they are commonly known, return to the United States sooner rather than later. They probably should never have been allowed to leave, but that was beyond our control. I also thank my officials for their help and support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá ríméad orm bheith sa Seanad inniú chun na díospóireachta ar an Dara Céim den Bhille an Aire Gnóthaí Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta (Cumhachtaí agus Feidhmeanna) 2003 a oscailt. Tugann an Bille deis dúinn díriú isteach ar chursaí a bhaineann lenár n-oileáin amach ón gcósta. Tá mé ag tnúth go mór le cloisteáil ó na Seanadóirí ar ball maidir lena gcuid tuairimí ar an reachtaíocht seo agus, dar ndóigh, a gcuid tuairimí maidir le cursaí oileánda i gcoitinne. &ldquo;Cur chun cinn agus cothú daonra a bheidh ag cur fúthu agus ag obair faoin tuath, sa Ghaeltacht agus ar na hoileáin, trí chúnamh a thabhairt chun pobail inmharthana agus bheo ó thaobh an chultúir a chothú sna háiteanna sin.&rdquo; Is é sin ceann de na spriocanna a leag an Roinn Gnóthaí Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta roimpi féin ina ráiteas straitéise.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom an deis a thapú chun cúpla rud a rá faoin sprioc tábhachtach sin go ginearálta roimh dhíriú isteach ar fhorálacha sonracha an Bhille. Is fiú a mheabhrú don Teach go bhfuil os cionn 40% de dhaonra na hÉireann, sin é, thart ar 1.5 milliún duine, ina gcónaí i gceantair tuaithe. Tá tuiscint níos fearr ann anois &ndash; go háirithe ag éirí as an obair ar fad a rinneadh i ndáil leis an straitéis spásuil náisiúnta &ndash; ar na hathruithe móra atá tarlaithe cheana féin agus atá fós ag tarlú sna ceantair sin. Samplaí de na mórathruithe seo ná an ghluaiseacht daonra &ndash; idir dhaoine áitiúla ag bogadh i dtreo na gcathracha agus a mhalairt treo &ndash; an fheirmeoireacht ag dul i leig, riachtanais agus rialacha nua i gcúrsaí pleanála agus comhshaoil ach go háirithe, easpa áiseanna agus infrastruchtúir.</P>
      <P>D'aithin an Rialtas an riachtanas a bhí ann cur chuige straitéiseach a chur i bhfeidhm a bheadh dírithe ar phobail a chónaíonn i gceantair tuaithe. Mar thoradh air sin, tugadh an cúram d'fhorbairt tuaithe don Roinn nua Gnóthaí Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta. Is é an dúshlán ar leith atá os comhair mo Roinne ná polasaithe a aimsiú a thugann aghaidh ar na hathruithe atá ag tarlú sna pobail tuaithe, tacaíocht a thabhairt dá bhforbairt agus cothromaíocht réigiúnach níos fearr a chur chun cinn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá mé sásta go bhfuil dul chun cinn leanúnach a dhéanamh le leas eacnamaíochta agus sóisialta na bpobal tuaithe a chinntiú faoin bplean forbartha náisiúnta &ndash; a bhfuil tionchar mór ag an bPáipear Bán ar fhorbairt tuaithe air &ndash; agus faoin gclár CLÁR ach go háirithe. Mar is eol don Teach, tá CLÁR ag díriú isteach ar na ceantair tuaithe faoi mhíbhuntáiste is mó a d'fhulaing titim sa daonra idir 1926 agus 1996, le meántitim de 50%. Beidh suim ag an Teach cloisteáil gur ghnóthaigh daonra iomlán de 284,000 buntáiste caiteachais de thart ar 14 milliún a caitheadh ar thacaíocht don bhonneagar fisiciúil, pobail agus sóisialta faoin gciste CLÁR sa bhliain 2002. Tagann cuid mhaith de na hoileáin mhara faoin gclár seo freisin, mar shampla, Árainn Mhór ó thuaidh, Inis Bó Finne, Cliara, agus Inis Tuirc san <Col N="1664" />larthar, agus na hoileáin Béara agus Cléire ó dheas.</P>
    <P>Is í bunaidhm pholasaí na Roinne i ndáil leis na hoileáin ná forbairt inmharthana na n-oileán mhara sin a bhfuil daoine ina gcónaí orthu a chur chun cinn agus iarracht a dhéanamh leibhéil shásúla seirbhíse a sholáthar do na hoileánaigh. Is féidir an bhunaidhm pholasaí seo a shainiú i dtrí chuspóir straitéiseacha: rochtain shásúil ar chóras iompair i rith na bliana ar fad do phobail oileán a éascú; pobail na n-oileán a spreagadh chun eagraíochtaí ionadaíocha a bhunú a oibreoidh le Ranna Rialtais, le háisíneachtaí Stáit agus le húdaráis áitiúla chun bonneagar, tionscal, talmhaíocht, iascach, turasóireacht agus araile na n-oileán a fhorbairt; agus polasaithe Rialtais maidir leis na hoileáin a chur chun cinn agus a chomhordú.</P>
    <P>Tá mé thar a bheith bródúil go pearsanta as an méid atá bainte amach do na hoileáin le blianta beaga anuas. Is dócha gurbh í an chéad chéim thábhachtach dár tógadh ná coiste idir-Ranna comhordaithe um fhorbairt óileán a bhunú i 1993 chun athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar straitéisí forbartha do na hoileáin agus na tosaíochtaí sin a mheas. Cuireadh tuarascáil chuimsitheach le chéile agus foilsíodh í sa bhliain 1996. Ba chéim thábhachtach eile í ná freagracht shonrach i leith na n-oileán a bhronnadh ar an Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán, a bunaíodh i 1997. Is cúis áthais dom gur thit na dualgais sin ormsa ag an am mar Aire Stáit ag an Roinn sin go dtí 2001 agus arís anuraidh nuair a ceapadh mé mar Aire ar an Roinn seo, An Roinn Gnóthaí Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Tá se rí-shoiléir go bhfuil lán-tacaíocht tugtha ag an Rialtas seo agus an Rialtas a d'imigh roimhe do chaighdeán saoil na n-oileánach a fheabhsú. Mar shampla, tá an soláthar i leith fhorbairt na n-oileán méadaithe ó faoi bhun &euro;2.5 milliún sa bhliain 1997 go dtí &euro;10 milliún don bhliain seo chugainn, sin é, &euro;7.5 milliún i leith thograí caipitil agus &euro;2.5 milliún i leith thograí reatha. Tá infheistíocht an-mhór déanta le seacht mbliana anuas i gcúrsaí infrastruchtúir na n-oileán, mar a chéile le seirbhísí &ndash; agus airím ina measc sin iompar farantóireachta agus aeir, céibheanna, bóithre, soláthar leictreachais agus uisce, cúrsaí slainte agus oideachais.</P>
    <P>Gan dabht ar bith is í rochtain shábhailte an tosaíocht is mó a bhaineann le hinmharthanacht phobail na n-oileán. Go deimhin féin, tá sé aisteach a smaoineamh go bhfuil sé 50 bliain ó thréig daoine na Blascaoidí, agus dá mbeadh na seirbhísí ann ag an am sin atá anois ann, ní tharlódh an rud sin, mar tagann bád farantóireachta isteach go dtí an Bhlascaoid chuile lá, nó cúpla uair sa lá, ach sin mar a bhí an saol, agus seo mar atá an saol. Tá feabhas thar cuimse tagtha ar na seirbhísí farantóireachta ó 1997 &ndash; faoi láthair tá 14 seirbhís á maoiniú le hais cúig cinn i 1997. Is fiú a lua chomh maith go bhfuil seirbhísí aeir á maoiniú go dtí na hoileáin Árann chomh maith le seirbhís ingearáin do Thoraigh i rith an gheimhridh. Níl deireadh leis <Col N="1665" />an obair seo go fóill beag. Rinne Ollscoil Cranfield stáidéar ar leith ar sheirbhísí aeir chuig na hoileáin i 2001, agus tá na moltaí sin fós á meas ag mo Roinn. Cheana féin, tá dul chun cinn sásúil á dhéanamh chun aerstráicí a chur ar fáil ar Inis Bó Finne agus ar Oileán Thoraí mar atá geallta i gclár an Rialtais. Ceapadh comhairleoirí le gairid le stáidéar a dhéanamh ar na seirbhísi farantóireachta agus ar an infrastruchtúr atá riachtanach ina leith. Táthar ag súil leis an tuarascáil sin go han-luath.</P>
    <P>Tá infheistíocht ollmhór déanta agus le feiceáil go soiléir i gcéibheanna oileánda le cúpla bliain anuas, mar shampla, caitheadh níos mó na &euro;1 milliún ar Chéibh Léab Gharbh in Árainn Mhór agus &euro;2.4 milliún ar Chéibh Mhachaire Rabhartaigh le freastal ar Thoraigh agus Inis Bó Finne. Tá &euro;1.75 milliún ceadaithe do Chéibh Rú an Átha le freastal ar Oileán Cliara agus Inis Tuirc agus deontas de bheagnach &euro;11 milliún, an ceann is mó a ceadaíodh ariamh do oileán, tugtha chun forbairtí móra a dhéanamh ar na céibheanna Cliara agus Tuirc iad féin. Anuas air seo, tá pleanáil maidir le mórfhorbairt na gcéibheanna ar na hoileáin Árann ag dul ar aghaidh chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Is dushlan mór eile do mo Roinn deiseanna fostaíochta inmharthana a chur ar bun ar na hoileáin. Tá na hoileáin Ghaeltachta ag fáil seirbhís mhaith ó Údaras na Gaeltachta, go háirithe mar thoradh ar scéim nua fiontair a fógraíodh i mbliana do na hoileáin seo. Faoin scéim sin, anuas ar na gnáthdheontais caipitil agus fostaíochta, beidh deontais eile suas go dtí &euro;90,000, nó 80% de na costais bhreise a bhaineann le gnó a bhunú ar oileán, ar fáil faoin scéim <i>de minimis</i>. Tá se inmholta go mbeadh aitheantas den saghas sin tugtha do na hoileáin taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht a thagann faoi chúram na Ranna Fiontair, Trádála agus Fostaíochta. Le tamall anuas, tá mo Roinn-se ag breathnú ar na féidearthachtaí atá ann ciste fiontair a bhunú do na hoileáin seo i gcomhairle leis an Roinn Fiontair, Trádála agus Fostaíochta. Tá mé sásta a chur in iúl go bhfuil dul chun cinn suntasach déanta maidir leis an gciste fiontair seo le deireanaí, agus tá súil agam scéim a fhógairt sa bhliain nua.</P>
    <P>Is cuid dhílis d'oidhreacht an Stáit iad ár n-oileáin mhara, agus cé go bhfuil go leor déanta le blianta beaga anuas, aithním an gá le feabhsúcháin bhreise ar rochtain, seirbhísí agus bonneagar le caighdeán maireachtála na n-oileánach a chothú agus a fheabhsú. Tá sé mar aidhm agam a chinntiú go leanfar ar aghaidh le hinfheistíocht fhiúntach i bhforbairt na n-oileán sna blianta amach romhainn, agus tá mé cinnte go mbeidh beannacht an Tí seo ann dá leithéid. Cad is fiú na hoileáin Arainn i gcúrsaí turasóireachta do chathair na Gaillimhe? Níl aon amhras ann ach gur fiú i bhfad níos mó ná caiteachas atá á dhéanamh ar na hoileáin.</P>
    <P>Beidh Uachtarántacht an Aontais Eorpaigh ag Éirinn sa chéad sé mhí de 2004. Is cúis mhór <Col N="1666" />sásaimh dom a chur in iúl go mbeidh trí chomhdháil thábhachtacha á n-eagrú ag mo Roinnse, mar chuid den Uachtarántacht seo, ag a mbeidh toscaireachtaí ó bhallstáit an Aontais mhéadaithe ann. Reachtálfar comhdháil amháin i mBaile Átha Cliath le plé a dhéanamh ar chúrsaí drúgaí. Reachtálfar an péire eile faoin tuath, ceann ar fhorbairt na tuaithe i gcontae Mhaigh Eo agus an ceann eile ar chúrsaí oileán agus nithe gaolmhara i gContae na Gaillimhe. Tá na socruithe i ndáil leis na comhdhálacha seo á ndéanamh faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>Is mian liom anois aghaidh a thabhairt ar an reachtaíocht atá os ár gcomhair inniu ag míniú aidhmeanna an Bhille ar dtús agus, ina dhiaidh sin, ag míniú téacs an Bhille de réir ailt.</P>
    <P>Bille gairid le sé alt a bhfuil trí aidhm aige: foráil a dhéanamh i leith cumhachtaí nua i ndáil le seirbhísí paisinéirí bus a chur ar fáil mar chuid de chonarthaí farantóireachta nó aeir éirithe; foráil a dhéanamh i leith cumhachtaí breise a bhaineann le haerstraicí a chur ar bun ar na hoileáin; agus daingniú a dhéanamh ar na cumhachtaí reachtúla reatha atá ag an Aire i ndáil le seirbhísí iompair go dtí na hoileáin.</P>
    <P>Tá an chumhacht maidir le seirbhísí paisinéirí bus ag teastail ar bhonn siarghabhálach chun faidhbe <i>ultra vires</i> a d'aimsigh Oifig an Phríomh-Aturnae Stáit a leigheas agus rinneadh plé air le gairid ag an gCoiste um Chuntais Phoiblí. Bhí i gceist díriú ar an ngné seo i gcomhthéacs Bhille an Aire Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán (Cumhachtaí agus Feidhmeanna)(Leasú) 2001 nár achtaíodh. Go bunúsach tá an chumhacht seo ag teastáil sna cuinsí go bhfuil riachtanas ann paisinéirí a thabhairt ar aghaidh idir an phointe tuirlingthe/fágála ar an mórthír agus an t-ionad daonra is giorra. Is sampla den chineál riachtanas atá i gceist ná an conradh farantóireachta d'Inis Bó Finne. Tagann an bád i dtír ag Céibh an Chloiginn agus bíonn seirbhís bus ceangailte leis an gconradh chun na gasúr scoile ón oileán a thabhairt ar aghaidh go dtí an scoil i dTuam nó Mainistir na Coille Móire. Sampla eile is ea an tseirbhís bus go Gaillimh a chuirtear ar fáil do phobail Oileáin Arann nuair a thagann siad i dtír ag Ros an Mhíl. I láthair na huaire tá riachtanas mar seo ann i gcás ceithre cinn as 14 chonradh farantóireachta chomh maith le conradh aeir amháin.</P>
    <P>Feidhmeoidh an dara cumhacht maidir le haerstraicí ar na hoileáin mar chreatlach reachtúil faoina bhféadfaí forbairt a dhéanamh ar sheirbhísí iompar aeir go dtí na hoileáin amach anseo ach cead an Aire Airgeadais agus an Aire lompair a fháil. Bhí an chumhacht chumasaithe seo san áireamh chomh maith i mBille an Aire Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán (Cumhachtaí agus Feidhmeanna)(Leasú) 2001 nár achtaíodh sa deireadh agus tá sé á lorg anois i gcomhthéacs gealltanais i gclár aontaithe an Rialtais maidir le haersheirbhísí a chur ar fáil go dtí na hoileáin.</P>
    <P>I gcomhthéacs na reachtaíochta atá molta, ceaptar go bhfuil sé iomchuí daingniú a <Col N="1667" />dhéanamh ar na cumhachtaí reachtúla reatha. Faoi láthair tá cumhacht ag an Aire foirdheontais a íoc i leith seirbhísí farantóireachta faoin Acht lompair Oileáin Arann 1946 agus Acht an Aire Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán (Cumhachtaí agus Feidhmeanna) 1998. Tá i gceist na forálacha seo a aisghairm agus iad a thabhairt isteach arís sa reachtaíocht nua.</P>
    <P>Ag díriú isteach ar théacs an Bhille anois, is foráil chaighdeánach í an fhoráil léiritheach atá in alt 1. Leagtar amach ann na sainmhínithe atá in úsáid sa reachtaíocht, mar shampla, ciallaíonn &ldquo;oileán&rdquo; oileán áirithe de chuid an Stáit. Maidir le &ldquo;comhsheirbhís paisinéirí bus agus oileáin&rdquo; a leagtar síos an bhrí de in alt 2, go bunusach séard atá i gceist na seirbhís bus do phaisinéirí a chuirtear ar fáil mar chuid de chonradh farantóireachta nó aeir idir oileáin áirithe agus an mhórthír.</P>
    <P>Baineann alt 2 le cumhachtaí an Aire i ndáil le seirbhísí iompair a sholáthar le haghaidh oileán. Féadfaidh an tAire, le toiliú an Aire Airgeadais, foirdheontais a íoc le haghaidh oibriú seirbhísí farantóireachta, mar a foráladh cheana faoi Acht Iompalr Oileán Arann 1946 agus Acht an Aire Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán (Cumhachtaí agus Feidhmeanna) 1998.</P>
    <P>Ina theannta sin, féadfaidh an tAire, le toiliú an Aire Airgeadais agus an Aire lompair foirdheontais a íoc i ndáil le seirbhísí paisinéirí bus agus oileáin mar chuid de chonarthaí farantóireachta nó aeir áirithe. Déanfar na cinn scríbe dóibh siúd a leagan amach i rialacháin. Tá an chumhacht á bronnadh gan dochar do bhailíocht foirdheontais a íocadh roimhe i ndáil leis seo.</P>
    <P>Tugann alt 3 cumhachtaí don Aire i ndáil le haeradróim a sholáthar i dtaca le haersheirbhísí a chur ar fáil idir na hoileáin agus an mhórthír. Sa chomhthéacs sin, féadfaidh an tAire, le toiliú an Aire Airgeadais agus an Aire lompair, talamh a fháil, trí aontú no go héigeantach, chun aeradróim agus saoráidí gaolmhara a thógáil, a fheabhsú, a leathnú nó a fhorbairt ar na hoileáin nó ar an mórthír más amhlaidh. Áirítear chun na críocha seo aon aeradróm atá ann cheana. Tá foráil ann freisin i leith maoiniú a dhéanamh ar na gnéithe seo.</P>
    <P>Leagtar amach in alt 3 na nósanna imeachta a bheidh le leanúint sa chás gur gá ceannach éigeantach, lena n-áiritear forálacha caighdeánacha maidir le fógra roimh ré, pleananna a thaispáint, fógra chuig daoine leasmhara, fiosrúchán poiblí, cuiteamh, eadráin, etc. Tá foráil san alt seo freisin maidir le cumhacht an Aire i ndáil le bainistiú agus oibriú aeradróm den sórt sin, nó, má údaraítear é le hordú arna dhéanamh ag an Aire le toiliú an Aire Airgeadais agus an Aire lompair, i ndáil leis an bhfeidhm sin a bhronnadh ar eagras reachtúil, mar shampla, chuig údarás áitiúil nó chuig cuideachta a fhaigheann maoiniú nó cuidiú ón Státchiste.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1668" />Baineann alt 4 maidir le haisghairm Acht lompair Oilean Arann 1946 agus alt 4 d'Acht an Aire Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán (Cumhachtaí agus Feidhmeanna) 1998, gan dochar do chonarthaí a bhí nó atá i bhfeidhm agus a rinneadh faoin reachtaíocht sin.</P>
    <P>Leagtar amach in alt 5 go n-íocfar caiteachas a bhaineann le riaradh an Achta ó thaobh an Aire Gnothaí Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta nó an Aire Iompair nó an Aire Airgeadais as an Státchiste ach cead an Aire Airgeadais a fháil mar is cuí.</P>
    <P>Is foráil chaighdeánach eile atá in alt 6 ina leagtar amach gearrtheideal an Bhille. Molaim an Bille seo don Teach.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to bring this Bill before the House. It is important we place the islands in their proper context because they are incredibly important. They have a population of 3,000 people, who are important in themselves and have a right to their share of good services provided by the State. The islands are repositories of a great deal of traditional Irish culture. In recent weeks, we have been commemorating the 50th anniversary of the last people leaving the Blasket Islands. Times were different then and there was no technology but, had those people had electricity, two daily services to the mainland, doctors on call and helicopters, it would have been possible to maintain the community on the Blasket Islands.</P>
    <P>I am not one for bemoaning the past &ndash; what is gone is gone and what is done is done. I was recently on an island with ESB workers who had installed an electricity service there. The island had been deserted but the people returned to it each summer to farm and fish. The cost was not excessive and I asked why the installation had not been carried out ten or 20 years ago. The answer was that the technology did not exist to lay the type of underwater cable which now exists in order to give a secure supply. Therefore, many of the changes relate to developments in technology in regard to boats, electricity cables and so on.</P>
    <P>The Estimates provide &euro;10 million for the islands, which some might say is a considerable sum of money. However, that is in the context of the fact that 254,000 people, a vast number of whom are tourists, visit Ireland every year. The importance of the Aran Islands to Galway city and Ireland as a tourist destination is the equivalent to the Boyne Valley or Glendalough in the east and their attraction and positive image of Galway means this expenditure must be put into context.</P>
    <P>Coca-Cola and other drinks companies spend vast amounts of money on brand marketing to try to create a good image. The Aran Islands' image is worth an enormous amount to Ireland Inc. every year. Dún Aengus, the people, the jarveys and so on make the islands an invaluable selling point. In that context, the money we spend on the islands is actually quite modest.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the organisers of next year's Milwaukee festival, which attracts more <Col N="1669" />than 100,000 people over three days, have decided to have islands as its theme. There is a huge business in tourism and the organisers know the American market is looking for something different. They do not want to come to Ireland to find MacDonalds. Rather, they want to find something different which is traditional and modern at the same time.</P>
    <P>The islands cannot exist in a time warp. We can preserve all that is good about the Aran Islands, their marvellous culture, language and fantastic archaeological ruins. However, those who visit the islands also want <i>en suite</i> services and the ability to travel by safe, quick and comfortable means. These people want the islands to have facilities to allow recreational activities on wet days and they want access to hotels, etc. What we must do is move forward positively in terms of providing the best of modern services while also protecting all that was good about the past and discarding the rest.</P>
    <P>The Bill does a number of simple things. The first of these is that it regularises a situation which was found to be <i>ultra vires</i>. I refer to the fact that I, as Minister, was responsible for the fact that people travelling from the islands were not left at the mainland by the boat and that was it. What is the point in bringing people from Inisbofin on the west coast and leaving them in Cleggan and saying that they are on their own? We dealt with this situation by tying up the boat contract with a bus contract and now, on days when regular services are provided, people can travel from Inisbofin to Clifden in Galway. However, we went one step further. There is no secondary school in Inisbofin so we arranged that on each Sunday evening and Friday evening, and on school holidays, children from the island are picked up at the pier and brought to their schools, Kylemore Abbey and St. Jarlath's in Tuam, on the mainland. The position is reversed when they are returning home. From the point of view of parents, that is a revolutionary change in the situation which existed 20 years ago when children came home for their mid-term breaks, returned to school and lost all contact with the island.</P>
    <P>It was pointed out by the Chief State Solicitor that there was a slight question that I had acted <i>ultra vires</i> and we want to put matters right. Anyone who argues with the principle of having an integrated transport service for the islands does not understand that most of the ferry ports are not people's final destinations.</P>
    <P>Until now, Údarás na Gaeltachta has developed airstrips on the three Aran Islands. As proposed in the Cranfield report, I want to develop further airstrips, initially on Inisbofin and Tory Island. To do that, I need the powers I am seeking in the Bill. In basic terms, the legislation will give me the power to purchase land, including, where necessary by compulsory purchase, for an aerodrome and to run that aerodrome. Much of the land will be purchased through what are termed &ldquo;friendly CPOs&rdquo; because a great deal of it is owned in commonage and there will, on <Col N="1670" />occasion, be difficulty in establishing title. It would lead to inordinate delays if we had to seek titles for every person. The land will be bought by agreement, in so far as possible, but we need, on a technical level, the power to take out CPOs, subject to all the normal protections that exist. We will be given the power, under the Bill, to delegate the operation of these services to a county council or another statutory agency such as, for example, Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>This is a simple Bill which will not do anything revolutionary. It will consolidate that which has already been done and ensure that matters in that regard are airtight. However, it will also allow us to proceed with the rolling programme where every islander will feel that he or she will have, subject to weather conditions at sea, as much access to services as is physically possible and the old days of being isolated on islands will be long gone. It is charming to think about isolated islands and the people who inhabit them, as long as one does not have to live on one 365 days a year. The modern islands are different because people come and go. In the late 1960s it took one a day to travel out to the Aran Islands and a day to get back. However, this meant that an islander who wished to attend an appointment or do some shopping in Galway had to spend a day travelling each way and was obliged to stay overnight in the city. That was incredibly expensive. People no longer have time to make such journeys.</P>
    <P>I am informed that people travelling on the regular services from Inis Mór in the Aran Islands can get to Galway quicker than those using the regular public transport service from Carraroe to Galway. That is a hell of a turnaround of which I am proud. It is great that people can travel from the islands to Galway in the morning and return home in the evening. That kind of practical improvement will maintain the population of the islands. The six provisions in this simple Bill will allow those things to happen.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a good debate on the Bill. I am anxious to proceed as quickly as possible with the Bill in order that the small matter of the bus services can be regularised in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá failte roimh an Aire go dtí an Seanad agus cuirim fáilte roimh an Bhille seo. Tá brón orm nach labharfaidh mé as Gaeilge inniu ach tá mé ag dul go rang seachtainiúil. B'fhéidir go mbeidh tuilleadh muiníne agam an bhliain seo chugainn.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and this timely Bill, with which my party has no difficulty. I also welcome the fact that the Minister spoke as Béarla. I know that he holds a Gaeltacht portfolio, but his use of English makes matters somewhat easier for Members who do not speak Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to digress to a certain extent and discuss the definition of island, particularly as it relates to Inch Island off the coast of Donegal. The Minister has probably received numerous representations from his colleagues in respect of this island. Transportation to the island is not a prob<Col N="1671" />lem and emergency transportation can gain access through the road network. However, there is another side to this story, namely, the infrastructural deficit that exists on the island. There are still 300 people living on the island who continue to refer to themselves as islanders. There is a small fishing industry on the island but there is no road leading down to the existing pier, which is almost devoid of the up to date facilities required to land a fleet.</P>
    <P>I presume the Minister is already well aware of this matter. However, I would welcome it if there was anything that could be done by way of changing the legislative detail. The place in question is called Inch Islanders and the people who live there refer to themselves as islanders. The Minister referred to the culture that exists on the Aran Islands and Inisbofin. The people to whom I refer have the culture and way of life of an island community. At present, a land mass must be completely surrounded by water for a particular period each year to be classified as an island. However, some provision must be made in terms of considering the cultural and infrastructural aspects.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty with the Bill. Anything which can help people to travel to and from the islands, particularly Tory Island, is welcome. We must keep our eye on the ball, however, and ensure that the existing ferry services are not adversely affected.</P>
    <P>I visited the Aran Islands in 1990. They were, to an extent, commercialised at that stage. People involved in business on the islands have stated that they are now becoming even more commercialised. It is a question of sustainability. The Minister is correct with regard to the direct and positive contribution made by the Aran Islands to the economy of Galway. The same can be said of Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay, which is visited by many people each year. I visit Arranmore once or twice a year and bring some friends of mine from Dublin whose lives in the city are hectic. They visit Arranmore in winter to get away from commercialism and everything else. I accept there is an argument that islanders must still be in a position to make money. However, we must achieve a balance without making it completely commercial and focus also on the area of protection.</P>

      <P>Is mian liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire. Tá áthas orm tacaíocht a thabhairt do Bhille an Aire Gnothaí Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta (Cumhachtaí agus Feidhmeanna) 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Le fada an lá, ní raibh na deiseanna nó áiseanna céanna ag muintir na n-oileán agus a bhí ag muintir na mórthíre. Tá forbairt iontach déanta maidir le córais iompair agus aeir sa chuid eile den tíre ach ní raibh mórán déanta ar son muintire na n-oileáin toisc go raibh siad scaipthe amach uainn. Tugann an Bille seo deis dúinn díriú ar riachtanais muintire na n-oileán agus <Col N="1672" />áiseanna agus infrastructúr cuí a chur ar fáil dóibh.</P>
    <P>Tá an Bille tráthúil agus molaim an tAire as ucht an dhíográis agus na ndúthrachtaí a thaispeáin sé ina chrói agus a ghníomhartha ar son leasa muintire na n-oileán le fada anois, go háirithe le bliain go leith ó toghadh ina Aire é.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister and congratulate him on bringing the Bill forward. It is refreshing that Senator McHugh is positively disposed towards the Bill. He acknowledged its necessity to accelerate the development programme being implemented by the Minister on behalf of islanders. They have the same rights as people living on the mainland. Those rights were not acknowledged in the past but they are addressed in this legislation because the Minister believes in equality for all. That is one of the guiding spirits of his Ministry, whether one lives on the mainland or on an island. The Minister has backed up his conviction with financial resources, which was attested to by many Members in the Lower House, and one Opposition Member acknowledged he is not a latter day convert to the needs and rights of islanders. I fully support that sentiment.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt the Minister's contribution to gaeltachtaí and the islands surpasses everything received by these communities previously. Bus, rail and air transport services, for example, have not been readily available on islands, most of which are located off the west coast. There has been significant depopulation of the islands over the past 50 years and, as the Minister correctly stated, if education, health and integrated transport facilities and services had been available over the years, depopulation would not have taken place.</P>
    <P>Infrastructural and industrial development had passed the islands by until relatively recently. Entrepreneurs and multinational companies do not have a presence on the islands and the development of services to the islands is hampered significantly by remoteness from the marketplace, difficulties in the transport of raw materials and other factors. Everybody agrees islanders are disadvantaged, yet island communities are part of what we are. As the Minister stated, they are repositories of all that is best about our heritage, history and culture and that must be preserved. Senator McHugh shares that aspiration.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for the manner in which he has passionately set out to preserve our heritage and culture. It must also be acknowledged that people who left the islands over the years have a tremendous emotional attachment to their birthplace. Two of the most essential ingredients in the revitalisation of the islands are the promotion of employment and the promotion of quality of life.</P>
    <P>Improvements have been made on the islands in recent decades through the subsidisation of transport services, for example, but a number of people still travel to and from the islands in open <Col N="1673" />boats, usually students travelling to the mainland to continue their education. The Minister has acknowledged this is dangerous and unfair and he has provided substantial resources in recent times to address that problem, which is to be welcomed. I am not a frequent visitor to the islands but, from what I know of islanders, they will appreciate the Minister's commitment.</P>
    <P>Exciting schemes have been introduced which touch on almost every aspect of life on the islands, including infrastructure, integrated transport services and the development of facilities for communities. The Minister has sought to reach out to islands through the provision of facilities and resources. One of the key objectives of his Department is to co-ordinate the provision of State services throughout the islands. The Minister chairs an interdepartmental committee that has taken a significant number of initiatives, which recognise and acknowledge that the balance needs to be tilted a little more in favour of islands in order to achieve equality. This is consistent with the spirit of the Minister's philosophy and vision of fairness that should obtain in regard to island communities.</P>
    <P>A considerable number of projects have passed through the planning process and are being implemented. I welcome, in particular, the five year action plan drawn up by the Department with responsibility for the islands, which was promised under the national development plan. The benefits of the plan are being realised on a number of islands. The Minister has secured an 18% spending increase in his Department's Estimate, which is much higher than the average increase. This will assist the Minister in terms of what he wishes to achieve during his term of office on behalf of people who have been rarely acknowledged.</P>
    <P>There has been phenomenal development in the variety and quality of air transport to the islands. The emergence of small, commercial aircraft means there is significant potential for island hopping and this readily accessible mode of transport has become feasible for islanders. The Minister has grasped this opportunity. I refer to Aer Arann. The founder and chief executive, Padraig O'Ceidigh, who is a former teacher, emerged from humble beginnings. Indeed, I believe he recently acknowledged that he was almost penniless when he started out &ndash; he certainly had very little money. He is reputed to have said that, if he had made one wrong move, he would have gone down, but there was very little to go down with him in terms of resources. However, he has achieved huge success, as the Minister will be very well aware, to the extent that I understand the airline will have a turnover of approximately &euro;60 million this year and is expected to be in profit. It has doubled its workforce over the last few years and expects to carry approximately 650,000 passengers during the current year. That is a tremendous success story.</P>
    <P>Aer Arann services connect many of our other cities with Dublin. The islands need and deserve <Col N="1674" />such a facility, but before this can come to pass, aerodromes must be built. The Bill before the House will enable the Minister to evaluate the need for such facilities. If he or any of his successors are satisfied that a particular air service is necessary, the Minister of the day will have the power to initiate the process of providing the relevant facilities.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Bill's provisions are equally applicable to sea travel, in terms of placing the same obligations on the Minister. For countless centuries, the only means of transport between the islands and the mainland has been by sea. One can only marvel at the courage and strength of character of the islanders, throughout past centuries, who had to travel in small currachs, under very unfavourable and dangerous conditions, from the various islands to the mainland and back.</P>
    <P>I have a rather vivid personal memory of an overnight stay on Clare Island a few years ago, when our scheduled return trip to County Mayo was cancelled because of extremely unfavourable conditions. Four hours later, the captain decided to travel. The return journey to the pier on the mainland was something out of the ordinary. It would be putting it rather mildly to describe it as a harrowing experience for me, my brother and our wives. That experience has given me some perspective and understanding of what people had to endure over previous generations. Although my family group had the benefit of a modern vessel, with the best captain available today, or so I am reliably informed by the locals, I am very conscious of what we experienced during that trip. I cannot even begin to imagine what previous generations would have endured under such conditions.</P>
    <P>This Bill is essentially about providing equality and facilitating the Minister with powers and provisions to provide that equality for islanders, in terms of their quality of life, the development of infrastructure and integrated transport, educational opportunities, and an equal share in the spoils of the progress and prosperity the rest of Ireland has had the good fortune to enjoy.</P>
    <P>Mar fhocal scoir, is mian liom mo thacaíocht iomlán a thabhairt don Bhille seo agus comhghairdeas a ghabháil leis an Aire arís as ucht na sároibre atá á déanamh aige ar son na Gaeilge, ar son na Roinne Ghnóthaí Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta, agus ar son mhuintir na n-oileán. Táim cinnte go bhfuil siad uilig slán go leor faoina chúram.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire agus iar-Sheanadóir. B'fhéidir go bhfuil súil agam nach mbeidh sé ina Sheanadóir ariamh aríst, agus b'fhéidir nach bhfuil. Is ceist pholaitiúil é sin seachas ceist phearsanta. Cuirim fáilte roimh an Bhille. Ní bheadh éinne atá réasúnta ábalta cur ina choinne. Tá cumhachtaí á soiléiriú nó á dtabhairt don Aire don chéad uair ar chóir a bheith aige le tamall fada, agus oireann sé do riachtanais na n-oileán na cumhachtaí seo a <Col N="1675" />bheith ag an Aire. Cosúil lena lán rudaí a thagann trí Thithe an Oireachtais, nuair a cuireadh an reachtaíocht os mo chomhair, chuir sé ionadh orm nach raibh na cumhachtaí sin ag an Aire is oiriúnaí roimhe seo, agus sin ceann de na heaspaí is mó a chítear sa chóras Stáit. Níl mé ag cur milleáin ar Rialtas ar bith, ach sa chóras Stáit go ginearálta, níl na bun-phrionsabail ann a gceapann a lán daoine a bheith ann ó thaobh chumhachtaí Rialtais de. B'fhéidir, ar shlite eile, go mbíonn an iomarca cumhachtaí ag Airí Rialtais in áiteacha nach gá dóibh a bheith ann in aon chor, ach sin ceist i bhfad níos leithne ná atá sa Bhille seo.</P>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh na cumhachtaí atá á bhfáil aige. Caithfear cúpla rud a rá. Tá na cumhachtaí seo tábhachtach, ach tá na hacmhainní atá riachtanach chun na cumhachtaí sin a chur i bhfeidhm chomh tábhachtach leis na cumhachtaí féin. Tá pleananna iontacha ann, mar shampla, faoin bplean náisiúnta forbartha do bhóithre agus taisteal poiblí agus a leithéid. Gan acmhainní, áfach, beidh siad ann, agus beidh daoine ag féachaint orthu agus ag léamh na bpleananna ildaite go brách, ach ní dhéanfar mórán. Bheadh sé go breá a bheith cinnte go mbeadh na hacmhainní ar fáil.</P>
      <P>Glacaim leis &ndash; agus caithfidh mé é seo a rá &ndash; go bhfuil an-fheabhas tagtha ar chaighdeán na mbóithre in áiteacha sna Gaeltachtaí. Tá aithne agam go mórmhór ar Ghaeltacht Chorca Dhuibhne, agus le deich mbliana anuas, tá an-fheabhas tagtha ar chaighdeán na mbóithre. Ní bhrisfidh éinne a charr a thuilleadh ag tiomáint timpeall Chorca Dhuibhne, agus is dul chun cinn é sin. Chím, agus chonaic mé, na fógraí i ngach áit, go mórmhór i nGaeilge Chonamara in ionad a bheith i nGaelainn Chorca Dhuibhne, ag tabhairt eolais dúinn faoi cé chomh fláthúil is a bhí Aire na Gaeltachta. Má tá sé ábalta na comharthaí a chur in airde, b'fhéidir go mbeadh sé ábalta aitheantas a thabhairt do Ghaelainn Chorca Dhuibhne agus a chuid fógraí a chur in airde sa chanúint sin. Sin rud beag, áfach.</P>
      <P>Tá rud éigin bunúsach sa Bhille seo. Tá codarsnacht idir fealsúnacht an Bhille seo agus a bhfeicim féin mar fhealsúnacht an Rialtais. Is é seo an cheist: an leanann infreastruchtúr an margadh, nó an leanann an margadh an t-infreastruchtúr? Má chreidimid go leanann infreastruchtúr an margadh, ba chóir dúinn é a ligint don margadh, agus dá ligfimis don margadh é, ba bheag an pobal beo a bheadh fágtha ar na hoileáin. Tá an oiread sin daoine á dtarraingt isteach do na cathracha agus na bailte móra gur bheag an líon a bheadh fágtha ar na hoileáin. Tá sé sin doghlactha. Ní dóigh liom gur fiú argóint faoi.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is éard atá ar siúl ag an Aire, agus is é bunchloch an Bhille seo, ná cur i gcoinne sin, agus infreastruchtúr a chur ar fáil ag dul i gcoinne chumhacht an mhargaidh. Ní ghlacann sé leis go gcaithfimis géilleadh don margadh i gcónaí. Beidh mé réasúnta cúramach faoi seo. Ní hionann iad <Col N="1676" />an fhealsúnacht seo agus fealsúnacht na Ranna Airgeadais. Tá sé soiléir ó gach cinneadh mór faoi infreastruchtúr sa tír seo gurbh é an bhunfhealsúnacht atá ag an Roinn Airgeadais ná go leanann infreastruchtúr an margadh. Nuair a bhíonn an pobal méadaithe, cuireann sé isteach go déanach é. Sin an fáth go bhfuil gach rud sa chathair seo déanach. Níor dheineadar pleanáil nó na rudaí a bhí ag teastáil roimh ré, agus anois, tá géarchéim infreastruchtúir sa tír seo. Is é an idé-eolaíocht atá ag an Roinn Airgeadais is bun leis. Glacaim leis go bhfuil an-chomhaontú idir é sin agus idé-eolaíocht an Aire Airgeadais, ach ní hé an tAire is cúis leis sin ach an Roinn. Ní ghlacann an Roinn Airgeadais leis gur cóir infrastructúr a fhorbairt sula n-éilíonn an margadh é agus an margadh a mhealladh ina dhiadh sin. Cuireann sí i gcoinne gach rud, an western rail corridor agus gach rud atá a lorg i mBaile Átha Cliath. Deir an Roinn nach bhfuil an t-éileamh ann, nach fiú a dhéanamh ó thaobh airgid de. Sa gcás seo, níl dóthan daoine ar na hoileáin le híoc as na seirbhísí ach sé atá i gceist ná foirdheontais a chur ar fáil le cinntiú go mbeidh daoine ábalta leanúint ag úsáid na seirbhísí seo. Is microcosm sin den bhfealsúnacht ar chóir a bheith i bpleananna forbartha na tíre go léir, infrastructúr a chur sna háiteanna go dteastaíonn uainn pobal a tharraingt dóibh. Má theastaíonn uainn daoine a tharraingt amach go dtí iarthar na tíre ba chóir go mbeadh an fealsúnacht céanna ann agus atá ag an Aire sa Bhille seo.</P>
    <P>Níl an choimhlint sin réitithe go fóill agus ní réiteofar é riamh. Beimid in ann rudaí beaga ó thaobh caiteachais poiblí a dhéanamh, cosúil leis na hoileáin, ach go ginerálta a mhalairt ar fad a bheidh ann mar gheall ar fhealsúnacht an Rialtais seo agus na Ranna Airgeadais. Sin an fáth go bhfuil an oiread sin míbhuntáistí againn i bhforbairt eacnamaíochta sa todhchaí, níl muid sásta infrastructúr a chur in áit sula thagann éileamh ón mhargadh. Sin difríocht fealsúnachta idir mé féin agus an Rialtas, ní fhéadar faoin Aire, mar sé mo thuairim go bhfuil sé ar an eite chlé den Rialtas, b'fhéidir ina aonar.</P>
    <P>Agus sin ráite agus fáilte curtha agam roimh an Bhille, tá cúpla gearán agam. Is trua é nár éisigh an tAire scríbhinn i mBéarla. Tá a lán focail teicniúla sa Bhille agus luafaidh mé iad a chabhrú leis an Aire sa todhchaí. Gan aon mholadh a thabhairt dom féin, mar duine ón nGalltacht, tá Gaelainn reasúnta maith agam ach tá focail sa scríbhinn nár chuala mé riamh. Sampla amháin de ná &ldquo;fostaíocht inmharthanach&rdquo;, sin &ldquo;sustainable employment&rdquo; ach má thugaim an scríbhinn seo do dhuine i nGaeltacht Chorca Dhuibhne, ní bheadh sé in ann an téarma sin a aistriú. Is iomaí oíche a chaith mé ag airneáil le daoine ó Ghaeltacht Chorca Dhuibhne agus ní chuala mé &ldquo;fostaíocht inmharthanach&rdquo; riamh. Dá mba rud é go mbeimís ag plé an ábhair sin, déarfadh an duine &ldquo;sustainable employment&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Bhí an méid a dúirt sé an-suimiúil faoi seirbhísí do phaisinéirí bus. Luaigh sé scoláirí ag dul go Coláiste Naomh Iarfhláith agus Kylemore Abbey. Regarding the Minister's comments about secondary school students, some of the students from St. Jarlath's College, Tuam, County Galway, visited the Dáil and the Seanad yesterday. We discussed with the teachers the many people from Galway who are attending St. Jarlath's. I understand first years no longer board in the college, but there are many students from all parts of the country boarding at the college. I pay tribute to the Minister for his great work for the islands when he was a Senator, a Minister of State and now as a Cabinet Minister. He has devoted considerable time and energy to working for the islands and their people. As he said, while the money might be very modest, it is very important to have that commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the occasions the Minister has been involved in the official opening of new facilities <Col N="1679" />on an island, he never forgets to invite the representatives from east Galway. We have had some lovely occasions on the islands. Some years ago the Minister opened an interpretive centre, which gave us the opportunity to see the great development of the islands. In my earlier visits to the islands, I usually managed to get a bicycle when I reached Kilronan. On the most recent occasion, the Minister had organised a bus to bring us to the centre he was opening. This is an example of the improvements that are being made. This was the first time I had travelled around Kilronan on a bus.</P>
    <P>The Minister deserves credit for an increase in the Estimates at a time when we know there have been significant battles at Cabinet for many items of expenditure. He has been involved in many innovative and interesting projects on the Aran Islands. When I was a member of the health board in the late 1990s, the question of medical services on the islands arose. There was a proposal to have medical consultations for minor illnesses via video link. People have regularly availed of this service. We know how difficult it can be for a medical person to get to an island if a patient needs treatment. As the Minister said, in days gone by there was considerable difficulty for people getting out to the islands. The same applied to people wanting to travel to the mainland.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the Milwaukee festival, in which Galway County Council and Galway City Council have been involved every year. It is great that the theme of the islands has been in the mind of the people of Milwaukee and the thousands who come to see that exhibition every year. This year, Galway city and county councils were represented and I am sure the islands were very much the focus of attention.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned the Cleggan to Inisbofin service, which is very important. I hope this service will be promoted as this Bill is not just about the Aran Islands but also about all the islands. The Minister has shown his commitment to Inisbofin. The health board has also introduced very good health services on that island.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, while the money here is not revolutionary it is important to see the commitment. He also said the port is not always the final destination and other services like the bus service are very important. The provision of airstrips and consolidating existing legislation are also important. The Minister has been very involved with promoting the need for air services in Clifden and it is good to see the provisions concerning such services in the islands in this legislation. Having spoken to members of the local authority, I know many of them use the air services to get to the islands. As Senator Fitzgerald has said, the new services might afford people the opportunity to visit all three of the Aran Islands. People often think it would take too long to take in all the islands in a boat trip. Anyone who has <Col N="1680" />visited those islands would agree they are worth visiting.</P>
    <P>The difficulties of people on the islands always come to the fore at the time of voting in an election. The Minister clearly stated in the strongest terms that people on the islands should vote on the same day as those on the mainland. Down the years we have seen last minute decisions that mean the islanders have to vote a few days before everybody else. With the introduction of electronic voting, it should be possible for this to happen on one day with the exception of those who have a postal vote and who vote some days earlier. Why should all those who want to vote on the same day not have that opportunity to do so? I hope this will happen and give islanders the same rights as everybody else.</P>
    <P>I love visiting the islands. While this might be work for the Minister, it is not work for me. Knowing the Minister's commitment to the islands I am sure he takes the same pleasure and an-taitneamh from his visits there. I hope the commitment he has always given in the past will continue and that in the future we will be talking about new services such as health services, airstrips and new technology being available to people on the islands, as they have been available to people on the mainland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. P. Burke Mr. P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá ar an mBille seo. I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on the great work he is doing for the islands. He has been a champion for the island and Gaeltacht communities for many years. With limited resources, former Deputy Donal Carey did great work for the Gaeltacht and the islands back in 1995 and 1996 when he was a Minister of State.</P>
      <P>As previous speakers have said, the islanders have had great transport difficulties. Shopping often entailed going to Galway or the nearest town or city, staying overnight and returning the following day. This was an enormous and expensive task. It is appropriate that they would get grant-aided facilities, as they deserve the same services as people in the rest of the country.</P>
      <P>I am a member of Mayo County Council, which annually holds a meeting on one of the islands off the coast of County Mayo. This gives councillors a great insight into what takes place on the islands and the hardships and difficulties in transport, postal facilities, etc. It was a big deal for the council meeting to take place on an island. The transport out and back meant it was a full day's work to attend. I can well understand the need for the minimum statutory notice of three days for meetings. A member of a local authority from an island, the Gaeltacht or other remote area needs sufficient time to get to the meeting venue. If someone were elected from one of the islands it would be a considerable task to attend a local authority meeting and get back again. Those difficulties have never been fully recognised or appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1681" />Mayo County Council has always held meetings on Achill, which is attached to the mainland by a bridge, Inisturk and Clare Island. These are very informative days out and, similar to Senator Fitzgerald's episode about travelling to an island, we had many hair-raising days going to Inisturk. I am delighted with the powers which the Bill vests in the Minister and I appreciate his intentions.</P>
    <P>The Government introduced the concept of better local government in recent years. In doing so, local authorities were reorganised and given more powers, staff and directors of services. What is the position of local authorities <i>vis-à-vis</i> the legislation? The Minister said he would analyse the work to be done and decide which body would do it &ndash; Údarás na Gaeltachta or the local authority. To prevent ambiguity, the Minister should specify which body would carry out the work. When local people look for a service they go to their public representative who then goes to the local authority. Another representative might go to Údarás na Gaeltachta and then to the Department. There may be confusion as to which body is dealing with the Department on different issues. I would prefer if he designated a particular body to which power would be given. Departmental funding should be allocated on an annual basis, as this would allow for an examination of the work that has been completed to date and what plans are envisaged for the future.</P>
    <P>I welcome what the Minister is doing and congratulate him. I hope he keeps up the good work in this area.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom, ar dtús báire, buíochas a ghabháil le chuile dhuine a ghlac páirt sa díospóireacht. I thank everybody who took part in the debate. I will briefly deal with some of the valid points raised.</P>
      <P>A point was raised in regard to Inch Island. Islands connected to the mainland by bridges present a challenge. My constituency is the greatest beneficiary if one counts the islands connected to the mainland in the manner in which this is done for census purposes. County Mayo has Achill Island. We immediately get Eanach Mheáin, Lettermore, Gorumna, Lettermullan, Furnish, Mweenish and so on. It would be a great day for me but this would spread the money more thinly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. P. Burke Mr. P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the 365 islands in Clew Bay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not connected by bridges to the mainland so they are not considered in this context. We define as islands those cut off by the tide once a day in a normal tide. They must have a permanent population and not be in the ownership of one person. The legislation allows us to make the definition so if, for example, the causeway to Inch Island gets washed away, we can define it as an island. A list of islands is not scheduled in the legislation. In the <Col N="1682" />case of Inch Island, my Department provided money on a once-off basis to maintain the causeway so that it would not become a fully offshore island. Responsibility for this lies with the county council but because the job requires a little more work I will consider these exceptional circumstances on a once-off basis.</P>
      <P>The islands have a good representative body. Islands have a close connection with the Government and islanders do not have any difficulty interacting with Government. In recent years I usually have to seek a meeting with them, rather than the other way around. They get straight on the telephone to our officials. There is a marvellous interaction between islanders and local authority and departmental officials. It is critical that officials on the ground are seen as friendly, accessible, helpful and co-operative people. The great aspect about dealing with a body of 3,000 people is that one can virtually get to know each one individually.</P>
      <P>I give due recognition to the work of a former Minister of State with responsibility for this area, Donal Carey, who set up a dedicated island fund. This was the first breakthrough for non-Gaeltacht islands. Gaeltacht islands always had access to funds. It is intended to continue to develop facilities. I was amused to hear references to money. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has been more than generous to the islands. Every time I went to him with a reasonable case, he was more than willing to provide finance.</P>
      <P>Tory and Inishbofin are the two most northerly islands. Work has been completed on the Magheraroarty pier and we have finished the work commenced by the rainbow Government on Tory Island. We have also completed work on Bunbeg Harbour, which is important for ferry services. The Leabh Gharbh pier has been completed on Arranmore. Down the coast from there, money was recently sanctioned for Coney Island where we also installed electricity. We are now working on the two biggest contracts ever for islands, namely Clare Island and Inisturk. We built slipways on both ends of Inishbiggle, at Ballycroy and Doran's Point. The delay with the cable car was beyond our control. In Clew Bay, work on Inislyre, Insegort and Clynish is either in progress or has been completed. The largest project is scheduled for the Aran Islands. Planning work is already in progress there and we will get around to it in due course. Next year, we hope to put in an airstrip and carry out dredging of the harbour in Inishbofin. All of the County Cork islands, with the exception of Dursey which has a cable car, have had major improvements to piers since 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every island has seen a change. Electricity was installed in eight islands which did not have it previously. Most of them are only inhabited on a part-time basis but those who live there have a strong connection with the place. There is a lower car tax rate on islands in recognition of the fact that they only have some three miles of road. The cars are somewhat similar to Oisín in Tír nÓg. <Col N="1683" />When he went off on his white horse, he was warned that he could not put his foot on the land of Ireland or he would become 300 years old. Cars on the island fall into the same category in that if they come on to the mainland they need mainland tax. Like Oisín, they should be warned not to bring an island-taxed car on to the mainland.</P>

      <P>We did away with the means testing of remote area grants and increased them substantially. Since I became Minister, thanks to the support of the Minister for Education and Science and his predecessors, secondary schools now exist on Tory Island and Inishmaan. We have also helped with the provision of health services. There are doctors on the three most populated islands, Inisheer, Inishmaan and Inishmore. I could mention many other developments. One of the points of great interest is the island allowance that recognises the higher cost of living for pensioners on islands compared to the mainland. Capital and current funding has been provided. This year's Estimate provides 18%, on which I will not elaborate at the moment.</P>
      <P>I have covered most of the questions raised on the islands. Other issues raised related to national air services and so on. No more than on the mainland, one cannot depend on one mode of transport on an island. Where islands have a sufficient population and are of sufficient distance from the mainland to warrant it, we aim to provide both ferry and air services. One service supports the other, rather than one taking passengers away from the other. What tends to happen is that more people use the services as they are more certain of getting back. A boat can always travel in fog because in such conditions the sea is calm. Air services can operate in almost any weather. The net effect on the Aran Islands is that both services have grown incrementally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must make a short reference to the issue of the use of Irish which is always being raised with me. People ask why I use Irish rather than English words. We tend to use Latin words quite a bit. I sometimes have to ask myself what the Latin derivation of <i>de minimis</i> is. A great deal of European jargon is constantly entering the English language. New words enter languages and we adapt to them very quickly when people begin to use them. One of the great things Raidió na Gaeltachta has done over the years has been to bring many new words into the Irish language. When a new word enters English, it simultaneously enters Irish. I am sure words which were strange to me or to the people of the Gaeltacht five or 50 years ago were strange in English. The first time I heard talk of capacity building and animation I had to ask what it was all about. <Col N="1684" />Those words are now in common use in English and Irish. There are very few people in the Gaeltacht who do not understand the meanings of the words &ldquo;boilsciú&rdquo;, &ldquo;rothar&rdquo;, &ldquo;bogearraí&rdquo;, &ldquo;fón phóca&rdquo;, &ldquo;Idirlíon&rdquo;, &ldquo;ríomhaire&rdquo; and others which also refer to great things. They also understand &ldquo;inmharthanach&rdquo; and &ldquo;chomh-tháthú&rdquo; when they need to know their meanings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. P. Burke Mr. P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>And &ldquo;airgead&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Tuigeann siad &ldquo;airgead&rdquo; iontach maith.</P>
      <P>I doubt there were more than three words in the speech which were not easily understandable. We have a policy of writing i gcaint na ndaoine &ndash; in the way ordinary people speak Irish. However, if there is a technical concept which has to be explained, it is only right to encourage the import or creation of terms which match the new words coming into the English language.</P>
      <P>I accept that one word we must be very careful about is &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo;. I worry that every time one wants to accomplish something in a rural area the concept of sustainability is always at the top of the agenda. I never see it being mentioned in respect of urban areas. If any lifestyle is sustainable, it is more likely to be the rural than the urban. City dwellers depend on others to provide their food. It is important that we prevent the use of the word &ldquo;sustainability&rdquo; from becoming another excuse to fail to make provisions in rural areas. I notice that while all the cars in the cities are sustainable, none of the cars in the country are such.</P>
      <P>I am a little mesmerised by the theory that limits have to be placed on the number of tourists who can be brought to the Aran Islands. The islanders who might make an economic gain should be the arbiters of whether they must limit the number of customers they have each year. When the DART service was suspended for three days to upgrade it to bring more passengers into Dublin, the O'Connell Street Chamber of Commerce and others went wild because they were going to lose business. Despite the great number of customers they have, they cannot afford to lose a theoretical amount of business. I am of the opinion that if the DART stops for three days, people will use their cars. If this argument can be made in Dublin, we must recognise the need to allow business to grow reasonably on the islands if the populations there are to be sustained. To fail to do that is to ask people in a vulnerable economic situation, who earn their livings over four or five months of the year if they are lucky, to curtail their businesses in a way we would never ask of people in a major city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must be careful to avoid looking at these places as theme parks. They are not places which are to be allowed to grow at the discretion of people who do not have to live there. Growth must be allowed to take place. Nobody is more conscious of the need to manage that growth in a way that prevents it from destroying the very <Col N="1685" />thing which is creating it than the islanders themselves. I have seen that time and again. On Inis Mór, I witnessed the huge effort which has been made to upgrade the product to avoid attracting tourists who would prove a liability in the long term. It is sought to get more bed nights and to provide better facilities on the island. Ragus, for example, represents an attempt to show traditional Irish culture to the people who visit the island rather than to simply attract people to drink in pubs. The island is trying to avoid the mistakes of the Isle of Man which attracted the wrong type of tourist in the 1960s. The islanders know that their long-term interest is served by good quality tourism and a good quality product.</P>
    <P>The islanders are the people who should decide how best to develop that product. They do not need a great many people who do not have to live there attempting to curtail reasonable development. There is a perception that Aran is like O'Connell Street on a fine day. If one leaves the main road on Inis Mór and travels to Gort na gCapall or Bun Gabhla, there is plenty of solitude and beauty to be found. There is a small stretch of road between Cill Rónáin and Dun Aonghasa which serves a reasonable amount of traffic in the summer. That is understandable. As Minister, I have provided money for the development of roads to places which will allow people to avoid any contact with other humans. There is a great deal of space on Inis Mór to permit these initiatives. It is wrong to give the impression that there is a metropolis on the island because there is a reasonable amount of traffic on a short stretch of road during the summer.</P>
    <P>Inis Mór is still a marvellous place to go as are all the islands. Each one is unique and beautiful. It is in the long-term interest of the islands to encourage developments similar to those on Inis Mór on Tory Island, Inisbofin, Gabhla, Clare Island and Inisturk. I thank Senators for a constructive debate and I look forward to Committee and Report Stages. I look forward to the passage of this Bill to allow us to proceed with the development of the islands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am trying to absorb the Budget Statement which is probably one of the shortest ever, although at least it gives us the chance to read through it. I welcome the decentralisation of 10,500 jobs which is a positive move. Looking at <Col N="1686" />the distribution of those jobs, I regret that more of them are not going west of the Shannon. It is not an issue in which I have any constituency interest but it is a pity the jobs will not go there. I would very much welcome an unequivocal commitment in writing from the Minister for Finance that benchmarking will be paid, as agreed. That would be a positive move.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the self-satisfied members of the Government parties, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, have no idea what will hit them over the coming days, weeks and months when they start to get telephone calls on the issue of public service pensions. What is being proposed in the budget cannot be implemented. In my judgment &ndash; it is only my judgment because I do not have a vote or a call on this issue &ndash; no national agreement will be agreed while these proposals are extant. I suggest public service unions will not be in a position to accept a new public service pay deal while those daft proposals are in place.</P>
    <P>There is a proposal to increase the minimum retirement age to 65 years. There might be an argument for that, although I do not subscribe to it. There are many teachers who could teach until 65 years of age and beyond and who would be delighted to do so. However, this proposal requires people to teach until 65 years of age. There are many teachers who would not be physically able to handle a class of 25 to 40 infants or an honours leaving certificate class at 65 years of age. The proposal is absolutely daft. If that is not bad enough, the next proposal removes the compulsory retirement age of 65 years and proposes that there should be no compulsion for people to retire at a particular age if they are &ldquo;fit and willing to stay on&rdquo;. People on Zimmer frames will be holding down jobs and they will have doctors' certificates stating that they can work. They will be taken from their jobs in boxes. The Minister spoke about creating promotional opportunities but this is absolutely daft.</P>
    <P>People may think it does not relate to Members of the House or to people who work here and that they should not care. As somebody who defended, argued for and negotiated pensions for Members of the Oireachtas &ndash; this proposal will not affect me &ndash; it is appalling to think that under the new regime, somebody who is elected to the Oireachtas at 21 or 25 years of age, is re-elected in ten or 20 subsequent elections and loses their seat at 51 or 52 years of age will not be entitled to receive a pension for another 14 years. Whoever thought this through is daft. It is a classic example of people in the pensions section of the Department of Finance sweet-talking the Minister, as they have always done, with nobody checking what is going on. Somebody deserves to get their backside kicked on this issue. It is an appalling vista and it will not work. That should be recognised and it should be changed immediately.</P>
    <P>There is much wrong with this proposal but I do not have the time to go into it. I accept it was a recommendation in the public service pensions <Col N="1687" />report. However, Members will note that a number of us on that commission submitted a minority report opposing it. The Minister said he would not implement the increased 1% and that he is not applying any changes to people currently in jobs. As I said previously, it would be better to cost it and if it is necessary to deal with the public service unions to take another 1% of whatever to pay them, it would be better.</P>
    <P>I do not want to hear people whinging in future, as they have in the past, about retired Members of the Houses, or their widows or widowers, having nothing on which to live because we are beginning to institutionalise that situation. It is time people considered this before it goes too far.</P>
    <P>I have welcomed some measures. Previously I asked for something small but an tábhachtach, sin an cinne atá déanta ag an Aire nach gcuirfear cáin ioncam ar na mná tí atá thar cheann na scoláirí a fhreastalaíonn ar chúrsaí sa Ghaeltacht i rith an tsamhraidh. It is only right given all they do and the measures they must put in place to look after students. There is little in it for them and it is a positive move which will be welcomed in Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal on public private partnerships. It is bad there has been no change in the tax bands, although not for people like us or for people with high incomes. We are going back on what we did some years ago when we brought people, particularly the lower paid, out of the tax net. We are now pulling them back into it. I do not see the logic of that for the sake of a small amount of money. Given the type of society and community we are trying to build, it is not a good way in which to move forward. This is penny-pinching, particularly in light of the Minister's prognosis for the next three years. He said that next year, he expects GNP to increase to between 3% and 3.3% and that economic growth in 2005 will be 4% and 4.5% in the following year. These are impressive figures but if we are going to make that kind of money, we must examine how we will share it out.</P>
    <P>The proposal to take apart the public service pension arrangements is almost a guaranteed Exocet, which will destroy any chances of getting agreement on a new national wage agreement. I am certain people will not go along with this appallingly badly thought out proposal. I ask the Minister to take this message on board and negotiate a return from that position. If it is just a negotiating position, that is fine because we have all been there. However, if some people think they can make this stick, they are mistaken. Many people will use this proposal to build up a head of steam against a new agreement. It is a mistake.</P>

      <P>I do not share all Senator O'Toole's sentiments. Any effort to shake up the public service is good because it is high time it was shaken up. If it must start with pensions, that is all to the good because of the limited opportunity to shake up a service which has got its way virtually everywhere.</P>
      <P>I see the problems pointed out by Senator O'Toole. If he is right and this means no more national pay deals, I welcome it. If part of the Minister's plot is to decide to bring about a scenario which will challenge the public service, and if the public service, like Senator O'Toole, says it will have no more pay deals, then let us have no more of them. We have had enough of them. Let us end them and go ahead with free collective bargaining.</P>

      <P>It is not such a threat to the economy of the nation that we have no more pay deals. There is no proof that the pay deals were the saviour of the economy. The people who did well out of the pay deals were the public servants. Of course they start hurting and do not like it much when the suggestion is made that they be given some sort of equality with the private sector. They may be made to work until they are 65 years of age. Senator O'Toole says there are certain 65 year olds who cannot keep a class in order. That is true, but it is also true of some 25, 35, 45 and 55 year olds. It is nothing to do with age.</P>
      <P>People must retire sometime, but I do not see any reason public servants should be given preference over anybody else. If they are to be given such preferential treatment in terms of salaries and wages, let us see them given the same treatment as others on pensions. I welcome that and hope it is not a negotiating ploy. If it is not, and if we have no more pay deals, that is the price we must pay. We will then find out whether the pay deals were the great panacea for the economy. I suggest they were not. That is a minority opinion but I will not back away from it.</P>
      <P>I wonder what influences were brought to bear most on this budget. I do not share the view that the greatest influence was, necessarily, the Fianna Fáil backbenchers although some good points in it were the result of that pressure. I welcome with great enthusiasm the idea that we should decentralise as much as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that there is little real tax reform in this budget. There was a great deal of speculation that the bands would be widened. Not to widen the bands is, in effect, a stealth tax. I would like to have seen the Minister continue on the radical programme, in which he has been involved over the past seven years, of reducing direct taxes or, not my preference, widening the bands. I regret he has not taken that initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Ross for sharing his time. I too welcome decentralisation and also the implementation process put in place by the Minister. However, he has not set a completion date which raises the suspicion that it will be a long time before it takes place. I too agree there is a geographical element to the decentralisation. This is understandable in the short term but may be negative in the long term.</P>
      <P>I welcome, as I am sure the Minister of State does, that the Department of Agriculture and Food will move to Portlaoise, which is in my little bit of bog and just over the hill from Deputy Parlon. On the transfer of the Department of Arts, Sports and Tourism and everything else they can find to Killarney, this may be appropriate as far as tourism is concerned. However, it indicates the need for a separate Department of the Arts as throwing them in with sports and tourism demeans them. As we have such a wonderful and fine artistic tradition, particularly in the literary arts, there should be a separate Minister with responsibility for this area.</P>
      <P>There is a slightly instant quality about this debate, as the Minister has only just stopped speaking. I said a great deal of what I wish to say about serious topics during the debate on the Estimates some weeks ago, in anticipation of this debate. I considered proposing an amendment to this motion, to change it from &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann notes the Budget Statement&rdquo; to &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann ignores the Budget Statement&rdquo;. One of my gripes is that the Constitution does not trust this House with anything remotely connected with finance. Amendments can be ruled out of order because they involve a charge on the Exchequer. There is a case for examining this matter as part of the process of Seanad reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to be a Member of this House at this time, because it means I will receive my pension as soon as I leave it. I understand there will be small difficulties for other people. There is always a slightly positive element to these matters, <Col N="1691" />however. As far as this House is concerned, it is probably a good thing that people come into politics with special expertise from areas such as medicine, teaching and law and then return to such areas. I do not see why the State should give pensions to people who return to lucrative jobs before they reach the pension age. There is plenty of life in them after politics. We should be satisfied that they will be able to find another use for their talents.</P>
    <P>I agree with many of the comments of my friend, Senator Ross, on many issues, but I do not agree with him on free collective bargaining. The most vulnerable elements in society are squeezed when one enters free collective bargaining. The powerful elements in society, such as the strong unions, cream off everything in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>I think we can go further in certain respects. In his next budget, I hope the Minister for Finance will do more to assist those who are financially most at risk. He has produced an interesting budget with a few surprises, which he seemed to front-load. I thought it was terrific, from a theatrical point of view, that he opened his statement with an announcement that I do not think many people were expecting. Although he has been buffeted by criticism from Europe and commentators in this country, he has held the ship fairly steady, by and large.</P>

      <P>I am sure decentralisation will make a similar difference to other towns. It has been mentioned that few jobs are to be decentralised west of the Shannon, but the first decentralisation programme in the early 1990s focused on that region to an overwhelming extent. The two programmes have to be considered together. Not only does today's announcement represent a fulfilment of many promises that were made, but it also dispels some of the fears expressed when the national spatial strategy was published. Many people came to the pessimistic conclusion at that time that all decentralisation, if it was to happen, would be concentrated in hubs and gateways, but that has not transpired to be the case. Decentralisation is about spreading wealth around the country, which is very important. I wish the Minister of State, who will be in charge of implementing this process, the very best in that regard. Along with my colleagues, I will give him every assistance if anything needs to be done at a local level. I appreciate that there will be disappointment in places in south Tipperary, such as Carrick-on-Suir.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have every faith that the decentralisation process will be successful. Other places will benefit when it is carried forward.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole made clear that certain pension changes will be subject to a good deal of discussion and, perhaps, negotiation in the context of the next partnership agreement. I do not doubt that the partnership agreement will survive. Senator Ross seems to think there is no evidence that pay deals have done the Irish economy any good. A different view is taken by almost every international agency, including the OECD and the IMF, as well as most commentators.</P>
      <P>This budget maintains and underpins the economy as we move towards 2004. The net number of jobs increased by approximately 17,000 in 2003. I have calculated, on the basis of the figures in the budget, that it will increase by approximately 30,000 in 2004. The proposed minimal borrowing level of 1.1% is prudent. One of the best lines in the Minister's speech was &ldquo;Borrowing is the real stealth tax&rdquo;&ndash; I could not agree more. Inflation is being brought under control and will be reduced to 2.5%. Despite claims to the contrary in the last year, the public finances are in excellent order. We have a really strong basis for progress as the international economy recovers. I notice the Minister's projections for revenue next year are slightly over 5%. I suspect the figures might be quite conservative, not for the first time. There is no harm in erring on the side of caution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The five-year programme of public investment at current levels cannot be described as a stop-go system. The provision which has been made for carrying over 10% of budgets provides for greater flexibility. I am particularly pleased that an extra <Col N="1693" />&euro;30 million has been provided for schools, as it means an additional &euro;55 million will be available in total for primary and secondary schools in 2004, compared to 2003. Such infrastructural development is just as important as investment in roads and transport.</P>
    <P>The most hard-bitten socialist could not find anything to criticise in the progressive tax tables included in this budget. All benefits are concentrated on lower and lower-middle income groups. Those on the minimum wage will benefit. It can be argued perfectly validly that the higher tax band has not been shifted and that those who are better-off will have to wait a little longer. I do not doubt that changes will be made in that regard in future budgets as economic conditions improve. The correct priority has been chosen in the present circumstances. The increases in indirect taxes are fairly minimal. The impact of indirect tax increases on the CPI will be approximately half of that of last year. It is projected that the inflation rate will be 2.5%, which will bring us back into line with Europe.</P>
    <P>The social welfare increases provided for in the budget are two or three times greater than inflation, even in today's relatively tighter economic circumstances. Before anyone criticises the increases for being mean, it should be noted that under the rainbow coalition the increases were between 2.5 % and 4%.</P>

      <P>The two issues which jump off the pages of the budget are decentralisation, the announcement of which we were not expecting today, and the raising of the minimum retirement age to 65, referred to earlier by Senator O'Toole. Those are the two smokescreens which have been raised by the Minister in front of his budget in an attempt to deflect attention from how little is contained therein.</P>
      <P>Senators have referred to decentralisation. Five years ago, we were promised action on decentralisation and it is convenient that, six months before the local elections, the Minister should today announce details of places and numbers of posts to be filled. However, just &euro;20 million has been allocated for the redistribution of these jobs which means nothing will happen next year. Nevertheless, Government candidates in places like Birr and elsewhere will be able to take credit for the decentralised jobs when nothing will happen for the foreseeable future. There is no timeframe for today's announcement. While we all welcome the idea of decentralisation about which Senator Ross spoke strongly, it has dragged on for far too long and we are still left with vague promises about numbers without any commitment to a timetable for implementation. It is about time we got such promises.</P>
      <P>The public service retirement age has been raised to 65 years, about which I share Senator O'Toole's concerns. However, I agree with much of what Senator Ross said, although I was surprised by his comment that the Minister for Finance does not want any more pay deals. Perhaps he knows something the rest of us do not.</P>

      <P>I am interested in Senator Mansergh's final point on the new rural social scheme. It has been announced again and the Senator <Col N="1696" />quite rightly gave it emphasis in his remarks. However, we have little information as to what form the scheme will take. It has the potential to be a good scheme for rural areas but we do not have any meat on the bones yet and it is therefore too early to say what effect, if any, it will have.</P>
      <P>Senator Mansergh referred to Carrick-on-Suir not having been allocated any jobs. I spent my brief time in the public service as a teacher in Carrick-on-Suir. The issues of a lack of a decentralisation announcements for Carrick-on-Suir and the increase in the minimum age for retirement from the public service overlap in my mind in regard to Carrick-on-Suir. I am struck by the fact that a city the size of Kilkenny is to get just 105 places, while Portlaoise will get 400 places and Wexford is scheduled to get 325 according to today's figures. That is disappointing from a Kilkenny perspective.</P>

      <P>Kilkenny could have done a hell of a lot better, as could Carrick-on-Suir, which borders with County Kilkenny and has a large catchment area in south County Kilkenny. Carrick-on-Suir is not scheduled to get any decentralisation. Therefore, the budget is not all good news, contrary to what Government Senators would have us believe.</P>
      <P>A Senator spoke of what he regarded as the key sentence in the budget.</P>

      <P>The one sentence which gobsmacked me appeared under the heading of &ldquo;Indirect Taxation&rdquo;. The second sentence in the Minister's remarks reads: &ldquo;The goal of keeping inflation low takes precedence on this occasion.&rdquo; This is an extraordinary remark for a Minister for Finance to make in the context of producing a budget. He has stated that this goal only applies on this occasion, when I would have thought this to be an important job for the Minister for Finance in any budget.</P>
      <P>I have defended motorists in the House before and will do so again tonight. It is wrong for the Minister for Finance to increase the duty on fuel, namely, petrol and diesel. In the debate on the Estimates last week, I stated that Australian and other systems which tax emissions rather than the fuel itself should be examined and pursued in the long term. The motorist is one of the most beleaguered of all citizens when one considers that, as we sit here tonight, thousands of motorists are stuck in traffic burning extra fuel due to congestion and delays. Despite this, motorists will pay five cent extra per litre for petrol and diesel from midnight tonight, about which they will not be happy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance announced an increase in child benefit, which has been lauded by Government Senators as some sort of mam<Col N="1697" />moth increase. However, two years ago the Minister promised that he would increase child benefit last year by &euro;20 per month for the first two children and &euro;25 per month for third and subsequent children. Despite that promise, last year the increase was just &euro;6, as it is this year. Contrary to what is being presented as a great success, the budget is behind the Minister's previous commitments on increases in child benefit &ndash; it is just another one of the many broken promises.</P>
    <P>There is no mention in the budget of child care, one of the most serious problems which affects young women trying to get into the jobs market.</P>
    <P>No specific mention is made of first-time buyers. Local authorities are taking on board development charges and are passing them on to first-time buyers. In effect, we now have a first-time buyer's tax instead of a first-time buyer's grant. Those people will not be cheered by the announcement that there will be an additional &euro;30 million in the local government fund. These levies are still going to come down the tracks because, as we have been informed, they must be in place by the end of March next year. Those people who are still trying to build their first house will still be affected, regardless of the contents of the budget.</P>
    <P>There are positive aspects to the budget. I agree with Senator Ross, however, that it contains little in the way of reform or change. Two issues, namely, decentralisation and the increase in the minimum retirement age, dominate the budget, which contains precious little else. With that in mind, I cannot support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley. I listened to the contribution of the Minister for Finance in the Lower House this afternoon and I was impressed by what I heard. The progress he has made over many budgets is maintained in that which he introduced today. The economy is in safe hands and the Minister has introduced a set of measures which will ensure that it will be well placed to avail of an improvement in international economic conditions. As Senator Mansergh observed, the Minister has ensured that borrowing will be minimised.</P>
      <P>The Minister also achieved that which I thought it would be difficult to achieve, namely, not adding significantly to inflation on the part of the Government. I was concerned that any significant increase in direct taxation would have an effect on domestic inflation and place Ireland at odds with other European Union member states. I am pleased that the measures which have been introduced will minimise the risk in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, has been consistent. The budget protects the gains already made and caters for those who are most disadvantaged. Failure to do the latter was a criticism of previous budgets. I do not believe that such criticism was legitimate. If one examines matters dispassionately and carefully, one will see that the most disadvantaged have been catered for, partic<Col N="1698" />ularly in terms of child benefit and other social welfare increases. It is a significant achievement to grant across the board increases which are of the order of twice the level of inflation. Such increases constitute real and positive benefits for those who are disadvantaged. I will not catalogue the various measures involved, but I must highlight the increase of &euro;10 per week in old age and related pensions and also the increases in children's allowance, widow's contributory pension, deserted wives benefit, etc. These are measures of which the Government can be proud.</P>
    <P>I am also in favour of the measures proposed in respect of decentralisation.</P>

      <P>Suggestions have been that some of these proposals will be to the political advantage of individuals. However, on any objective assessment, I do not see how we can locate Defence Forces' headquarters anywhere other than at the Curragh. There is no reason that the Department of Defence should not be situated adjacent to those headquarters in Newbridge. The announcement that 250 Revenue officials are to decamp to Athy is a measure of the case put forward not by politicians but by the Athy investment, development and employment forum. The latter is made up of local people who act on their own behalf and who made their case eloquently and coherently to all the leaders of Government. It was they, not politicians, who secured those 250 jobs for Athy. I hope politicians across all parties helped in that effort but I do not believe anybody made a political sally on their own behalf in respect of Athy, which is disadvantaged and which requires the jobs in question. I welcome the fact that 250 Revenue jobs will go to Athy.</P>
      <P>It makes excellent financial and logistical sense to locate Defence Forces' headquarters in the Curragh and to place 300 staff there, where they rightly belong. Since I entered the House some time ago I have advocated that Defence Forces' headquarters should be located at the Curragh and I am pleased that this will now be the case. I welcome the relocation of 200 jobs to Newbridge under the decentralisation of the Department of Defence.</P>
      <P>A total of 10,300 people will be moved to out of Dublin to other areas of the country. This will benefit both those areas and the capital.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to the Minister's contribution in the Lower House, particularly in respect of income tax. When the Government came to power, it gave a commitment that it would not increase personal rates of taxation and that the huge achievements made prior to its entering office would be maintained. The Minister stated:</P>
      <P>Some may think that they can reduce unemployment by high tax-and-spend policies. However, any such reduction would only be temporary and would in any case be reversed as tax increases damage our competitiveness. We, on the other hand, have got unemployment down and kept it at low levels by keeping tax rates low.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister also stated:</P>
      <P>This lesson should be learned by those who mistakenly call for us to increase our tax burden towards the levels of some other states in Europe. Such calls are misplaced and those who make them fail to see that job creation is the appropriate goal if we are to achieve real social inclusion. High direct tax rates destroy jobs sooner or later. This Government has no intention of going down that route now or in the future.</P>
      <P>I wholeheartedly agree with him in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the rural measure. That measure, in the context of the social scheme and the fact that 2,500 places should be created, is significant. I resent any suggestion that poverty in rural areas is in some ways different from or less worthy of being attended to than that experienced in urban areas. Those of us who live in rural areas are aware that the poverty which exists there is just as grinding as that in urban <Col N="1700" />areas. That poverty frequently goes unrecognised and I am glad the measure in question will address it. I reject any imputation to the contrary.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Mansergh's comments on stealth taxes and I will not repeat them. I welcome the concept of multi-annual capital envelopes. It should be possible to ensure we can roll through from one year to the next, that moneys which are not spent can be carried forward and that the Department can plan coherently from year to year.</P>
    <P>The budget copperfastens many of the gains made in previous years. It is consistent with the strategy adopted by the Minister for Finance in successive budgets. He should be applauded for the measures he has introduced. It is good that there have not been major shifts and changes. The budget is a case of steady as it goes and the ship is under good control under the Minister's captaincy.</P>

      <P>I have often written that the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, is the worst Minister for Finance ever, even though he has a well organised Department and his officials read all the newspapers, including those published only in Cork. He took wrong decisions when he had choices to make. He did not invest in infrastructure when he had the opportunity and, instead, reduced the national debt. An appalling infrastructure deficit has developed. According to the Minister, Ireland is at the upper end of the scale in terms of infrastructure investment in Europe, which confirms this lack of development. He is comparing the country to others that developed their infrastructures over 20 years, yet this is considered to be idealistic nonsense. We have fallen so far behind, we do not believe we can develop such an infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Finance is doing its best to prevent the development of a proper system of off road public transport similar to that in European cities of comparable size to Dublin. The Department decided the State cannot afford this <Col N="1701" />and it is in the wonderful position of being able to say half the time measures cannot be taken because there is no market for them but, when the market develops and such infrastructure is desperately needed, the officials say the projects are too dear and cannot be undertaken. This is a wonderful double lock which means that when the Exchequer can afford to undertake such projects, it will not do so because they are not needed and, when they are needed, they are too dear because acquisition of property is expensive and labour costs are high and they cannot, therefore, be undertaken. This prevents the development of a road and rail infrastructure that much poorer European countries such as Portugal take for granted. Lisbon has a metro, yet Portugal is still a comparatively poor country. I will visit Budapest next week. That city had a metro 25 years ago, about which the people of Dublin can only dream, yet Hungary has only one sixth of our <i>per capita</i> GDP. This is a fundamental fault.</P>
    <P>The other fundamental fault of the Minister and the Government is the institutionalisation of inequality. Ireland is one of the most unequal countries in terms of income in the OECD. All the old folksy rhetoric of the Minister for Finance and his allies that everybody is a little better off than they were ten years ago does not get away from two issues. The first is the income gap has widened and the second is inequality matters. This is not an academic theory. If a society believes inequality is all right, the inevitable consequence of institutionalising income inequality is inequality in services. I can provide Members with many studies by eminent academics, which demonstrate that a society cannot sustain income inequality on the scale experienced in Ireland without profound inequality in service provision.</P>
    <P>The political values that underpin a belief in the need for inequality as an instrument for growth inevitably leads to inequality in many other areas. I agree with Senator Dardis that there is appalling, grinding rural poverty, which is often compounded by appalling, grinding loneliness. It is worthwhile to take action to relieve rural poverty and isolation, particularly of elderly people in areas where there is little or no public transport.</P>
    <P>Contrary to the accepted wisdom, it is not necessarily true that higher levels of personal taxation lead to higher levels of unemployment. Ireland does not have a higher level of unemployment than the Netherlands or the Scandinavian countries. Penal personal taxation is not a great concept and it was adopted in Ireland because the law was not being enforced for a long time. As a result, PAYE taxpayers carried the tax burden. It is nonsense to suggest this is an inevitable correlation and it is not supported by economic studies.</P>
    <P>The reduction in capital gains tax to 20% in this State has been an enormous incentive to many companies in the private sector to pay senior and middle ranking executives through methods that reward them in terms of capital <Col N="1702" />gains rather than income increases. They, therefore, pay 20% on the extra revenue they generate from capital gains and avoid paying the top rate of income tax. Only the veritable little people in public sector jobs pay the top rate of tax. How would increasing capital gains tax reduce employment? Property speculation and share speculation generate capital gains tax. There are many exemptions, for example, in the area of productive investment. CGT was reduced to 20% and the business class thinks the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, is the best Minister for Finance ever because its members became rich on the spot. They pay the tax without grumbling because they know it is a good deal.</P>

      <P>What happened the yield of tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained what happened to the yield but the Senator was not listening carefully. Many people converted income into capital gains because it was cheap and easy and they paid 20% tax rather than 42% tax. It was a great scam, out of which they did well, and they will be eternally grateful to the Government for its generosity.</P>
      <P>Before Government Members begin cheering about social inclusion measures, they should read the latest report of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. Can they forget about what happened seven or eight years ago? The State is almost 100% richer than it was in 1996 when former Minister Proinsias de Rossa was alleged to have abandoned pensioners. This is a different country with different opportunities and the Government should have the confidence to be judged by its own decisions and sustain its judgment without harping back to 1996 because the next statement it utters will refer to Ernest Blythe taking the shilling from pensioners in the 1920s. Let us talk about modern Ireland, which is a rich country, and let us debate the way resources are allocated. The Government has made decisions about resource allocation that sustain inequality, let down our infrastructure and create an unequal Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Dow Jones industrial average, yesterday, was at its highest in 18 months and the indications are that all sections of the American economy are beginning to grow again. Managers are ordering and, as Dr. Dan McLaughlin said recently in Sligo, in an address to members of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party, as soon as American companies began to build up their inventory control, all sections of the American economy have begun to re-order, following a turbulent three-year period during which companies were cutting back to the bone. Once they begin to build up their inventory control, the international companies based in Ireland will begin to re-order.</P>

      <P>The budget was launched today in an atmosphere in which the world economy is beginning to turn around. Ireland will be part of that. It has been said that Senators and back-bench Deputies have no influence. From my personal experience today, that is not true. I lobbied the Minister for Finance, with whom I had a meeting, and wrote to the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, and the Minister of State at that Department, Deputy Michael Ahern, requesting an exemption from stamp duty on intellectual property. To my amazement, as I sat in the Dáil <Col N="1704" />Chamber today, that exemption was announced in the Budget Statement. On that basis, I have no time for any further claims that one cannot be influential through the Seanad. I was asked to make that approach by my nominating body, the Irish Exporters Association.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, representatives of the film industry, including Ardmore Studios, pleaded with us to lobby the Government to retain section 481, which has now been extended for a further four years. That will be very comforting for the 4,500 people working in the film industry in Ireland, including actors, craftspeople and electricians and the 3,500 young people who are studying that industry.</P>
      <P>It was apparent at the joint committee meeting that there were many different voices speaking on behalf of the film industry. Due to our success with section 481 over the past ten years, other countries are copying us. We need a visionary organisation driving the film industry. I suggest the Minister set up a development authority for the Irish film industry on similar lines to the IDA.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to the BES scheme. Having established my company with my co-founder, Ms Connie Doody, 17 years ago, we could not have grown the business without access to BES funds. I am delighted the Minister has extended that scheme for the next three years. People find it much easier and more lucrative to invest their money in property but, with the extension of the BES scheme for a further three years, the guarantees and tax relief it provides for investors are very attractive. The upper limit has been increased from &euro;750,000 to &euro;1 million. Young companies will have the assurance that funds will be available up to that level over the next three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator White for sharing her time. She has made a very big contribution to Irish business development in general and her valued contributions in this House are worth hearing. I compliment the Minister for Finance on implementing, at long last, the proposal to decentralise the Civil Service from Dublin to regional areas. I wish to express the appreciation <Col N="1705" />of the people of County Clare and, particularly, Kilrush, for which a very good case was made in recent years for the establishment of a Government office there. I welcome the decision which has now been made to decentralise part of the Revenue offices to Kilrush.</P>
      <P>As part of that scheme, there was a joint arrangement with Newcastlewest, County Limerick and Listowel, County Kerry. I am glad those three towns will benefit from reorganisation of the Revenue section of the Department of Finance. Decentralisation becomes very attractive where it involves a substantial block of civil servants moving to a particular geographical location. The availability of the Killimer ferry service will be an attractive feature for Revenue people moving to Kilrush, Listowel and Newcastlewest. I urge the Minister to expedite this move and I am glad he has put an implementation team in place. Contrary to an earlier statement in this debate, a deadline for implementation has been set, with an implementation team to report to a Cabinet sub-committee by next March. Furthermore, the Minister has provided an up-front capital contribution of &euro;20 million to kick-start this scheme and ensure it will be put in place.</P>
      <P>I also compliment the Minister on his provision for the Shannon region, which has been identified as the location to which 100 Irish Aviation Authority personnel will move from Dublin. That authority has already made a very significant contribution to the development of Shannon Airport and the surrounding region. This move will represent further consolidation of the aviation authority's position in Shannon and a substantial contribution to the development of the Shannon and mid-west region. The relocation of 300 personnel from Enterprise Ireland to Shannon Airport is also very opportune. Since 1959, Shannon Airport and Shannon Development Company have been the main economic engine for development in the mid-west region. They have made a very valuable contribution to the overall economic development and prosperity of that region, which will be further enhanced by the relocation of part of Enterprise Ireland. The consequent economic benefits will extend throughout the whole mid-west region, as well as in the immediate Shannon area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley, on their work. Since he took up office, Deputy O'Malley has demonstrated his commitment as one of the political heads of his Department, based on his experience as a member of the Mid-Western Health Board and, subsequently, in the Department of Health and Children. It is important to have people of his calibre and that of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, spearheading the drive for revitalisation of provincial areas. Today's announcement is one of the most significant developments in any budget over the past ten or 15 years. I compliment both the Minister <Col N="1706" />for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, on the work they are doing. I hope the whole scheme of relocation will be expedited, consolidated and undertaken as expeditiously as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley.</P>
      <P>Last year I looked at the budget as a schoolteacher would and I gave the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, a low honours mark, somewhere in the upper 60%. This year, I am not going to be a schoolteacher but a cook, examining the cake the Minister for Finance has baked in this budget. Last year, I said &ldquo;he tries hard but could do better.&rdquo; This year I want to see if this cake has the sort of ingredients we want. Will it be a big enough cake? Will it be healthy, of long-life and will it be divided fairly? I seldom disagree with Senator Ryan, but on this occasion I do when he claims the division of the cake is the important matter. It is the size of the cake, together with its division, that is important.</P>
      <P>Is the cake big enough? The Minister for Finance has worked hard to prove himself over the last several years. He has ensured the cake will be bigger through ways of incentivising the nation. Over the years, he has done a good job on this, particularly through reducing various kinds of taxation. I am not a betting man, but when he reduced betting tax &ndash; I think it was from 10% to 5% &ndash; he took in more revenue and when he reduced it again to 2%, he took in even more. The same happened when he reduced the capital gains tax from 40% to 20%. That is one way of baking a bigger cake.</P>
      <P>While he has done nothing particular to bake a bigger cake in this budget, he has taken steps towards doing so. If we take his word for it, he projects that he will increase employment by 23,000 in the coming year. If he manages this, it will be a bigger cake. He projects that GNP will rise for the next three years by 3%, 4% and 4.5% respectively. Those are not the heady heights we had in previous years, but if that is the objective of the Minister and his sums are correct, he will have done well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other areas where these same incentives will be applied. Film tax relief is a real example of where an incentive and jobs are created. I congratulate those who argue the case for research and development. If we are to invest in the future, research and development is an important element and I say &ldquo;Well done&rdquo; to the Minister for Finance. I had not noticed the intellectual property stamp duty until Senator White referred to it. All these are steps in the right direction. Another interesting incentive was in the area of corporate headquarters and holding companies. I travel around Europe and I know a number of companies which plan to set up headquarters in Ireland because it is a good place to do business, one of the reasons being the tax incentives in this area. In this regard I give the <Col N="1707" />Minister for Finance good marks in regard to the size of the cake he has baked.</P>
    <P>Is this a healthy and long-life cake? There is a big crisis in pensions facing Europe. The Minister for Finance has touched on it and has taken the first tentative steps in the right direction. However, he must go farther in tackling this sword of pensions which hangs over us. As we can work longer into old age, we have not funded ourselves for future pensions, unlike other European Union member states.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if the Minister has done nearly enough in the area of inflation. He projects the effect of price increases will be 0.4%. It does not seem high and inflation is coming down. However, it has a long way to go before we are competitive again. If there is one area that our future depends on, it is competitiveness. We have not recognised the needs of this area. The Minister's heart is in the right place.</P>
    <P>He will lose marks when I see what happens with public spending. Public spending is still high and infrastructure costs and other areas such as benchmarking have not been tackled. The proper provision for economic growth is in infrastructure development. However, the Minister admits that we failed to provide properly for infrastructure and that it will cripple economic growth if we do not get it right. The question is not so much what is spent but how. There is no tradition of cost benefit analysis on how we spend public money. The Minister referred to infrastructure investment but action will speak far louder than words. I am not giving him good marks for the long-life of the cake and I am more concerned about the food safety aspect of it.</P>
    <P>All Members will agree that this is a dull and boring cake. There was nothing in the budget to excite us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I felt sorry for Deputy Richard Bruton, who had to criticise it, because there was no meat and nothing tasty in it to have a real go.</P>
      <P>My main criticism is in the division of the cake. Did the Minister for Finance divide it fairly and equally? I agree with Senator Ryan on this issue. In the Book of Estimates two weeks ago we saw too many examples of financial nit-picking where cutbacks and the new charges referred to by the Fine Gael Party were directed at the less well-off. This is the real challenge we face. The state of the national finances is better, probably considerably so, than the Minister led us to believe when the Book of Estimates was published. The first thing the Minister could have done today was to roll back some of the cutbacks, new charges and increased costs and fairness would demand that he did that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say &ldquo;Well done&rdquo; to the Minister on the cake he has baked. It will be bigger than it was and it is safe. It is not as tasty as I would have wished and it is not divided nearly as well as it could have <Col N="1708" />been. I will give him 75% with the comment that he has tried hard and could do better next year.</P>

The Houses of the Oireachtas are the only ones excluded in the programme. We could have gone to Athlone or even Roscommon, however we are hopeful to stay where we are. Bringing the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to Knock Airport is a magnificent gesture.

Deaths, births and marriages, land and property will now all be registered in the Roscommon area, which is a great gesture.

      <P>It is more than a coincidence. In 1992 I asked the then Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, to give us something for Roscommon. He gave us 50 jobs in the Department of Health and Children's general register office. Unfortunately, that decision was only implemented in 2003 after my return to the Oireachtas. The opening was attended by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, representing the Office of Public Works. It looked very good on the day and while they were very tight-lipped, we know they were impressed by the support given to the general register office for deaths, births and marriages. We will now have a further 230 jobs along with all the ancillary work in building and equipping that development. I offer my gratitude to the Government.</P>
      <P>It is a great day for the Fianna Fáil majority and the Progressive Democrats who are working extremely well in Government implementing this policy. No Government in the history of the State has decentralised 10,500 jobs to the regions. This will be implemented within three years. In the lifetime of the Government, all this work will be completed and the staff will be in place. We will have the headquarters of the Department of Education and Science in Mullingar, the Department of Agriculture and Food in Portlaoise and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in Cavan. In excess of 100 jobs will be decentralised to Ballinasloe, with 130 jobs going to Longford. Carrick-on-Shannon fought hard and will get 265 jobs. This is thanks to Oireachtas Members like Deputy Ellis and Senator Mooney, who have been fighting for a long time and have now succeeded.</P>

The one disappointment is Boyle. I have no <Col N="1710" />doubt that the chamber of commerce there is expressing regret that Boyle has not been successful as it was providing a free site for decentralisation. The Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats' policy of decentralisation is being implemented, but we must maintain the fight. Boyle will get spin-off benefits from Sligo and Carrick-on-Shannon. All the areas around Boyle have benefited from the development of the credit card company in Carrick-on-Shannon and now it will benefit from the decentralised jobs. The extension of the tax incentive area to the end of 2006 will give an opportunity to finish all the projects that are under way at present. We had not expected this extension, but I know Leitrim County Council and all the Oireachtas Members from the area fought hard for it.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Finance on introducing this development. It is a great day for politics, for Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, and will help us as we face into the local elections. In Roscommon we have five good candidates and we intend to get four out of the five seats. Due to the decentralisation of 230 jobs to Roscommon, the people will respond and vote for Fianna Fáil in the local elections. We will also get two MEPs elected to Europe in the Connacht-Ulster constituency.</P>

      <P>This budget is a shame and a disgrace to the democratic process. Even by the Government's standards, it is an exercise in extortion that would in any other circumstance result in it having to face legal accountability. A year ago, I referred to the Minister for Finance as &ldquo;Charlie the Slasher&rdquo;. This has proved an apt title for a Minister who over the past year has single-handedly caused more hardship among the less well off than anyone could have realistically imagined.</P>
      <P>This budget, while a repetition of the scandalous document of last year, is an even greater indictment of the duplicity and gross mismanagement of the public finances by the Minster for Finance. After a year of holding the people to ransom and squeezing every last cent possible from the purses of the weakest sections of our society, the unemployed, disabled, elderly and sick, nothing has changed. The Government has no shame, as it cannot afford it. It spent and squandered it along with our public money, the fruits of our boom years. We all know that the Government has squandered the public finances and now it expect its criminally negligent shortfalls to be met and mended by those least able to afford their demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a shocking replay of the 2003 budget, we once again find stealth taxes, a total shutdown of services for the most vulnerable in society and a drastic curtailment of others. The budget contains many stealth taxes in which the taxpayer is yet again being asked to pay more while public services deteriorate. Although mainly disguised and denied, the Government has been forced to admit to some of the following charges: long-term medi<Col N="1711" />cation users will pay more as will those attending hospitals, those dependent on rent supplement and those sending their children to college. Last night an increase in toll charges for cars and other vehicles was also announced.</P>
    <P>These are only a few of the intended stealth charges. Local budgets will continue to be squeezed. Apart from the once-off contribution of &euro;30 million to local authorities, the freeze on Exchequer contributions will be followed by increased local charges. The big State monopoly companies will be looking for their share. Already the ESB has approval for an increase. Health insurance, rail, broadcasting and postal services will not be far behind. There is evidence they have sought increases which, no doubt, the Government will grant.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael has stood up against the benchmarking madness and stood for the hard working taxpayers who will pay for invisible improvements in public services out of their hard earned money. There have been cuts in discretionary schemes on which the poorest sector depend. Child care grants, community employment participation, the treatment purchase fund, FÁS training and integration budgets have all been cut by the Government. Investment in water and sewerage schemes has been cut. Funding for urban regeneration schemes has been cut, with the exception of what is proposed under decentralisation, for which we will have to wait. Funding for the Environmental Protection Agency has been cut. Health spending has been drastically cut. Some 70,000 households in this country live in poverty. People are not even assured of a hot meal every day, yet cuts of &euro;58 million to social welfare schemes are due to be implemented next year. This is what will happen even though a gloss has been put on it.</P>

    <P>The Fine Gael Party is committed to restoring community enterprise. We regret that the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Minister for Finance failed to recognise the great work that has been done through community employment schemes.

The cause is Government ineptitude and mishandling of finances, of which there is evidence everywhere, <Col N="1713" />the effect is to punish and penalise the less well-off.</P>
    <P>Moreover, other cuts are in store with the weakest once again bearing the brunt. Further hospital beds will be closed and contract staff laid off. New teaching materials will not be purchased and broken school equipment will not be replaced. The onus will be placed on parents to do this. Cuts in travel allowances will affect outreach services. Nursing home beds and respite care will be curtailed. Local improvement projects will be put off. Streets and public places will become dirtier. The backlog in the provision for the needs of the disabled will remain unmet. Like a conjuror pulling a life saving rope out of a hat, or more topically given the time of year, like Santa Claus bringing goodwill, the Government now, as it always does, is producing goodies in a pre-local election promise binge.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD" hpid="Mr. Parlon Mr. Parlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
      <P>A debate in this House has become a regular part of budget day each year. I thank the Independent Senators for tabling this motion which provides Members with an opportunity to comment on the budget. It also allows the Government to hear those views and, at the same time, to put on record the objectives which underpin budget 2004 and the measures that will deliver them.</P>
      <P>I begin by reminding the House of the core objectives the Government and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, set out today. We want to continue to foster employment and growth, to maintain our prudent approach to the public finances, to invest more in infrastructure and to keep inflation low, thereby securing Ireland's competitiveness, and in this way secure the resources needed to achieve social inclusion. We have made progress in all these areas, which is evident for all to see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1714" />Unemployment has been reduced from 16% down to under 5%. Our debt to GDP ratio has fallen dramatically from 100% of GDP down to 33% of GDP. These are real benefits which allow more people to share in a growing economy, while more revenue goes to fund sensible income policies and future investment. The strategic decisions taken by Government in recent years, as well as those taken in this year's budget, mean that we are well placed to benefit from an improvement in the major economies, provided that we continue to steer a prudent and far-sighted course. Senators will agree that to do otherwise would be to repeat the failed policies of the past.</P>
    <P>As part of today's budget, the Minister published the Government's economic forecast for the coming years which underpins the budget. Unlike last year, when uncertainty abounded &ndash; with good reason &ndash; we can now point to the general consensus that the much heralded international recovery is under way. The economies of our significant trading partners look better than they have in recent years. However, there are still significant imbalances in the world economy, which are still a source of concern and, as such, pose a risk to the sustainability of the international recovery. Senators are aware of how sensitive is our economy, for example, to sudden falls in the US dollar against the euro and the difficulties this poses for our exporters.</P>
    <P>The Government expects economic expansion to move back towards our long-term growth prospects. In particular, the Minister has forecast that, barring a major external shock, real GNP will expand by 3% for 2004 with real GDP growth growing slightly faster at 3.3%. For the years 2005 and 2006, it appears that real GNP may expand by 4% and 4.5%, respectively. As a result, we expect employment to increase by 23,000 next year while unemployment should average approximately 5%. Taking account of the changes in today's budget, consumer price inflation should average 2.5% in 2004, which is a halving of inflation in the space of one year.</P>
    <P>Senators will, no doubt, have listened with interest to the Minister's announcement on decentralisation. While this initiative was signalled in budget 2000, the next phase will adopt a new approach. Entire Departments &ndash; including Ministers and senior management will move out of Dublin. A total of eight Departments and the Office of Public Works will move headquarters to provincial locations, leaving seven Departments with headquarters in Dublin. Up to now, approximately 4,000 public servants have opted for decentralisation. The next phase, involving all Departments and offices, will see 10,300 civil and public service jobs move to 53 centres in 25 counties. The programme will be implemented on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>In my capacity as a public representative from a constituency outside Dublin and, as Minister with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, I am acutely aware of the benefits this will bring <Col N="1715" />in terms of a more balanced development of the regions. I welcome this decision and look forward to its implementation. Details of the decentralisation programme are outlined in the budget summary.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to borrow wisely to ensure that much needed investment can proceed. For 2004, we will increase gross spending on public services by just under 7% and spend close to 5% of GNP on capital projects. In recent years, there has been a rapid rise in public spending, particularly in areas such as social welfare, health, education and infrastructure. The prospect of lower future growth means less revenue will be available to fund increases in public spending. Consequently, the Minister has signalled his intention to keep increases to this year's level in the coming years.</P>
    <P>We are making a very significant investment in infrastructure, almost &euro;28 billion since 1997 and we plan to spend &euro;5.6 billion next year. As a percentage of our GNP, this is twice what is spent in the rest of the EU. However, we must also ensure that the taxpayer gets full value for this level of investment which requires a more focused and planned approach. In this regard, the Minister announced a new initiative today involving rolling five year multi-annual programmes for all investment areas.</P>
    <P>With effect from next year, Departments will be allowed to carry over to the following year un-spent Exchequer capital allocation, to a maximum of 10%. This initiative will be a significant benefit to longer term projects.</P>
    <P>Speaking of capital, Senators will be pleased to hear that a further &euro;30 million has been allocated to provide school buildings in the primary and secondary sectors. The Minister wants to see greater involvement of private sector interests in the funding of major spending projects through public private partnerships. He also intends to bring forward proposals to make changes to public sector contracts for construction, construction-related services and the hiring of consultants.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the Government should renege on its commitment to implement the report of the independent Public Service Benchmarking Body. The Government has no intention of so doing. We have an agreement on which both sides must deliver if we are to achieve the quality of services we all want. Senators will be aware of the initiatives the Minister has introduced over the years to fund the State's future pension liability and to encourage people to provide for their own pensions. These initiatives have been extremely necessary in light of predicted demographic problems in the future. It is estimated that the number of people of pensionable age will increase threefold over the next 50 years. The major economic problem this represents for the future must be addressed now. The Government has therefore decided to introduce changes to the pension arrangements for new entrants to the public service from 1 April next year. The <Col N="1716" />minimum pension age in most cases will be 65. Staff who enter the public service will be permitted to continue working after they reach that age. It is important to note that existing staff and pensioners will not be affected. Revised arrangements will also come into effect for the Garda, prison officers and members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The reduction of consistent poverty and the improvement of living standards will continue to be a Government priority. Over the past number of years, our policies in this area have brought real benefits to those in greatest need.</P>

The Government will continue to evaluate public expenditure in a way which allows it to free up resources to direct them to the areas which are most in need. It has done so today.</P>
      <P>The level of additional benefits announced today by the Minister for Finance is well ahead of the rate of inflation. The Minister announced a &euro;10 increase in the full personal rate of old age and related pensions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD" hpid="Mr. Parlon Mr. Parlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The old age contributory pension will be increased to &euro;167.30 per week. The new rate for the old age non-contributory pension will be &euro;154 per week. Widows' and widowers' contributory pensions for those aged 66 and over will increase by &euro;11.50 to bring the rate up to the level of the old age contributory pension. The new weekly rate for widows and widowers aged 80 or over will be &euro;173.70.</P>
      <P>All other personal weekly social welfare rates will be increased by &euro;10 per week. This measure will bring the lowest full personal social welfare rate to &euro;134.80 per week. The full qualified adult allowance rates will increase by at least &euro;6.60 per week. There will be a special increase of &euro;16.10 in the invalidity pension qualified adult rate where the qualified adult is aged 66 or over to make it equivalent to the old age contributory pension equivalent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been major increases in the level of child benefit under this Government. Next year will see a further increase of &euro;6 to bring the rate for the first and second child to &euro;131.60 per <Col N="1717" />month. The rate for third and subsequent children will increase by &euro;8 to &euro;165.30 per month. Further measures which will be announced by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs are set out in the summary of budget measures. A total of &euro;25 million is being provided to support persons with intellectual, physical or sensory disabilities. This funding will be used to provide additional emergency residential placements, extra day services &ndash; especially for school leavers &ndash; and to enhance health support services for children.</P>
    <P>The Government has made substantial progress in lifting the burden of tax on jobs and enterprise and is committed to continuing this successful strategy. This year, the Minister has targeted our limited resources towards those on low pay by increasing the employee tax credit by &euro;240 to &euro;1,040 per annum. This measure means 90% of the minimum wage will continue to be free of tax and will remove 39,200 taxpayers from the tax net. The first &euro;246 per week earned by a single worker will be tax free.</P>
    <P>The income tax exemption limits for those aged 65 or over are also being increased. The new limits will be &euro;15,500 for single persons and &euro;31,000 for married persons. This represents an extra &euro;500 and &euro;1,000, respectively. The increase in the exemption limits will remove an additional 2,200 elderly taxpayers from the tax net. These income tax measures will cost &euro;287 million in a full year. In three years, these limits have increased in value by almost 44%.</P>
    <P>Senators will be pleased to hear that a number of tax reliefs which were due to end have been extended. The business expansion scheme and the related seed capital scheme will continue to the end of 2006 in recognition of the positive role the schemes play in the development of small firms. The ceiling on the amount which can be raised under these schemes is being increased from &euro;750,000 to &euro;1 million. Another measure which I am sure the House will welcome is the extension of the film relief scheme to the end of 2008 with an increase in the ceiling to &euro;15 million per film from 2005.</P>
    <P>Senators will also be aware of a number of area-based tax reliefs which were due to end next year. In recognition of the fact that enforcement of the current cut-off date would result in practical difficulties, I am pleased to inform the House that the Minister has agreed to extend these schemes until 31 July 2006. The extension is made on condition that the projects involved will have commenced or are moving ahead at the relevant time. The Minister has also decided to extend the relief for corporate investment in renewable energy sources for a further two years as part of our strategy to meet our Kyoto Protocol targets.</P>
    <P>It is important that we continue to move up the value chain in terms of the quality of employment we develop. A new initiative to encourage research and development in Irish companies is to be introduced. It is proposed that a tax credit will be available to companies for incremental research and development expenditure. Up to <Col N="1718" />20% of this expenditure will be allowable against corporation tax in any given tax year. There will also be an exemption from stamp duty on transfers of intellectual property.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also decided to introduce measures to encourage multinational corporations to locate their regional headquarters and holding companies in Ireland. This will involve an exemption from CGT for Irish resident companies on the disposal of a substantial shareholding in their trading subsidiaries. There will also be an expansion of our double taxation relief provisions for dividend income paid to parent companies in certain cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking into account the need to keep inflation down, the Minister has decided to make only minor changes to indirect taxation. Taxation on cigarettes and other tobacco products will increase by the equivalent of 25 cent per packet of 20 cigarettes. The VAT-inclusive excise duty rate on petrol and diesel will be increased by 5 cent per litre. These increases will take effect from midnight tonight and will raise &euro;243 million next year.</P>
      <P>I turn next to the agricultural sector with which I am very familiar. The budget contains a number of measures that will benefit farmers. I am particularly pleased by the Minister's decision to establish a new rural social scheme. This scheme will provide worthwhile, locally based jobs for members of families eligible for the farm assist scheme. It is envisaged that up to 2,500 places will be available on the scheme. The effect will be the improvement of rural services and the provision of income to small farmers through a working week which is compatible with farming. Details of the scheme are set out in the budget summary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of tax measures have been introduced to assist the farming sector. First, the special scheme of capital allowance for farm pollution control due to end this year will be extended for another three years to the end of 2006. Second, there will be major improvements in the tax reliefs available for farm leasing to promote better use of our national agricultural land resources. These measures arise from the decoupling decision taken by the Government following the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy. The exempt threshold for leases of five to seven years is being increased from &euro;5,079 to &euro;7,500. For leases of seven years or more, the exempt threshold is being increased from &euro;7,618 to &euro;10,000. In addition, the age limit for the qualifying lessors is being reduced from 55 to 40. Third, the farmers flat-rate VAT will go up from 4.3% to 4.4%. This rate change will ensure that farmers will continue to be compensated in full for the VAT they bear on their business inputs. <Col N="1719" />There will be a corresponding increase in the VAT rate for livestock sales.</P>
    <P>To turn to the recently published Estimates, next year the Government will spend &euro;1.39 billion in support of agriculture. This represents an increase of &euro;62 million or 5% over the corresponding 2003 figure. When account is taken of the reduced expenditure requirements related to BSE in 2004, which arises from the improved disease situation, this expenditure represents an increase of 8% in real terms. A further &euro;1.6 billion will be paid out on EU funded agricultural measures in 2004, mainly through direct payments to farmers. This will bring total expenditure on agriculture to approximately &euro;3 billion in 2004. Direct payments to farmers will amount to an average of approximately &euro;13,000 each per year.</P>
    <P>The progress we have made over recent years has laid a firm foundation for future success. We can only build on that foundation if we continue to follow sound budgetary policies. Irish people have seen the rewards which have come from good management of the public finances and are wise enough to recognise the need to avoid short-term fixes.</P>

      <P>One need only look at news on &ldquo;Six-one&rdquo; to see how wise the people are. This budget represents a prudent combination of targeted tax and expenditure measures which will bring real benefits. At the same time, it protects the vulnerable in our society. We have more jobs in our society and a better standard of living for all, especially for those on the margins. We are seeing real benefits in the delivery of better public services focused on delivery and quality and we are able to put in place the much needed infrastructure that will continue to add to our future successes. The indications are there that we have come through the worst of the international downturn and I am confident that we can look to the future with optimism. This budget is another important step in the Government's delivery of its policies. I commend the budget to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>In a sense, this is a &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; budget. There are no ideas in it &ndash; certainly no big ideas. More often than not, that is good cause to be thankful when dealing with the Minister's ideas because most of them have caused us grief over the years. However, on this particular occasion, there was a need for greater ambition and greater innovation than we have seen. The real budget happened two weeks ago in the Book of Estimates, which put the squeeze on public services and imposed a series of 16 social welfare cuts. That is what will cause pain and that is the <Col N="1720" />story of the budget. What we have today is marking time in terms of social welfare and tax. It is a repetition of a number of ideas, most of which have been announced before.</P>
      <P>The biggest of those ideas is the decentralisation plan which was first announced by the Minister in 1999 in the 2000 budget. He has repeated it almost every time he has had to answer parliamentary questions in the Lower House. He usually uses the same mantra, including notions such as relocating Department headquarters down the country and so on. I accept we did not get the detail we got today previously and, to that extent, it is new. However, there is little money &ndash;&euro;20 million &ndash; to bring about the decentralisation and, as far as we can tell, there are no targets on how long it will take. I am extremely sceptical about whether this decentralisation will happen within the foreseeable future. The temptation is to think that it has a great deal more to do with the timing of the local elections than with anything else. Indeed, if anybody was in any doubt about that, the extraordinary performance of Senator Leyden earlier, when he dealt with the alleged impact on Roscommon, is proof of that point.</P>
      <P>I am a Dubliner and there are few Dubliners in this House. Maybe we should take an attitude dictated by our local circumstances from time to time, although we Dubs rarely do so. This is a zero sum game. If 10,300 jobs are to be gained by various exotic places around the country, then they are being lost to our capital city. Our capital city is still the area in the country in which most unemployment is located. It is also where many people choose to live, including no doubt the Minister's officials in the Department of Finance, few of whom will be affected by this decision. Some people who live in and who were brought up in this city will not wish to be forcibly relocated to some place down the country to shore up the Fianna Fáil county council seat in Ballygobackwards.</P>

However, that is not what we are talking about. We are talking about Senator Leyden and his mates in County Roscommon being able to go around next June telling people they have got 250 jobs or whatever or that they may get 250 jobs at some point in the undetermined future.</P>

      <P>I am in a minority in my party, as we Dubs are in all parties. Occasionally, we have to speak up for ourselves and for those civil servants who want to stay in this glorious city of ours.</P>
      <P>My party supports a serious programme of decentralisation which is intended to provide for regional development based on the spatial strategy. I do not see that in this plan. What I see is a programme for local government candidates from Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats throughout the country. I do not believe civil servants should be asked to sacrifice their careers on the basis of a local government manifesto for Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>What we have seen today in regard to social welfare is a serious disappointment. I spoke on this issue a couple of weeks ago during Private Members' business when the Minister Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, was present. I said &ndash; the Minister seemed to agree &ndash; that we would be entitled to judge this on the basis of the programme for Government which stated that it would make serious progress towards meeting the target of having the lowest rate of social welfare at approximately &euro;182 in 2007. That requires a real rather than an actual increase of approximately one quarter over the four years in between. What we see today just about marks time with inflation and does not greatly exceed the increase in other incomes. We will not make any progress on the Government's targets set out in the programme for Government which refers to &euro;182 as being the lowest rate of social welfare benefit in 2007.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in respect of income tax is much the same. It is reasonable to point out that the Government has often stated its target to reduce the number of people paying the higher rate of tax at 20%. This budget will actually increase the number, although I will not weep many tears about that. However, I am critical that many years after the Government first stated it as a strategy, there is a significant number of people on the minimum wage paying income tax. It is not sensible to say on the one hand that from February next, it is unreasonable for employers to pay employees less than &euro;7 per hour while, on the other, taking some of it from them by way of tax. If we state that &euro;7 per hour is an acceptable basic minimum entitlement, we must say, as a corollary, that we will not tax it. The Government has done nothing better than mark time with its 90% from last year. That is a pity because it is clear from the Exchequer returns we saw yester<Col N="1722" />day that there would have been the capacity to go a little further, or probably the full distance, in terms of taking those earning the minimum wage out of the income tax net.</P>
    <P>I remember attending this debate last year when Senator Quinn, whose contribution this evening I did not hear, warmly welcomed the Minister's commitment to introduce a carbon energy tax from the following year. I thought it remarkable that during his 45 minute dissertation in the other House, the Minister did not mention that commitment. I would be interested to know where that commitment stands. I for one have never believed the Minister was in any way committed to a carbon energy tax or that he cares a toss about the Kyoto Protocol and our commitments under it. I regret that his silence today has proved that he cares little for what are solemn international treaty obligations.</P>
    <P>There is a commitment in the budget for multi-annual budgeting for capital purposes, the capital envelope of three to five years. In principle, I accept it is right, but it is not the first time something of this nature was announced. Something similar was announced and even tried a number of years ago. However, the Department is not much given to this type of idea, certainly not in practice whatever about in principle. The proof of the pudding will be in the eating. I like the idea that one can carry over up to 10% of one's budget if it is unused. Provided that is not reflected in a reduction in one's budget for the following year, it clearly makes sense. In terms of infrastructural development and capital spending, we need a much more sensible way to do things than the stop-go way we have seen heretofore.</P>

      <P>I am speaking to the motion because an attack was made on the decentralisation policy that has been pursued by every Administration since the foundation of the State and which has not been implemented until today. It will be implemented within the timeframe. It is a happy day for the people of County Leitrim. My late father sat in this House and on many occasions, along with his contemporaries, sought the decentralisation of Departments to rural areas. I did not believe I would see the day it would happen. There will be 265 jobs in Carrick-on-Shannon. Senator Leyden said it already in respect of Roscommon, but I compliment my parliamentary colleague, Deputy Ellis, who fought for decentralisation and the staff of Leitrim County Council who prepared and laid the groundwork for today's momentous announcement. The county manager said earlier when I gave him the news that the site located in Carrick-on-Shannon will fit adequately the jobs that will be provided there. We are ready, willing and able to take on the challenge and will do so with enthusiasm. I compliment the members of Leitrim County Council and especially the representatives from the Carrick-on-Shannon electoral area who fought assiduously for it. There were times we thought it would never happen, but it has happened and will take place.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Government and the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon. I hope he will also ensure that the relocation of the sections of the Department of Agriculture and Food from Sligo to Leitrim will take place. The site has been purchased in my home town of Drumshanbo and is now at the conveyancing stage. That decision was pursued by the Government not as part of a decentralisation decision, but as a result of long recognised overcrowding at the Department offices in Sligo. I hope the Minister will be able to pursue it to its conclusion on the basis that we have the decentralisation programme in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county also welcomes the extension of the rural tax scheme but I hope the Minister takes this suggestion on board regarding what happened with the coastal resort scheme and unfortunately with the tax incentive scheme in County Leitrim. A report published earlier this week showed the stark reality that 72% of the houses built in County Leitrim over the past three to four years have been second homes. The tax incentive scheme was set up by the Government to help the repopulation of rural areas and not to provide second homes for wealthy people. I suggest that in the context of the guidelines awaited by Leitrim County Council there should be a more focused approach for the remainder of this incentive scheme. It should focus more on town and urban areas to ensure there will be repopulation. At the same time, the guidelines must <Col N="1724" />ensure that the people in my county and other rural parts of Ireland who wish to build houses on their own land will be allowed to do so without fear or favour from An Bord Pleanála or any other outside agencies.</P>
    <P>I understand and appreciate that the Opposition must make their political points but Senator Bannon made a sorry case for the Opposition. His speech could have been written in 1932 instead of 2003. It painted doom and gloom. No wonder the people voted to put Fianna Fáil back in Government.</P>

The circle is complete. Fine Gael lives in the past and we have a putative Minister for Finance who does not believe in decentralisation.

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for selecting this matter for the Adjournment and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for his attendance.</P>
      <P>I request that the Minister establish an inquiry into what happened in Derrybrien and its consequences. It is an environmental disaster for the area in terms of water pollution and the enormous fish kill which occurred. Many of the planning conditions laid down as a requirement before any development would take place, initially by Galway County Council and on appeal by An Bord Pleanála, have gone unheeded. It is unprecedented that development would start on a site without adherence to the pre-planning conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What will it mean if we are to follow the same pattern with similar situations in the future? The development charges being imposed at local authority level now on every individual house will be collected. I seek an urgent inquiry into why in <Col N="1725" />this instance, the bond demanded, or the combination of alternatives to the bond which amounted, as suggested by Galway County Council, to &euro;100,000, was not adhered to by the developers on this site. No Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government can allow that go unquestioned. I ask the Minister of State to ensure the developers adhere to that bond so that the people of Derrybrien can see that some agency will take responsibility.</P>
    <P>Nobody has yet taken responsibility for the disaster that occurred at Derrybrien. The neglect of the on site developers is the first instance of lack of responsibility. The report of the archaeologist who investigated the site initially is a damning indictment. It states:</P>
    <P>Excavation on the eastern half of the site was discontinued as the jelly like movement of the ground under the weight of the machine rendered further digging unsafe. Excavation on the western half of the site was attempted but the area was covered in dense ranks of fir trees which made it impossible for the machine to reach the testing sites. The work was abandoned altogether.</P>
    <P>That report goes back as far as June 2002. That simple paragraph by way of assessment of the site was never noted. The developers who ignored it were negligent in the extreme. The consultants appointed in the recent past by both Galway County Council and Hibernian Wind Energy are about to report. The reports will not satisfy the people of Derrybrien and Gort. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should not be satisfied with what has happened.</P>
    <P>As the relevant local authority, Galway County Council faces expenses in excess of &euro;100,000 to repair the damage done to local roads, the environment and a river. It had to augment the water supply at Gort at short notice. Nobody has indicated how the council will be reimbursed. I want the Minister of State to indicate who will reimburse the council for the work it carried out on site. I compliment the local area engineers and the other Galway County Council personnel, who worked so hard when nobody else would help. The developers walked away from the site for 14 days after the mud slide on 16 October. They returned when somebody pointed out their responsibilities to them, but they have not yet accepted that they may have been responsible for what happened.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to establish an inquiry into all aspects of this matter. Who will pay Galway County Council? Who will carry out the remedial action that is necessary to rehabilitate the fish life in the River Owendalulleegh and in Lough Cutra? Who will guarantee the safety of the Gort water supply on an ongoing basis? Who will take responsibility for the safety of the people of Derrybrien? I do not think the Minister of State can answer these questions. If I am right, he should accede to my request, on behalf of the <Col N="1726" />people of Derrybrien, for an inquiry into the matters outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Ulick Burke for raising this issue. The Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts and related legislation designate local authorities as the water pollution control authorities. The control authority in this case is Galway County Council. Under the legislation, the Environmental Protection Agency acts in a general supervisory role. I have made inquiries about the matter. I will outline the circumstances in the wake of the Derrybrien mud slide incidents, as I understand them.</P>
      <P>Galway County Council has served a section 23 notice on the ESB, Hibernian Wind Farms, Gort Wind Farms and Ascot Contractors under the Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Act 1990. The council is seeking full information on the Derrybrien incident. The section 23 provisions empower local authorities to serve notice in writing on certain persons, requiring them to give full information in respect of activities or practices that may have led to a water pollution incident. It is not appropriate for the council to seek formally to determine the cause of the mud slide, to ascertain liability or to impose requirements on liable parties for rehabilitation work on the river until it has received the information demanded under the section 23 notices. The council has spent almost &euro;100,000 on River Owendalulleegh remedial work so far. The river has been diverted in the area affected by the mud slide to reduce the amount of silt reaching Lough Cutra. The water quality in the lake is improving, but further heavy rainfall could lead to another build-up of silt.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency has assisted the council by giving it advice and by monitoring the water quality of Lough Cutra. The agency monitored the River Owendalulleegh two weeks ago. The results of water samples monitored for their chemistry were more or less normal. An ecological assessment of the lake, under the requirements of the water framework directive, was undertaken before the mud slide. Further monitoring, which will take place in the spring or summer of next year, will prove useful as an accurate comparison. I understand that biological life has been seriously compromised at the top part of the River Owendalulleegh, but biological life further down the river appears to have survived relatively well. Most of the loose peat went onto the flood plain and the lake and the main river channel is more or less as normal. The EPA hopes that trout spawning will not be impaired and that intervention will not be required to restock the river with trout.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of costs appropriate to be borne by Galway County Council will be dealt with by the council in the context of its annual budgetary process. General purpose allocations in excess of &euro;626 million were made available to local auth<Col N="1727" />orities from the local government fund in 2003. General purpose grants to local authorities from the fund have increased by about 85% since the Government came to office in 1997.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Galway County Council's allocation from the fund in 2003 was &euro;25,037,960. This represents an increase of approximately 92% over the 1997 allocation and an average increase of over 15% in each of the past six years. The recently published Abridged Estimates Volume indicates that &euro;1.118 billion will be available to the local government fund in 2004. This represents an increase of approximately &euro;38 million on the amount available to the fund this year. The Senator will be aware that today's budget provides for a further addition of &euro;30 million to the local government fund. Revised buoyancy projections should also permit increased provision for local authority funding in 2004. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government intends to notify local authorities of their 2004 general purpose grant allocations shortly. I repeat that it is not appropriate for Galway County Council to determine formally the cause of the mud slide until it has received the information it has demanded under the section 23 notices.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, to the House. It is appropriate that he will respond to my comments, as he pays attention to matters in County Donegal as part of his national brief. I would like to discuss the difficulties being experienced by St. Mura's national school in Buncrana and Monreagh national school in Carrigans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>St. Mura's national school in Buncrana has been waiting for funds to be allocated so that it can be refurbished. There are great plans to redevelop the school. An extension to the school is <Col N="1728" />planned because there is a lack of space there at present. Its principal has to conduct her office work in a classroom. The old-style two-room school in Buncrana was built in 1930. The school authorities are waiting for an announcement on when the building programme will be enacted. There is some confusion in this regard, as it has been suggested that construction will commence in 2004. I ask the Minister of State to commit to a date in his response. The parents of the pupils at St. Mura's are being punished for keeping the school up to scratch on a voluntary basis. The school should not be punished because it does not fall into the grant assistance category for developing schools. It should be kept on the list.</P>
    <P>The case of Monreagh national school in Carrigans is somewhat different. It was built in 1853 and celebrated its 150th anniversary last weekend. The school authorities in Carrigans have asked for a new building. They would like the Government to commit to when the land acquisition deal will be signed. The board of management is embarrassed because it has engaged in fund-raising, in which parents have been involved. Those associated with the school want to know why the construction has not started, when it will start and if it will start. The board of management is seeking a commitment in this regard and I hope the Minister of State can provide it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase of &euro;30 million for primary and secondary schools in the budget. The small schools to which I refer are the 19 pupil school in Monreagh and the 40 pupil St. Mura's primary school in Buncrana, which are a microcosm of the education system. In that context, one must consider that &euro;7.5 million is required to build one national school in Ennis, County Clare. I have serious reservations about where this money will come from for an overall national strategy. The boards of management of these schools do not want any more false promises or commitments. The board of Monreagh national school wants a start date for land acquisition so that the school building programme can proceed and the board of St. Mura's seeks a commitment as to when it can proceed with refurbishment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue. I am glad to have the opportunity of outlining to the House the Department of Education and Science's position in regard to the provision of improved accommodation of St. Mura's, Buncrana, and Monreagh national school in Carrigans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>St. Mura's national school has applied for the provision of additional upgrading of existing mechanical and electrical services and refurbishment of the existing school building. The Department has already accepted that there is a need to provide additional accommodation for students of St. Mura's national school in Buncrana and I am pleased to inform the Senator that a proposed building project for the school is at stage 4-5 of architectural planning. The Senator <Col N="1729" />will appreciate the importance of this stage which involves pre-tender documents. It is intended to publish details of the 2004 school building programme by early January at the latest. The programme will clarify what progress is planned for projects, such as St. Mura's national school during 2004.</P>
    <P>In regard to Monreagh national school, the Department is examining the school application for improved accommodation. The Senator will appreciate that before committing major capital funding to any project, the Department must be satisfied, having regard to all relevant factors including enrolment and demographic trends, that Monreagh national school has a viable future, thereby ensuring value for money. When these issues have been fully investigated by the Department of Education and Science, a decision will issue to the school's management authority.</P>
    <P>I will at the first available opportunity relate the Senator's strong views and concerns to the Minister for Education and Science. The Senator is part of a team, together with his Oireachtas colleagues in the north west, which is impressing upon the Minister the necessity to progress these applications. I am familiar with the schools and hope it will not be long until the 2004 programme is published and we can see if there is positive news for them.</P>

      <P>As the Minister of State may have seen in a recent &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme, the problem of juvenile or youth crime is particularly serious in many towns and cities. One of the most impressive tools the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has at its disposal is an annual fund which it can use to finance specific youth diversionary programmes in a number of urban areas. I understand that 64 programmes have been funded by the Department, representing the carrot, rather than the stick, approach.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State may know from his brief from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, one of the more recent applications comes from the STAY project in St. Aengus' parish in Tallaght. A comprehensive application has been made to the Department seeking funding as another programme within the youth diversionary programme. Like other Senators, I am here to plead and bleat about issues to do with my own constituency and to see if the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will lend his ear and support to the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a community based programme which attempts to pick up children who are falling out of the educational system and coming into harm's way through their engagement in anti-social activity and crime. St. Aengus' parish is not a designated area under the RAPID scheme and is not regarded as an area of heightened deprivation in <Col N="1730" />comparison to other areas close by. There is a general sense that the community has been poorly serviced by infrastructure. Uniquely, this group of community workers, a local national and community school, An Garda Síochána, the parish team itself and a variety of other agencies have come together to make this application to the Minister. The group seeks &euro;63,500 to fund the project so that it can be expanded to people over 18 years of age. It is not a large sum of money if one considers the amount of money which goes into custodial sentences &ndash; it is peanuts.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to liaise with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to express my strong support for this project and ask him to give us an early decision on the application. The small amount of money which they seek will make a difference in the community and will ensure this programme can continue to do its good work on a much sounder financial footing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter on the Adjournment and I am aware of his interest in this subject. I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who regrets that he is unable to be here due to prior commitments.</P>
      <P>Garda youth diversion projects are community based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young people from becoming involved, or further involved, in anti-social or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve prospects of employability. By doing so, the projects also contribute to improving the quality of life within communities and enhancing Garda-community relations.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is committed to their continuing development and, as resources permit, their expansion. The projects are funded by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and administered by the community relations section of the Garda Síochána. The first projects, previously known as Garda special projects, were established in 1991 and by October 2001, the number of projects had reached its existing level of 64. Many of the projects established in recent years were facilitated by the allocation of funding under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rapid expansion in project numbers created quality assurance challenges in regard to the operation and management outcomes of the projects. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform commissioned an evaluation report on the Garda youth diversion projects entitled, The Impact and Effectiveness of the Garda Special Projects, which suggested that a set of guidelines was required to develop a planned and strategic approach. The report recommended that the guidelines should set out the nature of youth crime prevention and diversion projects, the implementation structures required to deliver programmes at local level, the roles of the various <Col N="1731" />stakeholders involved and the range of actions and measures that are appropriate to fund good crime prevention work.</P>
    <P>As a result, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform commissioned the centre for social and educational research at the Dublin Institute of Technology, Rathmines, in 2001 to prepare comprehensive guidelines for the establishment, operation, management and administration of the projects. The guidelines were launched by the Minister in May 2003. The purpose of the guidelines is to act as a benchmark against which applications for new projects are to be evaluated on an ongoing basis. They should be viewed as an aid to new and existing Garda youth diversion projects on their establishment, operation, administration and monitoring. The guidelines set out best practice regarding preventative activities and interventions in dealing with marginalised young people. They will also act as a practical aid to projects and their management committees and co-ordinators.</P>
    <P>Participation in Garda youth diversion projects is voluntary. The primary project target group, which forms the majority of project participants, comprises young people who have entered the Garda juvenile diversion programme and are considered at risk of remaining within the justice system. The secondary project target group comprises young people who, although they have not been officially cautioned, have come to the attention of the Garda, the community or local agencies as a result of their behaviour and are considered at risk of entering the justice system at a future date. The number of participants in each project differs according to local circumstances and resources. The focus is on the quality of the work-intervention with the participants rather than on the quantity of participants.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the 64 Garda youth diversion projects cater for approximately 2,500 participants per annum. The Minister for Justice, <Col N="1732" />Equality and Law Reform has been informed by the Garda authorities that an application for STAY &ndash; the St. Aengus youth project &ndash; was received by the Garda community relations section in October 2002 and that the proposal relates to young people between ten and 18 years of age in the disadvantaged area of St. Aengus's parish.</P>
    <P>Three Garda youth diversion projects currently operate in the Tallaght district, namely, the YEW, KEY and JAY projects. Funding of &euro;5.577 million has been allocated to Garda youth diversion projects in the current year, of which &euro;296,420 has been allocated to the three projects in the Tallaght district. While the Minister has secured an overall increase of 9.5% in the Estimates for the Vote for the Garda Síochána in 2004, the continuing need to maintain discipline in the public finances means that he must prioritise expenditure. He, therefore, cannot increase the funding for all items of expenditure in the Vote. As a result, the Abridged Estimates Volume for 2004 provides for funding of &euro;5.318 million for Garda youth diversion projects. However, in view of the fact that most of the more recently established projects incurred start up expenses in the past two years, which are not expected to be a feature in the coming years, the Minister is confident that all of the projects can be maintained on the proposed funding allocation.</P>
    <P>It is not envisaged that additional Garda youth diversion projects will be established in the short term. However, the possibility of establishing further projects in the future in light of budgetary conditions will remain. In that context, I assure Senator Brian Hayes that the application for the St. Aengus youth project will be kept under review. I will brief the Minister, at the earliest opportunity, on the Senator's contribution and relay his desire that the project be approved.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 7.35 p.m. until 10.45&nbsp;a.m. on Tuesday, 9 December 2003.</P>
