    <P>An Cathaoirleach: I have received notice from Senator Browne that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to explain the progress that is being made to secure replacement jobs in the Carlow area.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Feighan of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to clarify why Áras Mháthair Pól, Castlerea, Áras Chaolainn, Castlerea, and Plunkett Home, Boyle, are without physiotherapy services for in-patients and out-patients, and to reinstate these valuable services immediately.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Morrissey of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Transport to give an update on the licensing of private bus operators and to list restrictions being placed upon them such as those being imposed on Mortons' route from Celbridge to Dublin.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator McHugh of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to give an update on the foreshore licence application towards dredging on the River Swilly and whether funding will be made available to cover the dredging costs which will facilitate the new ferry service between Buncrana and Rathmullan and also to facilitate a new RNLI boat in 2004.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Brian Hayes of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to explain why his Department has, to date, failed <Col N="1994" /> to reply to an invitation by the Labour Relations Commission to explain why, from October 2002, it took a decision to reduce the starting salary scale for secretarial assistants working with Members of the Oireachtas; to ask that an early decision will be taken to immediately review the starting salary in question and that the matter be discussed.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters raised by Senators Browne, Feighan and Morrissey and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators McHugh and Brian Hayes may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <P>
      <b></b>
    </P>
    <P>Ms O'Rourke: The Order of Business is No. 1, a motion referred to the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, which has completed its deliberations, concerning the fees to be payable in respect of salmon, eel and oyster commercial fishing licences and salmon, eel and shellfish dealers' licences issued or renewed for the period commencing on or after 1 January 2004; Nos. 2 to 6, inclusive, referral motions whereby the subject matter of motions Nos. 18 to 22, inclusive, are being referred to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights for consideration. These motions concern the introduction of biometric identifiers into the uniform format for visas and residence permits for third country nationals. The introduction of such data will enhance the security features on visas and residence permits and will establish a reliable link between holder, passport and visa; No. 7, Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill 2003 &ndash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 3.30 p.m; No. 8, motion on the appointment of the Ombudsman for Children to be taken from 3.30 p.m. to 4.30 p.m. with contributions from each group not to exceed ten minutes; No. 9, Broadcasting (Funding) Bill &ndash; Report and Final Stages to be taken at 4.30 p.m. and to conclude not later than 5 p.m; and No. 26, motion 26, to be taken from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. B. Hayes: My colleague, the spokesperson on marine and communications matters, will address our reservations on No. 1, a motion in her name back from committee and my party's reservations in that regard. We are opposed to substantial increases in drift and draft net licences in the marine sector and are seeking a debate on the matter. Our spokesperson will deal with that issue at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>On behalf of Fine Gael, I welcome the statement by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, on the Nally <Col N="1995" /> report which has recently come to the attention of Government, a copy of which has been circulated to the Leaders of Fine Gael and the Labour Party. It is important this House informs the Government of our belief that it would be useful if, at this stage, the Government and the Taoiseach were to meet and discuss with the families of those killed at Omagh the contents of that report, even in a truncated manner. I appreciate there are security implications involved but the families need to know the context of the report. I urge the Government, and specifically the Taoiseach, to meet the families at the earliest possible time.</P>
    <P>It is important the Nally group continues its work in respect of one named individual whose allegations were central to its report. I understand the individual has not, as yet, spoken to the Nally group. I encourage the Government to ensure the Nally group is not stood down so this individual is afforded the opportunity to make a full statement to it if he so wishes in the near future. I ask the Government to consider that proposal.</P>
    <P>There are two specific areas in which the Government could assist the victims of Omagh. It could, with the British Government, provide financial and moral support to the civil cases now being taken by the families against named individuals on this island. It should also, because of the particular atrocity which occurred that day, incur the costs involved in that regard. All right minded people in this and the other House should be absolutely clear on the need for Sinn Féin to get off the fence on this issue, to stop its crocodile tears and to state unequivocally that it is the responsibility and duty of every citizen in this State and in Northern Ireland to co-operate with the Garda Síochána and the Police Service of Northern Ireland in providing information which can lead to the arrest and trying of those involved in this dastardly crime. It is an act of grotesque hypocrisy for Sinn Féin to speak of the pain of Omagh and the difficulties experienced by its victims when it will not call on its supporters and friends to provide information to the police authorities in that regard. I call on the Government to join with my party and others in stating that unequivocally.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. O'Toole: I am utterly opposed to the proposal for dealing with No. 1, not for the same reason as Deputy Brian Hayes but because the distribution of salmon licences, as I have said many times in this House before, is unacceptable, unfair and is not properly weighted.</P>
    <P>While I am aware of what is in that motion, I am not aware of the content of the following three motions. The language used by the Leader in describing them is the language one would use when one is not inclined to give much information. Is the Leader saying there will be DNA <Col N="1996" /> testing of immigrants to ensure that persons seeking the visa are in possession of the relevant passport? What is being sought here? Despite the Leader's fluent and flowery explanation, I do not have a clue what she was talking about.</P>
    <P>There are many unclear issues concerning the Nally report. It is difficult to discuss the report without having seen it and I recognise and accept there are security implications. However, significant core information must be made available to those most affected. This could best be done if those involved in the report were asked to summarise the core information that led them to their conclusions in a manner that is not security sensitive. This would at least allow people to understand the processes by which Government and the Nally group came to the conclusions. While this will not satisfy all the people, it is necessary that we at least have an understanding of the logic that led them to their conclusions. This idea could be brought to the Government and presented as a route out of its difficulties. There are no sectional political differences on this.</P>
    <P>As regards a court case, it should be remembered that a previous Government gave support to a Dundalk based group which took a case against Sellafield. Therefore, there is a precedent for supporting cases taken outside the State, although it was citizens of this State who took the case. I do not believe there are significant differences in this case. While I agree with the Government that a limit must be put on it, a gesture could be made in this direction.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Ryan: While I agree with the thrust of what previous speakers have said about the Nally report, I am always sceptical of concerns about national security emanating from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. During the drafting of the Freedom of Information Act, the Labour Party was told that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform believed that all information in its possession would have to be kept secret to protect national security. It is not so long since the Department would not allow the photograph of its Secretary General to be published as it was deemed a threat to national security. While I fully accept there are issues of national security at play here, the final judgment on what constitutes a threat to national security should not be within the brief of the Department that looks after national security. Under this, self-interest and national interest can easily become confused.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why we have not worked harder to ease the anger felt by the families of those who died in Omagh that they are not being well served by the Government and political system in this State. A long and frank private meeting between the representatives of the families and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Taoiseach would help the famil<Col N="1997" /> ies enormously, even if the Minister is convinced he has no new information to share.</P>
    <P>Last week was a momentous one in the Iraqi struggle. The murderous Saddam was arrested and, according to the President of the United States, is destined for execution. This is an interesting way of holding a proper trial. A Chinese emperor once referred to how civilised the judicial system in his country was when he said that they first hold a trial and then hold the execution. We appear to be returning to this; I suppose the imperial pretence is to be expected.</P>
    <P>It was also a momentous week in which we discovered the Taoiseach was always against the war.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. B. Hayes: What war was this?</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Ryan: I know of many members of Fianna Fáil who were against the war. The Leader was against the war and Senator Ó Murchú was definitely against it. Others, to whom I am doing an injustice by not mentioning, may also have been against it. However, I did not know the Taoiseach was against the war. Maybe the Leader will persuade him to tell us where on the record we can find his new gem of a statement that he opposed it. It goes without saying that none of us is in favour of war, but I want to know where the Taoiseach said he was against this war.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. O'Toole: What he said was that he was for the people who were against the war.</P>
    <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: Order, please. We are not discussing what the Taoiseach said.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Ryan: It is not often that I welcome an interruption but that was a particularly good clarification.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: Senator Ryan should continue on the Order of Business.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Ryan: As one who has been on what would be classified as the liberal side during a succession of referenda, I question the idea of a 14 year old girl who is 23 weeks pregnant being taken to Britain under the auspices of a health board to terminate her pregnancy. It is an issue that needs to be thrashed out thoroughly. I recognise the privacy issues involved but ethical issues such as this should not be decided upon by people who are, as far as I can see, accountable to nobody. If one uses privacy, one eliminates, for good reason, some forms of accountability. However, this is not an area regarding which an issue of privacy should mean that public policy is left to one side. It is a very serious and profoundly challenging ethical issue and it should not be left to middle-ranking public servants in a health board to <Col N="1998" /> decide how to deal with it as the matter is far too complicated.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform raised interesting questions about the funding of Sinn Féin. I wish he would take up the party's invitation to inspect its books. While doing so, he might figure out how it could afford to employ six people full time in north Kerry for two years before the last general election as it targeted Dick Spring. None of the other political parties can afford such resources and personnel. Maybe Sinn Féin will explain where the money to employ so many people comes from because it does not show up in its books.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: I, too, welcome the clarity of the Nally report. I agree that every effort should be made to reassure the victims regarding their concerns.</P>
    <P>The United States Government should and does know who its allies were in the war on Iraq. It certainly did not include us.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Browne: Ireland got no contracts.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: Order, please.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: We raised a number of issues in debates in this House and had several transport debates. I acknowledge, along with our spokesman Senator Dooley, the great improvements in the rail timetable that was just published. The Limerick-Ennis line is reopening and when the Cahir viaduct is restored there will be a proper service on the Limerick-Waterford line for the first time in decades. Credit for this should be communicated by us to the Minister for Transport.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. P. Burke: Will the Senator be sending him a Christmas card?</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Finucane: I need the guidance of the Cathaoirleach on the Fisheries (Miscellaneous Commercial Licences)(Alteration of Duties) Order, which is to be taken without debate. Should one comment on it afterwards or now?</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: I do not know whether we can comment&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Mr. B. Hayes: The Senator is requesting a debate.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Finucane: I would like a brief debate to outline why we do not support it.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: I will allow the Leader to clarify the position.</P>
    
    <P>Ms O'Rourke: Was the matter not before the committee?</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Finucane: It was.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1999" /></P>
    <P>Ms O'Rourke: Is it correct to say that Senators Finucane, Kenneally, MacSharry and O'Meara are members of that committee?</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Finucane: Yes.</P>
    
    <P>Ms O'Rourke: Was there a vote at the committee?</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Finucane: No, because we are not allowed to vote. My party expressed its reservations regarding the licence itself and we were informed that subsequent discussions were for this platform.</P>
    
    <P>Ms O'Rourke: I thank the Senator for that clarification. I cannot whistle up a Minister now. I cannot get one just like that but I will ask the Minister to come and debate the matter. I cannot get him now. It is up to the Senator to raise this on the Order of Business.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: We cannot have a debate on the Order of Business.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Finucane: That is why I sought the guidance of the Chair. I just wanted to clarify why we opposed this increase in licences. Can I do so now?</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: No, the Senator cannot do it now.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. B. Hayes: I understand there is nothing to stop the Leader providing time for a short debate without a Minister.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: The Leader has proposed that this be taken without debate.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. B. Hayes: We are not being disorderly.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: We are not debating this today. If the Order of Business as outlined by the Leader is agreed, she may wish to change it when replying.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Finucane: I accept the Chair's advice.</P>
    <P>I am very surprised that an attack was made in the House on a person outside the House. In accordance with long-standing principles, Senator Leyden should apologise.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: Senator Finucane, that is not relevant.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Finucane: If the Senator has reservations about Roscommon Hospital, he should not shoot the messenger. He should take it up with the Minister.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: Senator Finucane, that is not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2000" /></P>
    <P>Mr. Finucane: It is in the newspapers and the Senator should apologise to the House if our code of conduct means anything at all.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Norris: Name and shame.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: That is not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Finucane: It is relevant.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: It is not relevant.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Finucane: The Senator should apologise.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: I will adjourn the House for ten minutes if I cannot get order.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. B. Hayes: We might get a Minister then.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: I do not want to do so but we want order in the House. Matters which are not relevant to the Order of Business should not be raised.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Finucane: The Senator was allowed to proceed and to develop this point last week.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: The Leas-Chathaoirleach dealt with this matter last week and Senator Finucane knows that.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Finucane: He did not deal with it. The Senator expanded his thinking on this and published a letter in a newspaper.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: The House will adjourn for ten minutes.</P>
    <P><i>Sitting suspended at 12.15 p.m. and resumed at 12.25 p.m.</i></P>
    
    <P>Mr. Mooney: The purpose of my brief contribution is to convey to the Leader&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: Contributions on the Order of Business should be brief, especially today.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Mooney: I do not wish to delay anybody's lunch. My intention is to convey to the Leader what I am sure is the overwhelming view of this House and the general public on the news of the capture of one of the greatest dictators since Hitler. Irrespective of the issues involved in the war in Iraq and earlier remarks on the Order of Business, I believe it has been a momentous week in terms of the capture of a man who, over 35 years, executed many people in Iraq.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: Is the Senator requesting a debate? </P>
    
    <P>Mr. Mooney: In the context of the capture of Saddam Hussein and the impact of the occu<Col N="2001" /> pation of Iraq, I refer again to my request some weeks ago for a debate on the role of the United Nations in Iraq and at a wider level and Ireland's role in peacekeeping. As the issue has come to centre stage again it is perhaps more relevant than ever. I ask the Leader to consider arranging a debate, on resumption of business after the recess, on the UN role in the Middle East, including Iraq, and Ireland's role in peacekeeping.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: The Senator has made his point.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Mooney: I cannot conclude without congratulating my colleague, Senator Brendan Daly, on having arranged the capture of Saddam Hussein through one of his constituents, Colonel Jim Hickey. We are delighted he has managed to achieve that miracle &ndash; well done.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Norris: I ask the Leader for a debate on the allocation of exploration licences to Shell Oil to exploit the Corrib oil fields, particularly when it appears that the taxpayer will get next to nothing for this as it has been given away. Shell is now attempting to overturn a decision of An Bord Pleanála. In the same newspaper that reported this, there are details of Shell's activities in Nigeria, where we are told it is responsible for an environmental cataclysm. Shell has been involved in a propaganda offensive, pretending it is putting in infrastructure there to help local people. These are all lies. I want to know why the resources of the Irish people have been made over to a company that has consistently behaved in a criminal fashion in Africa.</P>
    <P>I welcome the end of Saddam Hussein's dictatorship. I was a strong critic of the war, as were many other Members. However, it is indicative of President Bush's mindset that he wants Saddam Hussein executed. I imagine he wants him executed before he can tell what he knows about American involvement in the war, including Bush, his father and Mr. Rumsfeld.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: He was captured alive.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Norris: There must be a properly conducted international trial.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: We are not having a debate on this.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Norris: Arising out of an earlier discussion, there was a serious breach of this House's Standing Orders last week in which a journalist was named. We are entitled&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: Order, Senator Norris.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Norris: We are entitled to an explanation as to why that Member is allowed to continue to act in defiance&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2002" /></P>
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: Senator Norris, we are not dealing with that matter on the Order of Business.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Norris: We are entitled to an explanation as to why the Member is allowed to act in continued defiance of Standing Orders. We must press for an explanation.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: Order, Senator Norris.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Hanafin: I share Senator Ryan's concern about the possibility of a 14 year old being sent to the UK by a health board executive to have an abortion. There are two silent screams in this country, one of which is from childless couples who would gladly adopt a child of this nature. An innocent baby will be lost at 23 weeks of age. This is poignant given that it is Christmas week.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: We cannot debate the matter.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Hanafin: I am sharing Senator Ryan's concerns.</P>
    <P>I am interested in the debate on Sinn Féin expenditure because throwing more light on this will be of great help. Sinn Féin has a large number of offices throughout this country, including areas in which it has no elected representatives, such as counties Leitrim and Waterford.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: That matter would be more appropriately raised during a debate.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Hanafin: I also point out that Sinn Féin also has offices in Monaghan, Drogheda, Dundalk, Sligo, Navan, Leitrim, Waterford and Cork. In Dublin city, there are two in Parnell Square, one in Drumcondra and Cabra&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: This is not a matter for the Order of Business.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. B. Hayes: They are going into the banking business.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: Cuts, cuts and more cuts.</P>
    
    <P>Senators: Hear, hear.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: This seems to be the flag being flown by the Government.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: I ask that the Ministers for Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs make statements to the House on cutbacks in home help and carer's allowances. Elderly people are being put at risk by this Government. I ask that action be taken in the run up to Christmas.</P>
    <P>The Government must take action with the <Col N="2003" /> banks to reduce bank charges. It is important that we have a debate on the cost of banking as many people are forced to have their wages paid through the banks.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: Good man.</P>
    
    <P>Ms O'Meara: I ask the Leader to organise a debate in the new year on the issue of domestic violence. At this time of the year, we know from the media that domestic violence is a major source of upset and disturbance in many households. It is not an issue for those families alone, but for us all. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on this important issue early in the new year when the House sits again.</P>
    <P>While other Members may commend the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, on improving rail times, I remind the House that some rail lines are being completely ignored to the point of abandonment, including the Ballybrophy line.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Browne: The standardisation of the school year has been welcomed on many fronts, but there is a shortfall in terms of the Christmas holiday, particularly for primary schools as they are being forced to work until the Tuesday before Christmas. This issue should be examined. There are many teachers in this House, including the Leader of the House. It is unfair to children that they must go to school up to the Christmas period and do not get the full benefit of the holiday. The matter should be examined by the Minister for Education and Science. Valid points have been raised on this issue.</P>
    <P>In light of the comments of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform last week on a political party, which many of us suspect are correct, if he has evidence he should attend this House, outline the case and have a full audit of the political party in question. It is amazing that the political party concerned can have full-time offices in counties where they have no political representatives.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: Those details are a matter for the debate.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Browne: This should be examined to see if there is a link with the smuggling and racketeering that is currently taking place.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: That is a matter for the debate.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Browne: I ask that the Minister make a full statement in the House.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Dooley: I join my colleagues in the request for a debate on transport in the new year, particularly to discuss some of the new commuter and transport initiatives, which in some cases were started by the Leader when she had responsibility for transport. I join with Senator Mansergh in <Col N="2004" /> welcoming some of the new developments, for example, a very good commuter service between Ennis and Limerick was recently announced as a result of Senator O'Rourke's initiative and it would be a good opportunity to discuss it.</P>
    <P>I ask the Leader to pass on the compliments of the Seanad to the people who were involved in the capture of Saddam Hussein and to recognise the Clare connections in that and in particular Senator Daly's involvement.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. U. Burke: Is the Senator thinking of moving back to the constituency?</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Dooley: Does the Leader agree that allowing US war planes to land at Shannon was not, in effect, being complicit in the war, as indeed was the case with France and Germany?</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Browne: What if the Government allowed Iraqi planes to land at Shannon?</P>
    
    <P>Mr. U. Burke: Has the Senator changed his mind on the Hanly report?</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: Order please.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Ross: If I can be a calming influence on this House I will be so.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Coghlan: The father of the House.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Ross: A serious point has been raised by a large number of Senators, namely, the new situation in Iraq after the capture of Saddam Hussein. Everybody welcomes that capture and there is no doubt that a tyrant whom everybody condemns is now in prison. We should have a debate on this because we have a proud record on Iraq in this House. The Leader of the House has, very rightly, allowed free debate on this because it is an important issue, but there is another issue on which we have a proud record in this House and Senator Ryan rightly alluded to it, namely, capital punishment. I find it disgusting that the Americans should take the first opportunity of parading their approval of capital punishment around the world and that President Bush should come out and say that this man should be executed. I want the Minister for Foreign Affairs to attend this House, because there is always a deafening silence in this House when Americans execute people in their own country. The Government is too cowardly to take up the issue and make a protest. Given that we claim to have an influence in the United Nations and on America, and that we rightly allowed US aeroplanes to land at Shannon, we should in the loudest possible terms protest to the President of the United States of America for now appearing to be the arbiter of judgment and deciding that people, leaders and tyrants around the world should be executed.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: All those points are for the debate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2005" /></P>
    <P>Mr. P. Burke: I ask the Leader to arrange as soon as possible in the new session a debate on funding for the BMW region. This issue has been raised by Senator Higgins on numerous occasions. Two reports have been published, one of which is the INDECON report. Also, the Estimates demonstrate that funding for the BMW region is lagging far behind what was initially proposed.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Quinn: I ask the Leader to consider having a debate in the new session on the recent report of the Information Society Commission on the future of broadband in Ireland. I have raised this topic on many occasions in the past, as we should make progress in this area which will give us an opportunity in the information age. The Information Society Commission was established under the auspices of the Department of the Taoiseach. This report draws attention to the fact that we may have missed the boat because we have decided to leave this in the hands of the marketplace. It needs the involvement of Government.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Ryan: Hear, hear.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Quinn: I accept this might be contrary to what I have often said in the past. There is a view that we may have already missed the boat unless we move immediately. The Government can do something about this; we should not put it on the long finger.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Feighan: The deputy executive director of the German Irish Chamber of Industry and Commerce made a statement today regarding past experiences of decentralised jobs in Germany, in which he stated he could not imagine that the costs will be covered by the sale of a few Government owned offices in Dublin. While I welcome decentralisation, two and a half years ago I made inquiries about decentralisation under the Freedom of Information Act and discovered it cost three times more to decentralise an office to another town in Ireland than to leave it in the capital. When free sites were made available for decentralisation, these were not acknowledged. The gravy train is about to roll. I ask the Leader to ask the Minister to come here and outline from where the funding for decentralisation will come and, more important, what criteria will be used to ensure that spending will be kept in check.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Henry: I share the concerns of Senators Ryan and Hanafin about the 14 year old who was taken to England to have an abortion. However, I have repeatedly raised the matter of the lack of supervision of children in the care of the State. It is dreadful that this child became pregnant as a 13 year old apparently while in our care. How did this happen? Has anyone been charged? This is a really serious issue and I do not believe this is an isolated case. The children in our care are inad<Col N="2006" /> equately supervised and we need an urgent explanation as to what happened in this case.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Kitt: I join Senators in calling for a debate on transport. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, met representatives of West on Track and the Western Inter-County Railway Committee, of which Fr. MacGréil is secretary, to discuss the western rail corridor. I hope he will consider in particular the section from Galway to Tuam and Claremorris. The Leader was involved in establishing a study on that section. The stretch of road between Tuam and Galway has a worse bottleneck than any in Dublin, as confirmed by figures from the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív. I hope we will receive word on this shortly.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Ross's comments on Iraq and President Bush's call for the capital punishment of Saddam Hussein. I am amazed that President Bush who is very much pro-life &ndash; for which I applaud him &ndash; would decide on the death penalty for Saddam Hussein without any international scrutiny. I totally disagree with the comments of the US President.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Fitzgerald: I welcome the publication of the schools capital programme for the coming year by the Minister for Education and Science. Despite the considerable vocal criticism of him, this is a very impressive programme. In recent years there has been a serious attempt to look at initiatives and pilot projects which give greater value for money. The recently piloted devolved grants scheme has now been further expanded, which I very much welcome. All those who want to see greater development of the capital programme will regard the devolved scheme as an initiative that will in time prove to be great value for money. I welcome the decisions of the Minister.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Daly: I wish to express satisfaction and some relief that one of the greatest dictators in modern history has been captured. It is a cause of satisfaction to all of us that the man who was responsible for the deaths of millions of people has finally been caught. He caused chaos and disruption in Iraq for many years. I also wish to express satisfaction that Colonel James Hickey, the son of an emigrant from County Clare, played a central role in the events of last weekend.</P>
    
    <P>Ms O'Rourke: His father was from Cooraclare.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. B. Hayes: The people of Clare helped to get Saddam Hussein, but they did not get an All-Ireland this year.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Daly: The Geneva Convention and the national conventions should be taken into account in dealing with Saddam Hussein.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2007" /></P>
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: I do not like to be parochial, but I think the colonel's father emigrated from County Limerick.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Dooley: His aunt lives in Cooraclare.</P>
    
    <P>Ms O'Rourke: I think the Cathaoirleach can be allowed a small indiscretion at Christmas time.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition, Senator Brian Hayes, discussed the motion on fisheries which will be taken after the Order of Business. The Senators who are members of the joint committee from which the motion has returned have been named in the House. I understand the Senators in question attended the meeting of the committee which took place yesterday. I do not know how we can accommodate a debate on the matter. I said earlier that the Minister cannot come to the House because he is in Brussels for three days to discuss fisheries matters. The Opposition can decide to pursue the matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Brian Hayes also referred to the Nally report. He asked the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to meet the families of the victims of the Omagh bombing. He called for the Nally committee to be kept in place in case a particular person who has not given evidence decides to repent. It will be open to the person in question to give evidence if the Nally inquiry is not stood down. The Senator also called on Sinn Féin to get off the fence on this issue and to co-operate with the Garda Síochána and the Police Service of Northern Ireland rather than continuing solely to give sympathy to the families of those who died at Omagh and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole also discussed fisheries issues. He asked me to spell out the importance of Nos. 2 to 6, inclusive, on the Order of Business. I questioned the relevance of the motions because I do not like to propose motions which I do not understand. This is an old habit so I found out that the motions relate to integrating biometric identifiers, such as fingerprints and thumbprints, into a uniform format. I have been told that is what &ldquo;biometric&rdquo; means. The Senator also called for a summary of the Nally report. He agreed with Senator Brian Hayes that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should discuss the issue with the relatives of the victims of the Omagh bombing.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan also discussed the Nally report. While he accepts that there are national security concerns, he has reservations about the fact that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform seems to feel that every issue is a matter of national security. The Senator expressed his surprise at the Taoiseach's comments on Iraq over the weekend. He mentioned the case of a 14 year old girl who is alleged to have had an abortion in England at a very advanced stage of her pregnancy. She had been pregnant for 23 weeks, which is almost six months. The House will discuss for an hour this afternoon a motion on the appointment of the Ombudsman for Children, who will play a big role in respect of matters such <Col N="2008" /> as the well-being of children. I suggest to Senator Henry also that she can discuss such issues this afternoon.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan also discussed the funding of Sinn Féin. I have heard that Sinn Féin has offices in parts of the country where it does not have any Members of the Oireachtas, or even of local authorities. I know it is targeting every local authority area in next year's local elections. Sinn Féin is committed to its cause and determined to get its candidates elected. The issue of funding is a serious one, particularly if other parties cannot match Sinn Féin's funds or are not allowed to do so. Sinn Féin should give a full explanation of these matters. It is true, however, that funding can be flaithiúlach among members of other parties. Senator Ryan claimed that Sinn Féin targeted the County Kerry seat of the former Tánaiste, Dick Spring.</P>
    <P>Senator Mansergh welcomed the Nally report. He gave credit to the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, in respect of the new train timetables. We will certainly convey the Senator's opinion.</P>
    <P>Senator Finucane caused the House to be adjourned by saying that a particular Senator should apologise for certain remarks. I am aware that the Chair ruled that this matter is not in order, but I want to be truthful. I am reflecting the fact that a Senator raised the issue.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: It is not in order.</P>
    
    <P>Ms O'Rourke: Senator Mooney mentioned the role of the United Nations in the capture of Saddam Hussein and requested a debate on the matter. I have spoken to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who said that he wishes to come here as soon as possible after Christmas.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris raised the issue of the licence given to Shell Oil in respect of the Corrib oil fields. He also mentioned what he considers to be a breach of the House's Standing Orders.</P>
    <P>Senator Hanafin shares Senator Ryan's concerns about the young girl who may have had an abortion and about the financing of Sinn Féin. Senator Bannon got a great whoop when he spoke.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: Not for the first time.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. B. Hayes: Or the last.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Dardis: Did he get the whoop or give it?</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: Order, please.</P>
    
    <P>Ms O'Rourke: He gave it and he got it. Senator Bannon also discussed home help, carer's allowances and bank charges. He has a wide remit.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Meara asked for a debate on the issue of domestic violence. She contacted me about a week ago to discuss the matter. An excellent report on domestic violence has been produced by Women's Aid. I hope a debate can be arranged for the first sitting week of the new year. <Col N="2009" /> The Senator also said that while others may approve of the new rail timetable, the Ballybrophy line is being ignored.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne spoke about the standardisation of the school year, which I think is a good idea.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Browne: There are problems at primary level.</P>
    
    <P>Ms O'Rourke: I know. It is a good idea that primary and secondary schools should open and close at the same time. It makes it easier to co-ordinate school transport services, some of which are provided by mothers and fathers. Senator Browne also discussed the funding of Sinn Féin.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Dooley, who gave me credit for the initiative which led to the improvement of the rail line between Ennis and Limerick and other commuter lines. It is in the nature of things that one moves on. One rarely gets praise for what one has done, when another Minister is getting the praise.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: To which Minister is the Leader referring?</P>
    
    <P>Mr. B. Hayes: The Leader should not be so hard on herself.</P>
    
    <P>Ms O'Rourke: Senator Dooley also mentioned the Clare connection with the capture of Saddam Hussein. He discussed the decision to allow certain aeroplanes to land at Shannon.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross was correct to mention that the circumstances in Iraq have changed. We all welcome the fact that Saddam Hussein, who was a dictator, has been captured. However, I do not welcome the fact that the President of the United States said on television that he wants Saddam Hussein to be executed.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: Hear, hear.</P>
    
    <P>Ms O'Rourke: Talk about dictatorship. It does not bother me to say that it was a dreadful thing to say.</P>
    <P>Senator Paddy Burke spoke about funding for the BMW region. My colleague, Senator Dardis, has told me that representatives of the Council for the West addressed the Joint Committee on European Affairs this morning about this issue and other needs.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn called for a debate on the Information Society Commission's review of the future <Col N="2010" /> of broadband. He said that we may have missed the boat in that regard.</P>
    <P>I was not aware of the comments about the cost of decentralisation made by a representative of the German Irish Chamber of Industry and Commerce, to which Senator Feighan referred. I do not know about the remarks in question, but I am sure that decentralisation will lead to a significant economic out-turn in the regions. It will be of enormous benefit.</P>
    
    <P>Senators: Hear, hear.</P>
    
    <P>Ms O'Rourke: I have certain knowledge in this respect because Athlone has benefited from decentralisation over the past 26 years. The decentralised offices are the bedrock of economic activity in the Athlone region.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Feighan: If I might clarify what it costs&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Ms O'Rourke: Senator Henry spoke about the supervision of children in the care of the State. I suggest to the Senator, who has made her case strongly in recent weeks, that she should raise the matter this afternoon when the Minister of State with responsibility for children comes to the House to discuss the motion on the appointment of the Ombudsman for Children.</P>
    <P>Senator Kitt spoke about the western rail corridor. The Senator agreed with Senator Ross's remarks on the US President.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald welcomed the new method of capital funding, particularly the delegated finance to different schools, which is a very good idea. Senator Daly from Cooraclare should be allowed to have a little crow. I think Cooraclare is in Clare, but if the Cathaoirleach says it is in Limerick, that is where it is.</P>

    <Title>Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill 2003  [  Seanad Bill amended by the Dáil ]  : Report and Final Stages.</Title>
    <P>
      <b></b>
    </P>
    <P>Acting Chairman (Mr. Dardis): I welcome the Minister to the House for Report and Final Stages of the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill 2003.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been amended by the Dáil and, in accordance with Standing Order 103, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage. On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil. This is looked upon as a report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad. For the convenience of Senators, I have arranged for the circulation of those amendments and their grouping. The Minister will deal separately with the subject matter of each related group of amendments. I remind Senators that only the amendments made by the Dáil may be discussed.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern): Before I commence, I ask the Chair to request the Clerk, under Standing Order 121, to correct the misspelling of the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; in page 19, line 13.</P>
    
    <P>Acting Chairman: We would hate to misspell &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; and I will direct the Clerk accordingly.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. M. Ahern: Amendments Nos. 8 to 15 and 18 to 25 deal with sections 23 to 25, inclusive, 28 and new section 28. A significant number of amendments were tabled in both the Seanad and Dáil that proposed the inclusion in the Bill of significant practices and procedures regarding the manner in which a supervisory authority conducts investigations, inquiries or reviews under sections 23 to 25 respectively.</P>
    <P>Having reflected on these concerns, I considered it appropriate to bring forward a number of amendments to address these matters. The most significant of these is amendment No. 23 that provides for the insertion of a new section 28 in the Bill. As Senators will see, subsection (4) of the new section requires the supervisory authority to make regulations respecting the procedures to be followed in conducting inquiries under section 23, investigations under section 24 and reviews under section 25. Thus, there is now a statutory obligation on the supervisory authority to prepare its <i>modus operandi</i> for conducting inquiries, investigations or reviews under these sections.</P>
    <P>Moreover, subsection (2) of the new section 28 provides that a witness before the authority is entitled to the same immunities and privileges as a witness before the High Court. In addition, subsection (3) of new section 28 protects persons against having to disclose any information that the person would be entitled to refuse to produce on the grounds of legal professional privilege. It also prevents the authority inspecting or copying any document containing such information.</P>
    <P>The second most important aspect in these amendments relates to the interaction between sections 23 and 24. In essence, under the Dáil amendments the supervisory authority cannot initiate an inquiry under section 23 where it has already undertaken an investigation into the same matter under section 24 or <i>vice versa.</i> The one exception to this is where the authority considers it needs to change from a section 23 inquiry to a section 24 investigation and gets court approval to proceed in this manner. This is designed to prevent a member of a prescribed accountancy body being involved in an examination and on hazard of being subjected to sanctions under two separate statutory provisions on inquiries to the same set of facts.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 25 is another important change in this group of amendments. This provides that the right of the supervisory authority to annul a decision or direct the holding of a fresh investigation is subject to the approval of the court.</P>
    <P>The remainder of the amendments in this grouping are related to or consequential on the more significant changes I have outlined.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McDowell: These are important amendments and the sections in question are important in terms of the investigation and inquiry powers the Bill confers. Perhaps the Minister can help clarify some aspects of this for me. Following the procedure the Minister has described, what happens to an inquiry under section 23 that is broken off when an investigation under section 24 is commenced? Does the inquiry continue, is it suspended, or is it deemed to be completed? I agree that the important point is that someone should not be at risk of being judged, or even penalised, twice. Apart from anything else, this would not be an administratively sensible way of doing things.</P>
    <P>The important thing is that the power of the supervisory authority to investigate members, as opposed to accountancy bodies, should only be used as a power of last resort. No one wants the IAASA to be a port of first call where members of the public with a complaint against an individual accountant go to the supervisory body first. There is common cause in this and we want clients who have a problem with accountants to go, in the first instance, to the accountancy bodies and the supervisory authority will only conduct an investigation in circumstances where there is some inference that the accountancy body itself has not done so properly. This clear principle should be set out in the Bill. Unfortunately the amendments have been presented in a technical way and while I get the gist of them, I am not entirely sure we have achieved this principle. Perhaps the Minister can offer me reassurance on this.</P>
    <P>In new section 28, is the power regarding oral hearings a new power or is it one that already existed? It seems a new power, but I could be wrong. If it is a new power, perhaps the Minister will clarify why he felt it necessary to introduce it.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Coghlan: Arising from our previous debates on this matter, the Minister will be aware that my concerns are slightly different. There is still no statutory protection for the term &ldquo;accountant&rdquo; and who can practice as an accountant. Has this matter still not been addressed?</P>
    
    <P>Mr. M. Ahern: As regards amendment No. 10, when it moves from a section 23 inquiry to a section 24 investigation, the section 23 inquiry dies.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McDowell: Can it be resumed if it stops?</P>
    
    <P>Mr. M. Ahern: No. Senator McDowell also referred to amendment No. 23 which establishes the new section 28. Under this section, the supervisory authority shall make regulations respecting the procedures to be followed in conducting inquiries under section 23 investigations under sections 22 and 25. The supervisory authority shall make the regulations regarding inquiries, investigations and procedures.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan asked about the term &ldquo;accountant&rdquo;. I stated in both Houses that this issue would benefit from further consideration and research &ndash; I have had great interest in it for many years. We had a discussion with the interim Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority and asked it to examine the issue before we introduced the Bill to see if it could decide on terminology that would fit into the legal system. It felt it would be more appropriate for the new authority, when set up statutorily, to review the question of getting legal protection for the term &ldquo;accountant&rdquo;. We will ask the authority to examine this expeditiously once it is established.</P>
    
    <P>Acting Chairman: Amendments Nos. 58 to 65, inclusive, relate to the compliance statement, as alluded to in section 43.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. M. Ahern: Amendments Nos. 58 to 65, inclusive, deal with the directors' compliance statements. Section 43, as amended, contains three key changes to the Bill as passed by this House. The first is the introduction in the new subsection (9) of an exemption from the section for private companies limited by shares whose balance sheet and turnover totals are not greater than &euro;7,618,428 and &euro;15,236,856, respectively. This means that companies operating at levels under those financial thresholds are not required to provide a directors' compliance statement. However, I hope that companies not legally bound by these obligations would, as a matter of prudence, put in place the type of procedures alluded to in the section. While the provisions are not mandatory at present, a time might come when they will be. In this regard, the facility for me to vary the thresholds is contained in the equivalent of section 46 of the Bill as passed by the Seanad. I intend to monitor how this provision operates in practice. Specifically as a consequence of this change, the link in the original section between exemption from the requirement to prepare a directors' compliance statement and eligibility for audit exemption is removed.</P>
    <P>The second core amendment for those companies which will be subject to this section is that one of the aspects of the directors' compliance statement has been deleted. I refer to my decision to omit the requirement for an opinion to be given by the director that his company &ndash; minor incidences apart &ndash; complied with its relevant obligations in the financial year to which the statement relates. I regard the removal of this requirement as a major concession.</P>
    <P>The third significant change is that companies not trading for profit, for example, management companies for blocks of apartments and companies used by the voluntary sector, usually constituted as guaranteed companies, as well as unlimited companies, have been removed from the scope of this section by virtue of the wording of subsection (2).</P>
    <P>As a result of the substantive changes that were made, some consequential technical-type amendments were necessary in the two new sections, sections 205E and 205F, which are being inserted by the original section 43 into the Companies Act 1990. These changes remove the difficulties that Senators, Deputies and outside interested parties who made submissions raised regarding this provision.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Leyden: I thank the Minister of State for his openness in accepting these amendments and for listening to the recommendations of various Senators, Deputies and interested parties.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Coghlan: The Minister of State could not accept amendments from this House on the question of the compliance statement but I thank him for the amendments made in the other House, which allow for a raising of the limits to &euro;7,618,428 and &euro;15,236,856. This is to be welcomed.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McDowell: I did not have the opportunity to examine the transcript of the debate in the other House so I am not clear from where the new limits have come. They seem extraordinarily high.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. M. Ahern: They are based on the annual return filings by companies to the Companies Registration Office.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McDowell: Nonetheless, they seem extraordinarily high and will have the effect of exempting a considerable number of private companies limited by shares from the requirements of the compliance statement. However, I understand the pressures that existed to do something about the thresholds, even though the Minister of State has pitched them higher than he might have done.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has also changed the section substantially by removing the requirement on the part of directors to sign a compliance statement, which comprised the teeth of the section. I realise he has left the bulk of the process in place and that the directors have a responsibility to ensure there are financial procedures in place within a company to ensure compliance with the various tax enactments, etc. However, he has removed the requirement on the director to sign a compliance statement stating he is satisfied the job has been done.</P>
    <P>I hope we have not effectively removed the teeth from the section. A major concession has been made, as the Minister of State put it. We should keep a very close eye on this area because it may well be that directors will be happy to say they are satisfied that procedures are fine if they do not have to put their necks on the block by saying they are satisfied those procedures have been complied with. I hope the Minister of State has not gone too far in listening to Deputies, Senators and outside groups.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. M. Ahern: I mentioned that we would be monitoring how the procedures are operating. Directors cannot be auditors and audit every little tittle-tattle that happens in their companies. However, they have responsibilities under company law and we now require them to ensure procedures are put in place. This is logical. It is not logical to expect a director to say every aspect of company law, tax law or environmental law is being complied with &ndash; this is up to the management of the company. My view is that it is the directors' responsibility to make sure procedures are in place that ensure these legal aspects are being monitored.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McDowell: That was not the Minister of State's view the last time we discussed these matters.</P>
    
    <P>Acting Chairman: Amendment No. 52 concerns the audit committee.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. M. Ahern: Section 40 was a subject of considerable debate in both Houses or the Oireachtas, on the basis of which I introduced a number of refinements in the Dáil beyond those I had already made in this House. They are designed to take account of suggestions for improvements which I trust will make the provision workable in practice. The broad areas of change concern the scope of the remit of the audit committee, amended requirements applicable to all relevant categories of companies and relevant undertakings and the revised criteria for public limited companies and refined requirements for large private companies in relevant undertakings.</P>
    <P>It has now been clearly provided for in paragraphs (<i>a</i>)(ii) and (<i>c</i>) that the audit committee's remit will encompass group accounts. The committee will now also be required to review the directors' compliance statement in its entirety. Of general relevance to commercial entities required to establish an audit committee is a relaxation, under the new subsection (7), in the length of time for which an employee needs to have left the employment of a company or its subsidiaries to qualify for appointment as a non-executive director and, <i>ipso facto,</i> be available to be appointed as a member of an audit committee. The period has decreased from five years to three years and this will make it easier for companies to find non-executive directors.</P>
    <P>Subsection (8) of the amended text provides, by way of exemption from the earlier requirements of the section as applicable to public limited companies, that only one director needs to quality under the criteria in the new subsection (7), provided he is appointed as the only member of an audit committee or as the chairman of a committee consisting of not more than two persons, including himself, and has the casting vote.</P>
    <P>Where the board of directors of a public limited company to which these provisions are applicable does not establish an audit committee in conformity with this section, each director to whom this failure is attributable is guilty of an offence under the new subsection (12).</P>
    <P>Under the new subsection (3), the boards of directors of large private companies and relevant undertakings can, subject to satisfying the other applicable requirements, establish an audit committee with only some of the responsibilities listed for audit committees under subsection (2). This is a significant concession because these entities are being allowed discretion as to which of the responsibilities they will direct their audit committee to take on and where they decide to establish one. In their report, under section 158 of the principal Act, such concerns will be required to state whether they have established an audit committee or decided not to, and whether they have assumed some or the full list of responsibilities under subsection (2).</P>
    <P>The director of a large private company or a relevant undertaking is guilty under the new subsection (13) when he or she fails to take all reasonable steps to comply with the requirements of subsection (4). These requirements, in summary, are to state in the section 158 report whether they have established an audit committee, or not, and the reasons or to indicate where they have not taken on all their responsibilities under subsection (2). The offence resides in the failure to make the due notification under subsection (4).</P>
    <P>I repeat that the requirement to establish an audit committee is not mandatory on any private company. The new subsection (16)(<i>a</i>) exempts a public limited company, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of another public limited company, from having to establish an audit committee. There are a number of other technical consequential amendments throughout the section arising from the more substantive amendments I have described. The section as amended accommodates the concerns expressed by various interests.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Coghlan: I accept the amendment meets the wishes of the various interests which were consulted and I support the Minister.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McDowell: I am not sure I understand the thinking behind the amendment. The audit committee can be responsible for a huge number of functions and subsection (2) is exhaustive. When the Minister of State says he will allow the audit committees of certain companies to opt out of certain powers, what is the thinking behind that move? Those powers and functions are listed in some length in subsection (2). Of which does the Minister of State expect companies to choose to opt out?</P>
    
    <P>Mr. M. Ahern: As I said, the requirement to establish an audit committee is not mandatory on any private company. Under subsection (6) a director of a large private company or a relevant undertaking is guilty under the new subsection (13) of an offence where he or she fails to take all reasonable steps to comply with requirements under subsection (4). Again, these requirements are stated in the section 158 report &ndash; whether they have established an audit committee or decided not to do so, taking on either full or partial responsibilities. They are not required to do this but if they do not set out in a section 158 report why they have not done so, they can be charged with an offence. They do not have to set up an audit committee unless a public limited company is involved.</P>
    
    <P>Acting Chairman (Dr. Henry): Group 4 relates to the audit exemption threshold, decoupled from the directors' compliance statement increases. This is a new section 53 arising from amendment No. 82.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. M. Ahern: There are two substantive aspects to amendment No. 82. The first is to increase the turnover exemption threshold below which companies are eligible to dispense with having their accounts audited from approximately &euro;317,000 to &euro;1,500,000. This is a substantial increase in the operative threshold and is likely to allow a significant number of companies to avail of the exemption.</P>
    <P>The second substantive amendment is to delete the current section 32(3)(<i>b</i>) of the Companies (Amendment) (No 2) Act 1999 and to insert a new section 32A. The requirement here is that companies can only avail of the audit exemption if they file their returns in the Companies Registration Office on time in the year in question as well as for the previous year where applicable. The focus on this amendment arose from the fact that the exemption from the directors' compliance statement was linked to the audit exemption threshold. It was argued in both Houses and outside that this limit should be increased and that is what the amendment does. Having given this matter very careful consideration, I am firmly of the view that the revised limit which I have struck is the appropriate level of exemption. As I said, this threshold will continue to be monitored.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Coghlan: I acknowledge that the Minister of State gave a commitment here which he honoured in the other House. However, if I have a disappointment it is with this part of the Bill. The EU would allow a threshold of &euro;7.3 million while Britain has gone from a £1 million turnover to £5.6 million. The Netherlands limit is &euro;7 million and the German threshold is &euro;6.8 million. If we are encouraging increased cross-Border trade on the basis of an all-island economy, that figure is still too low. I accept the Minister of State has moved in the right direction but it is rather meagre. The Minister of State, given his accountancy background, would accept that I and many people, particularly in the Border counties, feel the figure is low.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McDowell: This is one of those amendments which was waiting to happen in the sense that when the Bill was first discussed here we anticipated that an amendment would be made. I have never quite understood why the comparison is made with Northern Ireland or why people thought there was necessarily a knock-on effect. It does not seem to me that clear that there are direct implications or that people would simply incorporate or do business elsewhere because there was an auditing requirement. I never found that argument particularly persuasive but it was clear the Minister of State would accept it and if I was him I would probably have done so also. The new limits he has struck, which are intended to conform to the Northern Ireland limits, are probably the best way to pitch it.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. M. Ahern: They would not conform to the Northern Ireland limits. They are the same as the British limit, which has gone to approximately £5.6 million. The accountancy bodies in Britain did not favour that move, as they only wanted the limit to go to £1.5 million or £2 million, but the limit was raised to £5.5 million anyway. Senator Coghlan expressed the fear that companies would incorporate in Northern Ireland, although whether that is practical is another question. Raising the threshold to &euro;1.5 million in turnover will take approximately 100,000 of 122,000 companies out of the audit field. I was talking to former colleagues of mine in the accountancy profession who feel that many companies will still get audits done, but they will not be required by law to do so. They will still have to make annual returns in time and have their accounts done. This will not be earth-shattering.</P>
    
    <P>Acting Chairman: Group 5 relates to section 35 and prescribed bodies not requiring recognised-prescribed bodies to apply to the High Court. It is the subject matter of amendments Nos. 40 and 41.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. M. Ahern: Amendments Nos. 40 and 41 delete subsections (6) to (10), inclusive, (13) and (14) of section 35. The amendments remove the legal underpinning of sanctions arising from the disciplinary approach of prescribed accountancy bodies and the requirement to have them ratified by the High Court. This is in line with the express wish of some of the accountancy bodies which indicated that these could impose delays, increase costs and otherwise undermine the basis on which the bodies impose sanctions on their members.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McDowell: I presume the Minister of State is satisfied this stands up legally because it strikes me as something that could be a cause of concern. I agree the procedure is probably a fair one but this seems as if it could be subject to some legal challenge.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. M. Ahern: The advice we got was that the accountancy bodies gave us to understand that they had Supreme Court support for their procedures.</P>
    
    <P>Acting Chairman: Group 6 relates to new section 36, the subject matter of amendment No. 42.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. M. Ahern: Amendment No. 42 inserts a new section into the present Bill which amends section 194 of the Act of 1990. It is designed to enable the Director of Corporate Enforcement to seek and obtain information from auditors in respect of indictable offences reported to his office under the said section 194. It will also permit the director to access books, which is not covered by the existing text of section 194.</P>
    <P>The inclusion at paragraph (<i>d</i>) is designed to relieve auditors of the obligation to notify the Director of Corporate Enforcement in respect of offences relating to sections 125 and 127 of the Companies Act 1963, which relate to the filing of annual returns, on the basis that these offences are already apparent from the public record in the Companies Registration Office.</P>
    <P>The new subsection (5B) is designed to protect disclosure of documents which already have the protection of legal professional privilege.</P>
    
    <P>Acting Chairman: Group 7 relates to new section 50, the subject matter of amendment No. 81.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. M. Ahern: The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement was established under the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001. That office assumed responsibility for the enforcement of the Companies Acts which was previously the responsibility of the Minister and his officers.</P>
    <P>In the limited time the office has been in operation, a number of technical difficulties have arisen concerning the manner in which the office is able to bring information before the courts. Amendment No. 81 is designed to ease the way in which such information can be certified and submitted to the courts. It is then up to the court to determine what weight and value it wishes to attribute to any of the information or documents submitted. The provisions are based on precedent found in competition and taxation law.</P>
    <P>Similar facilities are included in the section for the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Minister and his officers, inspectors appointed under the Companies Acts and the Companies Registration Office.</P>
    
    <P>Acting Chairman: Group 8 is the subject matter of amendment No. 83.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. M. Ahern: Amendment No. 83 inserts a new section 52 into the Bill. Essentially, it inserts a new subsection (16) into section 43 of the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1999 to provide that an alternate director is not acceptable for the purposes of this section as fulfilling the requirement of that section of the 1999 No. 2 Act to have a director resident in the State.</P>
    <P>Senators may remember that section 43 was one of a number of provisions contained in the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1999 to address problems created by non-resident persons using the State as a convenient companies registration point, and essentially tarnishing the reputation of the State abroad by engaging in undesirable practices in other jurisdictions.</P>
    
    <P>Acting Chairman: Group 9 relates to new section 53, the subject matter of amendment No. 84.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. M. Ahern: Section 13 of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1982 at present allows the Minister to make regulations disapplying the restriction in section 376 of the Companies Act 1963 on the formation of partnerships containing more than 20 persons.</P>
    <P>To facilitate venture capital partnerships it is proposed to make such a regulation. However, it is considered appropriate that the exemption should apply to existing as well as new partnerships formed after the regulations are made. Accordingly, amendment No. 84, which inserts a new section 53 into the Bill, amends subsection 13(2) in the 1982 Act to enable this to be done.</P>
    
    <P>Acting Chairman: Group 10 relates to new section 54, the subject matter of amendment No. 85.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. M. Ahern: Amendment No. 85 adds four new subsections to section 200 of the Companies Act 1963. The essence of the amendment is to ensure that companies can take out directors and officers' liability insurance. There is doubt as to whether companies can actually take out such insurance under the terms of existing section 200. These amendments serve to remove that doubt and provide certainty for any existing cover.</P>
    
    <P>Acting Chairman: Group 11 relates to new section 55 and Schedule 2, the subject matter of amendments Nos. 86 and 88.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. M. Ahern: Amendments Nos. 86 and 88 provide by way of the detail in Schedule 2 for removing doubts which have arisen as to ability of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement to prosecute criminal offences under the Companies Acts in respect of all the sections specified in the Schedule.</P>
    <P>At its simplest, the absence of the words &ldquo;shall be guilty of an offence&rdquo;, or similar words in other sections, has raised the spectre of an arguable case being made that the sections in question are not capable of being prosecuted in an appropriate manner. The various defaults set out in the sections in the schedule are being corrected and will thus be capable of allowing criminal prosecution to be pursued by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</P>
    
    <P>Acting Chairman: Group 12 relates to section 31, the IIPA, the subject matter of amendments Nos. 27 to 31, inclusive.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. M. Ahern: Amendments Nos. 29 and 30 relate to the deletion of subsections (3) to (5) and their replacement by new subsections (3) to (9) of the section. The amendment arises primarily because of the necessity to include a provision dealing with a recognition related application of the Institute of Incorporated Public Accountants to be made before the section is commenced. It sets out various scenarios and eventualities with regard to an application by the Institute of Incorporated Public Accountants for recognition. I confirm that I have received an application which I have referred to the board of the interim IAASA body for advice. This advice is still awaited.</P>
    <P>The provision provides that a member of the Institute of Incorporated Public Accountants at the time of the making of the institute's application is deemed to continue to hold recognition until the commencement of the section or the date of the decision on the application for recognition by the IIPA, whichever is later. If the application is refused, the members of the Institute of Incorporated Public Accountants are considered to hold recognition for a further three year period, mirroring the situation for individually recognised auditors provided for in section 34.</P>
    
    <P>Acting Chairman: Group 13 relates to section 36, not the ODCE, the subject matter of amendment No. 47.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. M. Ahern: Amendment No. 47 involves the deletion of subsections (5) to (9), inclusive, of section 36 as passed by this House. These subsections provided for the application by the Director of Corporate Enforcement to the courts to have members of recognised accountancy bodies removed from the register of auditors. The submissions from the accountancy bodies argued that it is a function of the bodies themselves to remove a member from acting as auditor. This will now be subject to oversight by the supervisory authority being established by the present Bill. However, the Director of Corporate Enforcement will still have the power, in section 160 of the Companies Act 1990, to seek the disqualification of a person from acting, <i>inter alia,</i> as an auditor.</P>
    
    <P>Acting Chairman: Group 14 comprises technical and drafting amendments. They include amendments Nos. 1 to 7, inclusive, amendments Nos. 16, 17 and 26, amendments Nos. 32 to 39, inclusive, amendments Nos. 43 to 46, inclusive, amendments Nos. 48 to 51, inclusive, amendments Nos. 53 to 57, inclusive, amendments Nos. 66 to 80, inclusive, and amendments Nos. 87 and 89.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. M. Ahern: This miscellaneous grouping consists of primarily technical and drafting amendments which, by and large, are routine. I will now refer to some of the more significant of these.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 48 to 50, inclusive, provide for the inclusion of group as well as annual accounts in the requirements of the sections in question. These amendments, while technical in nature, are important in terms of effect.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 39, by the addition of the words &ldquo;ancillary or consequential&rdquo;, makes clear that the court order in the situations in question must flow from the subject matter before it for determination. If the formulations in question were not included, the court could, in theory, impose punitive sanctions which could be open to legal challenge. The amendment, therefore, sets out the parameters of the court's determination.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 87 makes certain amendments to the Companies Act 1990. For example, it substitutes the &ldquo;Supervisory Authority&rdquo; for &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; which is required to facilitate the transfer of regulatory function over accountancy bodies from the Minister to the authority.</P>
    <P>If Senators require further information on amendments I can provide it now.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Coghlan: I compliment the Minister of State on what he has done, particularly in honouring his word to us on Committee Stage in terms of amendments to the Bill in the other House. From my discussions with colleagues in the other House and having read the debates there, I am satisfied the matter was handled very well in both Houses. If I have any criticism, it is perhaps that the Minister of State was too generous with regard to the threshold for the compliance statement, as Senator McDowell has already pointed out and, dare I say, not generous enough on the audit exemption threshold.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is well aware of my views on small companies and business generally. The low audit exemption threshold could hamper business in Ireland and place us at a competitive disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> Northern Ireland in particular. I had the Border counties very much in mind. The Minister of State referred to the danger of certain businesses being set up and incorporated in the North.</P>
    <P>That said, however, I welcome everything that has been done in connection with this Bill. I thank the Minister of State and his officials for the work they have put into the Bill. It has been a mammoth undertaking and I salute all concerned on a task well performed.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McDowell: I wish to be associated with Senator Coghlan's comments. On the face of it, this could be regarded as a very dry Bill, although it has greatly exercised the professional bodies it directly affects. I have no doubt it has taken up a great deal of time on the part of the Minister of State and his officials. This is a Bill of some importance and topicality, having regard to our experience in recent years when processes and standards of some very large companies have not met our requirements. It is timely to put into legislation the requirements now applicable to companies and their auditors. One hopes this will be just another part of the process of changing the culture of corporate compliance in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister of State and his officials on their work. Perhaps, in his response, he will give some indication as to when he anticipates having the supervisory bodies up and running on an interim basis and when he envisages the various actions and powers provided for in the Bill being activated.</P>
    
    <P>Ms White: I thank the Minister of State and his officials, who are specialists in this area of business. I compliment the Minister of State on the speed and efficiency with which he has handled this important Bill. In that process, in addition to his departmental brief on trade and commerce, he also speaks from practical experience as an accountant and businessman. His empathy with that area has been evident in his handling of this and previous Bills which he has brought before the House.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Leyden: I extend my sincere thanks and congratulations to the Minister of State and his officials on their successful handling of the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill 2003. It is a big achievement for any Department to bring a detailed Bill through the Oireachtas so expeditiously. The Minister of State has been very open in his response to representations from Members of both Houses and outside parties. All concerned will be very happy with this Bill. That is evident from the absence of further representations in recent weeks, by comparison to the volume of such representations following the Bill's initial publication. Again, I compliment the Minister of State and his officials and wish them a very happy Christmas and a successful new year.</P>
    
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern): I thank Senators for their contributions on the various Stages of this Bill. Many of the points raised in debate were followed through, including some relatively minor changes advocated on Committee Stage in this House. However, it was during the passage of the Bill through the Dáil that we brought forward many of the amendments which had been tabled initially in the Seanad but not adopted here. The Seanad provides an opportunity for debate at a different level and in a less heated environment than in the Lower House. That is a very positive feature.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators Coghlan and McDowell for their participation in this debate and their welcome comments on the amendments. On the implementation of the Bill, there have been some discussions with the interim IAASA about setting up the statutory body and further discussions are required. The implementation of the Bill will be staggered over a period of time. It is hoped to move it forward early in the new year, but I do not have any definite date at present.</P>
    <P>I thank my officials for their excellent work and the time they have given to this Bill over the past few years. Such matters do not materialise overnight, as Senators will be well aware. A great deal of work has been involved in bringing the Bill forward, during which officials have been exemplary in their work ethic and advice, on which I compliment them. I also thank the Seanad staff for their help and advice.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish all present a very holy and peaceful Christmas and a prosperous and happy new year.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Title>Appointment of Ombudsman for Children: Motion.</Title>
    <P>
      <b></b>
    </P>
    <P>Ms O'Rourke: I move:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann recommends Ms Emily Logan for appointment by the President to be the Ombudsman for Children.</P>
    
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan): I welcome that Seanad Éireann is having a debate on this matter and I seek its support for the resolution to appoint Ms Emily Logan as Ombudsman for Children.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman for Children will have a dual role. First, she will deal with complaints against public bodies, including schools and hospitals, by or on behalf of children and young persons. Second, the Ombudsman for Children will promote the rights and welfare of children and young persons. It is a key post in the national children strategy, particularly in giving children a voice. All Members will know how important that is in ensuring children's viewpoints are understood and factored into policy decisions.</P>
    <P>We had an innovative and exciting selection process which involved children and young persons in drafting the person specification, in drawing up the advertisement and in the selection process for the position. It was rewarding for all involved. I thank the Civil Service Commission which managed the process, ensuring that the best recruitment practice was followed and meeting the challenge in developing a new approach to recruitment with enthusiasm and efficiency. The Civil Service Commission was ably assisted in participation and consultation by children through the National Children's Office. I thank the 70 children and young persons who gave their time, including a number of weekends, in helping with the selection process. Everyone was struck by their objectivity and enthusiasm as their contributions exceeded all expectations and they should be proud of their work's outcome.</P>
    <P>The importance of coming before the Oireachtas with this nomination is that we must strive in obtaining a consensus between all parties in an appointment of this type. It is also important as this is the first appointment to this position. Of course, the ultimate decision has to be made by the Government. As a result of the proceedings of the Civil Service Commission, three candidates were identified and submitted for the Government's decision. The Government takes responsibility as the majority controlling interest in the Houses to make this determination. I thank the other party leaders with whom I discussed this matter for giving it such a fair wind in the Lower House.</P>
    <P>That the Ombudsman for Children will be appointed by the President further emphasises the independence of the office and its significance. Ms Emily Logan can and will make a difference through advising on the development of children's policies and encouraging public bodies to develop policies, practices and procedures to promote the interests of children. The Ombudsman for Children will also promote public awareness of the rights of children and monitor and review legislation affecting children, consulting with them regularly.</P>
    <P>I recommend the motion to the House.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Feighan: I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to the House, as he is always refreshing in debate here.</P>
    <P>I welcome the appointment of an Ombudsman for Children. Today of all days, with the conviction of Ian Huntley, Members realise its importance. We all heard the shocking news that Ian Huntley was previously accused of indecently assaulting 11 year old girls and having sex with a number of underage schoolgirls. It was frustrating for the police searching for Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman that they only found this out when they were telephoned by members of the public and discovered ten previous allegations against him. The appointment of an Ombudsman for Children is welcome news because it makes us more vigilant against these awful occurrences.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 contains the procedures for appointment and terms of office. Has the staffing of the office been worked out yet? Also, the report of the UN committee on the rights of the child pointed out there was no mechanism in this State to vindicate children's rights and no way in which children could raise problems and complaints.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the ombudsman will have the power to comment on the need for administrative or statutory reform, which encompasses all matters regarding children and their welfare. We should welcome the fact that it will be an independent office responsible to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It was Fionnuala Kilfeather, the chief executive of the National Parents Council, who said that when things go wrong for children in school it can take months or even years for their rights to be addressed. The ombudsman will be an advocate for the child. Each week we hear new details of schools that are dilapidated, unheated or otherwise in urgent need of repair or reconstruction. The Ombudsman for Children will be able to intervene on behalf of children when their rights, including their educational rights, are ignored or violated.</P>
    <P>Passage of the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 was warmly welcomed by the alliance last year and was hailed as a major step in the effort to promote and protect the rights of children. Ms Logan is a very appropriate appointment as she was previously director of Our Lady's Hospital for children in Crumlin, and was directorate manager at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London. She also holds an MBA in health management and an MSc in psychology. I wish Ms Logan well in the office she is due to take up very soon, which unfortunately took a decade of campaigning by children's lobby groups to establish. The first commitment to establish an ombudsman came from the Minister with responsibility for children in the rainbow coalition, Mr. Austin Curry, in 1996. Sometimes we should congratulate ourselves, but in this case it took too long to appoint an ombudsman.</P>
    <P>Parents and others who have a legitimate interest in children can make complaints. Where a complaint is made by someone other than a parent, the parent must be told. Thankfully, there are provisions to rule out frivolous complaints.</P>
    <P>The Minister allocated &euro;282,000 in the Estimates. If there is to be extra recruitment of staff, will that be possible within such a budget?</P>
    <P>Seven years after it was first promised and more than a year after it was passed into law, it is good to see the Office of the Ombudsman being established and I, on behalf of Fine Gael, welcome it.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Glynn: Fáiltím an Aire chuig an Teach. This is a very historic day. I welcome the announcement that Ms Emily Logan has been nominated by the Government to be appointed by the President as the first Ombudsman for Children. As has already been said, Ms Logan is eminently qualified for this job and I am sure she will bring a great deal of commitment and enthusiasm to it. It is well worth noting, as was outlined by my colleague on the other side of the House, Senator Feighan, that her background of employment indicates very strongly that she is well placed and well qualified for this position.</P>
    <P>Some people have complained that it has taken too long to nominate the Ombudsman for Children. We should note that this is a very important decision and such decisions should not be rushed as one has to get it right. If one rushes the decision many important people will be excluded from the decision-making process. However, this is not the way the matter was handled and I believe that was correct.</P>
    <P>This is an extremely important position and it is essential that the right person was chosen. In order to choose the appropriate person it was essential that we included experts in the decision-making process. This is why children and young people were included in all aspects of the process, as has been stated by the Minister. Young people and children are very discerning and quick to spot the inadequacies and deficiencies in people's personalities. It does not take them long to separate the wheat from the chaff in determining whether a person is good or bad. They put much time and effort into the recruitment of Ms Logan and I pay tribute to them for this.</P>
    <P>We did not procrastinate on this, we are not indulging in policy procrastination, but this Government has put words into action. The establishment of the Ombudsman for Children demonstrates this Government's dedication to implementing the rights of children. The establishment of an independent Office of the Ombudsman for Children was among commitments made in the national children's strategy 2000, just over three years ago.</P>
    <P>Without doubt there is a need for an independent person to act as a powerful advocate for children. The ombudsman's role will benefit all children and young people, investigating complaints about schools, hospitals, and Government agencies, as well as promoting all children's rights.</P>
    <P>In this Chamber on a number of occasions I have raised the matter of bullying. The newspapers recently reported an incident which was not good to read. With the advent of this very important position young children, if they see fit, will be able to make a complaint of their own volition and have it investigated, which is very important. A young lady at the tender age of 13 or 14 committed suicide in Mullingar because of bullying. I do not like to stand here in the full glare of publicity stating that, but regrettably it happens to be true.</P>
    <P>In promoting the rights and welfare of children the Ombudsman for Children can, among other things, provide advice to the Government, encourage the development of policies, practices and procedures to promote children's rights and welfare, highlight issues that are of concern to children and monitor and review the operation of legislation in so far as it refers to children. The ombudsman will set up structures to consult with children, ensuring that their views are taken into account when policies and legislation are being considered. That speaks volumes about the commitment of this Government and the importance all sides of the House attach to this issue.</P>
    <P>With regard to examining and investigating complaints, the remit of the Ombudsman for Children extends to public bodies, schools and voluntary hospitals. Complaints can be made by a child, a parent of the child or a person who has either a personal or professional relationship to the child concerned and is considered a suitable person by the Ombudsman for Children. This is a very wide remit whereby the welfare and safety of children can be protected. The ombudsman is the person who will implement the appropriate policies and ensure they are pursued in the interests of the protection of children.</P>
    <P>The introduction of an Ombudsman for Children is a further step along the road to providing our children with quality services and letting their voice be heard. Since 1997 the Government has provided over &euro;178 million in additional funding invested through the health boards in the development of child welfare and protection services. I identify fully with the concerns of Senator Henry on the matter she raised, but I am a former member and chairman of that health board and advise her to have a second look at the situation, although I know it is in hand. It is <i>sub judice</i> which precludes me from saying much about it, but I am concerned as is Senator Henry. The funding includes an additional &euro;8 million for 2003. This funding has provided for a wide range of developments, including family support projects, preventative services and intensive community based services.</P>
    <P>Some &euro;282,000 was provided in budget 2004 for the establishment of the Office of the Ombudsman for Children. Accommodation for the office has been secured in the city centre. In response to Senator Feighan's question about staff, approval has been given for seven staff members to be assigned to the office on a phased basis. The Department of Health and Children will work closely with the new Ombudsman for Children to select the appropriate staff. The Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, whom I welcome, will sign off on the remaining sections in early 2004.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman for Children will affect the operation of a myriad of institutions by providing an opportunity to seek redress by, or for, a child without having recourse to adults or professionals in the first instance. It is not possible to have more autonomy. We need to ensure that when a child complains an examination can be started quickly without becoming entangled in an ever-increasing web, which could confuse and alienate our children from public institutions.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman for Children is intended to be an independent and easily reached mediator. One of the roles will be purely to investigate and report. The importance lies in the power to investigate the actions of those affecting children and to report on these to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>To our children, this ombudsman will be an important advocate for them, providing informality and accessibility in resolving the issues they consider important. The Ombudsman for Children shall be appointed by the President on the resolution of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann. I am glad to be a Member of this House today and to support this development. The acceptability of the Ombudsman for Children will be enhanced by the fact that the holder is acceptable to all sides of both Houses.</P>
    <P>The independence of the Office of the Ombudsman for Children is vital as our children must see that this is an independent authority. I welcome the six year term of office, which can be renewed once. The Ombudsman for Children may undertake an investigation on his or her initiative, which is to be commended. I strongly support the motion before us and commend the Government. I appreciate the support that no doubt will be forthcoming from all sides of the House.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Henry: I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I very much welcome the appointment of Ms Emily Logan, who is an inspired choice. Those who have worked with her and know her say she will be absolutely splendid. She will certainly have her hands full as we live in a very wicked world considering what is happening to children.</P>
    <P>Senator Feighan mentioned the gruesome case in England in which two ten year old girls were murdered by a man of 28. It is shocking to find that there were streams of accusations of child abuse against him. Apparently it was well known that at the age of 23 he had fathered a child with a 15 year old. This went on and on.</P>
    
    <P>Ms O'Rourke: He went through school after school.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Henry: We seem to be little better at screening those involved in child care now than was the case when the incidents, which are being revealed at the Laffoy commission, happened. We say we did not realise what happened then. However, we were putting children into the care of institutions then and we know they were abused. Unfortunately, the same thing appears to be happening now. I am sympathetic to health boards that are having trouble recruiting staff to work with children, especially difficult children. However, we must make a better attempt than what is happening now. This case in England happened in an open school where the children were of an age at which one would think it was safe to leave them out and about. They were not very small children who would not have complained about what was happening to them.</P>
    <P>Senator Glynn alluded to the case that Senator Ryan and Senator Hanafin raised on the Order of Business this morning regarding the very late abortion for a child in the care of a health board. I asked how she had been so poorly supervised as a 13 year old that she became pregnant, whether charges were being pressed and attempts made to discover who had impregnated her and where it had happened. While we do not have the details of this case, in the X case the parents informed the Attorney General they were going to England as they wanted to ensure DNA samples could be taken so that the person they suspected, the child had said and was since proved to have caused the pregnancy of that child, also aged 13, could be prosecuted. The health board must attempt to do the same in this sort of case.</P>
    <P>It is 10,000 times worse that it should happen to a child in the care of the health board. As that child was taken into care, all of us have a collective responsibility for her. Did it happen here? Did it happen in England? What on earth was going on? I have raised this matter here before. I see this as a serious issue and I do not believe this was an isolated case.</P>
    <P>I am also very troubled by the cases of unaccompanied minors. While some of them may arrive here pregnant, others may not. There is a considerable lack of supervision of these children who are in the care of the State as they are children. The Refugee Council report describes children as being unsupervised from 5 p.m. until 9 a.m. the following morning and teenagers minding teenagers, all of which is utterly unsuitable. I know there are huge difficulties, but we must do something to rectify this situation.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that it might be as a result of negligence and carelessness on our behalf, immigrant children appear to be excluded under section 11 of the Ombudsman for Children Act, which states that the Ombudsman for Children cannot investigate any action taken concerning the law relating to asylum, immigration, naturalisation or citizenship. This leaves these children in an incredibly vulnerable position of not even having the protection of the Ombudsman for Children. Also listed in the exclusions are cases where civil legal proceedings are taken in any court. Does the same apply if criminal legal proceedings are taking place, which is surely what should happen in a case such as the one in Senator Glynn's health board area? These are most depressing findings on a day when we all should be rejoicing about what has been achieved in appointing the Ombudsman for Children.</P>
    <P>When we introduced the Child Care Act, I was very critical of the fact that inspections of institutions for young offenders were to take place every six months, whereas the inspection of institutions for non-offenders was to occur periodically. The then Minister said this was because there were not enough inspectors to go around. However, the family of a child offender would be more inclined to be in contact with and keep an eye on their child than the family of a child who may be in for neglect. There may be very little protection for such children. We have seen justified criticism about many institutions, which we have had to close. This should be reconsidered so that there can be more inspection of these facilities.</P>
    <P>Children should not be in the same institutions as adults. This is entirely unsuitable regardless of whether they are Irish nationals or immigrant children. It is impossible to keep an eye on them especially when people claim family relationships that may not exist. We must introduce better supervision in this area.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State knows, all family law cases are held <i>in camera.</i> A young barrister was appointed a few years ago to report on these cases. People do not realise how serious many of these cases are and how much they affect children even in fairly straightforward cases such as divorce and separation in which some judges do the very best they can to secure the rights of the child. For example, in cases where those separating are in better off circumstances, some judges have said that the children should be left in the home and the parents should find a flat or other accommodation. It is unworthy that the children should be the ones most disrupted. We have no idea what goes on in these cases. The Attorney General at the time, who is now the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, said that &ldquo;<i>in camera</i>&rdquo; meant &ldquo;<i>in camera</i>&rdquo;. The barrister who was appointed could not sit in on these cases. As legislators, we need much more information about what is going on. The public also need such information. I ask that this area be examined as rapidly as possible because children are frequently badly done down.</P>
    <P>I would also like to speak about children who are mentally ill. The facilities in this country for such children are woeful. The circumstances of children in voluntary hospitals can be investigated, but what about children in psychiatric hospitals? It is entirely unsuitable that they can be held in adult psychiatric hospitals, but that is what is happening. There are six places in the west and four places in Dublin. I am often contacted by psychiatrists who say they cannot get places for children who will do damage to their families. Those who are psychiatrically ill and attend hospitals on a day care basis do not receive any schooling. There is plenty for the new ombudsman to do. Those with attention deficit disorder, Asperger's syndrome and similar problems receive very little help. What proportion of the children to whom I have referred drop out of school at secondary level and attract the attention of the criminal justice system very shortly afterwards?</P>
    <P>I am glad that Senator Glynn mentioned the issue of bullying. I was horrified to hear about a ten year old in his local area who was bullied. My Trinity College colleague, Professor Mona O'Moore, has been raising this issue for 20 years. A case involving bullying in junior infants is before the courts at present. Surely we can get a little more done in that regard. The Cathaoirleach has been very patient with me so I will conclude by reiterating that so much remains to be done. It would be good if the ombudsman could examine the recommendations of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. The committee suggested about eight years ago, when it was chaired by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, that the constitutional provisions in this regard could be changed. I apologise to the Minister of State for giving him something else to do.</P>
    
    <P>Ms O'Rourke: The Minister of State has enough to do.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. B. Lenihan: I will be happy to have something else to do.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Henry: The position of children under the Constitution is not as good as their position under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. I wish the new ombudsman, Ms Emily Logan, well in her work but I am afraid she will have a great deal to do even before she begins to assess individual cases.</P>
    
    <P>Ms O'Rourke: I wish to share my time with Senator Feeney.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    
    <P>Ms O'Rourke: I welcome the Minister of State to the House and the announcement that Ms Emily Logan is to be appointed as the Ombudsman for Children. I am glad that the House is having this brief chance to debate the matter, just as the Dáil enthusiastically approved the appointment this morning. I welcome the establishment of the position of Ombudsman for Children because it gives dignity to children, who are now seen as people in their own right, albeit in a formative stage. They need the guidance they receive from parents, families, communities and schools. The fact that young people were involved in the drafting process and in the discussions on the appointment means that their needs are clearly recognised. Children were told for a long time that they should shut up and know their place. We were all brought up on such good dictums, but there is an innate dignity in everybody, regardless of age. The appointment of the ombudsman will give a positive voice to that dignity, which will be very good.</P>
    <P>I welcome Ms Logan to the position to which she is to be appointed by the President. The former Fine Gael Deputy, Austin Currie, was instrumental in the establishment of this position when he was Minister of State with responsibility for children. We have followed up his work by bringing about the establishment of the new office. Ms Logan will be enormously stretched in her job. It is depressing to read each day about offences against children. Very young children who live on the fringes of society are often deprived of the experience of childhood. Some of them may get involved in crime. It is enormously depressing.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry has spoken strongly in recent weeks about the sad case of a 14 year old girl who became pregnant while in the care of the State. It is not good enough for public servants, of whatever rank, to say that they will do their jobs and to claim that those who seek additional information over the telephone are nosy parkers. We have every right to question what has happened because the children have been placed in care in our name. It is the duty of the care authorities to respond because they are acting <i>in loco parentis.</i> I appreciate that certain complexities are associated with this case, but the fact is that a child who was placed in care in the UK because of the lack of places in Ireland became pregnant. It is horrific to think that this happened under our aegis.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Henry: It happened at the expense of taxpayers.</P>
    
    <P>Ms O'Rourke: That is what makes the matter acute, difficult and complex. We need to state our position clearly.</P>
    <P>I referred to one aspect of Ms Logan's activities. Her appointment marks another level of progress in the care of children. We cannot expect her to solve all the problems faced by children immediately, but when she has been established her work will be of great assistance to families, parents, communities and schools. I do not know Ms Logan, but I have read her CV and I am familiar with what she has done. She has been very supportive of young people in all the positions she has held. I wish her well.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that I must hand over to my colleague, Senator Feeney. I will conclude by saying that the most horrific aspect of the Huntley case was that he moved between the social service areas in England. The fact that he had been accused of certain crimes, some of which he has been proven to have committed, was not relayed to the relevant authorities. He was able to find many jobs in schools attended by young girls. The horrific crime of which he was convicted today should never have happened. It is a salutary lesson.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming before the House to discuss the appointment of the Ombudsman for Children. I wish Ms Logan well in her new position.</P>
    
    <P>Ms Feeney: Like my fellow Senators, I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan, to the House. I have said before that it is lovely to come to the House when all Senators are singing from the same hymn sheet. It normally happens when a good news story is under discussion. The history which is being made today is being brought about on a cross-party basis. It is right that all parties have been involved in a process which will be of benefit not only to children, but also to society as a whole. The appointment of an ombudsman for children will give children a voice. It will give them the comfort to stand on their own feet. I agree with the Leader, who said that the new position will give dignity to children.</P>
    <P>I will not discuss all the cases that have been mentioned by Senators today. Senator Glynn spoke of the shocking consequences of a bullying incident in his health board area. We should remember that adults are bullied in the workplace each day and we should spare a thought for those who suffer as a result. The word &ldquo;crime&rdquo; may seem to be a strong one to associate with bullying, but I consider bullying to be a horrible crime. It is a terrible shame that incidents of bullying are allowed to take place.</P>
    <P>I would like to know how the proposed Office of the Ombudsman for Children will work. I am sure the details will be outlined in the coming weeks, after Ms Logan has been appointed. I am aware that a child will be able to contact the office directly, but it is important that parents are informed of such representations so that their constitutional rights can be safeguarded. There is no doubt in my mind that there is no pain quite so bad as that suffered by a young child. We adults here today would all say that we could bear any pain ourselves, but the worst thing in the world for any of us is to see a child or children suffering in any way. I say that because I have just returned from Lesotho, a small state in southern Africa. I was there last week with other Oireachtas colleagues. The suffering of young children is of a different type from what we are discussing here. They suffer from starvation or have been orphaned by HIV-AIDS. It is the same pain, but a different problem.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that Ms Logan has come through the process. I certainly would not have liked to have been one of the candidates. It seemed a very interesting process as children were allowed to conduct interviews. That is absolutely fantastic, and I was delighted to read that each candidate had to be interviewed by the children involved in the selection process. There was a type of role-play in which they were interviewed by adults and other children. I wish Ms Logan well. Her CV is very impressive. Having sat for five years on An Bord Altranais, I rate the nursing profession in this country as one of the best. I have no doubt that she will be a wonderful ombudsman. She will now serve for a six-year term, which may be renewed once. That is a very wise decision as continuity is very important in this area where one deals with sensitive emotional issues.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan. I am delighted that we have reached this point. As I said at the outset, it is history in the making. I also thank the Minister's party colleague and predecessor as Minister of State, Deputy Mary Hanafin, who initiated the idea a few years ago.</P>
    
    <P>Ms O'Meara: I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan, to the House. I also particularly welcome this appointment, which has been a long time coming. The delay had nothing to do with getting it right, as Senator Glynn suggested. It was to do with money not being allocated to make the appointment.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. B. Lenihan: It was not like that.</P>
    
    <P>Ms O'Meara: We had this discussion before with the Minister of State, but it was my clear understanding that the Department of Finance was dragging its heels on this matter. I note the Minister's wholehearted commitment to this appointment. I commend him for this and for his commitments to the implementation of the national children's strategy, published in 2002. Nearly four years on, very little has been implemented. However, this legislation is being passed. It was brought first to the Seanad where it was welcomed and received cross-party support. We were very pleased to pass the Bill, one of the last passed by the previous Seanad, introduced by the then Minister of State, Deputy Mary Hanafin.</P>
    <P>While it is very welcome, we must be clear that this is a fairly minimal position. I wish Ms Logan very well in her appointment. I do not know her, but I read about her appointment in the newspaper this morning. She seems extremely well suited to her position. I ask her to be powerful in that position and push the boat out regarding the powers which this Act, though fairly minimal, has given her. She should exercise them to the fullest possible extent. As we know, and as has been said by other Senators, the position is clearly needed.</P>
    <P>The position of many children in this society is unacceptable. As Senator Henry pointed out on the Order of Business this morning, the appalling situation where a young child in the care of this State had to be sent to England for the necessary care that we were not able to provide ourselves is an indictment of the system. The fact that, when in the care of the health board abroad, the child was left in such a vulnerable position that she is now facing the horrendous trauma of an abortion at such a young age is an absolutely extraordinary indictment of how one child is being treated by the system here. Perhaps the ombudsman might take up a complaint on behalf of that family's child. If legal issues are involved, that will plainly not happen.</P>
    <P>Let us consider homelessness. In this week before Christmas, how many children are homeless? How many are living in poverty, acting as carers for their older relatives or parents, subject to domestic violence, abuse or education in inadequate schools? All those are indictments of our system for which we are collectively responsible. On the one hand, we should clap ourselves on the back that we are introducing some legislation but, on the other hand, unless we take full responsibility for our failings, we will get nowhere. Unless we give Ms Logan and her office the necessary resources, this legislation will be meaningless and unless we get our act together on vulnerable children, our fine words will also be meaningless.</P>
    <P>The extent to which vulnerable children in particular need a specific level of care is regularly reported by the media &ndash; on national television and in print. We seem to be finding it difficult to provide that, and it is clear that much must be done. I do not question the Minister of State's commitment in this area. I have discussed the matter with him. Why do we continue to fail in this regard? It may be that we are failing the communities and families from which those children come. We must recognise as a society that there are areas in urban and not so urban communities where families are finding it impossible to cope. The social welfare cuts made in the last few weeks will not help. Many single parents are struggling and will find it even more difficult to manage because of the cuts being harshly forced through by the current Government.</P>
    <P>I urge both the Minister and, in particular, Ms Logan, to be strong in their advocacy for children. I hope children will find the independent voice they need and that this will be the start of a cultural change. As other Senators have pointed out, we have come from a situation in Irish culture and society where children were seen but not heard. I hope this legislation is part of a change in that culture whereby children will be seen to have rights independently, not through their parents or family but in their own right. I hope we will stand up and be meaningful rather than pay lip service to the rights and needs of children and adequately respond to them, particularly regarding resources and the law.</P>
    
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan): I thank the Seanad and Senators for their contributions and their general welcome for the appointment. I join with them in wishing Ms Emily Logan well. Senator O'Meara may be surprised to learn that, while I have met her on occasion, I do not know her either. Senators did not mention that the nature of the appointment process was a first in that, while it was a political appointment in the gift of the Government, rather than treating it as such, it was very carefully bestowed. We set up the procedure, so the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners were not acting in a statutory context but as agents for the Government in undertaking the exercise.</P>
    
    <P>Ms O'Rourke: It had an advisory role.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. B. Lenihan: It was my decision. In a sense, it was my appointment too. Of course, I should say that it was the Government's appointment, and it took its own decision although it was guided by what I had to say on the matter. I am delighted that the Seanad has also given a fair wind to this appointment, and I very much welcome the general discussion on children's welfare and rights. It was a very well focused discussion during which many issues were raised. I would like to take up some of those.</P>
    <P>Senator Feighan raised the question of the most distressing proceedings in England today and that the gentleman in question &ndash; if I might call him that &ndash; had ten checks conducted on him, all of which proved negative. This illustrates a very important point about the whole subject of vetting. We are currently having a discussion on vetting in the other House. A very constructive motion has been tabled by Senator Feighan's political interest on that subject. We must always remember, however, that clearance through vetting is not clearance. There is no substitute for checking references.</P>
    
    <P>Ms O'Meara: That is right.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Henry: Yes.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. B. Lenihan: That is fundamental, and we must state it at all times. We must give a lead on the issue. I am not saying there are no problems with vetting. The central vetting unit clearly has a great deal of work to do and needs to expand its functions. A review group will be reporting on that to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, in early January. That is a very important issue, and I know there has been legitimate criticism of Government policy in the area. The voluntary groups are very concerned about it. However, vetting is not conclusive and I cannot overemphasise the importance of checking references. Senator Feighan highlighted that point.</P>
    <P>One of the functions of the Ombudsman for Children will be to promote the United Nations Convention and the work of that organisation's committee. With regard to dilapidated schools, the Minister for Education and Science has produced a well funded programme in respect of primary and second level schools. If Members consider the document the Minister published this morning, they will see that he has brought a tremendous professionalism to the preparation of the school building programme. That programme has been moved away from the land of the nod and the wink and, in a manner which is characteristic of the Minister, the process of how schools should be improved is now established on an open and transparent basis. The criteria for the assessment of schools are published in detail in the report.</P>
    <P>Senator Glynn naturally welcomed the appointment of a nurse to the position of ombudsman. I agree with his sentiments in that regard. The Senator and also Senator Henry and Senator Feeney referred to bullying, which is a key issue. We learned, through the consultation process, that bullying is a key concern of children and is a neglected underside of our social life. I have no doubt that the ombudsman will comment on and take action in respect of this matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Glynn also referred to our child welfare protection services. I will deal with that matter in reply to Senator Henry who asked whether we are doing enough in that area. The health board published the children first guidelines some time ago. An amount of money has been spent in publicising these guidelines in the different health board areas and I have been concerned for some time about the lack of awareness of them. This year, in the youth budget, the Government, through the Department of Education and Science, ensured that the various youth organisations should also be funded in respect of the provision of child protection and training therefor. Work in this area is ongoing. It is important that we promote awareness of these matters.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry also referred to unaccompanied minors, which is a difficult subject. Senators should understand that, under the refugee legislation, if a child who is unaccompanied and under the age of 18 years presents here, he or she is deemed to be in the care of the health board. However, cases involving these children are not typical of other child care cases. Children normally come into the care of the health boards because they are at risk in some way, perhaps from negligent or abusive parents or through a personal circumstance. However, in cases involving the children to whom Senator Henry referred, the risk is purely that they are unaccompanied minors. Social workers, the bulk of whom are retained by the East Coast Area Health Board, which holds the operational role for the eastern region, must make refugee applications on behalf of unaccompanied minors. The State, as parent, not only cares for these children, it also decides that refugee claims must be made in respect of them.</P>
    <P>As a result of measures taken by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, there has been a reduction in the number of these children arriving here. I have had a number of conferences with the health boards and officials from the Department of Health and Children and Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in respect of this matter. My concern is that the priority of social workers operating in this area should be in terms of the reunification of these children with their families. We are, however, constrained by our international legal obligations and we have been obliged to provide accommodation. As Senator Henry pointed out, such accommodation is not intensively supervised. The amount of investment that would be required to provide the full child care model that obtains in respect of, for example, domestic cases would be inordinately prohibitive. The measures taken to reduce numbers have eased matters somewhat. We are of the view that further reductions will take place in the coming months.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry also referred to the inspection of institutions. It is important to note that we have established the social services inspectorate, which has produced a number of good reports. One of the concerns I have as a result of reading those reports is that there is still a relatively high number of children in residential care who are under the age of 12. There is no reason these children should not be fostered. One of the matters I continually raise with the chief executives of the health boards is the need to promote fostering and to encourage as many parents as possible to foster children. A family placement is always better than a residential one. It is difficult to obtain a placement for a teenager in a foster care setting&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Ryan: It is difficult to obtain placements for them elsewhere.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. B. Lenihan: &mdash;and they may have to be placed in residential care.</P>
    <P>The social services inspectorate has highlighted the problem with fostering children under the age of 12 and I have raised it with the chief executives of the health boards. Some health boards have been more successful than others in implementing policies of this type. For example, the North Western Health Board does not have a single child in residential care; they are all fostered. That is a model we should pursue. The cost of residential care far exceeds that of foster care and the State provides generous material incentives to foster parents. I am preparing legislation which would give greater legal security to fostering. It is important that we promote fostering at every opportunity. The social services inspectorate is doing a good job and the reports it has published can be perused on its website. I wanted to allay Senator Henry's fears in respect of that matter.</P>
    <P>The hearing of family law cases <i>in camera</i> is a wide philosophical issue and is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. If we operate the <i>in camera</i> rule in judicial proceedings affecting the welfare of children, those proceedings will be removed from effective scrutiny. When powers are invested in the courts, judges must be independent in the exercise of them. One of the most valuable safeguards of public criticism in a free society is the exposure of judicial proceedings. The application of total secrecy to any branch of judicial proceedings means that they are effectively removed from public criticism. That is a difficulty and it is why the Constitution states that there must be publicity in court proceedings, save in exceptional limited circumstances. In recent decades the break-up of family life or the involvement of child welfare questions in judicial proceedings are no longer exceptional or unusual circumstances. The legal profession and the Judiciary are perhaps not as enthusiastic about proceedings being subjected to publicity and many individuals would be unhappy about their private arrangements being exposed in court. It is, therefore, a difficult issue.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Henry about adolescent psychiatry. There is some limited, but not enough, provision in this area. However, one of the difficulties with adolescent psychiatry is that of attracting some of the Senator's colleagues in the medical profession to practise in the area. One of our institutions cannot operate at present because we cannot fill a consultant position. While consultant psychiatrists are very interested in the area of child development at the younger age, they are not as attracted to working with difficult teenagers.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Rourke, at her most philosophical, referred to the dignity of the appointment and the dignity it will bestow on children. It is important to remember that it is for children that this appointment is being made. Children will be able to go directly to the ombudsman. As Senator Feeney stated, they will not be able complain about their parents because they will be complaining about public bodies or voluntary hospitals, that is, the State.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Meara referred to complaints in the context of children in care. The State will be involved in this regard and a recent matter to which several Members referred could result in a complaint to the ombudsman. It is not policy to comment on individual cases but the Minister for Health and Children has sought a report on the matter in question. I would not like Senators to be under the impression that it is necessarily the case that the placement in England resulted from any shortage of provision here. There were wider issues involved, but I do not wish to comment any further.</P>
    <P>Senator Feeney, among others, stated that the job of the ombudsman will not be easy. She correctly stated that children will be involved in the interviews. They were also involved in the designing of the advertisement.</P>
    <P>I wish to place on record, for Senator O'Meara's benefit, that provision was made in last year's Estimates. However, an embargo on recruitment to the public service was in operation at that time. The necessary positions to support the ombudsman had to be identified. That was the constraint on proceeding in the first six months of last year with the appointment. There was a financial constraint, but it was not a cutback. However, it disappeared in July and we have been working on it since. I asked my officials why we could not place the advertisement in the newspaper and was told we could not do so because the children had to be involved in its drafting.</P>
    
    <P>Ms O'Meara: The children were on their school holidays at that time.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. B. Lenihan: Yes, and we had to explain to them what an ombudsman does and then ask them to design the advertisement. The advertisement was ready in November. I was anxious to make the appointment before Christmas and I am thankful to all parties for facilitating me in this regard. We made it in the nick of time.</P>
    <P>I enjoyed the discussion on the general issues and hope I have addressed most of the matters raised. Senator O'Meara made a fair point about the children's strategy. That matter is being monitored by the children's office and we will be benchmarking ourselves on it. She also raised the question of resources and vulnerable children in the care system. There is no doubt but that the health boards have very grave responsibilities in this area.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Rourke said we cannot always assume that practices are correct and must evaluate them. That is true. I have always had concerns in this regard. It is good that the social services inspectorate now evaluates practice in institutions. We have to move on from that and look at how we will evaluate practice in terms of social workers. We know, as Members of the Oireachtas, that we cannot interfere in such matters on an individual basis but someone must make a judgment on them. That said, we have to evaluate the quality of such judgments.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their welcome for Ms Emily Logan's appointment as Ombudsman for Children.</P>

    <Title>Broadcasting (Funding) Bill 2003  [  Seanad Bill amended by the Dáil ]  : Report and Final Stages.</Title>
    <P>
      <b></b>
    </P>
    <P>An Leas-Chathaoirleach: I welcome the Minister of State to the House.</P>
    <P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil. In accordance with Standing Order 103, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage. On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil. This is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad. The only matters, therefore, which may be discussed are the amendments made by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>For Senators' convenience, I have arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments. Senators may speak only once on Report Stage. The Minister will make one contribution on the subject matter of the two related amendments.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. J. Browne): The Bill under discussion today was passed by Seanad Éireann on 13 November.</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann, in passing the Bill last week, included two amendments, a copy of which Senators should have before them. I proposed both amendments to take account of two particular issues that arose in discussions on the Bill.</P>
    <P>The first amendment refers to access to programmes by those who are deaf or hard of hearing and introduces a new provision in this regard. The second refers to directions from the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to the commission to bring forward schemes and clarifies the intention of the original proposal.</P>
    <P>There was considerable discussion in the Dáil on the issue of access. This is an important issue on broadcasting generally and the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland is currently engaged in a consultative process on the matter with a view to preparing general codes and rules for all broadcasters. The introduction of provisions on access <i>per se</i> is outside the scope of this particular Bill, but even if it were not, my view is that it would make more sense to await the outcome of the consultative process rather than anticipate it at this stage.</P>
    <P>On programmes which might be funded under the broadcasting funding scheme, access is an issue that should be taken into account. Any prescriptive provisions should however be avoided as we do not know what form the broadcasting commission's code will ultimately take. In this context, the provision adopted by the Dáil is, in my view, a reasonable one. It requires the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, in preparing a scheme, to have regard to the understanding and enjoyment of television programmes under the scheme by persons who are deaf or hard of hearing.</P>
    <P>The amendment on directions by the Minister in section 2(6) was introduced to allay fears that the Minister could direct the commission to fund a particular programme. This was never the intention. It was included to enable the Minister to direct the commission to bring forward a scheme under any of the categories in section 2(1). A direction such as this is envisaged where the commission, for whatever reason, might not have brought a scheme forward. A scheme prepared by the commission, including one following such a direction, must be approved by the Minister and laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>As Senators will also be aware from earlier debates, section 5 also provides for regular review, at least every three years, on the operation, impact and effectiveness of schemes under the Bill. A copy of that report will also be laid before the Oireachtas.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Finucane: I welcome the amendments. My colleague, Deputy Coveney, has been engaged with this issue for quite some time. I compliment him for his work.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for accepting the amendment. Anyone who watches programmes produced in foreign countries, such as Latvia, will know they are subtitled. I often watch an entire programme because it is subtitled, not because I cannot hear what is being said but because I do not know the language of the country. Subtitling is extremely important to the deaf and hard of hearing. In that context, it is desirable this amendment was made. I hope the BCI will bring forward concrete proposals in this regard. I am sure it will respond to the wishes expressed in both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    
    <P>Ms O'Meara: I echo Senator Finucane's sentiments in welcoming the amendments. This legislation was thoroughly discussed, particularly in regard to this issue. The Minister of State is flexible, listened to the views of Senators and responded to their concerns by including these important amendments. We know from experience it is important to clearly spell out our intentions in legislation, particularly when handing over functions to a body like the commission. I have no difficulties with the amendments. I commend the Minister of State and his officials for their work on this Bill.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: I welcome the amendment but I wonder if, to give it some concrete form, it would be possible in this technological age to manufacture a device which, with the pressing of a button, provided one with English or Irish subtitles to programmes. I know not everybody would require subtitles at the bottom of their screen except, perhaps, when a person is speaking in a foreign language in the middle of a play. Such a device could be provided for those who need it such as the hard of hearing or the deaf. It ought to be possible to do something like this in this day and age.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. J. Browne: I welcome the positive response from Senator Finucane and Senator O'Meara. As regards the comments of Senator Mansergh, I am sure that with modern technology, some positive movement in this area could take place, although as I am not entirely <i>au fait</i> with technology I am not sure what can happen in this area. However, I have noticed that Sky television provides digital technology where one can choose the camera from which to view a football match.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Ryan: Where is technology when one needs it?</P>
    
    <P>Mr. J. Browne: As Senator Finucane said, Deputies from all sides of the House were positive about this Bill when it was debated in the Dáil. They were particularly positive when dealing with new programmes and how the deaf and hard of hearing can be included. I hope that when the BCI comes to look at the channels in the new year, it will make solid proposals that all programmes should be captioned. It is important that this happens.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. J. Browne): I thank Senators for their contributions today and in previous debates on the Bill in the House. I know Senators encouraged the Minister to accept amendments. I thank Senators for their courtesy and wish them a happy Christmas.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Finucane: This Bill was initiated in this House. As the Minister is aware, the House showed great interest in the Bill. Much of our attention focused on discussing the community aspect, particularly with regard to radio and television. While I accept that revenue for community broadcasters could not be ring fenced in the Bill, the Minister was sympathetic to the development of community radio and television throughout the State. I look forward to the BCI formulating, at an early stage, a scheme that will apply to this and that the wishes of most Members on community broadcasting are reflected.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: Hear, hear.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Finucane: I welcome that most of the legislation from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is initiated in this House. I hope the level of debate in the House enhances the legislation. I wish the Minister and his officials a happy Christmas.</P>
    
    <P>Ms O'Meara: I thank the Minister and his officials for their work on this Bill and look forward to seeing it in practice. I hope that it lives up to the expectations of Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas and I urge the BCI to be creative in implementing the framework we have set out in this legislation.</P>
    
    <P>Labhrás Ó Murchú: I compliment the Minister and the officials responsible for drafting this Bill. This is Solomon-type legislation that responds to the many requirements in broadcasting at local and national level. I am particularly pleased that it is focused on heritage and culture. I agree with the comments made by other Senators on the commission; it is important that it is aware of what is happening at local as well as national level. There is much money involved and it is important that the commission succeeds and responds to the real needs that exist.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Title>Economic Competitiveness: Motion.</Title>
    <P>
      <b></b>
    </P>
    <P>Mr. Dardis: I move:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann affirms the importance of competition in all sectors to achieve low prices and fairness for consumers, a level playing field for all businesses and overall efficiency for the economy and accordingly, approves and supports the Government's policy to promote competition in the economy.</P>
    <P>Competition is absolutely essential for a free and open society. Freedom to compete means freedom to innovate and offer new products and services and, ultimately, to create wealth and prosperity. It goes to the heart of the type of society and economy we want. One does not have to be a specialist in law or economics to realise this.</P>
    <P>The role competition plays in ensuring fairness is easy enough to recognise. To ensure a fair balance of economic power and a free society with functioning markets, we need strong competition, active consumers and appropriate regulation. We are improving in regard to all three needs, thanks to the action of the Government. For example, we are opening up more areas for competition in transport and services. We are properly resourcing the Competition Authority, the results of whose work are becoming increasingly evident. We are promoting more consumer awareness through the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and we have placed the consumer interest at the heart of financial regulation in the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority.</P>
    <P>It is quite significant that the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority's recent consultation paper defines its three key mandates as follows: helping consumers to make informed choices through education and codes of practice in a fair financial services market; having a regulatory system that fosters safe and sound financial institutions while operating in a competitive and expanding market of high reputation; and developing an appropriate regulatory system for credit unions. These mandates serve to underline the arguments I am making. Despite much scepticism, the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority is shown to be making an excellent start with its recent price survey and other initiatives, as is evident from its consultation paper.</P>
    <P>There is a marked difference between the &ldquo;competition&rdquo; this motion seeks to address and the &ldquo;competitiveness&rdquo; referred to in the Fine Gael amendment. This is a point on which I expect my learned colleague Senator Minihan to expand. It is important for a competitive economy to have competition within it, but the two concepts are separate.</P>
    <P>We are providing for better regulation across many areas of the economy, from communications to accountancy and financial services. The passage of the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill 2003 this morning serves as an example. The Government has shown sensitivity to the need for appropriate regulation rather than over-regulation. One criticism of our past is that we have over-regulated.</P>
    <P>Competition is an essential part of Europe's single market and the EU has been a tremendous force for competition in Ireland and throughout the EU. It is questionable whether we would have come as far as we have if we had not been members of the EU.</P>
    <P>Competition is at the heart of fair and functioning markets and it is the ideological opposite of the idea behind the centrally planned economies that fell apart. The denial of human rights in countries that had centrally planned economies entailed the denial of economic freedom and competition.</P>
    <P>Only die-hards of the left dream of re-establishing full central planning in the Soviet style. However, those with moderate politics still face a choice between leaning towards planning, control and the inevitable protection of vested interests or having faith in the freedom to compete.</P>
    <P>Consider the introduction of competition to airports and the creation of three new airport businesses from Aer Rianta. The Labour Party and others want to see the full plan for every day in Shannon and Cork airports. Its bias is towards planning, control and the protection of existing interests and arrangements and it just does not see that competition does not work like that. The whole point of competition is to give Shannon and Cork airports the freedom to compete, innovate and make their businesses work to their benefit and that of their customers.</P>
    <P>At a strategic level, we believe there is a clear basis for these businesses. However, they can only work with the freedom to compete. This includes the autonomy to make, implement and modify their own business plans. There is a radical difference between the preference to allow Shannon and Cork airports the freedom to compete and the Labour Party's preference for central planning in advance of every step before anything strategic is done.</P>
    <P>It matters little enough whether people say the planning should happen in Aer Rianta, the Department of Transport, among social partners or at Government level. There is no need for this type of central planning for our airports at all. The point is that one chooses either to have faith in the ability of independent companies to compete and prosper or to plan and protect centrally. Freedom to compete is the polar opposite of planning, control and protection.</P>
    <P>Some people create a spectre around the word &ldquo;competition&rdquo; and allude to predatory, dog-eat-dog behaviour and the so-called law of the jungle. This is a worn-out cliché and a caricature wheeled out occasionally to oppose change. It plays on people's fears and displays a great lack of confidence in what people can and do achieve when they compete.</P>
    <P>My colleagues and I are pro-competition because we have confidence in people's skills, innovative capacity and decisions. They rise to the challenge of competition and will continue to do so. This has been amply demonstrated in regard to the success of the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>We know from experience that competition works for consumers and for the public interest. It delivers lower prices and more and better services. We have seen it on a massive scale in terms of air transport. The Ryanair story has been catalogued enough in the Houses without my going into it in detail, but it is worth mentioning that Aer Lingus has thrived by competing effectively in recent times. The benefits from air transport competition have been immense and have been enjoyed by millions of people. There are social benefits as well as economic benefits and thousands of jobs and small businesses in tourism have felt the direct beneficial effect of low cost access to Ireland. If anything has contributed to the rise in numbers of tourists coming to Ireland, it has been access to low cost air travel.</P>
    <P>It is of strategic importance that we maintain and develop this access. One expert has pointed out that air routes are elements of infrastructure, as vital as roads and rail lines. They may perhaps be even more important for an island. We need to build and maintain air routes at the lowest possible cost, and this is why airport competition will be good for the country as well as competition between terminals at Dublin.</P>
    <P>Competition in telecommunications has delivered a range of services that would be unthinkable if we still had Telecom Éireann. Imagine if we had a sole fixed line operator, one mobile company and one cable company, all in State ownership. Only the most ideological of ideologues of the left would say we would have better and cheaper services with that type of monopoly. We have further to go down the road of competition in telecommunications, particularly on the local loop and we cannot let up in this area or any other.</P>
    <P>We need more competition in many areas of the economy. To complement the work of the Government and the Tánaiste in reducing insurance costs, we need more players in various parts of the insurance market. The Tánaiste has encouraged businesses to look at the Irish market again, especially since the Personal Injuries Assessment Board will soon be up and running and the civil law reforms will be in place, as they are going through the Dáil at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport is leading the way on bus routes and private operators. Again, who will claim now that the people of Dublin are worse off because we have the Aircoach service? We can also use the power of competition in sectors of the health service, as clearly we could do with more competition in health insurance. The structure of the market, with one dominant company in VHI towering over BUPA with a market share of over 80%, is far from ideal but that is an historical legacy. The VHI management discharges its duties and functions in the circumstances in which it finds itself and has done so well in the past. I doubt we would ever have allowed this market share to be built by management action, that is, by mergers and acquisitions. We would not be comfortable with a bank having a market share over 80% and the health insurance market is in great need of more competition. Many health policy strategic considerations will have to be addressed in achieving this.</P>
    <P>Competition in the provision of some health services is behind the success of the National Treatment Purchase Fund. Operations are priced and contracts entered into and if the price one hospital is offering &ndash; private or public, in Ireland or Britain &ndash; is too high, there is no onus on the National Treatment Purchase Fund to use it. Competition works for the good of patients here and it produces value for public money. It will be well worth our while absorbing and applying what we have learned from the use of &euro;30 million or so in the National Treatment Purchase Fund.</P>
    <P>It is clear that we should continue to use the power of competition in as many areas as possible for value for public money. I congratulate the Competition Authority for the range of its work and for enforcing competition policy in ways that are not always dramatic but are effective. The recent action on petrol stations and newspaper prices are good examples. I am confident the Competition Authority's ongoing consultations and reviews will pay dividends, not always in high profile ways, but in creating a competition culture in the country.</P>
    <P>Is it not clear now that the presumption must be in favour of competition? The burden of proof lies with the opponents of competition to demonstrate that competition would produce worse outcomes. It is a rare case where the public interest is best served by a monopoly, even a regulated one. I ask anyone who defends anti-competitive practices or non-competitive arrangements to demonstrate how consumer interests are enhanced by the preservation of rules and procedures that reduce competition. The onus to prove the case is on that side, not on those of us who favour competition. We favour competition because it is a force for growth, innovation and prosperity and also because it is inherently fair. Competition brings fairness and economic development together and no one needs fear that. We are making progress on competition in Ireland. The mindset has been changed, slowly enough and mainly by example, but we must press on. The result will be better for our citizens, better for the economy, better for workers and job creation and better for our international competitiveness.</P>
    <P>The Opposition amendment refers to the report, &ldquo;Competitive Challenge 2003&rdquo; from the National Competitiveness Council and Forfás. It states that facilitating markets to operate efficiently by ensuring adequate competition is vital to driving down the cost of doing business in Ireland but according to ACRA 2003, however, Ireland ranks 13th out of 16 countries in terms of the intensity of domestic competition. The report also states that the Competition Act 2002 was a significant step forward in enhancing Irish competition law and strengthening the powers of the Competition Authority. It refers to Ireland having no civil sanctions for infringement of competition law, unlike some other countries, and that needs to be considered. The report also refers to impediments to competition as a result of State-imposed legislation and regulations which need to be removed. I said earlier that we were perhaps over-regulated in the past, which is not to say that some industries or activities should not be regulated. Dominance within a market has to be regulated but we must allow competition to flourish, as that is beneficial to everyone.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Minihan: I second the motion and reserve my right to speak at a later time.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Coghlan: I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Seanad Éireann condemns the failure of the Government's policies to maintain Ireland's competitiveness as evidenced by the substantial contribution which Government stealth taxes have made to inflation in recent years and the recent report of the National Competitiveness Council which revealed that Ireland is the joint most expensive country in the euro zone for consumer goods, ranks fourth most expensive of 16 countries for insurance premiums <i>per capita</i> and is the third most expensive of nine countries for industrial electricity costs.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Fahey. It is good to see him back again after his recent escapades. It is a sign of our proximity to Christmas that the Progressive Democrats have decided to table a motion commending the Government for its policy on and approach to competition. They must have assumed that in the spirit of goodwill that normally descends upon us all at this festive time that they would receive uncritical acclaim from all sides of the House for their motion. I am sorry to disappoint my friends opposite, but the ghosts of Christmas past, present and future prevent us from embracing the sentiment behind their motion.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Dardis: Bah humbug.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Coghlan: For the thousands of Irish businesses fighting to retain their competitive position in domestic and international markets at present, this motion will ring hollow. The increased costs facing business, which are directly attributable to Government-sanctioned increases or initiatives, are the single biggest indictment of the failure of the Government's approach to tackling competitiveness in the Irish economy. Businesses and consumers must also bear additional costs arising from the persistent failure of the Government to tackle monopolies and cartels, particularly in the non-traded sectors.</P>
    <P>A competitive economy is a laudable and achievable objective. However, it is patently cynical for members of the Government to portray themselves as the champions of competition, while simultaneously undermining the cost base of most businesses in the State. Increases in energy costs, waste charges, telecommunications costs and insurance costs are directly attributable to Government inaction in these key areas. The Government has created an abstract vision of what competition might be like in key sectors but has singularly failed to deliver on that vision. We have the reality of a supposedly competitive electricity market, yet consumers end up with less choice and higher prices. Similarly, in the telecommunications sector the Government has failed to introduce real choice and value for consumers.</P>
    <P>In public transport, we still have State-owned monopolies that ill serve the interests of consumers. We have a postal service that is less efficient than the carriage-drawn service of 100 years ago and the programme of infrastructural development that is supposed to underpin a competitive economy is full of inefficiencies, cost overruns and delays. The poor Minister for Transport will soon end up opening the same roads twice in a valiant effort to maintain his high public profile in the media.</P>
    <P>In addition to State-sponsored inefficiencies and costs, the Government has also seriously undermined the competitiveness of Irish businesses by introducing an array of stealth charges and taxes which attack the very heart of economic competitiveness of businesses in the State. While trumpeting low corporation tax rates, the Government has done its utmost to ensure that few businesses get to make any profits at all.</P>
    <P>At every chance, the Government has sought to increase its indirect tax take from consumers and businesses. It hopes that the absence of a harp on the envelope seeking the increased charges will distract business people from the true source of this perfidy. Seldom in the course of Irish politics have so few taken so much from so many, and all with the hope that no one will notice. Unfortunately for it, some people have noticed.</P>
    <P>Companies providing foreign direct investment have noticed the slide in our competitiveness. They have seen how other governments have been prepared to adopt innovative and less grabby policies that sustain and encourage growth, employment investment and development. They have recognised that this regime pays lip service to competitiveness. It talks the talk, but cannot walk the walk. The Tánaiste's confirmation yesterday that the Government is now focused on the quality and not the quantity of new jobs will be cold comfort to the thousands of our fellow countrymen who have lost their livelihoods this year.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt the sincerity and commitment of my friends opposite. However, instead of raising a toast to the emperor's new clothes, their time and effort would be better spent putting pressure on their Ministers to return to basics. Seven years of sitting on the comfortable leather of ministerial Mercedes has dulled their senses and numbed their ministerial motivation.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Minihan: They are Volvos.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Coghlan: What can be done to tackle the problem? For a start, the Government should call a halt to any additional cost increases from State owned or controlled sectors. This includes the energy sector and aspects of the telecommunications sector. It should also call a halt to the imposition of any new stealth taxes. A high powered committee of business people and officials should be established to examine the impact of any new charges or taxes on businesses and to report publicly on their findings. Our development agencies should also redouble their efforts to assist indigenous creators of employment.</P>
    <P>For too long our industrial policy has veered too much towards Boston and Berlin at the expense of Ballyhaunis, Ballymun and Ballyferriter. It is time we accorded equal respect and resources to our indigenous entrepreneurs and stopped continually tilting the hat to foreign investors. For too long we have neglected the employment potential of key indigenous sectors of the economy. These are the people and businesses that will be here for the long haul and which will create employment and wealth in their locality. They too require a competitive environment and ultimately will fail if the Government continues to see the business sector as an open ended source of funding for out of control public expenditure.</P>
    <P>A competitive environment and effective competition policy are fine aspirations but without an honest, meaningful and transparent commitment to achieving such objectives, they will remain empty, dangerous and meaningless. Meanwhile, the employment and industrial base of the State will be eaten away by stealth taxes, cartels, monopolies and a Government that is more concerned with soundbites than action.</P>
    <P>We will feel the effects of this shallow and superficial approach to competition and the economy for years to come. If the Members opposite are serious about this motion, they should retable it at their next parliamentary party meeting and request the Tánaiste to outline how she proposes to address Ireland's increasing joblessness and its slide into uncompetitiveness. They can then return to this House to outline their proposed solutions to the problems they have helped to create.</P>
    <P>We are duty bound to oppose this motion and to propose an amendment condemning the role of the Government in the creation of an uncompetitive economic environment.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. P. Burke: I second the amendment. Everybody is in favour of competitiveness in the economy and we would all like a reduction in prices and the cost of living. Prices have gone wild over the past two or three years and the Government has missed golden opportunities to act on the issue.</P>
    <P>In terms of competitiveness, Senator Dardis mentioned the splitting up of Cork, Dublin and Shannon Airports into separate entities as an example. Senator Quinn is here. He is the owner of many supermarkets, but does not have a separate board to look after each one. I cannot see what the creation of a different board for each airport will do for competitiveness. If we have a good model in place, the same model should extend to other related premises or businesses. While I agree with providing freedom to the airports with regard to what they can do and that much can be done to make them more competitive and attractive to business, the Government is missing an opportunity and is creating more red tape rather than eliminating it. We see the same red tape hindering the progress of local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Government will spend &euro;5.9 billion on water and sewerage schemes over the next number of years as part of the national development plan. The majority of the schemes will be carried out through public private partnerships, PPPs, or design, build and operate schemes, DBOs. These will not provide competitiveness. One or two firms or companies will compete for tenders resulting in the formation of cartels throughout the country. We will end up with one or two groups or multinationals owning the water sources and the management of water and sewerage systems throughout the country. What will this do for the country's competitiveness?</P>
    <P>As Senator Coghlan pointed out, stealth taxes have increased over the years. Water and sewerage is an area where stealth taxes will rise even further and the ordinary Joe Soap will end up paying the piper. The Government is losing control because of how it is proceeding. If we are to hand over our water sources and water and sewerage systems to DBOs and PPPs, we should debate the matter. It seems as if we are about to put them into the hands of a few. Few companies will be able to tender for these schemes. One or two groups will specialise in the business and they will have a big advantage when tendering. As a result they will have a monopoly which will not lead to competitiveness. The Government must examine this issue.</P>
    <P>We have seen the same problem with the banks. Over the past ten years the number of banks opening on high streets throughout the country has escalated. It was said that the more banks we had, the more competitive the market would be. However, any fall in interest rates was not a result of having more banks. We did not see any reduction in bank charges either. Now we see the banks rationalising and amalgamating and we will end up with only two or three banks in towns throughout the country. This is an area where we did not gain competitiveness by the introduction of variety in business. Different types of competition will bring down prices and assist competitiveness. I suggest the Government has not given sufficient attention to those areas &ndash; Senator Coghlan is correct in his comments in that regard. I second the amendment moved by Senator Coghlan.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: I welcome the more reasoned and less political contribution of the Leas-Chathaoirleach. I compliment the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and her team of Ministers of State, including Deputy Fahey, on their work in the context of improving competitiveness. From my experience of close involvement with members of the Government over a five year period, I can say that Ministers work very hard. A number of Government sub-committees are working on the well-acknowledged deficiencies in infrastructure, including competitiveness issues, with a view to making progress in resolving them. Obviously, the idea that people just sit back comfortably in their chairs does not hold.</P>
    <P>We need to maintain a balance in this debate. Nobody disputes that there are genuine and pressing competitiveness concerns. Nevertheless, it is unjustifiable to argue that we are becoming hopelessly uncompetitive and that the picture is one of doom and gloom. In many areas, we are very competitive and, in general, our economic performance over the past few years is envied by other countries, large and small. To a great extent, we have got the basics right, but there is much catching up to be done in other areas.</P>
    <P>I am glad inflation is coming down closer to the European average of 2.2% to 2.3% and I look forward to a further reduction, perhaps below 2% next year. I simply do not understand the basis for references to public expenditure being out of control. Nobody could draw that conclusion from the recent budget. It seems likely that, at the end of this year, we will have fairly negligible borrowing figures, compared to last year's budget estimate. I do not believe there will be a larger deficit, in borrowing terms, as is being predicted for next year.</P>
    <P>I will refer to a few areas of work in progress on competitiveness issues. Education is extremely important. Just today, the Government announced substantial spending on the improvement of primary and secondary schools. The budget reinstated valuable research and development expenditure and one hopes there will not be a stop-go situation. In the presence of two university Senators, I have to say I am somewhat concerned about the current grant for third level education. In technical terms, because of the reinstatement of research and development and the deal on maintenance grants last year, there was a significant increase in third level spending. As a result, the overall day to day spending may be suffering. That is undesirable as it relates to our competitiveness. I hope that issue will be looked at before the revised Book of Estimates is issued, rather than left aside until next year. I have some concerns in that regard. The decentralisation programme will reduce some of the pressures on the greater Dublin area. In an indirect way, those pressures are contributing to our uncompetitiveness.</P>
    <P>I have some concerns on the overall question of Kyoto and carbon taxes. I note that a certain interest group, comprising those involved in the wind industry, is threatening us with all sorts of heavy fines. EU members have to look rather carefully at what the rest of the world is doing and finally decide what we ought to do, taking into account the competitiveness impact of taking actions to which some of the bigger countries will not conform.</P>
    <P>It is very clear, regardless of whether we like it, that the US economy is built on cheap energy. If we make our energy much more costly while the US fails to take any action on its situation, it is difficult to expect any closure of the gap between US and EU competitiveness. While I do not suggest there is any lack of justification for environmental concerns, we need to look very carefully at any action we take in terms of the implications for competitiveness.</P>
    <P>Investment in transport infrastructure is, perhaps, one of the areas in which we are most deficient. However, great efforts are being made and we are beginning to see significant strides forward. In the past year, the motorway from Dublin to the Border has been opened, followed, in the last week, by the Kildare by-pass and, in the last two days, a significantly improved rail timetable which, for the first time, is beginning to pay attention to congestion in cities other than Dublin. For example, a commuter service between Limerick and Ennis is now being provided and I have no doubt the Minister will look forward to some action on Galway's public transport problems before very long.</P>
    <P>We need to be careful about the burden of regulation to ensure that, in the name of accountability, we do not bring in too much regulation to add to existing burdens. The term &ldquo;stealth taxes&rdquo; has been much abused. It has been applied to matters which are nothing of the kind, such as increases in electricity charges. I do not agree with the policy, which simply creates future problems, of having freebies on a wide range of public services, thereby leading to a disproportionate rise in future when the system becomes untenable.</P>
    <P>In the context of indigenous employment, tourism receives a great deal of encouragement and backing from the State. Service employment is the area of greatest increase. I do not accept the notion that we have policies and a climate which is inimical to the creation of indigenous employment, taking a broad view of the situation.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Quinn: I wish to share my time with Senator Ross.</P>
    
    <P>An Leas-Chathaoirleach: Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Quinn: I welcome the Government motion and the particular wording used in terms of its determination to promote competition. I have been a believer in competition since I started in business 43 years ago, to which the Leas-Chathaoirleach kindly referred. I have been aware of the benefits of competition. When I started in business, back in 1960, the main operator in our area was a company named Liptons which, if I recall correctly, had 60 branches and was backed up by other companies such as Home and Colonial and Maypole, none of which was Irish-owned. At that stage, Dunnes Stores had been in operation for about three or four years. It gives some idea of what happened and how within ten years Liptons, Home Colonial and Maypole had disappeared and Dunnes Stores took over the market. I would love to take some credit for this change, but that goes to the consumers who followed the market. The effect of the market is such that the more we drive it, encourage it and make it competitive and open, the more likely we will benefit from it.</P>
    <P>On my first visit to Leningrad in 1989, I went to a supermarket outside the city. I asked the manager how many customers he had and he was able to tell me the exact number. I was very impressed by this and I asked how he knew he had 4,680 customers. He replied that it was the number of inhabitants in the town. I discovered that his was the worst supermarket I had ever seen, but everyone was forced to shop there as there was no other supermarket in the town and he had cornered the marketplace. That example is a reminder to me of the benefits of competition. There is a cycle race known as &ldquo;Devil Take the Hindmost&rdquo; in which there are 20 laps with 20 cyclists. After each lap, one rider has to drop out after a lap sprint is announced. Something similar happens in competition. The benefit of competition is to the community and those who respond to what is offered by it.</P>
    <P>However, competition has to be watched carefully as there can be some disadvantages to it. I suggest that the main disadvantage of the campaign against rip-off Ireland is that it concentrates solely on price to the extent that it may discourage those who take into account service, balance and quality. The campaign may even result in poorer quality of consumer goods and products.</P>
    <P>When I walk along Grafton Street or into the Liffey Valley, Jervis and Blanchardstown shopping centres, I feel as if I am in Liverpool, Manchester or Birmingham. I do not see many Irish-owned shops anymore, which is one of the disadvantages of open competition. Earlier in the year, I attended an interesting conference on all aspects of retailing. One speaker from abroad said that in competition between the good, big retailer and the good, small retailer, in the long term, the good, big retailer is likely to win such as in the business I know well in Britain where there are now only five companies remaining. The good small retailer has great difficulties competing against their large counterparts which are capable of undercutting prices. In the US, the Robinson-Packman Act was introduced to keep the smaller retail sector alive and healthy. However, large retailers, such as Walmart with its huge buying power, inevitably take over the market.</P>
    <P>We must encourage competition, but we must also keep in mind the balance that there are some disadvantages if there is an over concentration on open competition. It is likely that those in business will not be Irish-based because the size of the large competitors tends to take that business. It has happened in other areas, but there are also success stories. I like to quote the Irish proverb &ndash;&ldquo;Éist le fuaim na habhann agus gheobhaidh tú breac&rdquo;&ndash;&ldquo;Listen to the sound of the river and you will get a trout.&rdquo; If those in the business, and not just retailers, are to succeed, they must listen to the changing marketplace. Sometimes, the smaller business is able to provide a product or service to attract customers and beat the bigger ones. We must take both of these into account when we pursue competition.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Ross: Until I listened to Senator Quinn, I always distrusted business people who claimed to welcome competition. There was a similar mantra from semi-State bodies, such as Eircom and CIE, which asserted that competition was always a good thing, but followed it with the word &ldquo;but&rdquo;. They asserted that competition was a good thing, but it was, in effect, good for other companies and as long as it was an abstract concept. It is a concept that we approve of as a people because it is good for the consumer. However, the State has a duty to intervene in the market.</P>
    <P>Some markets become distorted and monopolies develop for various reasons which are the product of the market. When that happens, competition is suppressed while the consumer and other industries suffer. It is important that we are having this debate in the House. The Progressive Democrats can assert their commitment to the competitive ideal, even if they cannot practice all its aspects in Government. I do not have a viewpoint on who is right or wrong on this Private Members' motion. The aspiration of the motion put down by Senator Dardis and Senator Minihan is unarguable. However, the Fine Gael Party amendment is an unnecessary attempt to discredit the Government's aspiration by putting in a few, irrelevant, cheap political points, ones which it does not believe in and cannot put into practice.</P>
    <P>I take issue with the term &ldquo;stealth taxes&rdquo; as I have never quite understood what is meant by it. I understand what the detractors mean by stealth taxes, but I agree with Senator Mansergh's comments on them. I do not believe that the rises in ESB, CIE and VHI prices are taxes introduced by the Government. They are undesirable, but they are often a reflection of the extraordinary inefficiencies in those particular companies. The greatest outcry is by those semi-State monopolies that practise it. The problem is not the increase in prices, but that the costs in these particular semi-State companies are too high. The VHI, the ESB, CIE and RTE and other quasi-monopolies operate in a small county which has in theory opened up to competition. In effect, there is minimal competition, duopolies and token competitors. The result is that competition is suppressed or does not exist at all and there is price fixing. Nobody has suggested that there is cartel between competitors in these utilities &ndash; if we can call them that &ndash; but there is an understanding. Nobody from one company picks up the telephone to fix the price with another and pretend there is competition. However, there is an understanding between these companies that is contrary to consumers' interests.</P>
    <P>It is welcome that the Government is aware of this aspect. In those particular utilities, there must be Government intervention to ensure competition. If that means radical intervention, so be it because it is necessary. I am not a free marketeer in the extreme sense in that I believe&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Ryan: Really.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Ross: No. I believe the State should not take over great industries and utilities as Senator Ryan does and, therefore, control competition which is anti-consumer. The only way to keep consumer prices down is to introduce the maximum amount of competition.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment recently acknowledged the serious problems with inward investment. I am open to correction but I understand that she said on the business news on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; that Ireland is no longer a competitive economy. The programme is probably too early for most of the Progressive Democrats Members to hear.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Minihan: We heard it the night before.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Ross: Senator Minihan hears it every day and every week. This was her response to the IDA report.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Dardis: Just because the Senator gets up early once a month does not mean he can be condescending to the rest of us who go home late.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Ross: This was at 7.10 a.m. which is even early for a farmer of Senator Dardis's sort.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Dardis: We have the milking done by then.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Ross: This was in response to the IDA report of the day before which stated we are losing jobs in IDA supported companies faster than we are creating them. This is very serious and is due to the fact that in the software industry where multinationals are involved, the pay for very highly skilled people is much higher than in places like India and China and we cannot compete. I was delighted that she said they are looking at other ways, such as research and development, and quality rather than quantity jobs, to restore competitiveness. I hope it is not an aspiration but a real development because with the strength of the euro the nation is in some trouble in this area.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Leyden: I welcome the Minister to the House and commend our colleagues in the Government for tabling the motion.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on her work on competition. Her work is evident in the establishment of the PIAB. I am a member of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business and I know insurance costs are a major contributory factor in the lack of competitiveness in many sectors compared to our competitors. The establishment of the PIAB will add greatly to competition in this market and will assist people in securing insurance at a more competitive rate.</P>
    <P>I commend our colleagues on the other side of the House for their new conversion to the name and shame campaign with the slogan &ldquo;Rip off Ireland, Fine Gael&rdquo;. I am not saying Fine Gael is ripping off Ireland but they did not do a bad job in that regard when they were in Government.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: The Government has been doing it for seven years now.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Leyden: Fine Gael was not too bad when it was in Government at doing a rip-off&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: Even the health service is being dismantled in the Senator's county, as we are well aware.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Leyden: We can certainly say that under a Fine Gael&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Dardis: They were the first to think of it.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: He did not follow through on his campaign.</P>
    
    <P>An Leas-Chathaoirleach: The Senator without interruption.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Leyden: It is the greatest compliment to a national movement that a Senator from that side of the House, as a consumer affairs spokesman, could give them a lead on this. I am genuinely delighted that Fine Gael has adopted our report.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: It did not take long for the Senator's former leader to&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>An Leas-Chathaoirleach: Senator Bannon.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: The Senator was not performing.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Leyden: Naming and shaming can be a risky game and it is always risky to name and shame in that regard.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: The Senator lost the plot.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Leyden: I hope the &ldquo;rip off Ireland&rdquo; campaign which the Senator's party has launched is getting some response and that he will be prepared to use this information in the interests of consumers&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: It is getting a wonderful response.</P>
    
    <P>An Leas-Chathaoirleach: Senator Bannon, allow Senator Leyden to speak without interruption.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Leyden: &mdash;and make it available to the people who can really do something about it, namely the Government.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: They are making a bad job of it so far, as the Senator is aware.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Leyden: The Senator's assistance is very much appreciated by us and we thank him as he has converted to a position which is&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: I am glad to see the Senator acknowledging his failure.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Leyden: On the cost of petrol&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: The Government hiked the price of that too.</P>
    
    <P>An Leas-Chathaoirleach: Senator Bannon, allow Senator Leyden to speak without interruption.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Leyden: Due to the name and shame campaign there was much competition in the retail prices of petrol and diesel. We found that the cheapest places were Castlebar, County Mayo, in the Senator's constituency, and Moate.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: What about Roscommon?</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Leyden: I am delighted that many retailers were able to adjust their prices following the publicity given to petrol and diesel prices.</P>
    <P>Tesco has entered the market and is perhaps a loss leader in respect of some of its retail outlets attached to supermarkets. In this regard, I am concerned about allegations about Tesco which have been published.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: The Senator made allegations which he did not retract.</P>
    
    <P>An Leas-Chathaoirleach: Senator Bannon, I know you are both from the same constituency but please allow Senator Leyden to continue.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Leyden: This is becoming very tiresome, but hopefully not for long. It is my wish that we will have separate constituencies and that I will not be receiving this tirade when I speak, as the Senator will have less interest in my position than he has now.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Fahey: After January.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Leyden: Yes, after January. We look forward to the Senator moving back to Westmeath and we wish him well.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Minihan: Is that an announcement?</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: I thought an independent commission had been established.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Leyden: That is true.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Dardis: The Senator is inviting trouble.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Leyden: It is obvious that Senator Bannon wants to go back over the Shannon as he has been there for quite some time.</P>
    
    <P>An Leas-Chathaoirleach: I ask Senator Leyden to address the Chair.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Leyden: The retailer's group, RGDATA, has called on the Competition Authority to investigate the very serious claims &ndash; they are only claims &ndash; which have been made in respect of the cost of vegetables supplied by the north County Dublin growers to Tesco, who have approximately 35% of the vegetable market in this region, a very high percentage. It would be anti-competitive if there was any pressure on producers not to provide their products to the Aldi and Lidl chain stores which have secured a very high percentage of the market. Both those chains are very competitive, but unfortunately a high percentage of their products is imported in bulk from other parts of Europe in particular. It is an open market, which we accept, but I encourage them, because there is no point in criticising them, to purchase more products from the Republic of Ireland. I know they are implementing that policy and I recommend it.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: Is the Senator no longer a European?</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Leyden: We have to look after our own patch.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: That is quite right.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Leyden: I encourage the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: The Senator is living in a little cuckoo land of his own.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Leyden: &mdash;to work in co-operation with Aldi and Lidl and suppliers to ensure they provide products at competitive prices to these chains. They are making a very big impact and are spreading throughout the country. If one goes into any of their stores one will see that they have a policy of a reduced number of checkouts. This is to encourage the perception that there are more customers there than is the case.</P>
    <P>They are making progress. I welcome competition but I also welcome more sales of Irish products. Tesco, in fairness, is establishing a branch in Roscommon where it is getting a great welcome from the public. Its store will be open next year where approximately 100 people will be employed. Tesco now tends to buy more Irish products which is important from the point of view of our sales.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Dardis: Senator Bannon would like to see those stores stocking Argentinian beef.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Leyden: I hope not.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: That is a comment that Senator Dardis has made.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Leyden: The Tánaiste and the Government should be commended on bringing down the rate of inflation to the level it is at today.</P>
    <P>I recall a period during my time in Government in the 1980s when the inflation rate was 24%. We inherited that from a short-lived coalition Government.</P>
    
    <P>An Leas-Chathaoirleach: The Senator has one minute left in which to speak.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Leyden: That is unfortunate as I was just getting into the matter.</P>
    
    <P>An Leas-Chathaoirleach: The Senator wasted a lot of the time.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Leyden: I remember&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: Yes, when he was a Minister.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: Some 24.3%.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Leyden: &mdash;negotiating in Holland with the Heineken group&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: He slipped into the Shannon.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Leyden: &mdash;on the purchase of Murphy's Brewery in Cork, when I was Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. I was acting with the IDA at the time. We were not successful, but it became very clear to me what inflation meant to companies the size of Heineken. One of the factors which was holding them back in a decision to come to Ireland at the time was the rate of inflation. We have succeeded in bringing down inflation to approximately 2.5%. It is a major achievement and in fairness to the Minister for Finance, the budget did not add to inflation in general. The price of drink was not increased. Petrol was increased in price slightly, but I hope there is competition in the market.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: What about all the other stealth taxes?</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Leyden: With the developments in Iraq the price of crude oil will fall as Iraq will be a major supplier of oil. With a settlement and tensions easing enough to allow a government to be formed there in the next 12 months, they will be very anxious to produce oil to enable them to be more competitive.</P>
    <P>I commend our colleagues in Government, Senators Dardis, Minihan, Morrissey and Kate Walsh, for tabling this motion and I assure them that we support it enthusiastically.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Ryan: The difficulty in politics always arises when people let a dogma take the place of pragmatism.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Dardis: Hear, hear.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Ryan: As a member of the political left, I concluded long ago that the 19th century nostrum of nationalising everything was neither necessary nor particularly useful in looking after either working people or society. I take a similar view of competition. Of course there are areas of life where competition is good. For instance it would be very good to have serious competition in the licence trade in Dublin, where Fianna Fáil has resolutely protected owners of large pub chains, at the expense of consumers, because they are major supporters of Fianna Fáil. We all know who they are.</P>
    <P>We watched the taxi regime in Dublin being defended by a succession of Fianna Fáil Ministers. I give former Minister of State, Bobby Molloy, full credit for being decisive in ending that. Some people come in here with brass necks and talk about competition while resolutely defending interest groups to which they are close. I am not talking about the Progressive Democrats, who have an attachment to competition. I think they are wrong in saying that competition in all areas is good.</P>
    <P>The nearest thing to a free competitive market in health care can be seen in the United States. It is the most expensive health care service in the world, consuming $1 in $7 of the gross national product of the richest country in the world. All indicators suggest that the American health care system is not better than that of those countries with regulated markets or markets where there is limited or no competition. Life expectancy in the United States is lower than in most of the countries in northern Europe. Infant mortality is scandalously high &ndash; perhaps 50% higher than the European average.</P>
    <P>We must be careful not to try to impose models on areas of activity where the model does not fit &ndash; the classic one being health care. Does anybody seriously believe we would have a better education service if every town had three national schools on the basis of the price people would pay for their children to get primary education? There are areas of life where competition is singularly inappropriate to bring about the quality of service people need.</P>
    <P>We are in a peculiar position in the case of electricity provision. We are told that industrial electricity costs are among the highest in Europe. However, every month there is a collective whinge from prospective investors who believe it is not economic to invest in electricity generation. There is yet another attempt ongoing at present. If we allegedly have the most efficient electricity service in Europe&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: We do not.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Ryan: &mdash;why is this the case? As Senator Mansergh said, we do not. The best indicator of the efficiency of the ESB is that the most ruthless market capitalists in the United States are prepared to loan large amounts of money to it at premium interest rates because they recognise the capacity of the ESB to deliver and pay them back. This has nothing to do with having a monopoly, which has gone. It is because, contrary to what Senator Ross said, it happens to be an extraordinarily efficient organisation.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: Hear, hear.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Ryan: There is a balancing of price in the ESB in the sense that while industrial costs are perhaps higher than some would wish, domestic electricity is among the lowest priced in the developed world. What have we decided to do? We decided to reduce the price to industry. The famous term is &ldquo;rebalancing&rdquo;, which the regulator has used occasionally. Rebalancing means changing the burden of the cost of electricity by taking it away from business and giving it to consumers. This does not make any improvement in our overall competitiveness. It simply changes the burden. We have a very good electricity generating system run with extraordinary expertise by very dedicated public servants, who are paid perhaps half what middle ranking officials of the least competitive sector of the Irish economy &ndash; the banking sector &ndash; believe themselves to be worth.</P>
    <P>Competition is grand for the sale of televisions. I spoke at a Rotary meeting in Cork recently. A man told me he was in the oil business and had 40 competitors. If he were in that business on his own he would be a millionaire. There are areas of life where competition is very good and healthy and where it would be very useful in this country. I refer to the legal profession and others, which dress themselves up in alleged concerns about professional ethics and standards while being nothing more than closed shops protecting themselves from anything as nasty as price competition.</P>
    <P>I have no problem with the Government advancing competition where it is an appropriate response and where the market really exists. However, there are many areas where this is the least preferable way of dealing with it. There are other ways, for example cost benchmarking &ndash; I do not mean pay benchmarking &ndash; to compare ourselves with other countries and give quasi-monopolies targets to be in the bottom quartile. I would love our banks to be subject to serious competition; they are not. Any system, which can pay people 0.5% interest for their deposits and charge 12.5% interest on loans, is not in a serious competitive market. This is a far bigger threat to our competitiveness than the price of electricity.</P>
    
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern): I thank the Senators for raising these matters this evening. The National Competitiveness Council's annual competitiveness report 2003 and the Competitiveness Challenge 2003 report were published on 1 December 2003. These reports provide an extremely useful insight into Ireland's current competitiveness status as they assist in highlighting key areas to be addressed in meeting the challenges to Ireland's international competitiveness. These reports have been given immediate attention by the Government both in the context of this year's budget and through the Government's commitment to consider and give effect to the NCC recommendations.</P>
    <P>The Government continues to take steps to strengthen competitiveness across the economy and to implement specific measures to tackle cost pressures in key areas for Irish industry. As we are all aware, one of the areas most severely affected by price rises in excess of the rate of inflation is insurance. Almost every business in Ireland has been adversely affected by increasing premiums and as a result, this has fuelled Ireland's inflation rate. The Government is in the process of introducing a programme to fundamentally reform the insurance market to tackle the issue of high premiums, which have had a detrimental effect both on consumers and on business competitiveness. The Government is committed to continuing with the reform programme and bringing about improvements in the functioning of the insurance market.</P>
    <P>The National Competitiveness Council stated in both its recently published reports that Ireland's immediate priority must be to slow the growth of prices and costs. The Government is committed to enhancing Ireland's competitiveness status and an essential component of this is to provide a business environment with low inflation. Earlier this year the Taoiseach and Tánaiste underlined a target of getting inflation down to 2% and the latest figures from the Central Statistics Office for November show that inflation is now at 2.2%. This will help stabilise firms' costs and provide them with a solid competitive business environment from which they can successfully compete on both domestic and international markets.</P>
    <P>However, we cannot afford to be complacent. We will continue to further reduce our inflation rate bringing it into line with our EU partners and other competitors. In this context, the recent budget demonstrated that keeping inflation low was a key priority. The Government has avoided inflation-fuelling taxes in line with the requests of the National Competitiveness Council. The budget, furthermore, reflects the Government's commitment to support job creation and investment in Ireland. We have introduced a series of new measures so that the tax system further supports initiative, risk-taking and innovation.</P>
    <P>The new measures include the introduction of a research and development tax credit, the removal of stamp duty on the registration of patents and the extension and improvement of the business expansion and seed capital schemes. The National Competitiveness Council has presented the Government with a set of key priority areas in respect of which progress needs to be monitored. When the Government discussed both of the council's reports at its meeting on 25 November last, it was agreed that the Government will consider Ireland's competitiveness status every six months. This consideration will involve discussions on the recommendations of both NCC reports. The Government also agreed to establish a monitoring process to consider and track progress on the implementation of the council's recommendations.</P>
    <P>The Government sees competition as the lifeblood of a vibrant economy. It is committed to removing unwarranted constraints on competition in all sectors of the economy. It will place consumers at the top of the policy agenda. Increased competition has a critical role to play in helping to keep prices under control. In the aviation industry, for example, competition from low cost airlines substantially reduced the cost of air travel. While much needs to be done to encourage competition in some sectors of the economy, the Government is working hard to bring about changes.</P>
    <P>Competition is effective if it provides a real choice to consumers, who are then prepared to exercise that choice to seek out the best value for the products or services they require. The Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs launched its price awareness campaign last month to stimulate greater price awareness among consumers. Surveys conducted by the office as part of the campaign revealed substantial variations in prices across a wide range of goods, such as potatoes, petrol, insurance and CDs, within localised areas. The clear message from the surveys is that consumers should shop around for the best deal.</P>
    <P>The effective promotion of competition is not possible without an effective legal framework. Sound competition legislation contributes to competitiveness by penalising anti-competitive and anti-consumer behaviour and by protecting the competitive process in all sectors of the economy. The Tánaiste, who has overall responsibility for competition and consumer matters, sponsored the Competition Act 2002 for this reason. The 2002 Act reformed and modernised previous legislation relating to competition policy and merger control. In particular, it increased the penalties for serious cartel activities such as price fixing, enhanced the independence of the Competition Authority and transferred responsibility for controlling mergers and acquisitions from the Minister to the authority. More enforcement powers, such as increased jail terms for hard-core competition offences such as price-fixing and market-sharing, have been given to the authority. New powers of arrest and detention have been introduced.</P>
    <P>As a consequence of an arrangement between the Competition Authority and the Garda bureau of fraud investigation, two detective sergeants have been seconded on a whole-time basis to assist in the investigation of criminal breaches of the Act. The authority has more civil cases before the courts than ever before. It has settled a number of investigations on the basis of undertakings received by businesses alleged to have breached competition law. In the past ten days, the authority has announced settlements in investigations involving <i>The Irish Times,</i> the <i>Irish Independent</i> and Statoil. The authority received assurances about future practices in respect of the resale price of daily newspapers and consumer petrol pricing policies.</P>
    <P>The authority's financial and staffing resources have increased substantially in recent years. Staffing levels increased from 29 in 2000 to 47 in 2003 and the authority's budget more than doubled in this time. Part 3 of the 2002 Act, which deals with the control of mergers and acquisitions, commenced on 1 January 2003. Under these provisions, responsibility for controlling mergers transferred from the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the Competition Authority. Decisions on mergers have been taken by the Competition Authority since 1 January last, therefore, solely on the basis of competition criteria. Special provisions relating to media mergers were also included in the Act.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises that restrictions on competition arising from regulations can impose substantial costs on the economy. Such restrictions can have adverse effects on the international competitiveness of Irish business. The Government is committed to addressing sectors where barriers to entry or restrictive practices exist. A high level group on regulation, under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach, oversees the implementation of our response to the 2001 OECD report on regulatory reform and advises the Government accordingly. The Government's commitment to better regulation stems from the recognition that if State regulation is excessive in quantity or of poor quality, it will be an unnecessary burden on economic and social activity. By minimising regulatory barriers, we can make it easier for entrepreneurs to avail of business opportunities and to enter markets and we can achieve greater efficiency and choice for consumers.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned that the Competition Act 2002 enhanced the Competition Authority's enforcement powers. The authority is challenging anti-competitive arrangements by initiating legal actions via its enforcement role, either on its own initiative or on foot of complaints and, in a wider role, by studying various sectors of the economy from the perspective of competition. In deciding on the sectors to be studied, the authority has taken account of the importance of the sector for the economy, the indicators of the level of competition, the existence of public or private barriers to entry and the general public interest.</P>
    <P>The Competition Authority is involved in studies of three separate sectors of the economy &ndash; the professions, the banking sector and the insurance sector. The authority's studies of the professions involve a comprehensive study of the medical, legal and construction professions. The studies specifically cover medical practitioners, dentists, veterinary surgeons, optometrists, solicitors, barristers, engineers and architects. The authority will produce separate reports on each individual profession. It is envisaged that this process will conclude in 2004.</P>
    <P>The Competition Authority has also undertaken a study of competition in the provision of banking services. It has published a consultation paper as part of this study. To date, the process has involved narrowing the focus of the study to a number of key markets for further study. The markets that have been chosen are personal current accounts and loans to small and medium sized enterprises. The markets will be analysed from the perspectives of barriers to entry and degrees of rivalry. The study will identify the barriers to entry and analyse their origin, their intended effects and their actual effects. It will make recommendations to have disproportionate barriers to entry removed, where appropriate. The study will identify and analyse industry practices, legislation or administrative practices that limit the degree of rivalry in the marketplace to the detriment of consumers. It is expected that the authority's report on the banking sector will be completed in the third quarter of 2004, although an interim report prepared by the LECG economic consultants will be released in the summer of 2004. All interested parties will be invited by the authority to comment on the report.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Competition Authority has undertaken a study of competition issues in the non-life insurance market, with particular reference to motor insurance, employers' liability and public liability. These sectors are being analysed from the perspectives of barriers to entry and the degree of rivalry. The authority intends to produce a final report during the second quarter of 2004. An initial report, which is expected by February 2004, will set out the preliminary results of the research and allow for comments by interested parties.</P>
    <P>Competition is essential in all sectors of the economy if we are to achieve low prices and fairness for consumers and a level playing field for businesses. This is important if we are to improve our overall competitiveness. I hope I have demonstrated the Government's commitment to this end.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern. It seems that he has shifted negligence for this country's lack of competitiveness to the Tánaiste. By acknowledging in his speech the usefulness of the annual report of the National Competitiveness Council, he can be said to have pointed out that the Government has not met its duty to bring down inflation. I would like to comment on Senator Leyden, who seems to be living in a little cuckoo land of his own.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: Senator Leyden is not in the House.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: He was in the House when he made his comments.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: He is not here now. No reference should be made to absent Members of the House.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: If Senator Ross, who also lives in a little world of his own, wants to come to my part of the world he will have to get a pair of designer wellies to see exactly what Government policies have done to the midlands region in recent years. I refer in particular to rural areas. We have seen the closure of small country shops, pubs and other important services which kept the fabric of rural Ireland intact for many years. That has gone. One hears about the national spatial strategy and the decentralisation plan&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: It fits in very well. That is what the Senator wanted to say.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: &mdash;but they are in a heap. I second the amendment tabled by Fine Gael that Seanad Éireann condemns the failure of the Government's policies to maintain Ireland's competitiveness as evidenced by the substantial contribution which Government stealth taxes&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: The amendment has already been seconded.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: I support it. There is no doubt whatsoever that the motion is worthy in its aspirations. However, I cannot support the hypocrisy of the Progressive Democrats who tabled it. &ldquo;Low prices and fairness for consumers&rdquo; allied to an increase in &ldquo;overall efficiency for the economy&rdquo; are admirable goals shared by everyone in the House. However, as we know, there is a great distance between fine-sounding words and effective action, of which we have not had much over the last seven years during which Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have been in government. They have not demonstrated our competitiveness to the general public. When the annual competitiveness report for 2003 was launched, I called on the Order of Business for a debate. It very much acknowledges the Government's negligence in the area.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: A lot done. A lot more to do. That is all.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: This is the most expensive country in Europe, while Dublin is the 21st most expensive capital city in the world. Urgent remedial action must be considered as a priority by the Government. Our economic welfare is not negotiable. There is real and justifiable anger throughout the country that what money is left in people's pockets after the Government has taken its pickings in taxes, including stealth taxes, is not going far enough. There is anger that consumers are continually paying over the odds for inferior services and that the Government is doing absolutely nothing about it. That is very evident. Consumers have been continually ripped off since we leapt into the euro bandwagon. Prices are being pulled out of the air, with &ldquo;The sky is the limit&rdquo; appearing to be the motto of many. Our citizens and visitors&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Dardis: Bring back the punt.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: You must get into bed with Tony Blair and George Bush on that one.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: Will the Senator, please, speak through the Chair?</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: Our citizens and visitors are being ripped off in equal measure. One can go around businesses in any part of the country. There is evidence of rip-offs in many hotels, bed and breakfast establishments and restaurants. In any other part of Europe one can avail of cheaper meals.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Dardis: Perhaps the Senator wants them closed down in rural areas.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: There is an insurance crisis, of which the Government seems unaware. The spiralling cost of premia is forcing hauliers and hackney and taxi drivers out of business.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: We are debating a Bill on the matter tomorrow.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: I have pointed out that it is happening in the Leader's constituency, in which some hackney and taxi drivers are being quoted premia of &euro;24,000 or &euro;28,000 a year. This is forcing them out of business.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: There are many more taxis on the streets than there used to be.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: The Progressive Democrats must not have been looking at what is happening nationwide to table such a motion. These are important services, and we need people involved in them. The more, the merrier. I know that here in the capital, where there are a fair number of taxis, they are all being used.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: There is a great taxi service in Tipperary too.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: Senator Bannon to continue without interruption.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: Insurance prices have doubled in the last 12 months.</P>
    <P>Competition is urgently needed in the health sector. Doctors, dentists and other health care providers must be as open about their charges as any other business. I pointed out last week on the Adjournment that for a simple signature doctors were seeking approximately &euro;65. That is just to sign the application form of a disabled person. The Government must look into this. When he was here last week, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy O'Malley, told me that he admitted his responsibility in the area and that he would look into the matter. He has done very little to date. The Minister did not even refer to it.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Minihan: Yes, he did. Did the Senator listen to his speech?</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: Mobile phone charges in Ireland are deemed the highest in the world. Car manufacturers are ripping off Irish drivers by charging buyers up to 40% more than the prices that they set for other EU countries. According to the European Central Bank, businesses in Ireland are being charged higher interest rates than comparable companies in other EU member states. A survey of approximately 1,800 credit institutions across 12 EU countries showed that overdraft and business loan rates were higher in Ireland than elsewhere. As I said, insurance costs have risen by over 100% in the last two years, while business costs generally have risen at over three times the rate of inflation over the same period.</P>
    <P>The Competition Authority's strategy statement for 2003 to 2005 states, &ldquo;Credible enforcement against anti-competitive behaviour is important to maintaining an environment in which markets benefit customers&rdquo;. Fine Gael's rip-off Ireland website is a testament to such anti-competitive and anti-consumer behaviour. The Government is throwing its citizens to the financial sharks. There is evidence of this every day of the week.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: The Senator's time is up.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: The budget last week will add to inflation.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: Very little.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: We see further uncompetitiveness being dished around by various companies and so on&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: Will the Senator, please, conclude?</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: &mdash;while indirect taxes and charges are being introduced almost every day of our waking lives. All that one need do is read the newspapers or listen to the media and one will see those charges.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: The Senator's time is up. He must conclude.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: I will do so. Medium and small businesses are outraged&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: The Senator must conclude.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: &mdash;at the rate increases. In some counties in the last 12 months rates have gone up by 25%.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: Seanad speeches are getting inflated too.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: I could give examples of three or four counties in the west or midlands where rates have risen by up to 50%.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Minihan: If competition is good for consumers, the economy and society, at least I agree with Senator Bannon on that point. It works. Those of us who favour competition as a core value have won that argument. From air travel to radio stations to mobile phones, and, lately, even Friday night chat shows, consumers have evidence that competition delivers for them.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: Eamon Dunphy.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Minihan: The question about competition is no longer why but why not. The onus is now on anyone to show why we cannot have competition. This goes across the board. Competition is a force for value for money and efficiency. It is no threat to anyone except protected private interests &ndash; often interests which are well hidden or masquerade under a public interest disguise. The days of artificial monopolies are over &ndash; no one wants them back. This is well understood by the public. Even if some political parties and others are slow learners, I welcome signs that the light has recently gone on in the heads of Labour Party members about the benefits to consumers of competition. I am still not convinced however &ndash; I do not think the public is convinced &ndash; of the strength of their convictions or understanding of competition.</P>
    <P>I have listened with interest to Fine Gael Senators speaking on that party's amendment. What was clearly not well understood by its members was what competition was. They have mixed up the words &ldquo;competition&rdquo; and &ldquo;competitiveness&rdquo;. Is it some clever new parliamentary tactic to table an amendment to a motion about the wrong subject or use a word which just sounds like another in the hope of making an impact?</P>
    
    <P>Mr. B. Hayes: No.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Minihan: It is a pity that the Senator did not read the motion. Had he done so, he might have got the right topic.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: Senator Minihan to continue without interruption.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. B. Hayes: It is Christmas. The Senator should throw away the script.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Minihan: The Fine Gael Party is not the greatest shot at the best of times, but tonight its Members have not even aimed at the correct target. They should at least have read the correct motion before tabling their amendment. Opposition Members referred to sound bites and asked if we are serious about the motion. Are they serious about their amendment, when they did not even read the motion in the first instance? The proposer of the amendment left the House when this matter was brought to his attention.</P>
    <P>Competition contributes to the overall competitiveness of the economy. However, competition is not competitiveness. Let us be clear about that and debate the correct subject. Competition is about fair and functioning markets, open pricing and choice for consumers. For something so obviously good, it is still surprising that it took people in Ireland so long to learn to embrace competition. The European Union was a great help in this regard because it put competition policy at the centre of creating the Single Market. Far from being an import from the American model of economy and society, competition is a core part of the EU Single Market. This shows the foolishness of the accusation in <i>The Irish Times</i> today that the Tánaiste wants to import some notional US-style neo-liberalism against the Taoiseach's European inclination. Critics of the EU on the hard left, including many who opposed the Nice treaty, accused the Union of being a neo-liberal, big business project. They are right in one regard only, namely, that the EU favours a functioning and fair open market economy and vigorously enforces competition policy to this end. The Tánaiste, the Taoiseach and the Government do likewise.</P>
    <P>To be against competition is discredited and old fashioned. Most people work in competitive situations and in competition. They are not afraid of it because it is normal. This is the aspect that opponents of the plan to have competition between airports do not understand. Competition is part of normal working life for most people in Ireland. I am convinced, for example, that Cork Airport has a bright future and will thrive as a result of being free to compete. This policy did not come a day too soon.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: Those in Government will find it difficult to get rid of all the people to whom it gave jobs in the past.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Minihan: If Senator Bannon wishes to speak to the motion, he should ensure he is referring to the correct subject.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: Senator Bannon has already spoken. Senator Minihan should speak to the motion and address his remarks through the Chair.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. B. Hayes: We will speak to any Member we like.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Minihan: Cork Airport has been waiting for freedom to compete for a number of years. In 2003 the decision has finally been made to allow it to stand on its own. I have no doubt that people at Cork Airport will embrace and relish competition. I am convinced there will be dramatic results.</P>
    <P>For this reason alone, the Government's competition scorecard for 2003 shows a massive positive. It deserves congratulations and the Progressive Democrats will be shouting &ldquo;encore&rdquo; in the years ahead in terms of the introduction of further pro-competition policies. I will be happy to debate this motion again when Fine Gael comes to understand the core issue involved&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Mr. B. Hayes: Did the Senator read the Minister of State's speech? We are not the only ones to use the word &ldquo;competitiveness&rdquo; in this debate.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Minihan: &mdash;and puts forward an amendment we can debate.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. B. Hayes: The Senator should read the speech.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Minihan: On Senator Bannon's comments about the medical profession&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: Senator Dardis knows what is in the Minister of State's speech.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Minihan: &mdash;he stated that the Minister of State did not refer to it. However, I must inform him that, on the second last page of the speech it is clearly stated that the authority has embarked on a comprehensive study of the medical, legal and construction professions. Not only did the Fine Gael Senators not read the motion, they have not even listened to the debate.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: Why have the problems to which I referred not been resolved?</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: Order, please. Senator Bannon made his contribution and should refrain from interrupting.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Dardis: But the Senator is great gas.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: This is not a House of gas, it is the Seanad.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Minihan: I support the motion. Competition has been successful in this country and consumers have benefited from it. As we continue to move in that direction, consumers will make further gains. When referring to the Fine Gael rip off Ireland website, the appropriate part to use is Fine Gael RIP.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Bannon: What about the Progressive Democrats being the B team of Fianna Fáil?</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: Senator Bannon, please.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Henry: I shall try to bring some peace and calm to the debate. Competition is very important and I read the report with great interest. However, one area which was not addressed in any great depth was that of retaining trained personnel within the economy. We have made major efforts to promote businesses involved in the pharmaceutical, chemical and information technology areas, which rely heavily on trained personnel. I fully supported the Minister for Finance's moves on individualisation in respect of tax having, as I stated at the time, suffered being described by a member of the Revenue Commissioners as being the same as a wholly owned subsidiary of my husband when I complained about the amount of tax I was paying. It is a pity the Minister has not made further efforts in this area. We must try to ensure that we retain within the economy the people we are now training at second and third level in science and technology.</P>
    <P>There have been many reports on equity in third level education and efforts are made to ensure that employment is fair. The Houses recently passed the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill but it will have little effect if child care facilities are not available in the various industries or businesses we are discussing. I suggest that the Minister might try to remove from the economy what is described as the &ldquo;churn&rdquo; factor. This is where people, generally women, are trained up to a certain level and employed in industry or business. These individuals are then lost because they leave employment, perhaps for domestic reasons, for a short period and there are no retraining methods to facilitate their return.</P>
    <P>We do not have many life-long learning schemes. Some years ago I was privileged to be given an honorary degree by the University of Ulster. At the conferring ceremony, I was amazed to discover that many of those receiving undergraduate degrees were nearly the same age as me.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Dardis: The Senator is very young.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Henry: I thank Senator Dardis. It was good to see the level of retraining in which those on the opposite side of the Border were engaged at the time.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Government can take action in respect of the schemes to which I refer, particularly in the areas of technology and science and engineering. The Department of Trade and Industry in the United Kingdom recently became so concerned about the matter that it compiled a report, so there is no need for us to commission one. One of the women involved in its compilation, Dr. Gill Stephens, famed for discovering Viagra and worldwide research director of Pfizer, a company of importance to this country, spoke in Ireland last week about the importance to our economy of trying to retain people we have trained. That is a matter which is worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>The Government should try to provide more support in these areas. The spirit is willing, but the flesh has been rather weak. Further efforts have not been made in respect of tax breaks for child care or the care of the elderly. I hope the Minister for Finance can do something in this regard in the next budget. The loss of trained workers in any part of the economy is a serious problem.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Mooney: I am pleased our colleagues in the Progressive Democrats have tabled this motion on a matter that has been raised on the Order of Business on several occasions by various Members on all sides of the House. While we all tend to focus on the same issues, they are equally important in the retelling. One such matter is that of pricing. Elements of the retail sector are ripping off consumers on a regular basis. They are charging exorbitant prices for goods that can be bought more competitively in other outlets because they are getting away with it.</P>
    <P>It is quite extraordinary for a country with a proud tradition of speaking up for itself and of ensuring people's rights are not trampled upon that when it comes to purchasing something out of the family budget, we do not shop around as the Tanáiste advised some months ago. When the Tanáiste gave that sensible advice, echoing I suggest her rural background and that of those of us from rural backgrounds who were brought up to believe that every penny counted, she was pilloried in some sections of the media. Editorials in the<i> Irish Independent</i> guffawed at the thought of the Deputy Prime Minister suggesting people should shop around for good value. That brought home to me how parochial we can be and how, time and again, we miss the point when a good Government such as this one makes eminently suitable proposals. Such assertions are not properly researched, assessed or analysed. The knee-jerk reaction that if it is coming from a Fianna Fáil-PD Government it cannot be any good immediately comes into play.</P>
    <P>It is even more extraordinary that since making the Tánaiste made that statement a plethora of statistics have poured out, in the main from the Director of Consumer Affairs, illustrating the gross disparities right across consumer pricing. The very same newspapers which pilloried the Tanáiste six months ago for her advice are now highlighting these disparities and advising their readers to shop around. I am glad the Government highlighted this matter during the past couple of months. I hope the Competition Authority will look beyond Statoil and the insurance industry in this regard. There is no doubt but that the leisure and textile industries at retail level have questions to answer. As somebody involved in the music business, I acknowledge that the conglomerates offer special discounts on specific products from time to time.</P>
    <P>I recently went into a retail store in Liffey Valley shopping centre to purchase a DVD of a movie released some 12 months ago in the cinemas. The particular DVD I wanted was priced at &euro;19.99. I decided to leave purchasing it for another day and two days later when I went into HMV in Grafton Street to purchase it I discovered the same DVD in that store cost &euro;27.99, a difference of almost &euro;8. These were two mega-stores, not small retail outlets which would have some justification for such practice. They were overcharging because they know they can get away with it. There were no special discounts involved; this was a mainstream product on a shelf with a wide variety of others in a particular category of movies. They are able to charge such prices because they know people will pay them and not shop around. The same is true in the case of CDs, videos and PlayStation games. I endorse the Tanáiste's advice to shop around, particularly in the lead up to Christmas.</P>
    <P>One of the three priorities referred to by the Government relates to banking. I am grateful to our colleague, Senator Ross, who in his eminently readable business section of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> some weeks ago cited examples, relating to the transfer of euro within the eurozone and the operation of a cartel among the major banks, of charges for the transfer of euro from one European country to another. I thought such practices had been abolished with the introduction of the euro. I understood the banks were no longer in a position to charge for such transactions. They can and do, as we all know, charge for currency transfers outside the eurozone. I did not think such charges applied if one was sending a cheque or bankdraft for &euro;100 from Ireland to France or Germany. Not only do they charge for the process, they also delay it. I plead with the Government, when investigating the banking sector under competition law, to consider that area in concert with its European Union partners. This matter cannot be dealt with unilaterally.</P>
    <P>My next question is not an original one. Why is it that consumer goods are cheaper in the United States than in the European Union? What is the difference? Surely, it is not about economies of scale because there are 350 to 400 million consumers in the European Union. The Single European Act which has been in operation since 1987 deals with the free movement of goods, people and services. We are now aware, with the introduction of the euro, of the existence of disparities in some European economies. The issue of why disparities are so large will be a challenge to the EU.</P>
    <P>Senator Minihan referred in eloquent detail to the underlying ethos that the European Union is competition driven. Other questions such as whether this is attributable to over-regulation in the European Union need to be asked. If so, Europe could take a lead from Ireland. This Government has adopted what could loosely be referred to as a lightness of touch in the context of regulation, an issue the Minister mentioned in his speech.</P>
    <P>All politics being local, competition in the external sense is fine but within the internal economy that is Ireland, there remains gross disparities between east and west, especially in the area of infrastructure. I again put down a marker for the need to accelerate the infrastructural development of the peripheral regions. If we are to have a truly competitive economy internationally, there must be a degree of parity within the internal economy which will benefit not just one section or specific region. There have been massive and very welcome infrastructural developments along the east coast. We must also consider the peripheral regions if we are to be truly competitive.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. B. Hayes: I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his fine address. There is a suggestion from the other side that we have put down the wrong amendment. If that is the case, the Government has responded in the most substantial way possible &ndash; the Minister's speech refers to everything said in the amendment. That is one example of how the goal posts can be moved in the context of a debate. When Senators Bannon and Minihan lock horns, we get the best out of them and they are put under pressure from their respective research departments.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, I had an opportunity to visit Australia &ndash; I mentioned this to Senator Dardis who visited that country some time ago &ndash; where the prices in terms of goods and services are astonishing by comparison to Europe. That underlines the additional added costs in the European economy that must be addressed. Food and fuel prices in Australia are exactly half those charged in Ireland. I accept that salaries there are lower than in the eurozone.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a number of suggestions which might be of assistance in dealing with the pricing issue. We should put in place a local price regulator with responsibility to name and shame on local prices. It would be good practice for the regulator to outline the prices he or she had seen for the price of diesel or petrol, or the cost of a visit to a doctor's surgery in, for example, the South Dublin County Council area. This could be done on a county by county basis. It would be the regulator's responsibility to investigate prices and publish local data on goods and services.</P>
    <P>I agree with what the Tánaiste said in recent months: there is a need for people to be price aware. For this to happen there must be better displaying of prices. While rights are provided by the Legislature, consumers will not stand up for themselves. The publication of prices in the local press by a regulator would heighten the responsibility of consumers to shop around for the best possible price. We must be firm on businesses which do not display prices; this bad habit must be addressed.</P>
    <P>I recently compared the cost of an extension to my house with that of an extension to my sister's house. She lives in a much more affluent part of Dublin city than I do. I was astonished to discover that in the alleged more affluent parts of Dublin the price of simple construction work was double what it was in other parts of the city. Those who live in these alleged more affluent areas will have to demand that prices charged by contractors are driven down. They will have to use their muscle and shop around to get the best possible price.</P>
    <P>The findings of a recent survey of big and small businesses in the south Dublin chamber of commerce area, the third biggest chamber of commerce in the country, have highlighted the problem of insurance. I know the Government is aware of this issue. This is stifling business and having a disproportionately large effect in the SME sector. While I know there have been some welcome developments, the Government will really have to tackle this issue. It is pricing jobs out of the market. Jobs are being lost in small businesses. The Government will have to take a keener interest in this matter.</P>
    <P>I commend the amendment to the House. I hope that by raising this issue we will constantly monitor and review the Government's performance in this area. Unfortunately, most of the inflation generated in the economy is domestically produced. It stems from Government services and the semi-State sector constantly pushing up the price of the old reliables. The best way to keep a lid on prices is by ensuring such incremental charges are kept to a minimum. As it stands, they are fuelling the gap between direct and indirect taxation.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Dardis: I thank the Senators who have contributed to this useful debate. It is a pity Senator Bannon is not here to listen to Senator Hayes as at least he came up with some ideas as to what should be done, particularly the idea of a local regulator. It is good to receive constructive proposals on future policy.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on his address to the House. When speaking about the 2003 report of the National Competitiveness Council on the competitiveness challenge, he said this would be given immediate attention by the Government, both in the context of the budget and the Government's commitment to consider and give effect to the NCC recommendations. It is important that such reports are acted upon. I, therefore, welcome the Government's response.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn made the central point: the primacy of the consumer must be the priority. This is delivered by competition. Competition delivers benefits for the consumer. This feeds into the economy and, in turn, into competitiveness which improves our relative position internationally.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes referred to inflation. One of my pre-budget fears was that Government policy might feed into inflation. In our debate on the budget I said I was glad to note the Government input into inflation was minimal.</P>
    <P>Several Members have referred to The Competitive Challenge 2003 report which states, &ldquo;According to the Forfás consumer pricing report 2003, roughly 73% of total Irish inflation originated in the services sector during the period 2000-02&rdquo;. This reinforces the point Senator Bannon made about people having to pay &euro;60 to have a medical card application form signed. While the retail sector is frequently thought of as being the one driving &ldquo;rip-off Ireland&rdquo;, the services sector seems to be the bigger culprit.</P>
    <P>We must accept that there are certain essential utilities which are the function of central government, or at least a state apparatus. The question is how competition can be introduced within this sector and how the sector can be regulated. The experience in England indicates that the privatisation of the water supply network has not been a success, to put it mildly. The issue is how such a service can be delivered to the best effect in order that competitiveness of industry and Ireland as a whole is assisted.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn is correct to say there are issues other than price at play in the retail sector &ndash; quality, service and other factors are also important. However, competition delivers these and it is left to the consumer to decide the balance they afford to price as opposed to quality and <i>vice versa.</i> Senator Leyden raised the practice of a supermarket like Aldi. While I am not suggesting the quality of goods in Aldi is inferior, it has given an outlet to people who regard price as more important than quality and service. Supermarket chains such as Aldi give options which is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>We must prevent dominance. This is where competition legislation has been most effective. The Minister referred to the recent Bill. It is important that an independent assessment is made of competition criteria regarding mergers. I also accept the point made about the media.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan said it would be useful if a number of schools in a community competed on a private basis. While his idea is correct, there is already such competition at primary and secondary school level. There are certain schools to which parents want to send their children as they are considered to be better than others in the area. There is competition whichis based on how staff carry out their work.</P>
    <P>As the Senator concerned is not here to defend himself, I will not name him but it seems he has reached the point where there is not a pub, petrol pump, shop, farmer or hackney in rural Ireland. When he had finished talking about the price of petrol, one would have thought there were also no cars there.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: We still have Senator Bannon.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. B. Hayes: Thanks be to God.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Coghlan: Senator Dardis wants to keep Senator Bannon in rural Ireland.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Minihan: Maybe we should have no Senators in rural Ireland.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Dardis: I, the Cathaoirleach and others have expressed concerns on many occasions about the future of rural Ireland and the decline in farming and numbers of farmers. However, many positive things have also happened, largely because people are able to make positive choices and move into the urban areas to which they want to move. They are not locked into poverty in rural areas, which was the case for so long.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. B. Hayes: The new Calcutta.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Dardis: What is Fine Gael's consumer website called?</P>
    
    <P>Mr. B. Hayes: It is <i>www.ripoff.ie</i></P>
    
    <P>Mr. Dardis: RIP for Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>On competition policy, it is worth reiterating that the Annual Competitiveness Report 2003 states:</P>
    <P>Facilitating markets to operate efficiently by ensuring adequate competition is vital to driving down the cost of doing business in Ireland. Market entry by new firms and a high degree of rivalry between existing firms pushes other companies to lower costs, improve quality and service, and create new products and processes. Intense competition in domestic markets is a powerful stimulus to the creation and persistence of international competitive advantage.</P>
    <P>In other words, if competition is dealt with, international competitiveness will improve. The Annual Competitiveness Report 2003 also states: &ldquo;Policies that undermine competition, innovation and dynamism among companies represent the most common and most profound error in government policy towards industry.&rdquo; Senator Bannon made the point that we were not making any steps forward. However, the independent assessment states that the Competition Act 2002 was a significant step forward in enhancing Irish competition law and strengthening the powers of the Competition Authority. I commend the motion to the House.</P>

    <P>An Leas-Chathaoirleach: I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Malley, and I welcome Councillor Hilary Quinlan of Waterford, who is in the Visitors Gallery.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Browne: I ask the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment what progress has been made in securing replacement jobs in the Carlow area. Unfortunately, we have seen a steady decline in jobs in the Carlow area in recent months and almost every week we hear of small scale job losses. We lost 83 places on the community employment scheme in the last year, while Comerama, a factory in Castlecomer, has lost almost 200 jobs. We suffered job losses in Athy in Peerless Rugs two or three years ago and we lost jobs in Braun in July 2002. Recently we were also informed that the very successful Trek factory in Carlow is to move operations to eastern Germany.</P>
    <P>I can remember no new major industry coming to Carlow. I was born in 1973, which was the last time the IDA brought a major industry to Carlow of the likes of Braun and Lapple. While we have a new IDA business park, at present all we have in it is a beautiful fountain and, more recently, two caravans. People in Carlow are very disappointed that things are not going to plan and they are baffled because they feel they have everything in Carlow. We are both far enough from and near enough to Dublin and we have schools, recreational facilities and other assets for quality of life, which is why Carlow was so successful in the decentralisation process, getting the headquarters of Teagasc and a Department.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the news on decentralisation, we need new industry in Carlow because with decentralisation one is merely relocating existing personnel and jobs. One is not creating new jobs and there is a crying need in Carlow to secure jobs for graduates. I was amazed to learn recently that only 7% of Carlow IT graduates go on to work in Carlow. I do not expect 100% of Carlow IT graduates to stay in Carlow but I would like to see a higher percentage having the opportunity to do so if that is what they wish, instead of being forced to move to larger cities or abroad. The job losses in the Castlecomer area, Athy, Carlow town, rural Carlow and from the community employment scheme add to the difficulty of getting replacement jobs.</P>
    <P>I compliment the county enterprise board, which celebrates its tenth anniversary this week, on the work it has done in this area and its success in encouraging much small indigenous industry in Carlow. I want this Government to prioritise Carlow for future IDA-funded plants. Recently, we saw eBay being pushed towards Athlone although it ended up going to Blanchardstown. I would like to see a similar company or one such as Intel coming to Carlow. We have seen the positive effect Intel has had in Kildare since it was set up. We need something similar in Carlow.</P>
    <P>We have a fantastic site available on the outskirts of Carlow town and the new N9 motorway from Kilcullen to Waterford will provide excellent transport facilities. Carlow also has enhanced rail facilities which make it attractive as a commuter town. It has the necessary infrastructure in terms of schools and while it may lack facilities in the health services area, there are plans for a private hospital. The Minister of State may be able to expand tonight on the health strategy proposal for three health diagnostic centres in the country. Hopefully, one of those will come to Carlow which is the only county without a general hospital. If we get that, Carlow will have everything to offer prospective employers and employees.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister of State's reply. I hope the Government will market Carlow and attract high-skill jobs and companies such as commercial banks, which will provide jobs for graduates.</P>
    
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley): The Tánaiste would like to thank the Senator for raising this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste is conscious of the adverse effects on workers in the Carlow area of job losses over the past year, including redundancies at Braun and the recent announcement by Trek Europe of its decision to cease bicycle production, early in 2004, with the loss of some 45 jobs.</P>
    <P>Carlow town is being targeted by IDA Ireland as a location of choice in the south-east region for foreign direct investment. This is in line with the IDA strategy of achieving balanced regional distribution to the larger urban locations. The commitment by the agency to this goal is evidenced by the development of a flagship business and technology park in Carlow town. It is intended that any future overseas investment for Carlow town will be located on the 70 acre park. IDA Ireland continues to actively market Carlow town and the new business and technology park through its overseas marketing programme. This programme will continue in 2004.</P>
    <P>Carlow is ideally poised for investment across sectors. While continuing to be an attractive location for the engineering industry, it is planned that Carlow will advance as a cluster for both the international and financial services sectors. This, coupled with the recent improvements in road access to Dublin Airport and the growing reputation of Carlow Institute of Technology, will position Carlow well for additional inward investment. Furthermore, the new &euro;5 million research centre for biotechnology, recently opened by Teagasc in Carlow, employing up to 30 PhD students, will serve as an attraction.</P>
    <P>The major decentralisation package announced in the budget recently includes 350 jobs to be relocated to Carlow. These include 250 jobs from the Tánaiste's Department and 100 from Teagasc. This move demonstrates the Government's commitment to balanced regional development and will provide a further boost to enterprise development in the Carlow area.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland works with local communities in creating the business infrastructure to foster new business start-ups. In that context the county's first community enterprise centre, an initiative funded under the community enterprise scheme, will assist in the incubation of business start-ups and consequent job creation and will be available for occupation in September 2004.</P>
    <P>It is essential for balanced development that all other sources of employment, including Irish and overseas industries, small business and tourism, are promoted actively. This is fully recognised in the strategy plan as developed by the Carlow County Development Board within which all the relevant State agencies are actively involved. IDA and Enterprise Ireland and the county enterprise board continue to work closely with Carlow County Council on the development of a marketing strategy for the future promotion of Carlow town. This existing co-operative framework can be used effectively and efficiently to deal with job losses and job creation in the area.</P>
    <P>FÁS, the national training authority, is playing an important role in assessing and providing training and re-training for workers affected by plant closures or downsizing and has been very active in the Carlow area. The Government's commitment to regional development is stronger than ever and is determined to see the emergence of strong magnets of attraction such as Carlow. For successful development, each region must have clear competitive reasons why companies should locate there rather than elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste is satisfied that the combined efforts of the State development agencies under the aegis of her Department, as well as the ongoing commitment of the Government to regional development, including the recently announced decentralisation programme, should facilitate the economic development of the Carlow area.</P>

    <P>Mr. Feighan: I welcome the Minister of State. Over a year ago, the Plunkett Home in Boyle did without physiotherapy services for inpatients and outpatients for nine months and for the past two months there have been no physiotherapy services for in-patients and out-patients in north and west Roscommon. No stroke cases are being helped and no physiotherapy is provided to keep patients mobile. None of the patients in these centres is getting any activity. This is a far cry from the model provided in the Health and Wellbeing for Older People 2001 &ndash; 2006 strategy launched by the Western Health Board.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Health and Children to clarify the reason Áras Mháthair Pól, Castlerea, Áras Chaolainn, Castlerea, and the Plunkett Home, Boyle, with more than 130 in-patients and out-patients are without physiotherapy services. We ask him to reinstate these services immediately.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. T. O'Malley: I thank Senator Feighan for raising this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
    <P>Recent years have seen dramatic changes in both the concept and practice of services for older people, and enormous strides have been and continue to be made in developing a comprehensive, community-based service that is integrated with other health services. The shift in the delivery of services from predominantly hospital-based care has been extremely successful and, undoubtedly, the quality of care for older people has been enhanced by this development.</P>
    <P>While we all realise that the economic situation facing us is not as vibrant as we have been used to over the past number of years, I assure Senators that the issues surrounding older people and their welfare have not been ignored by this Government. Without wishing to bore Senators with figures, I would like to provide a brief summary of how some of the additional money for services for older people was spent this year.</P>
    <P>In 2003, a total of &euro;23.6 million in additional revenue funding was allocated to services for older people. This funding is being used for a variety of services, including a home help service, a nursing home subvention scheme, support to carers, commencement of an elder abuse programme, support to voluntary organisations, the opening of new community nursing units, provision of aids and appliances, development of dementia services, funding of day care centres and development of consultant-led services.</P>
    <P>Since 1997, a total of &euro;270 million in additional funding has been put into services for older people. As with all other sectors of society, the injection of Government money is not an absolute solution to all the issues. There will always be a need for extra resources, facilities, staff, etc.</P>
    <P>Physiotherapy is a health care profession concerned with human function and movement and maximising potential. It uses physical approaches to promote, maintain and restore physical, psychological and social well-being, taking account of variations in health status. It is science-based, committed to extending, applying, evaluating and reviewing evidence that underpins and informs its practice and delivery. The exercise of clinical judgment and informed interpretation is at its core.</P>
    <P>Physiotherapists work in a wide variety of health settings such as intensive care, mental illness, stroke recovery, occupational health and care of the elderly. In the context of the three facilities mentioned by the Senator, my Department has been advised by the Western Health Board that the provision of physiotherapy services at those venues has ceased temporarily, due to the senior physiotherapist being on leave due to illness. I understand from the board that it is hoped to resume service to both in-patients and out-patients early in the new year on the resumption of duty by the senior physiotherapist.</P>

    <P>Mr. Morrissey: I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy McDaid. I am a great supporter of the plans to open up the bus market in Dublin and introduce private operators by granting licences in certain cases. However, I have been made aware of instances, one of which is the Morton bus service from Celbridge to Dublin city centre, in which impediments and restrictions are being place on newly licensed operators as to where they can or cannot pick up passengers.</P>
    <P>The Morton service caters for some estates in the Celbridge area not serviced by Dublin Bus. However, on renewal of its licence, Mortons was told it could not have pick-up points outside several of those estates and that its service must travel to the city via Lucan. As the bus is normally full on leaving Celbridge, it is a major imposition to have to divert into Lucan, exit at the Foxhunter junction, merge with the N4 traffic and then negotiate the obstacle of the M50. While, on the one hand, it is Government policy to assist private operators into the market by issuing licences, significant penalties are also being imposed.</P>
    <P>I have also received representations about a similar service operating from Carrickmacross which, subject to correction, is not allowed to pick up passengers in Ardee or perhaps another location along the route. Intending passengers have to get to the next stop further on than their normal pick-up point as the private bus service is only allowed to pick up passengers at certain locations. If we are to have proper deregulation, there must be a wider delivery of bus services. Members of the public do not understand the system whereby passengers can be dropped of at a certain stop but the bus is not allowed to pick up passengers standing at the bus stop. Such impediments to running an efficient transport business must be seriously reviewed. I look forward to the Minister of State's reply.</P>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Transport </P>
    <P>(Dr. McDaid): I thank the Senator for raising this issue. Apart from my immediate reply, should we find it necessary to meet in the new year, this can be arranged.</P>
    <P>The Road Transport Act 1932 provides the legislative basis for entry to the public transport market by private bus operators. In accordance with this legislation, private operators are licensed to operate coach and bus services within the State. There are 428 licences held by private bus operators for a range of public bus services, including regular scheduled services, school and college services, occasional bus services for special events such as concerts, city tours and so on.</P>
    <P>The Department is required, under section 11(3)(<i>a</i>) of the 1932 Act, to apply a public interest test to applications for licences. The Minister must consider whether the service proposed is in the public interest, having regard to the passenger road services and other forms of passenger transport available to the public on or in the neighbourhood of the route of the proposed service. Generally the &ldquo;public interest&rdquo; is interpreted as being best served by enhancing and facilitating an expansion of the range of transport services available to the public, as opposed to allowing unrestricted competition for market share.</P>
    <P>Applications for bus services are generally deemed to be in the public interest if there is no existing passenger road service or other form of passenger transport available to the public, or where existing public transport services are not adequate to satisfy demand, particularly by reference to their frequency and capacity. The adequacy or inadequacy of existing services and the net benefit to the public interest of a proposed service are assessed by the Department on the basis of the best evidence available to it, including evidence submitted by the applicant in support of the licence application and information made available by other parties. These would include, for example, public authorities, employers with an interest in the provision of public transport for their employees, school and college authorities in respect of services to educational institutions, official tourism bodies in relation to tour services and so on.</P>
    <P>Section 11(3)(<i>b</i>) of the 1932 Act also requires the Minister to consider whether the proposed service is sufficient in regard to its frequency, daily duration and other respects to meet the requirements of the public. The Department examines applications for added value to the public in terms of the route and locations to be served, the timing of services and the days on which services are available, to maximise the availability, regularity and frequency of service. In compliance with the legislation, restrictions are placed on licences from time to time in an effort to avoid direct conflict between operators, while at the same time ensuring the availability of a good range and spread of services to the travelling public. This can be a particular issue in a city like Dublin where there are only a limited number of routes into and through the city and where some degree of shared running is unavoidable.</P>
    <P>The operator to which the Senator has referred holds a number of licences from the Department, including one in respect of the route in question &ndash; from Nutgrove Avenue to Celbridge, into Dublin city centre and returning to Nutgrove Avenue. This licence was issued on 23 December 2002. The operating times shown in the licence are those sought by the operator and there are no other restrictions on operation of the route.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year the operator applied to the Department for approval to operate additional services on this route. Taking account of the increase in population in the Celbridge area and the evidence available of demand for bus services which was not being met by existing operators, the Department duly approved all of the increased services proposed by the operator. My Department understands from the operator concerned that the additional services will be in operation early in the new year.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated publicly on a number of occasions his personal commitment to reform of the regulatory and organisational model for public transport. In November last year he outlined his proposals to the public transport partnership forum. These included the introduction of controlled competition in the form of franchising to the Dublin bus market. The Minister has also stated his view that all public transport outside the greater Dublin area should also be subject to independent economic regulation.</P>
    <P>The Department is engaged in detailed discussions with the trade unions and other stakeholders about the reform programme and, in parallel, pressing ahead with the development of the necessary legislation. It is the Minister's intention to enact this legislation during 2004. We will then have in place a modern legislative framework for the procurement and market regulation of public transport.</P>
    <P>I hope the foregoing will be of assistance to the Senator. As I indicated, if he requires a more detailed explanation, he will be welcome to meet me in the new year.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 7.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 18 December 2003.</P>
