      <P>I have received notice from Senator Bannon that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to outline the reasons for the discrepancies in the funding cutbacks to Longford Community Resources, which provides valuable services, projects and training for the marginalised in the community.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment, and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have suggested over the past few weeks that the House should not adjourn for the Easter recess until we have had a debate on the current situation in the Northern Ireland peace process. While I fully appreciate that the Taoiseach is out of the country representing us in Athens today and, though I would not in any way wish to make the situation more difficult by asking a Minister to attend the House to contribute, given the sensitivities involved, I suggest to the Leader that the House discuss the matter in a short debate at some stage today, perhaps over 40 minutes or an hour. That would allow colleagues to put their views on the record.</P>
      <P>I say that because, as the Leader well knows, there is a spirit of co-operation and support on all sides of the House for the two Governments' efforts as they try to cajole all the Northern Ireland parties to work the situation out. Members of the House would make a very good contribution to that process. I do not want to pressure the Government to say anything more than it has already. My proposal is therefore for the House itself to debate the matter, and I would be interested to hear the Leader's response.</P>
      <P>An unrelated matter raised by many colleagues on all sides of the House is the dramatic escalation in the spread of the SARS virus in many parts of the world, particularly south-east Asia. I know that the Leader has been in contact with the Minister for Health and other Departments about the serious matter raised on the floor of the House. I suggest that, over Easter, she put another idea to the Minister for Health, namely, that he arrange for a full risk assessment of continuing with the Special Olympics, particularly regarding south-east Asian countries. That risk assessment could involve the Department of Health and Children, the Special Olympics organising committee, the World Health Organisation and others. This disease spreads rapidly through travel and we are all at risk where we are exposed, in the absence of proper quarantine controls, to people travelling here from south-east Asia. Australia has, in the past 48 hours, begun to quarantine people travelling there from south-east Asia in order to ensure that the disease does not take hold.</P>
      <P>A full risk assessment of, at the very least, representatives from those countries in south-east Asia that are sending delegations to the Special Olympics should be put in place. As Senator Finucane stated yesterday, there is a great deal of concern among many of the towns hosting the delegations from that part of the world. A full scale risk assessment would be helpful and perhaps in the first week after the Easter recess the House could hear the response of the Minister for Health and Children to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I raised the question of young people buying houses and the fact that they are either being misled or given incorrect impressions from those providing different views and advice. I am concerned because, in view of the fact that the same information is available to the State, people are giving totally opposing advice to young people. Those who give this kind of advice should at least be required to include a declaration of interest to the effect that it is in the business of stockbrokers to sell equities and that it is in the business of auctioneers to sell property, etc. I was amazed at the response of Senator Dooley and others who rushed to the defence of the auctioneering group. When I raise this issue, the response I normally receive from auctioneers is one of delight because they are ashamed at the behaviour of some people in their profession and want it cleaned up.</P>
      <P>Tribunals and court cases showed us that auctioneers are the sellers and buyers of property and that auctioneering companies have individuals at the back of auction halls who bid against young buyers and raising the market price. I did not make this evidence up, a member of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party told me stories about an interest in land being sold by their family and their being unhappy about the way it was dealt with and the fact that it emerged that the land ended up in the ownership of an auctioneer's brother.</P>
      <P>I did not pull this scenario out of the air. I did not intend to deal with these issues, but they need to be addressed. Perhaps there is a need for regulation in the area of auctioneering so that we all can have trust and confidence in it. This matter needs to be considered and I ask the Leader to invite the appropriate Minister to come before House. I am sure the Minister would share the views of people on both sides of the House. This is not a party political issue. I am sure Senator Dooley would not want to defend and represent himself as being in favour of the kind of activity I have just described.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo the sentiments expressed by Senator Brian Hayes regarding the issue of the Northern Ireland talks and the ongoing difficulties that appear to be encountered by the parties in resolving the current set of issues. I underline the need for a debate and statements on this issue. I accept that this is a delicate issue, but it is important that we should discuss it as a matter of urgency. As Good Friday approaches, our best wishes go to the Taoiseach, the British Prime Minister and all parties involved in the current round of discussions and negotiations. The underlying desire of all peoples is towards a positive resolution of the issues involved. I hope this is achievable, if not in the immediate short term, then in the long term. It would be worth considering having a continuing discussion at this level on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Leader to consider returning to the issue of alcohol abuse after Easter. In the com<Col N="1116" />mentaries that have emerged in recent weeks, a change of attitude is finally emerging in respect of people's attitude to alcohol. There is a growing concern, which has now reached the proper level, about alcohol, its effects and the intolerance towards it in our community, not only in terms of law and order and violence, but also in terms of the physical and mental health of members of the community and, in particular, the younger generation. This matter has major implications for the health service and the education system and it is one we should revisit on a regular basis. We have a role to play in reflecting people's concerns about the effect of alcohol on people of all ages and at all levels of society. I welcome what appears to be a change of attitude towards this matter.</P>
    <P>I ask the Leader to consider making time available for a debate on tourism. Now that the weather has improved, we hope that the Irish tourism industry will have a good year this year. However, the signs are not good on the international front and, in that regard, it is important that we look carefully at the future of tourism and the need for supports for it, particularly in the current year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady" hpid="Mr. Brady Mr. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Donegal coroner, Mr. Sean Cannon, on highlighting the influence of alcohol as a major contributing factor in the tragic death of a 15 year old boy, Brendan Rush, in Donegal town last year. We all heard the plans for mandatory identification cards, heavier penalties and changes in advertising standards. I accept that this matter was the subject of a previous debate, but I ask the Leader to arrange a debate which would focus on the aspect of parental responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the huge housing waiting lists in all local authority areas and the chronic shortage of land in most of these areas, I ask the Leader for a debate on local authority housing. Unfortunately, local authorities in need of land for housing are often unable to compete with the private sector when land comes on the market for public sale. Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come before the House to debate the matter? I would not be opposed to regulation in the auctioneering industry and I would not defend the few bad apples in the barrel. Most of those in the business are honourable, but perhaps young people are being offered different advice from various sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More importantly, as regards the chronic shortage in local authorities areas such as County Kerry, there is a need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to put in place some mechanism that will allow liaison and consultation between the agencies of the State when land becomes available in areas where it is urgently required by local authorities. Everyone, including the Taoiseach, is concerned about the huge prices of land. Perhaps a mechanism could <Col N="1117" />be put in place which would allow for an arbitrated price to be agreed in order to allow local authorities to purchase land. I urge the Leader to make suitable representations to the Minister on behalf of everyone in the House in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Brian Hayes in his request for a risk assessment regarding SARS and the Special Olympics. I hope this would also include a safety assessment. When I raised the issue last week, it was largely with the purpose of facilitating the Special Olympics and making sure that points of entry would be sufficiently staffed to enable the Games to take place. It would be a pity if we allowed a scare to develop. We are dealing with a small number of affected countries in south-east Asia. There are positive signs in that people have begun to identify the virus, which may well have peaked, and means of diagnosing it. I hope the Department of Health and Children will work closely with Special Olympics organisers to ensure that fears are dispelled and that people are reassured. The Special Olympics is important for this country and for all the athletes involved and it should go ahead without a hitch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the proposed ban on smoking in public places. This follows on from a murder last week in a New York night club in which a bouncer asked a patron to extinguish his cigarette. This resulted in the stabbing of the bouncer who died 11 hours later in hospital. The Vintners Federation of Ireland and the Irish Hotels Federation have raised concern as to how the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, will proceed with the ban. I would appreciate if the Leader of the House would arrange for the Minister to inform us how he intends to proceed and whether it will be an all out ban.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley" hpid="Mr. Dooley Mr. Dooley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader request the Minister for Transport to come to the House as soon as possible to discuss the issues surrounding the future ownership of the State airports? There is considerable concern, certainly in my region, County Clare, about the future ownership structure of Shannon Airport. There is uncertainty among staff, business and tourism interests in the area. A debate on the Minister's proposals might be useful at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I again join Senator O'Toole and others in seeking a debate on the auctioneering industry. While I will certainly be making comments, we all want to make it clear that we are not in favour of rogue elements within any profession. The issue I have is that auctioneering continues to be singled out as the profession which seems to have the greatest number of rogues, which is certainly not the case. A debate would be very useful in assisting to highlight this. I recognise the issues that Senator O'Toole has, of which I am aware and which are of great concern to me, but they should be thrashed out in a balanced envir<Col N="1118" />onment where all sides of the profession are discussed and the excellent work many auctioneers are doing is recognised. At no time should the good name of auctioneers be maligned. As I know Senator O'Toole would not want to do this, a debate would be useful in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to invite the Minister for Transport to come to the House, if he remembers where we are, in the next term. It is a disgrace that he has not been here once in the second term and was only here once in the first term. We need to debate the issue of the driving test and the huge failure rate. A total of 1,400 fail the test every week. There are also wide variations with Cavan having the highest failure rate and the Shannon region having the highest pass rate. There is also the fact that there is no regulation of driver testers. Even the test is outdated from the point of view that there is no overtaking manoeuvre, a vital driving skill. It needs to be updated. Therefore, there is a need for an urgent debate in the House on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I also want to raise the transport issue. Some months ago other Senators raised the issue of the dismantling of the rail signal at Athenry. I now hear reports from the County Development Board in Galway on the proposals of Iarnród Eireann to dismantle the rail signal at Gort, County Galway. It is very sad at a time when the Minister for Transport, Deputy Seamus Brennan, has been positive about a western rail corridor, Iarnród Eireann is taking many steps to dismantle rail signals on this line. A debate on this issue would be useful if the Minister is coming to the Seanad. The Leader might follow up this question and have a debate on the railways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry" hpid="Ms Terry Ms Terry">
      <NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody here would dispute the success of the penalty points system. It has been a great success and responsible for saving lives but in the light of the comments made at the annual conference of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors yesterday in Galway about the inability to implement any further extension of the penalty points system, it is time the Minister for Transport came into the House to debate the issue and explain how he expects the Garda to implement a service without the necessary computer systems. We also need the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to explain how he can expect so many resources to be applied to implementing the system when Garda resources are completely stretched, an issue we discussed yesterday and on many other days. There is a huge need for gardaí on the streets but instead they are tied up and will be further tied up trying to implement this system without the necessary computer systems. I would like to see both Ministers come into the House to explain to us how the system will be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan" hpid="Mr. Feighan Mr. Feighan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
      <P>Recently I highlighted the issue of lack of decentralisation to areas which had not <Col N="1119" />already benefited. The Leader joined me in calling for a debate on the issue. I am very disappointed that a debate has not taken place and urge the Leader to ensure it takes place as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was allowed to raise on the Adjournment the issue of decentralisation to Newcastle West, Kilrush and Listowel. In his final response the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, stated decentralisation would happen soon. It will happen shortly &ndash; at least that is what the Minister of State says &ndash; after a long, long wait.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that but I just want to reassure my colleague.</P>
      <P>In response to what Senator McCarthy said on the Vintners Federation of Ireland and the Irish Hotel Federation lobby, Senators will be aware there is concern among the cancer bodies, the Irish Heart Foundation and ASH from which we have all recently received letters. They state quite definitively that they hope there will be no rowing back on the commitment by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, in accordance with the tobacco regulations, to introduce legislation from 1 January next year. They are concerned that there may be a body emerging within the Government parties looking for a certain part of a premises to be allocated for smoking. They are trying to have their concerns allayed and urge the Minister not to change from his original intention. If I remember correctly, legislation to approve this passed through both Houses. Am I right in saying this or will it be done by way of regulation? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Ms O'Rourke Ms O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This year, as everybody here knows, has been designated European Year for People with Disabilities. We are well aware of the failure of the Government to provide adequate resources to deal with the difficulties that many families face. The real commitment of the Government is highlighted when we see that it opposes Irish participation in drafting a new treaty on the rights of persons with disabilities. It is impeding at European level the establishment of a combined European effort to eliminate difficulties for people with disabilities. Will the Leader request the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House and clarify the position with regard to his commitment to people with disabilities, given that this year has designated European Year for People with Disabilities and we will host the Special Olympics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Ms O'Rourke Ms O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition, Senator Brian Hayes, again brought up the topic <Col N="1120" />of a debate on Northern Ireland. I thank him for the sensitive way in which he introduced the topic because the peace process has reached a very fine balancing point, about which there is no doubt. We are all afraid that the wrong word would be an intrusion into the debate. I spoke to the Taoiseach's programme manager yesterday evening because the Taoiseach had left for Athens. The Taoiseach would not wish anybody else to take the debate. However, I do see merit in talking about the topic again. I, therefore, ask the leaders of the parties to meet me in the anteroom after the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>Senator Brian Hayes also asked that the Minister for Health and Children establish a risk assessment for the SARS virus which would give a guarantee and a sense of security to those who are travelling, as well as to those coming for the Special Olympics from certain countries. This would be well worth doing. I am making a list of Ministers whom we might invite in the first two weeks of the next session. I hope that will be one of matters discussed.</P>
      <P>Senator Joe O'Toole again talked about auctioneers and expressed some amazement at what a particular Senator said yesterday. A useful debate must take all points of view into account.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Meara echoed what Senator Brian Hayes had said about Northern Ireland and has extended her best wishes to the two Prime Ministers as they go about their business on the issue. She also said the issues relating to alcohol reflected huge concerns. She is quite right. It is amazing how the dangers of smoking took a long time to register, yet now everybody accepts that smoking is dangerous for one's health. We are at the cusp of the debate where we are realising the dangers of excessive alcohol. I am always cautious about saying that alcohol is bad for one's health, because medical research shows that moderate drinking is in order while excessive drinking is not. That should prove a very good debate.</P>
      <P>Regarding the debate on tourism, the SARS virus will affect not only those arriving for the Special Olympics, but also people travelling from the representative countries. Recalling what Senator Brian Hayes said, it is important that this issue should be included in the debate on tourism.</P>
      <P>Senator Brady correctly gave due praise to the Donegal coroner, Sean Cannon, who spoke about the very sad death of a young man there and laid the blame where he thought appropriate. Senator Brady and other Senators have also regularly highlighted the importance of parental responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Coghlan spoke about the huge local authority housing lists and asked that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government should attend this House. That is a debate I want to arrange, but I must point out that the Taoiseach is going ahead with public submissions on the constitutional provision regarding property, and these will be made in July. The committee on the Constitution is dealing with that issue. The <Col N="1121" />Senator is right in asking for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come to the House to speak about it. There may be interim measures which can be taken.</P>
    <P>Senator Maurice Hayes agreed with Senator Brian Hayes about SARS risk assessment, particularly in relation to the Special Olympics. Senator McCarthy trusts there will be a continuation of the all-out ban on smoking, and the tenor of letters we are getting from concerned bodies bears out this concern.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooley referred to the future ownership of State airports and wants the Minister for Transport to attend this House. That is also on my list. The Senator is clearly not in favour of rogue elements and from what he said yesterday he wants a debate on auctioneering, and we are all agreed on that.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne also wants the Minister for Transport to attend this House to talk about the driving test issue. If there continues to be unease among the concerned bodies and the Minister's Department about its proper administration, the lack of care which people heretofore have been giving to driving will increase, and that would be wrong. I will endeavour to get the Minister for Transport to attend. Senator Kitt referred to the taking away of rail signals, when there is some hope for the train line in question.</P>
    <P>Regarding Senator Terry's comments, the Garda sergeants and inspectors were right to express their concerns about the points system being correctly implemented. A useful debate could be held on that issue. Senator Feighan requested a debate on decentralisation. The party that &ldquo;punches above its weight&rdquo; had a debate on that at its own conference, and the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, was very emphatic about it.</P>

      <P>That same month, having considered the recommendations of the Committee of Public Accounts the then Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, decided to establish a review group on auditing with 12 terms of reference. Besides dealing with all of the issues suggested by the Committee of Public Accounts, two of the terms of reference were new and dealt with self-regulation in the auditing profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1123" />In summary, the review group was asked to examine the following principal issues: self-regulation in the auditing profession, auditor independence, the auditing of financial institutions, and the role of the auditor in ensuring compliance with statutory provisions.</P>
    <P>The review group, chaired by Senator O'Toole, had its first meeting on 23 February 2000 and concluded its deliberations by the end of June 2000. The final report of the review group was presented to the Committee of Public Accounts on 11 July 2000 and was further discussed at the Committee of Public Accounts on 28 November 2000.</P>
    <P>I would like to record the Government's appreciation for the professionalism and dedication with which the review group addressed its task and the scope, quality and timeliness of the report which it produced. The members of the review group are to be congratulated on its achievements. Its report contains some 80 recommendations covering all aspects of the matters that were under review. I should perhaps clarify that those recommendations of the review group that relate specifically to financial institutions will be dealt with by the Minister for Finance in the context of the legislation he will introduce in relation to the new Financial Regulatory Authority.</P>
    <P>Following a public consultation on the report and its recommendations, the Government endorsed the report and also approved the establishment of the new oversight board recommended by the review group &ndash; the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, primarily for the purpose of advising the Minister for Finance and his Department on the implementation of the recommendations in the report.</P>
    <P>When this blueprint was developed, these concepts and solutions were particularly novel and pioneering and, depending on the perspective of the commentator, some might have said audacious and unwarranted. The latter comments would arise from the fact that the thinking behind them and the proposals was not in vogue elsewhere at the time. However, some time after the present set of propositions had been put into the public domain, a number of financial crashes occurred, most notably Enron and Worldcom, because of issues which included compliance failure and supervision. These collapses focused attention in jurisdictions worldwide on these subjects.</P>
    <P>Many of the administrators in the countries in question charged with the task of developing governance systems aimed at preventing a recurrence of these situations looked for guidance to the work which had been ongoing here. Obviously, it has been necessary to transform these proposals into draft legislation. This required time but it is probably fair to say the road map devised should ensure Ireland will remain at the forefront of prudential initiatives in the commercial arena. This is imperative if we are <Col N="1124" />to maintain international confidence in Ireland as a place in which to invest and do business.</P>
    <P>I will attempt a very brief summary of the draft legislation which I am bringing before the Seanad today to try to convey an overall sense of what is proposed. One of the key features of the Bill is the proposed establishment of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, or IAASA as abbreviated. The authority will have a wide range of oversight functions in relation to accountancy representative bodies as well as, for example, examining the accounts of defined companies for compliance with the Companies Acts.</P>
    <P>What about other links in the compliance chain? In the case of prescribed accountancy representative bodies, disciplinary procedure operated by them in respect of their members is now being given statutory underpinning. As regards auditors, existing controls are being enhanced and they will be subject to new audit-related requirements. There will be greater strictures and impositions on companies in relation to the preparation of accounts. There are procedures designed to ensure auditors are genuinely independent of those companies whose accounts they audit. Also, directors of companies are being required to confirm their companies' compliance with all statutory obligations which are relevant to them, not just those arising in company law. Each company's auditor is to vet this statement.</P>
    <P>It will, I hope, be clear from this compressed account of what is proposed that an interplay between the relevant parties is provided for, based on their respective roles. The legislation is striving for a balance between objectives of high standards and limited regulation and in the apportionment of new responsibilities between the various parties involved with corporate governance.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the provisions of the Bill and explain in some greater detail what each of these is designed to achieve. Obviously, this is not intended as an exhaustive account of the contents of each section. Part 1 of the Bill contains some preliminary technical matters. The first three sections contain provisions found in most Bills where there is existing legislation in being. In this instance, it sets out how the Bill will relate to the existing Companies Acts.</P>
    <P>Part 2 of the Bill contains the provisions dealing with the establishment of the new authority, the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority. In summary, this new body will take over certain functions relating to the granting of recognition to bodies of accountants under section 191 of the Companies Act 1990 which forms the basis for the supervision and regulation of auditors. Additionally, the IAASA will have the power, among other matters, to intervene in the disciplinary processes of the accountancy bodies where it deems it necessary; carry out independent investigations of possible breaches of standards of prescribed accountancy bodies by their members and apply to the courts to compel <Col N="1125" />directors of a company to amend accounts not in compliance with the Companies Acts.</P>
    <P>The establishment, powers, functions, <i>modus operandi</i> and practical aspects of the functioning of the supervisory authority are provided for in the sections which follow. Section 4 contains interpretations used in this Part of the Bill. Of particular interest are the definitions of &ldquo;designated body&rdquo; in the context of bodies which will nominate persons to be directors of the new supervisory authority. The term &ldquo;recognised accountancy bodies&rdquo; already has a particular meaning in the Companies Acts and is the basis on which members of such bodies can act as auditors. Section 5 deals with the manner in which it is proposed that the new supervisory authority will be established. Under this section, the Minister will be empowered to designate a company incorporated as a public company limited by guarantee to be the supervisory authority.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the membership of the supervisory authority. Subsection (1) provides that each of the prescribed accountancy bodies will be a member, as well as designated bodies. Subsection (2) identifies these designated bodies. In this regard, it will be noted that various parties interested in accounts and auditing matters will be members. I should mention that section 46(1)(<i>a</i>) enables the Minister to prescribe any other body which may subsequently be identified as having an interest in this area to be a member of the supervisory authority. As the supervisory authority is being set up as a company limited by guarantee, it will have to have a memorandum and articles of association. Section 7 provides that following incorporation of the company, any subsequent amendments to the memorandum or articles of association can only take effect with the Minister's prior approval.</P>
    <P>Section 8 sets out the principal objects of the supervisory authority which will have to be enshrined in the memorandum of association of the authority. The objects are to supervise how prescribed accountancy bodies regulate and monitor their members; provide for adherence to high professional standards in the auditing and accounting profession; monitor whether the accounts of certain classes of companies and other undertakings comply with the Companies Acts, and act as a specialist source of advice for the Minister on auditing and accounting matters.</P>
    <P>Section 9 sets out the main functions to be discharged by the supervisory authority. These functions will include certain matters relating to the recognition of bodies of accountants which up to now have been undertaken by the Minister. The section also includes the approval of the constitution and by-laws of each of the accountancy bodies; the ability to undertake investigations into prescribed accountancy bodies; monitoring the effectiveness of provisions of the Companies Acts; co-operation with prescribed accountancy bodies and other interested parties in developing auditing and accounting standards and practice notes; reviewing whether the accounts of com<Col N="1126" />panies and other undertakings referred to in section 26 comply with the Companies Acts and, where this does not turn out to be the case, seeking High Court directions to secure compliance.</P>
    <P>Section 10 empowers the supervisory authority to carry out its functions and, where necessary, adopt rules and issue guidelines concerning any matters that relate to its functions or powers. In addition, subsection (4) of this section enables the supervisory authority to apply to the High Court for an order compelling a prescribed accountancy body to comply with a rule adopted or a guideline issued by the authority.</P>
    <P>Section 11 deals with the appointment of directors of the supervisory authority by the Minister. There will be 12 directors appointed by the Minister, eight of whom will be nominees of the list of designated bodies at section 6(2), with the chief executive officer holding his or her directorship <i>ex-officio</i>. To ensure the independence of the new supervisory authority, no more than two of the directors appointed by the Minister can be members of prescribed accountancy bodies. As there is no restriction of that sort in relation to the chief executive officer, three of the directors can be members of prescribed accountancy bodies under the Bill, as drafted. The number of directors can be altered by means of a ministerial regulation under section 46(1), as can the limitation of membership of the supervisory authority by members of prescribed accountancy bodies to two.</P>
    <P>The intention is that the executive of the supervisory authority will have the requisite expertise to carry out all of the functions assigned to the authority. Bearing in mind that some of the duties of the board will be delegated to sub-committees of the board, there may, nonetheless, be grounds for considering the possibility of greater representation on the board of members of prescribed accountancy bodies and the appointment of experts to sub-committees where deemed necessary. Moreover, to secure the independence of the supervisory authority, the members of the body, unlike the position in a normal company, are not permitted to instruct directors in the discharge of their duties as directors of the authority. The term of office of a director will be not less than three years and not more than five years and it will be possible to re-appoint directors.</P>
    <P>Section 12 deals with the appointment of the chief executive officer to the new supervisory authority and sets out in summary what will be his or her functions. These are to carry on, manage and, in general, control the administration and business of the supervisory authority as well as performing any other functions that are determined by the board. The chief executive officer will hold office on terms and conditions approved by the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance. If the chief executive officer is to be removed, it is the board of directors which will take this decision.</P>
    <P>Section 13 deals with the work programme of the supervisory authority. The authority is <Col N="1127" />required to draw up and submit a work programme setting out its strategies, planned activities and intended outputs for a three-year period. This programme will also give information on the staff and resources required, including an annual programme of expenditure. As it is intended that the authority will be funded by the State and the accountancy bodies, the Minister will consult the prescribed accountancy bodies before approving the annual programme of expenditure. Provision is also made to ensure that the work programme is laid before each House of the Oireachtas not later than 60 days after the date of which it is submitted to the Minister. Subsection (10) provides that the Minister may not give directions concerning the discharge of a work programme, or, if it arises, of any amended or supplementary programme.</P>
    <P>Section 14 deals with the funding of the supervisory authority. It will be funded by the State and the prescribed accountancy bodies. The review group on auditing recommended that the split should be 40% from the State and 60% from the accounting bodies and that is the basis on which section 14 has been drafted.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides for the establishment by the supervisory authority of a reserve fund exclusively for the purposes of carrying out investigations under section 24 or conducting reviews of whether accounts of companies that fall within the scope of section 26 comply with the Companies Acts. It is difficult to estimate in advance the likely nature, extent and cost of recourse to these provisions and, in particular, those relating to investigations under section 24. However, it is imperative that, when they arise, such issues can be examined immediately and that the absence of funding will not delay the IAASA taking appropriate action. This is the basis for the development of a reserve fund, as provided for in section 15.</P>
    <P>The second of the functions in respect of which the reserve fund is being developed is to examine the accounts of certain companies for compliance with the Companies Acts. These are all public limited companies and certain private companies or undertakings which meet a threshold of &euro;25 million balance sheet total and a turnover of &euro;50 million. In the circumstances, it is considered reasonable to impose a levy on such companies to fund this aspect of the supervisory authority's activities. However, before any levy is imposed, the supervisory authority will have to establish criteria and submit them to the Minister for approval.</P>
    <P>Section 16 is in the nature of good housekeeping and simply provides that any excess revenue will be carried forward by the supervisory authority from one year to the next. Likewise, sections 17, 18, 19 and 20 have all to do with housekeeping matters and deal with the staff that the authority will have, the disclosure requirements of both directors and staff and the ability of the authority to establish appropriate superannuation arrange<Col N="1128" />ments for the chief executive officer and the staff of the supervisory authority.</P>
    <P>Section 21 obliges the supervisory authority to prepare accounts and submit these for audit to the Comptroller and Auditor General. The section also requires that the Minister lay copies of the accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General's report before the Houses of the Oireachtas and provide them to the accountancy bodies.</P>
    <P>Section 22 requires that an annual report on its activities be submitted by the supervisory authority to the Minister and that this should be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas within six months of the year's end. The section also contains provisions that would require both the chairman and the chief executive to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts or any other committee of the Oireachtas to account for the performance of the functions and exercises of the powers of the supervisory authority.</P>
    <P>Section 23 empowers the supervisory authority to intervene in relation to the investigation and disciplinary process of a prescribed accountancy body to ensure that it has complied with such procedures approved under section 9(2)(<i>c</i>). Depending on the outcome, the supervisory authority is given the power to advise, admonish or censure the prescribed accountancy body. Provision is also made for the publication of decisions of the authority.</P>
    <P>Section 24 empowers the supervisory authority, where it considers it appropriate or in the public interest, to investigate the possible breach of a prescribed accountancy body's standards by a member. The section contains the necessary powers to facilitate such an investigation by the supervisory authority, including requiring the production of documents, the attendance of relevant persons before the supervisory authority and the power to certify cases where relevant persons have refused to co-operate with an investigation by the supervisory authority to the court, with a view to the court determining the extent to which they should co-operate with the authority. Appropriate appeal mechanisms are also built into the section.</P>
    <P>Section 25 allows the supervisory authority to undertake a review of how the members of recognised bodies are being regulated. As regards sanctions that can be applied against a member who refuses to co-operate, the reference in subsection 2(<i>c</i>) essentially relates to the new section 192A &ndash; being inserted into the 1990 Act by section 35 of the Bill &ndash; which effectively gives statutory backing to the disciplinary procedures of prescribed accountancy bodies.</P>
    <P>Under section 26, the supervisory authority will be exercising a role other than supervising the activities of prescribed accountancy bodies. Under this section, the supervisory authority will be able to examine the annual accounts of companies falling within the definition of relevant undertakings. In essence, these are public limited companies, large private companies, and unlimi<Col N="1129" />ted companies and partnerships, all of whose members have effective limited liability and which were brought within the requirements to prepare and submit accounts to the Companies Registration Office under the EU regulations of 1993.</P>
    <P>Arising from its examination, the supervisory authority would send a notice to the directors of the companies specifying the manner in which the accounts were considered to be defective and seeking to have them brought into compliance. Failure to comply with such a direction could result in the supervisory authority bringing the matter before the courts to have an order made directing that the accounts be brought into compliance with the Companies Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 27 is in the nature of housekeeping to enable the supervisory authority to delegate its functions to a committee of its directors or employees, as appropriate and as specified in the section. Section 28 sets out the procedures for instances when the supervisory authority, or parties subject to rulings by it, need to bring matters specified in the section before the court for determination. Section 29 provides for the recognition of the supervisory authority's seal and instruments in any court processes.</P>
    <P>Section 30 deals with the issue of confidentially of information obtained by the supervisory authority. It also sets out the specific bodies to which information can be communicated where the supervisory authority believes that information is connected to the functions of the body to which the disclosure is made.</P>
    <P>Section 31 deals with the transfer of functions to the supervisory authority. These are set out in the Schedule to the Bill and include the recognition of a body of accountants for the purposes of its members being able to act as auditors. The section also deals with the continued recognition of the existing recognised body of accountants. In the case of the Institute of Incorporated Public Accountants, arising from judicial proceedings taken against the Minister in relation to the recognition of this institute 1996, subsections (3), (4) and (5) of this section provide that that institute must apply to the supervisory authority for recognition as soon as reasonably practicable after the commencement of the section. In the meantime, however, persons who are members of that body and who are authorised to act as auditors will be able to continue to act in this capacity.</P>
    <P>Section 32 is designed to protect the supervisory authority and any of its members, directors or employees from any liability for damages, unless the act or omission is shown to have been done in bad faith.</P>
    <P>Part 3 of the Bill contains a number of provisions which, having regard to the future consolidation of the Companies Acts, as recommended by the company law review group, primarily amend provisions of Part X of the Companies Act 1990, which deals with auditing matters. The first of these amendments, section 33, inserts a number of definitions into section 182 of the 1990 Act. <Col N="1130" />These definitions are of terms subsequently used in a number of provisions in the said Part X.</P>
    <P>Section 34(<i>a</i>) implements some of the provisions of the 1992 Regulations. Paragraph (b) of this section adds to the provisions of section 187 that specify circumstances where a person is not qualified to act as auditor of a company. Paragraph (<i>c</i>) is in the nature of a transitional provision. Under that subsection persons who hold individual authorisations will have a three year period during which they have to become a member of, or become subject to, the regulation of a recognised body of accountants or cease to be qualified for appointment to act as an auditor under the Companies Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 35 gives statutory backing to the disciplinary procedures of prescribed accountancy bodies. Members of such bodies are already subject to such arrangements but they did not have the statutory backing now proposed. The provisions contain the usual checks and balances and where necessary matters can be appealed to the courts for final determination. Section 36 implements the recommendations of the audit review group that persons should not act, advertise themselves or hold themselves out as being able to audit unless they comply with the requirements of the Act.</P>
    <P>The section also contains provisions that enable the Director of Corporate Enforcement to apply to the High Court to have a person's name removed from the Registrar of Auditors. As some recognised bodies operate their recognition procedures in respect of firms rather than individuals, the section also contains the necessary provisions that will enable an individual member of the firm to be struck off without causing the firm itself to lose its recognised status to act as auditor.</P>
    <P>Section 37 contains a number of specific technical amendments designed to update section 199 of the 1990 Act having regard to the new approval mechanisms that are being put in place &ndash; the supervisory authority rather than the Minister will be the authority recognising bodies of accountants in the future. It also updates the notification procedures and the manner in which information is to be forwarded to the CRO as provided for in the 1992 Audit Regulations.</P>
    <P>Section 38 makes similar adjustments to section 200 of the 1990 Act. Up to now, the Companies Acts required that accounts give a true and fair view of the financial state of a company. There was no specific obligation in law stating that accounts had to be prepared in accordance with accounting standards. Section 39 now introduces such an obligation. It is important to note that the accounting standards applicable to a company are those relevant to its circumstances and its annual accounts. This means that some accounting standards will not be relevant to some companies.</P>
    <P>Section 40 introduces a requirement for the establishment of audit committees by certain companies. Under subsection (2), the obligation to establish such a committee will apply to the board of directors of all public limited companies. <Col N="1131" />As regards the directors of large private companies and relevant undertakings, as defined, the obligation under subsection (3) is to establish an audit committee that meets the requirements of the section or state in the annual directors report that they have failed to do so and explain the reasons for the failure. The section sets out the matters the audit committee should deal with in the company. The composition of the audit committee is stipulated and is essentially designed to ensure that it is an independent committee. This accords with international best practice.</P>
    <P>Section 41 introduces for the first time in statute law a requirement for companies to disclose the accounting policies adopted in determining in particular the amounts included in the balance sheet and profit and loss account. Section 42 requires the disclosure of information regarding the remuneration paid to the auditor for audit work, audit related work and non-audit work. Corresponding information for the previous year is also required to be disclosed. Where the remuneration for work is of an insignificant amount, below &euro;1,000, the information does not have to be disclosed. The section also imposes obligations on the audit committee, where the remuneration for non-audit work exceeds the aggregate of the audit and audit related work, to state whether it is satisfied the carrying out of the non-audit work by the auditor did not affect the auditor's independence.</P>
    <P>Section 43 introduces an obligation on directors of a company to prepare a compliance statement concerning the company's policies respecting compliance with its obligations under company law, tax law or any other statutory law which would have a material impact on the company's financial statement. It also introduces an obligation that these be in writing, be approved by the board of directors and be reviewed every three years. Under subsection (4), the directors are obligated to include in their annual report that they are responsible for securing the company's compliance with their relevant obligations and what procedures they have in place to achieve such compliance, confirm that they have, where necessary, reviewed the procedures and give their opinion on the extent to which they have secured compliance with their obligations.</P>
    <P>Section 205F, also inserted by section 43 into the Companies Act 1990, requires the auditors of a company to give their opinion on the directors compliance statement and, in circumstances where the directors have failed to prepare such a compliance statement, report that matter to the Director of Corporate Enforcement. Section 44 is designed to address a particular problem that has arisen with section 127 of the Companies Act 1963, as inserted by section 60 of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001. Essentially, the provision has the effect of confirming that, where a company makes an annual return on a date prior to its existing annual return date, the anniversary of this new earlier date will be the new annual <Col N="1132" />return date, unless the company opts to retain its previous return date or otherwise establishes a new return date under section 127(9) of that Act.</P>
    <P>Section 45 is designed to ensure that for private non-profit making companies that currently do not have to submit any accounting information with their annual return, in future the auditor's report on the annual accounts which has still to be prepared by the company will be submitted to the CRO. This is already the case in respect of public companies not trading for profit or charitable companies.</P>
    <P>Part 4 of the Bill contains 6 sections. The first three relate to the powers of the Minister to make regulations in relation to matters referred to in earlier provisions. These include the prescribing of bodies of accountants and designated bodies, as well as varying monetary amounts in particular circumstances, for example threshold levels which trigger particular requirements or levels of financial sanctions. In addition, paragraph (<i>j</i>) is designed to enable the Minister to exempt certain classes of companies and other undertakings from specific provisions in circumstances where and to the extent that they are regulated under other enactments. This will apply in particular to entities that are used by the financial services industry and are subject to regulation by the Central Bank. It is my intention to make such a regulation exempting investment companies used by the financial services funds industry from the seven sections specified at paragraph (<i>j</i>) at the same time as these sections are being commenced.</P>
    <P>Section 49 amends the Company Law Enforcement Act to enable the Director of Corporate Enforcement to act as a member of the new supervisory authority. Section 50 is designed to ensure that where the supervisory authority engages in its activities and issues reports and summaries of decisions and directions, that these will have the protection of qualified privilege providing they otherwise meet the provisions of the Defamation Act.</P>
    <P>Finally, section 51 revokes the 1992 Auditors Regulations, these having been now incorporated into Part X of the Companies Act 1990, as I have just described. I apologise for having gone on at some length about the provisions of the Bill but it is worthwhile putting on the record what it is the Bill is designed to achieve. I thank the House for its co-operation in arranging this debate.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing Senators' contributions and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for the comprehensive overview of the Bill. This Bill puts into effect the recommendations of the review group on auditing, which sat between February and July 2000 and was chaired so ably by our colleague, Senator O'Toole. The review group on auditing was established following the inquiry by the Committee of Public Accounts inquiry into DIRT and was asked to address a number of issues about the regulation of accountants and the indepen<Col N="1133" />dence of auditors, which the Minister of State has dealt with at some length.</P>
      <P>The review group on auditing did its work in four months and produced a 300 page report with 80 recommendations. That speaks for itself. It was a fantastic achievement. Its output represented a broad consensus among the diverse bodies represented on the review group and provided an effective plan for moving forward. It should be remembered that the review group met and did its work before the Enron and WorldCom collapses and before the accountancy scandals in the US were made public. In that context, its work was far-seeing.</P>
      <P>On the issue of regulating the accountancy profession, the core of the review group's work was that we need to move to a new model. The other model was effectively based on complete self-regulation by the profession of the profession. This had developed over the years for two reasons: first, the accountancy profession wanted self-regulation; and second, successive Governments and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment were happy to leave this responsibility with the profession. There was no inclination or desire within the Department to invest the necessary resources to carry out an effective regulatory role and they were perfectly happy for accountants to regulate themselves.</P>
      <P>The review group on auditing decided that this had to change. It came to the view that there was a need for more hands-on involvement. We needed to move from delegated self-regulation to a new model of supervised self-regulation. This new model would see the State playing a much more active role in supervising the way in which the accountancy profession regulated itself and, if necessary, undertaking direct regulation itself.</P>
      <P>The involvement of accountants in a number of scandals throughout the 1990s and the inability of the professional bodies to demonstrate to the public that they could regulate their members in an open and effective way made some change inevitable. There are no doubts that self-regulation does have some benefits. It can be done at no cost to the State, and it involves professionals who understand the nature of the work and the technicalities of the work in the regulatory process. It also has many disadvantages. It creates a perception of &lsquo;chaps regulating chaps', and it is easy for the public to believe that when a profession is faced with a choice between the members' interest and the public interest, the members' interest will always win out.</P>
      <P>The Bill is welcome because it provides us with a structure &ndash; the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority &ndash; which can rigorously examine how the accountancy bodies carry out this self-regulation, can ensure that the right procedures and processes are in place, and can make sure that fair, independent decisions are made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is detailed and complex legislation. It is, however, disappointing that it has taken so long for it to reach the floor of the Oireachtas. The review group on auditing reported in July 2000. <Col N="1134" />Since then, the Tánaiste has issued many press releases about the action which she is taking on the regulation of the accountancy profession. She even took the unusual step of publishing draft heads of a Bill a year ago, before the election, to show what she was doing, but that does not hide the fact that it has taken almost three years for this Bill to reach us. That is an indication, perhaps, that the Tánaiste is more interested in public relations than the actual delivery of public service reform.</P>
    <P>This Bill also contains a number of measures which will strengthen the regulation and independence of auditors. These will have to be teased out in detail on Committee Stage, but in broad terms they are to be welcomed, especially when they bring Ireland into line with best practice internationally. However, we should be careful to ensure where we impose additional regulation that it is solidly based, it is the minimum required and is not an unfair or undue burden on business.</P>
    <P>As the long title of the Bill makes clear, this supervisory authority will exercise power and responsibility only on accountancy bodies. The simple fact is that anyone can call themselves an accountant. There is no restriction on somebody with no qualifications whatsoever setting up a shop in the High Street and putting the sign &ldquo;Accountant&rdquo; above their door. This Bill will do nothing for people who are the customers of such unqualified accountants. The Bill, therefore, is not about supervising the regulation of the accountancy profession, and this should be addressed. Supervision is confined only to the accountancy bodies and people who are members of those bodies.</P>
    <P>The review group on auditing considered the issue of whether to protect the title &ldquo;accountant&rdquo; and failed to come to a conclusion on the issue, but surely this Bill provides us with an ideal opportunity to bring the entire accountancy profession, or anyone who wants to call themselves an accountant, within the scope of the new supervisory authority. Perhaps in his reply to the debate, the Minister of State might indicate how the new authority will impact upon unqualified accountants who are not members of any body. Rather than making it easier or giving an incentive to stay outside, the Minister of State should be trying to bring them into the fold.</P>
    <P>How will the Bill prevent any of these people setting up and portraying themselves as accountants when, in fact, they have little or no qualifications? If a customer of one of these unqualified accountants has a problem with them, there is nobody to whom he or she may complain. Surely this legislation provides us with an opportunity to throw the net over the entire accountancy profession or anyone who wants to call themselves an accountant. This could be done with a relatively straightforward amendment and I am sure we will come back to this on Committee Stage. In the meantime, I would be interested to hear the Minister of State's views.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that this Bill imposes new <Col N="1135" />requirements on companies. In some cases these requirements only apply to large companies, but in others they apply to all companies, large and small. The reality is that it was the actions of large companies, and specifically financial institutions, which led the setting up of the DIRT inquiry, which in turn led to the setting up of the review group on auditing. Small companies have been subject to an increasing amount of legislation in recent years. The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the revamped Companies Registration Office have increased the amount of paperwork with which small companies must now comply. It is right that anyone enjoying the benefit of limited liability should comply with basic minimum legislative requirements, but in recent years these have been growing and growing.</P>
    <P>The company law review group, in its report, made various recommendations about simplifying the company law needs of small business but we have not seen that legislation. The emphasis in all the legislation seems to be on increasing regulation, not reducing it. Increased regulation means increased costs to business, either through directly hiring staff to deal with regulatory compliance or hiring consultants to deal with it for them. The cost to business means ultimately loss of competitiveness and a loss of jobs. Each single piece of legislation may not be critical in itself, but the cumulative effect is that those trying to run small businesses and make a living from them are finding themselves spending more and more time filling in forms and complying with State regulations. This Bill again provides the Government with an opportunity to lift the burden on some of those smaller businesses, and perhaps we can do something about this on Committee Stage. The Minister of State might have some preliminary thoughts in this regard when he replies.</P>
    <P>The core principle of all regulation is that it should be proportionate to a clearly stated public interest. The Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1999 introduced the concept of audit exemption and allows companies to avail of audit exemption if they satisfy a number of criteria. This removes the chore of having a statutory audit completed for many small companies. I understand the direct costs of an audit are difficult to estimate but one survey has indicated that the average cost for a company with a turnover of &euro;1 million is in the region of &euro;3,000. These costs will undoubtedly increase if the Bill is enacted as presented to us. If a similar figure is applied to all small companies in Ireland, the overall cost to business will be significant.</P>
    <P>As many small companies are owned and managed by the same person, there is little need for an independent audit of their stewardship. Owners or managers can decide whether to have an audit for their purposes based on their own information needs. In some cases third parties such as banks might require the company to prepare an audit as part of loan conditions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1136" />Research into exemption thresholds in other European countries clearly highlights that the thresholds in Ireland are considerably lower than those in most of our neighbours. In Northern Ireland the current threshold for turnover is £1 million, compared to &euro;317,000 in the Republic. This means that a company trading in Newry with a turnover of £900,000 is not required to have a statutory audit while a company trading across the Border in Dundalk with the same level of turnover is required to do so, incurring additional costs. This is hardly something that creates a climate conducive to cross-Border trade or an all-Ireland economy. I understand a consultation paper has been published in the North suggesting that the threshold be increased from £1 million to about £4.8 million and that this is under consideration. This would put us at a clear disadvantage. The Minister of State might have some preliminary thoughts on this but we should deal with it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Much of the Bill is about the establishment of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority. The explanatory memorandum to the Bill states the State contribution to the budget of the IAASA in 2003 and 2004 will be just over &euro;600,000. This suggests that the total budget will be &euro;1.5 million, with the balance being contributed by the accountancy bodies. In reality, it is not the accountancy bodies which will pay the additional &euro;1 million but businesses, which will pay increased charges to accountants, which will pass it on to the bodies. I would be grateful if the Minister of State could indicate whether he has seriously considered the idea of assigning the functions proposed for the IAASA to some other agency, either the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority or the Director of Corporate Enforcement. Both bodies have the administrative structures to support the functions being allocated to the IAASA.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that a convincing case has been made for the IAASA to have its own administrative structure and all the overheads that go with it. This is not to quibble with the work of the IAASA but the structure being put in place to support that work could be done in a more cost-effective way than is being planned. Do we really need another agency when some other body could carry out the same work? </P>
    <P>There is always a balance to be struck between proper and effective regulation and unnecessary burdens on business. Striking that balance is not easy and often it is only with the benefit of experience that changes can be made. I have been told via representations that the compliance statement required by section 43 of this Bill is unique to Ireland. Perhaps the Minister of State can clarify this. We need to be careful that we are not imposing conditions which will make Ireland a less attractive proposition for inward investment or for people to take up directorships of companies. Good non-executive directors are a tremendous benefit to any board. If we make it difficult or unattractive for companies, particularly grow<Col N="1137" />ing companies which need that additional external expertise, to attract people to provide advice, we will ultimately inhibit the growth of the company, the economy and jobs. While I agree with the concept of the compliance statement, I would like to hear the Minister of State's assurance that it is not an unduly arduous task for directors to perform. I would also like to hear to what extent it is in place in other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which is long overdue. It needs a very long and considered Committee Stage debate. Although it is directed at the accountancy profession, in reality, the cost being imposed by it will be felt by every business in Ireland. We should bear this in mind in looking at the Bill and only be prepared to impose those additional regulations that are necessary and proportionate.</P>
    <P>I would like to have dealt more with the exemption and compliance thresholds and the need to have registered accountants in order that the Bill can deal with anyone who calls himself or herself an accountant. I also wanted to mention the money-laundering directive soon to come our way, which is another indication that we must deal with the issue of accountants, and to stress that the board should have a minimum of 40% representation from the accountancy profession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his detailed analysis of the Bill. Like the Opposition, we have received many submissions on it. I could summarise them very fast by saying the main concern is the level of turnover at which the appointment of an auditor is required. The Companies (Amendment)(No. 2) Act 1999 puts the level at &euro;317,000. When it comes to the drafting of amendments, the Minister of State should bear in mind the points made by the Opposition spokesperson, Senator Coghlan, and I and ensure we have a level playing field. We should raise the threshold of turnover to about &euro;1.5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We need to go much further if it is to be increased across the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator said the threshold across the Border was £1 million, which equates to between &euro;1.5 million and &euro;2 million. That level should be set by order rather than constant changes in legislation because in ten years, &euro;2 million will represent quite a small turnover. In fact, the turnover of a small builder, building about three houses per year, could be over the threshold set down in the Bill. If an effort is being made to discourage small companies from becoming limited liability companies, that is fair enough and according to the recommendations of the report of the review group on auditing. Many small limited liability companies have acquired very bad reputations. There have been scandals recently in which limited liability companies have been established and then gone into liquidation <Col N="1138" />within a very short period, leaving an amazing number of debts.</P>
      <P>I commend our colleague, Senator O'Toole, who chaired the review group on auditing. Its report is a weighty document. The review was carried out between February and June 2000. The group had 18 members, all of whom played a very important role. The report is an excellent research document and provided a good backdrop to the preparation of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, and the Department for bringing the Bill before the House. It arises directly from the report and the recommendations contained therein. The group was established by the Minister following the DIRT inquiry of the Committee of Public Accounts to examine the regulations and professional rules governing the auditing profession. I congratulate all those involved in the production of the report.</P>
      <P>The main function of the new Bill is to provide for the establishment on a statutory basis of an independent regulatory body, the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority. The IAASA has already been set up on an interim basis and has been operating in that capacity since April 2001. I pay tribute to the work of the interim authority since its establishment and I believe this legislation is a testament to its fine work in this area, based on the case it made to the Department. Contrary to what the Opposition spokesman stated, the Tánaiste acted expeditiously in establishing the interim authority shortly after the report was presented to the Government.</P>
      <P>The powers conferred on the regulatory body in this legislation are extensive, but they are also appropriate. The principal function of the IAASA under the new legislation will be to supervise how the prescribed accountancy bodies regulate and monitor their members. In addition, the IAASA will have the power to: intervene in the disciplinary process of the accountancy bodies where it deems it necessary; carry out independent investigations in public interest cases; and apply to the courts to compel the directors of a company to amend accounts that are not in line with accounting standards. Many of those issues also arose at the ongoing public inquiries. It was felt that many accountancy firms did not carry out their duties. They will have to comply with the wishes of this organisation in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased that the supervisory authority will be given the responsibility of promoting adherence to high professional standards in the auditing and accountancy professions. On the whole, they have very high standards and have, through their excellent work, contributed greatly to the development of Ireland's economy. While I do not necessarily believe these professions are particularly corrupt or inefficient, in light of certain events concerning offshore accounts and fraud exposed at the various tribunals &ndash; together <Col N="1139" />with the Enron scandal and, in particular, the trouble AIB had with its American subsidiary, Allfirst &ndash; it is fitting that the Government is making a firm move to encourage compliance with our tax regime and laws. This legislation will be very positive for the profession, in general, and for its reputation, in particular, because it will protect the industry as a whole from damage caused by any non-compliant members.</P>
    <P>As has been the practice to date, this legislation aims to ensure that the IAASA will be independent of the accounting and auditing profession, while still having at its disposal the necessary expertise required for effective regulation. The number of accountants on the board of the IAASA will be strictly limited to no more than two. The Minister should reconsider the position in this regard and he may be sympathetic to increasing that number. I note, however, that if the chief executive is a member of the accountancy profession, the number may be three.</P>
    <P>If the organisation is to have the goodwill of the auditing and accountancy professions, there should be a review of its membership. Most boards would have a higher number of practitioners. Medical boards, such as An Bord Altranais, contain a significant number of professionals from that field. The accountancy and auditing professions feel it would be appropriate to review this section and increase their representation on the board. It is unusual for a profession to be so under-represented on its own supervisory authority.</P>
    <P>The new body will be funded to the tune of 40% by the State and 60% by the accountancy companies. This is a realistic and fair system and very much in line with the report of the review group on auditing, particularly when the supervisory authority will be obliged to obtain prior approval from the Minister for criteria for apportioning the levy among the accountancy bodies. There will be efforts to have large public companies contribute to particular audits.</P>
    <P>This legislation introduces a system whereby company directors will be required to draw up a compliance statement which will cover a company's policies and procedures concerning its compliance with its statutory obligations &ndash; including its obligations under company and tax law &ndash; and which will be reviewed by auditors. It is important that this matter, which will affect small companies, is dealt with quickly. Given that compliance applies to small companies, very few accountancy firms will sign off the accounts on the basis that they must also be audited. It will be a restriction and could be detrimental to the continued viability of some companies.</P>
    <P>Under the new legislation, the accountancy bodies will have to submit their by-laws &ndash; including their ethical rules and disciplinary and investigation procedures &ndash; to the IAASA for approval. This will lead to a significant strengthening of such rules and procedures, including rules governing auditor independence, while making direc<Col N="1140" />tors much more aware of their obligations under the law. Many SME directors will see this as a burden and I agree with that view. There are many forms and regulations which small companies must complete. I met an accountant recently who said he would not take on any more limited companies because of the number of regulations that must be complied with and the consequent responsibilities placed on him. He recommended that such companies should change their status and revert to being single trader companies.</P>
    <P>The Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill also contains provisions whereby directors of certain companies will be required to establish audit committees. I worked in the Department of Industry and Commerce with Des O'Malley during the passage of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1990. This was detailed and excellent legislation, if I may say so, which has been amended somewhat in the interim.</P>
    <P>Considerable background work went into the drafting of the Bill. Senator O'Toole chaired the review group, which produced an excellent report. Very few amendments are required, although I have received some submissions, mainly from small companies. Larger companies do not seem to be too concerned about the Bill. I am a member of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, which will consider submissions on this Bill in May, prior to Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State indicated that this is draft legislation. Given the vast experience of the Minister of State and the Tánaiste in this area, I feel the Government will be open to amendments from all sides of the House in the best interests of the Bill. As the former chairman of the review group, Senator O'Toole will have tremendous input to make. Given that he was immersed in the detail, I would be interested to get his view on exempting companies with small turnovers. This would lend weight to my arguments and those of Senator Coghlan.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that Members of the House are being employed in a particular way. I refer to the manner in which the Tánaiste decided to appoint Senator O'Toole to chair the 18-person committee. Contrary to the provisions of most of the Bills that go through the House &ndash; under which Members of the Oireachtas are restricted from being members of State bodies&mdash;</P>

      <P>It ill behoves any politician to refuse words of credit and praise, whether or not they are entitled to them. While I put much effort into chairing the audit review group and co-ordinating its activities, credit is due to those who have produced the goods. The report was published some time ago and the work of converting it into legislation has been done effectively by the interim Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, which has been established and of which I am a director. The work of co-ordinating and leading that authority is being done by Ms Karen Irwin who is present in the Chamber. She has done tremendous work and has had an extraordinary input to ensure that the report's findings are reflected in the legislation.</P>
      <P>Members should recognise that the Bill is not a negotiating document; it is a compromise document. It is not what the politicians or the general public wanted, it is a compromise that was arrived at in the aftermath of listening to the views of all the different groups to see how we could meet their needs. It is not exactly what anybody wants. If I was asked to draft the Bill, I would take a much stronger view on some of the issues than that which is reflected in it.</P>
      <P>Accountancy bodies and business groups have a view and, like us, they held the same view two years ago. If people want to reopen the issue, we will resume the ball game. However, I remind Senators that the legislation arose from a report to the Committee of Public Accounts. That committee gave us certain instructions and its views were very clear and represented those of Members on all sides, including Deputies Ardagh, Durkan and Rabbitte who made a strong input into the proceedings. The late Jim Mitchell was the Chairman and a former Deputy, Seán Doherty, was also a member of the committee. All of them had a major input into the process.</P>
      <P>When we produced the report of the audit review group, which has been warmly accepted by Members, the Committee of Public Accounts was less than enthusiastic and had real difficulties because it felt it did not meet its demands. The committee believed that the report did not go far enough and was described by the Chairman as being &ldquo;more like a pussycat than a tiger&rdquo;. It was only after absolute assurances were given by me, as chairman of the committee, and the Tánaiste, as the appropriate Minister, that we believed this would work, that Deputies Rabbitte and Jim Mitchell said they were prepared, on that basis, to see if that would be the case. I wish to underline that because it is how we came to our current position. If people want to start raising the bar, it can be raised in all sorts of ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No Bill is ever perfect on Second Stage, but certain issues can be tweaked and altered as we proceed through the subsequent stages. The accountancy bodies have made a strong case for more representation, but I will only support that case when they support the thrust of the Bill. I was glad to hear their spokesperson doing so this morning, although their views have certainly been <Col N="1142" />very negative for the past month. All we have heard from the accountancy bodies is negativity, but that is not the way to play the game at present. The Bill comes from a time when the public was appalled by and aghast at what emerged from the DIRT inquiry and other tribunals concerning the involvement of accountants and auditors in all sorts of nefarious activities that created various difficulties.</P>
    <P>I still believe in self-regulation and I hold to the position that accountancy bodies can do a good job. I defended that position before the Committee of Public Accounts. Members of that committee felt, for example, that self-regulation was not working and that it would not work in future either. They believed that auditors should not be allowed to serve for more than five years in any company and that they should never be allowed to do non-audit work. However, we managed to convince the Committee of Public Accounts that it was not appropriate to go that far and that there were other ways of adjusting those issues.</P>
    <P>We should remind ourselves of the position from which we started in terms of framing the legislation and dealing with these issues, in respect of which there have been long and difficult discussions in the audit review group and the interim Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority board. If a Member or somebody from the accountancy bodies or other interest groups raises any issue that has not already been discussed, pulled apart and dealt with by one of those groups, then we will have to listen. That is the yardstick by which we should judge the Bill.</P>
    <P>On the question of limited liability, it was interesting to listen to Senator Leyden who has got the point precisely. I am delighted to hear what that auditor, to whom he referred, said. The country has forgotten that limited liability is a gift. During the 1970s and 1980s, RTE's &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; produced many programmes about people who closed down companies that owed money all over the place and then opened up the following day with a change of name or address.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We were just being made fools of. People should remember that limited liability was granted by society to the business community on the basis of trust and confidence that people would not lose out. If people cannot comply with that, then, quite rightly, they should not trade under limited liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People are genuinely concerned about issues, including compliance. Some of the interpretations of this legislation that I have seen ascribed to various people in print are incorrect. Directors are required to do a number of things within the Bill's compliance provisions. They have to tell investors, shareholders and consumers that a company is compliant and can be relied upon. They are not required to search under stones or in every corner of a company. The most honest <Col N="1143" />board of directors can be scuttled by a dishonest middle or senior manager. I would make a distinction, however, between responsibility and accountability. Directors are responsible for certain things but, if they go wrong, someone else may be held accountable. Under the provisions of the Bill, directors have to ensure that accounting standards are met, that structures are in place to ensure compliance and that they are satisfied that those structures are effective. That is all they will have to do, but I am appalled to think that is considered to be new because I always believed that was the function and duty of company directors.</P>
    <P>Some company directors have been misled during the past month to the effect that, since these matters are to be legislated for, they could lose their homes or find themselves in court or in jail because their company was not compliant. However, that is not the aim behind the legislation. The Bill will ensure that company directors assure themselves that their companies have put in place compliant structures, as far as is practicable, and they will be required to sign up to that.</P>
    <P>I have read articles by people who are trying to make money by establishing training courses for directors. They want to make a few thousand euro a day telling people about the difficulties they are in, including in respect of health and safety regulations on food, but everybody is supposed to comply with these regulations. Although the Bill focuses on taxation and the finance issue, I find it extraordinary that directors suddenly feel under threat because they cannot tell whether their companies are complying with health and safety legislation. This raises a new issue that, if it becomes a problem, we may have to examine in a different context.</P>
    <P>The necessary structures are in place, but the next question is what the auditor must do. The auditor has to say that, as far as he or she is concerned, the compliance statement, which has been signed off by the directors, is okay. Auditors are now being told &ndash; by the same people who will be earning a few thousand euro a day telling them how they should do their business &ndash; that this will cause all sorts of problems and that they could go out of business unless they establish a sheaf of consultants to ensure a company complies with health and safety regulations, etc. That is not the case, however, because the Bill is very clear. It says the auditor makes his or her decision on the basis of information formed by the auditor while undertaking an audit, non-audit work or other work for the company. He or she is not required to go looking for new information to do the work differently.</P>
    <P>This matter is about compliance. It is also about ensuring that the work required by law is done in a compliant fashion in which we can have trust and confidence. There is no additional work intended. That is the clear intention of the audit review group, the IAASA and this legislation. That is the way it is set up. One body of account<Col N="1144" />ants wrote to me and, apart from indicating that I was unfair in my comments, which is fair enough, stated this compliance statement was unique to Ireland. That is a powerful phrase. I am unique to Ireland. There is nobody exactly like me. Everybody in this House is unique. If that body of accountants is trying to give the impression that there is nothing like this anywhere else in the world, it is wrong.</P>
    <P>The Sarbanes-Oxley Act signed by George Bush last July is clear. It requires that a company account report signed off by the directors will include a statement by the chief executive officer and the chief finance officer to the effect that the company is compliant. It is a criminal offence not to supply that statement. That is included in US legislation. I make that point in case someone says we will be less than competitive if we introduce similar legislative provisions here. Within ten years no fund manager or stockbroker anywhere in the world will invest a schilling of anybody's money in an economy which is not clearly compliant, clear of corruption and in which we cannot have full trust and confidence. That is the reality. A casual glance at the business or investment pages of any finance magazine will reveal that is the way matters are going.</P>
    <P>In terms of the audit committee, what is involved here is the question of independent directors. I recognise what people are saying about the constraints being imposed in terms of independent directors which are difficult to get. That is something the Bill will put up over the parapet. What we are requiring in the Bill is no different from what people in investment groups have been seeking for the past ten to 15 years, that there should be genuinely independent directors of companies. Senator Coghlan made a valid point that needs to be considered in terms of small companies. I am talking about large companies in this context. Directors must be independent. We are requiring in this legislation that they meet the external and internal auditor on their own without management, executive directors or others being involved. We are saying they also have to say that as far as they are concerned, the company auditor in question needs to be renewed. This is how we moved away from the demand that they hold their positions for a period no longer than five years. We considered there were problems in that regard, in that people could stop doing their job properly after four years if they knew their position was only for five years. There are swings and roundabouts. The independent audit committee will make a recommendation on who should be auditor, whether that person should continue or otherwise and whether the work has been done satisfactorily and in accordance with accounting standards.</P>
    <P>In terms of self-regulation, it was not the intention of the audit review group, this legislation, or the directors of the board of the IAASA that the members of the board would interfere with the work of accountancy bodies on a daily basis. What is intended is that &ndash; this point was dealt <Col N="1145" />with by Senators Leyden and Coghlan &ndash; the rules, by-laws and constitution would have to comply with certain broad, general principles on which the IAASA will be insistent. If they are not reflected in the constitution, those concerned will be required to reflect them in it before they are given or secure continued recognition.</P>
    <P>It is not correct to say members of the board will interfere with the disciplinary process. The position is clear and the Minister of State set it out clearly. They will intervene only where issues are brought to the attention of the board. This legislation emerged from people writing to Members of these Houses and others pointing out that they had brought complaints to bodies but they were not dealt with and asking how high profile accountants could continue to be in operation, etc. We know what was going on.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with the issue of accountants being directors. They have a strong argument to make but they need to be careful about the basis on which they make it. I do not accept the argument they have made for various reasons. They have made the case that we need accountants because of all the work being done by the board. The legislation makes it clear that the board is required to have the staff and the resources to do what it is doing. Members of the board, like me, will not be examining the accounts of businesses, drafting practice notes or setting accounting standards, on which we will be advised. It would be helpful to have accountants and auditors on the board, on which there are two already. I would support the idea provided that everything else was in order. There is a strong argument to be made in that regard, although not on the basis that members of the board need to have the necessary experience and knowledge to do the work of accountants. Members of the board will not become accountants tomorrow morning. Their job is to act very much like any regulator does; he or she examines the situation, the problems, the advice and comes to a conclusion. That is how the work of the board will be done. It will be done in close contact, which is the only way it can be done.</P>
    <P>Self-regulation is on the basis of there being a proper balance between the accountancy bodies and the IAASA. That is the basis on which it should work. It is not a case of somebody standing over a accountancy body and telling it what to do all the time. The approach is that the body must reflect certain standards. If complaints are made to the IAASA that matters are not being dealt with properly, we will be required to look into them. That does not mean it will automatically overturn matters. Such matters must be dealt with in a structured way. Like any formal complaint, such a complaint would have to be dealt with at different levels.</P>
    <P>I do not know anybody involved in the IAASA and did not know anybody in the audit review group who did not hold accountants in high regard. The motivation for this legislation stems from the fact that the vast majority of accountants <Col N="1146" />and auditors are thoroughly honest, utterly committed and compliant to the last detail. This legislation is about protecting their good reputation.</P>

      <P>I came here today to welcome the Bill and commend the work of Senator O'Toole. I regret that he is leaving the Chamber because I was going to say something about him and the committee of which he was a member. I am in a bit of a quandary because he has described this legislation as a non-negotiable document. If that is the case, why it is before the House and why will there be a Committee Stage debate? Such a comment seriously questions the role of the Oireachtas in this regard. I would not attribute such sentiments to the Senator but if such a comment had been made by anybody else, I would regard it as slightly arrogant for somebody to say we do not have a role in this matter. I have often been a member or head of a committee which has made reports such as this. One does ones best, tries to get a meeting of minds and, so far as possible, a consensus but at the end of the day it is for this and the other House to decide in this regard.</P>
      <P>I have a number of declarations of interest to make. I am a director of Independent News and Media, Regtel and the Ireland Fund. The first is a large international company, the second a small regulatory body and the third a charity. It might be worthwhile discouraging charities and such bodies from taking on company status. They only clutter up the Companies Office and the work of a body such as this. This debate points to the need for a decent regulatory system for charities and such bodies. The current system brings them into the ambit of procedures with which they do not need to be involved.</P>
      <P>I support what Senator Leyden said to the extent that the auditing profession should be more represented than it is on the proposed body. One needs to bring the profession along. I am not a member of it but we need the general support that would bring. If one considers this body in the context of bodies in other professions, it might be advisable to reconsider this matter.</P>
      <P>I thought it would be helpful if I spoke about my experience as a non-executive independent director &ndash; not because this is where the issue pinches me, but because of the importance of independent non-executive directors. I take seriously the role of protector of shareholders, particularly small shareholders. They are not necessarily always represented by large institutional investors who have the capacity to influence customs in a way that does not always suit small individual investors. That is part of my job, which is also to see that the executives do their job and are compliant with the law in all respects with regard to accounting so that the company is run properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been a member of an audit committee in one company which acted in almost exactly the way specified in the legislation. As Senator O'Toole said, most large companies act in accord<Col N="1147" />ance with accounting standards because they must deal in international markets which require that compliance. It is important that there should be consistency between Irish and international standards so that some company does not trip up because an Irish requirement is more specific than requirements in other countries.</P>
    <P>My difficulty with the legislation relates to the requirements for compliance. Senator O'Toole eased my concerns to a certain degree, but this is still difficult. A few weeks ago a company I am involved with sent me an important document of 50 pages which was accompanied by a 70-page note of advice from the company's solicitors detailing all the things I should and should not do. It scared the wits out of me because I was trying to be honest and stand over what I could say or do. The legislation is in danger of creating a cottage industry of advisers to advisers to advisers or of requiring people to scrutinise things too deeply before they can act.</P>
    <P>Directors are supposed to give certificates of compliance. I presume this means that directors will act as a group and not as individuals. I get uneasy in church when people say: &ldquo;We believe.&rdquo; I am prepared to confirm what I believe, but how do I know what other people believe? There is a danger that if one spreads responsibility around to a lot of people, one diffuses authority. I was an accounting officer in a department and knew what I had to do, namely, to set up systems and to see that the work was done. That is the most anyone can ask and it is the responsibility of the chief executive and the others, including non-executive directors, to see that that is carried out. Anything that makes this more discouraging or frightening is regrettable and the Minister of State should examine this, particularly in the case of companies that have subsidiaries all over the place.</P>
    <P>I totally support the proposition that companies should abide by company law and tax law. One is gravely derelict in one's duty if one does not ensure that a company does so. It is when that is extended to responsibilities under environmental law, health and safety regulations, equality legislation and so on, across a wide range of jurisdictions and legislation, that it becomes more difficult.</P>
    <P>The Bill is an attempt at social engineering on a monumental scale. Without picking on old sores, it is like the Freedom of Information Act. That Act was profoundly important but lost focus when its ambit was increased. There is a danger with this legislation that the reach of the provisions extends beyond its grasp. It might take the focus away from what we are really after, which is ensuring that people behave properly when it comes to financial and company law. I ask the Minister of State to consider that matter.</P>
    <P>There is also a danger, in respect of non-executive directors, that the Act will force people to consider whether they are financially numerate and literate. I am not so numerate or literate, but <Col N="1148" />I bring other experiences of the wider world to the role of non-executive director with companies I deal with. This is another narrowing of the focus the Minister of State should examine.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill and the intentions behind it. It is hugely important and, despite my earlier remarks, I admire the work done by Senator O'Toole and his colleagues. However, the focus would be improved if the compliance requirements were restricted to compliance with tax, company law, etc., as well as material breaches of same. Those requirements should not extend to subsidiaries which will have boards in their own companies that will be required to secure compliance. There is also a problem for companies with many subsidiaries as, from my reading of the Bill, they will be forced to replicate procedures. It might be sufficient for a compliance statement to be issued by the group parent on behalf of the subsidiaries.</P>
    <P>It is a good Bill, but it needs a little fine-tuning. Despite Senator O'Toole's remarks, I hope that fine-tuning can be done on Committee Stage to improve the legislation. I thank the Minister of State for his attention and I wish him and the legislation well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. As other speakers said, this Bill is a long time coming but it is welcome nonetheless. I listened with interest to the passionate defence by Senator O'Toole of what he obviously regards as his &ldquo;baby&rdquo; and I share much of his philosophical approach to this issue. He is clearly used to the process of partnership practised here for some years, whereby one talks issues out behind closed doors with interested parties. When a compromise is reached one then says: &ldquo;That's it, take it or leave it. There will be no further talks on this.&rdquo; In those circumstances it must be inconvenient to have to put legislation through the processes of the Oireachtas and subject it to a Committee Stage debate. No doubt Senator O'Toole will come to terms with this on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The Bill seeks to do different things which are complementary but distinctly different. It places the disciplinary procedures of the accountancy profession on a statutory basis, which is important. It puts the IAASA, which has been operating with an interim board, on a statutory footing and, as the Minister of State and other speakers indicated, deals with corporate governance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As someone who has occasionally practised as a solicitor, usually depending on the wishes of the people of Dublin North-Central at any given time, I am obviously a member of the Incorporated Law Society. As a result I have perhaps a more benign view than many of self-regulation. There is a general view among members of the public that all professions are conspiracies against lay people and that they are necessarily self-protective, self-protecting and bordering on the corrupt. Unfortunately, there have been all too many cases in recent years in virtually all professions <Col N="1149" />which tend to support that view. However, examples of that kind do not necessarily make for good generalisations and that is the case here.</P>
    <P>There is merit in self-regulation and in relying on the expertise of people who know how business is done. There is merit in one accountant judging another. They know what the pressures of work are and what can reasonably be expected of another accountant in particular circumstances. It is very much in the interests of accountancy bodies and individual accountants to ensure others do not bring the profession into disrepute. By and large, they know the rules of the game, and it is in their interest to uphold them. That applies to other professions also. Therefore, I can see serious merit in the proposal and would be very reluctant to go down the road of tearing up a system that has, by and large, worked reasonably well.</P>
    <P>In fairness to all concerned in producing the Bill and those who conducted the various consultations which preceded it, the structure which we have got is not a bad one. The notion that self-regulation is effectively maintained, put on a statutory basis and that an oversight system should be put in place is a good one. I share what I understood to be the general understanding of what was intended, namely, that the oversight was intended as just exactly that, not as daily involvement in disciplinary procedures against accountants. I would like to hear the Minister of State's assurance that that is the intention. I see it as an appeal mechanism and background safeguard rather than the IAASA as having day-to-day involvement in disciplinary procedures, or for that matter setting down the rules for such procedures to be operated by the accountancy bodies. I see it as a safeguard, certainly as a body which will deal with the accountancy profession in agreeing a method by which they should go about their procedures, occasionally coming into play when need be as a sort of court of appeal.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the bottom line is that it is often the big, important cases &ndash; those that are the focus of most public interest &ndash; where internal disciplinary procedures fail. That is the primary reason we have to put the existing processes on a statutory footing because they are only as good as the worst case. In very many cases ordinary accountants against whom complaints are made will co-operate. It is in their interests to do so, it is almost like a guilty plea if they do not. They would see it as their ethical and professional duty to co-operate with the professional bodies, of which they are members. However, as matters stand, those bodies do not have statutory power to oblige compliance. It is important that it is given to them. It is in the important cases where there is serious non-compliance &ndash; serious fiddling, for the sake of argument &ndash; where when an investigation starts one will get partial information or co-operation from those against whom a complaint is made. One does not very often get a refusal to co-operate but one will get partial co-operation with a little of the information one <Col N="1150" />needs in order to make a judgment. Therfore, it is important that the bodies are in a position to use the statutory powers that the Bill gives them in order to ensure full compliance, co-operation, delivery and discovery of documentation and so on. I am glad that that is being done.</P>
    <P>There are a few issues regarding the Bill to which others have referred which have been the cause of some controversy heretofore. I will share my preliminary thoughts with the House. The first relates to the independence of auditors. Again, we must remind ourselves, as Senator O'Toole so eloquently did, of where we are coming from. We are coming from a position where at public hearings before the Oireachtas subcommittee on DIRT, it became crystal clear that auditors in very large companies &ndash; in this case, financial institutions &ndash; either had not come across serious non-compliance with the law or did not disclose it in their reports. That was quite rightly the cause of public scandal and the impulse behind the setting in motion the process which brings us this Bill. The bottom line must be that we must be able to say at the end of the process that what we are now putting in place will stop this happening and that, even with the Bill, it cannot continue. I am not totally convinced that that is the case.</P>
    <P>I have sympathy with the view of members of the DIRT sub-committee that the provisions for the independence of auditors are not as thorough as they should be. There is a compelling case for saying auditors should not do non-audit work for the same company. I know that there is a process in the Bill whereby there is a requirement on companies to note the non-audit work done by auditors in a particular year and, for that matter, the preceding year. I wonder whether that will be sufficient to establish the independence of auditors. As I was not part of the independent review group, I do not know what the argument was. I suspect it ran something along the lines that there were so few big accountancy firms in the country that it would be impossible to enforce a rule whereby one could not have the same company &ndash; I will not name any &ndash; doing all sorts of work for the same firm. Nonetheless, the principle is an extremely important one because the conflict of interest is self-evident to everybody. If one is working for a company, it is not in one's interest to start pointing to faults in the way it does things. Unfortunately, although one might say good practice and professional ethics should dictate otherwise, there have been all too many examples where accountancy firms have been reluctant to do even what would be their statutory duty in other jurisdictions. I am not totally convinced that the section 42 procedure set out in the Bill will be sufficient to have the effect that we want it to have.</P>
    <P>Senator Maurice Hayes dwelt at some length on the certificate of compliance in section 43. This is an interesting departure, though I am not totally sure that it will have the desired effect. However, I support its general thrust. Like <Col N="1151" />Senator O'Toole, I am a little concerned at some of the opposition to it. As I read it, the primary thrust is to ensure compliance with tax and company law legislation. It goes on to talk about &ldquo;any other enactments . that may materially affect the company's financial statements&rdquo;. It would help if the Minister was to spell this out. It has been represented to us that legislation as diverse as food safety and health and safety regulations could conceivably come under it. That is probably pushing it and would not be my reading of it. However, it would obviously be useful to get an indication from the Minister of State <i>ex cathedra</i> as to what he sees it affecting.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, even if it does, these are Acts of the Oireachtas, put in place for a reason, which impose obligations on companies, be they in the interests of customers, workers or whomever. It is worrying when we are told that directors of a company should not have any responsibility for ensuring those Acts of the Oireachtas are adhered to because surely they must be. We have always had a problem &ndash; I believe the Minister of State has some experience of this &ndash; with health and safety, for example, where we are effectively told that the splendid laws and regulations are to all intents and purposes non-enforceable or not enforced.</P>
    <P>Perhaps by creating a pressure point and explicitly saying this is the responsibility of directors and requiring them to sign off a statement once a year stating, &ldquo;These are our practices and as far as we can see, they are working well&rdquo;, we would give the regulations more effect. Perhaps that would bring it to the attention of directors on an annual basis that these are legislative responsibilities imposed by the Oireachtas which have to be taken seriously. If it did that, it would be no bad thing. My sympathy is very much with the review group and the recommendation that it has made. My concern would be whether a once-a-year statement, perhaps a practice statement to be made even less often, would be sufficient to create the pressure point about which I was talking.</P>
    <P>The argument has been made about the composition of the board. To be perfectly honest, I have no view on this. If it is effectively an appeals board, it is right that it should have representation from the profession on it but with a majority from outside. Two members out of 12 or 13 seems a relatively low level of representation. If the accountancy bodies are of the view that that is important, perhaps we should look at it again. I am sure that the Minister of State will be open to doing this.</P>
    <P>We have had some discussion of the whole issue of limited liability, which is central to the argument about the threshold one uses for imposing auditing requirements and so on. I very much hold to the view that Senator O'Toole articulated. Limited liability is a privilege which includes, among other matters, effectively being able to walk away from one's debts in certain cir<Col N="1152" />cumstances. We should require companies which receive that privilege to adhere to certain regulations. Business will always state regulation is somewhere between a pain in the neck and an anti-competitive measure and so on. They will say this. I would not expect them to say anything different. If I was involved in business, I would say it, too. However, there is a responsibility on those of us who, in a sense, put the regulations in place to, first, explain the reason they are necessary and we are making them &ndash; we so often do not do this &ndash; and then ensure they are reasonable and can be easily complied with. Regulation, if it has a good reason and is put in place in a fashion which makes sense, is important. I certainly support the sort of regulation which the Bill looks to put in place.</P>
    <P>It strikes me that issues such as the threshold for auditing should be dealt with at a European level. These days much of our company legislation is centred on directives from Brussels. It is surprising that this is an issue that has not been dealt with in that context. If it is providing a competitive advantage, for the sake of argument, to companies incorporated in the UK and Northern Ireland, it is not then in the overall interest of the European Union that this should be the case. We should press this matter on an international basis. It would make sense that auditing requirements be levied on a reasonable basis according to internationally agreed standards.</P>
    <P>I support the thrust of the Bill. I sense in the Minister of State's initial statement that he is open to amendments and I look forward to Committee Stage after the Easter recess.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite" hpid="Ms White Ms White">
      <NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, and the officials in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment for presenting what I term real legislation to the House. I commend the initiative by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, to regulate the accountancy profession.</P>
      <P>Self-regulation within the profession did not work. It is claimed by some Senators that self-regulation does work, but it has been proven otherwise. There have been rogue accountancy companies and companies with ambiguous roles within large companies. It was Senator McDowell, I believe, who spoke of transparency. The new rules will impose additional disclosure requirements on companies with regard to fees paid to their audit firms for services other than the audit itself. It is clear to us now that there should be transparency as to whether the audit company is providing other services, such as management strategic plans for the company rather than just doing the audit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have observed mega accountancy companies who have had extraordinary relationships with some of the companies that they are auditing. The tribunals of inquiry showed that proper relationships did not exist regarding companies and auditors. Auditors were getting big fees and <Col N="1153" />overlooking serious problems in the companies. It is all transparent now, but we did not think of it at the time.</P>
    <P>It took two women with guts to whistleblow on the Enron case and expose the companies that were receiving mega fees and responsible for the audit at the same time. We are talking with 20-20 vision but it did not seem to be a problem then. I remember encountering a similar situation ten years ago and thinking that a company was getting special treatment because they were big payers.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the role of directors in companies. Senator Leyden referred to the turnover threshold of &euro;317,000. We have a high rate of failure in business and the number one requirement of a start-up company is to have a board, a chairman and strict financial management. A small company cannot have an audit committee, but the rules should apply to large and small companies. From my business experience, our customers have to trust our company. If there is a failure of trust, people will not do business with the company. From day one, very strict accountancy procedures have to be introduced to enable the company to survive. Part of the reason for the rate in failures is that companies are not keeping tight accounts of expenditure and costs. People cannot blame too many regulations for failure.</P>
    <P>Company directors must now take responsibility for issues such as health and safety regulations and company law. It is about time, because directors were able to receive fees of between &euro;15,000 and &euro;20,000 from small companies for representing their investors, when all they had to do was to sit at company meetings and not take responsibility. It may seem extreme or over-regulated but it is good that the directors now cannot sit there and look at figures and not give proper professional advice to companies. My company was built on trust and integrity. Without it no other company would deal with us. I am not sure of Senator Leyden's point on the &euro;317,000 threshold.</P>
    <P>People approach me asking what to do about the businesses in their area where 95% of them are failing and claiming that the Government is over-regulating industry. More importantly, it is a matter of trust. It is not complicated but is common sense.</P>
    <P>When I was on the audit committee of Bord Bia, we had to make sure that we complied with all the EU regulations. Unless Bord Bia was transparent in its operations, it would not receive any funding. Auditing and compliance are positive. I support the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, when she says that she wants Ireland to be at the forefront of the best international practice on corporate governance.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister inform us what type of audit committee is required for a small company up to the turnover threshold of &euro;317,000? I would hold that at the threshold of &euro;317,000 directors should have to be compliant because these small com<Col N="1154" />panies will not survive if they do not get their financial position correct and above board. There are so many obstacles to overcome.</P>
    <P>I was fascinated that the chairman of the committee told us this was a compromise document. It seems to me to be a strict document, but it was presented in an atmosphere where there was recognition that not everything had been done properly in the State.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Tánaiste and the Minister of State and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment for this legislation. It may appear to be heavy-hitting but it is the right type of legislation.</P>

      <P>Mine is at one remove but at the same time relevant. However, I will speak for myself on this Bill. I did not hear Senator O'Toole's contribution. However, I recall that, at the time he was chairing the group that dealt with this issue, I had taken it upon myself to walk to work every morning. I used to meet him outside the Shelbourne Hotel because as I walked down Kildare Street, he would usually be walking towards me. His meetings took place at 7.30 a.m. which showed a great zeal in tackling the issue. I have no doubt that his commitment to the partnership process over many years has borne fruit in the report the group issued and in the Bill before us. It is right that it took time for the legislation to emerge because the proposal and the various recommendations required careful deliberation. Some might say that the Bill was slow in coming forward but, given the importance of the topics it covers, I do not believe that to be the case.</P>
      <P>There are a number of points I wish to make. I hope we will get another opportunity to speak on the Bill again when the Minister of State returns for the Committee Stage debate. I am particularly interested in two matters, the first of which is the membership of the board. On &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning, the chief executive of the Institute of Chartered Accountants referred to the membership of the board and, in particular, the number of places assigned to accountants in its membership. I understand that provision is made for two accountants to serve on the board and that the executive director may or may not be an accountant. If he or she is an accountant, that number will be increased to three. In my opinion, the chief executive had a point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be 13 members on the board &ndash; 12 <Col N="1155" />members and the executive officer &ndash; and it does not seem appropriate that only two of these will come from the relevant profession. I do not agree with what he said when he compared this to a board dealing with medical matters and what would happen if only two of its members were doctors. Financial matters are different to those involving human health. At the same time, however, the allocation of two out of 13 places is quite low and it should be augmented to at least four. I hope the Minister for State will consider making this change because it would only be fair to do so.</P>
    <P>The accounting profession and companies needed this Bill. The DIRT inquiry showed that a slackness and a <i>laissez faire </i>attitude had emerged in respect of the rigour which should obtain in companies, in the accountancy profession, in the compilation of accounts and in how directors do their business. I approve of that. I accept that wrongdoing occurred, but I do not believe that the majority of those involved in the accountancy profession set out to perpetrate scams. As a result of the slackness to which I refer, it appeared that scant attention was sometimes paid how business was conducted in various areas.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment, in particular, on sections 38 to 43, inclusive, which deal with transparency and how the changes will come about. Section 39 introduces an obligation that accounts will have to be prepared in accordance with accounting standards. The Minister of State indicated that &ldquo;It is important to note that the accounting standards applicable to a company are those relevant to its circumstances and its annual accounts. This means that some accounting standards will not be relevant to some companies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said, &ldquo;Section 41 introduces for the first time in statute law a requirement for companies to disclose the accounting policies adopted in determining in particular the amounts included in the balance sheet and profit and loss account.&rdquo; That provision is going to be quite sharp and will require a rigour of attention to detail which will be well worthwhile in the context of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State also stated:</P>
    <P>Section 42 requires the disclosure of information regarding the remuneration paid to the auditor for audit work, audit related work and non-audit work. Corresponding information for the previous year is also required to be disclosed. Where the remuneration for work is of an insignificant amount, below &euro;1,000, the information does not have to be disclosed.</P>
    <P>That is an excellent provision. Section 43 on the compliance statement is also very good.</P>
    <P>During my term as Minister for Public Enterprise, I became very friendly with Patricia Hewitt, the Minister for Small Business and e-Commerce at the Department of Trade and Industry in the United Kingdom. She is now Sec<Col N="1156" />retary of State for Trade and Industry and she sent me a copy of an interesting discussion document on directors of companies in the aftermath of the Enron and other scandals in the United States. The Bill before us is very good in that it puts the responsibility squarely on the directors of companies, who in turn must say to their audit companies that this is what they stand over as being in good and fair practice and that the figures with which they have been presented are correct, or whatever is the correct terminology. This is important in the context of the furore that arose, and rightly so, over the DIRT scandal and its outcome. Directors deal with their companies on a daily basis and it is quite correct that there should be an increased onus of responsibility on them to say what they do, what they spend, how they run their business and submit correct accounts to their auditors. The double way in which we are effecting that shift in responsibility in the Bill is more appropriate than what is happening in the United Kingdom, where the authorities are going after the directors and not dealing, as yet, with the accountancy profession. We have managed to marry the two, which is a good development.</P>
    <P>The Bill will be seen as headline legislation throughout Europe and I note that the United States has marched ahead since the Enron scandal. The legislation has been carefully thought out. I pay tribute to Senator O'Toole for his role in that regard and to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the officials, the Tánaiste for taking the decision and to the Minister of State who is going to deal with it from now on. It is a worthwhile Bill and I look forward very much to being in the House for the Committee Stage debate.</P>
    <P>We are glad that the Bill was introduced in the Seanad, which, I believe, is a tribute to the work of Senator O'Toole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I must express my deep concern at only being granted seven minutes in which to contribute. I will try and say what I have to say in that time.</P>
      <P>I welcome the establishment of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority on a statutory footing. I also welcome the sentiments the Leader expressed in regard to Senator O'Toole. However, I am horrified and concerned about the implications of the Bill. It has not been thought through and has not been understood. The implications in respect of some of its stipulations will make us uncompetitive in an area of major importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider foreign direct investment. We compete in this area with many other countries and we are now suddenly putting in place a regulatory regime that is more stringent than any that exists elsewhere. I really am horrified by the implications of this. Let us consider the position of multinational companies, particularly those big concerns operating in Ireland at present. They are going to have to find two non-executive directors <Col N="1157" />who will be obliged to sign up for this. Where will they find them? I assume these people must be Irish &ndash; nobody outside the country will accept the stipulations that are required of them &ndash; and they will be obliged to sign a compliance statement that is tougher than those which must be completed in any other country of which I am aware.</P>
    <P>Let me deal with the example of Scotland, where there will be delight at this legislation because the Scots will tell every multinational thinking of investing in Ireland that it will have to find two non-executive directors who are Irish, who have not worked in the company in the past five years, who are going to have to sign a compliance statement which says a company is guilty unless it proves itself innocent each year. It is unbelievable that we are thinking of doing something like this. It is just not foreseeable that this could happen on that basis.</P>
    <P>Let me take one other instance. Where are we to find these non-executive directors? They are difficult to find at the moment. The onus on a non-plc company, a private limited company, is far too great to make sense. The directors will have to be familiar with a level of detail which in order to sign a compliance statement means the only choice they will have will be to get consultants to check on the environment, on tax, on food safety and on everything else, and to say &ldquo;Yes, I have done this.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I happen to have a company which fits into this category and which does not have non-executive directors who have not worked in the company in the past five years. I would imagine the same applies to the vast majority of other Irish companies. I am speaking today about foreign direct investment, the companies on whom we rely and have relied on for years. When they consider going to Ireland or some other country, they will see that the Irish regime is far tougher than that applied by the Oxley Act in the United States.</P>
    <P>Let me take some aspects of the Oxley Act which makes things far less onerous than they are in Ireland. The legislation before us provides that all the non-executive directors must sign up to compliance and may not be on the audit committee. In the US, the only people not allowed to be on the audit committee are the chief executive officer and chief financial officer. In the US, this applies to all public companies, but under the proposed regime in Ireland all private companies will be included as well. This means that Intel and Hewlett Packard and others who operate in Ireland will have to find Irish directors who have not worked in these companies in the last five years and who are going to have to sign up to compliance. Where will they find them? How many such directors are there? I am thinking of the companies that I know. Where will we find people who will sign up to compliance, knowing that if they make a mistake, and do not get in consultants to check on everything, they will be guilty and will suffer the penalties?</P>
    <P>In the United States, companies certify to the <Col N="1158" />Securities and Exchange Commission, but in Ireland companies certify publicly in annual reports rather than to a competent authority. That is another nail in the coffin of foreign direct investment in Ireland. In the United States it is required that accounts &ldquo;fairly present in all material respects the operations and financial conditions&rdquo; of the business, while in Ireland the requirement under this legislation is that companies &ldquo;comply with company and tax law and all other relevant obligations that may materially affect the company's financial statements&rdquo;. This is a tougher regime than in any other country.</P>
    <P>We are talking about foreign direct investment in Ireland. How many companies will be affected? Has anyone done the sum? Certainly it will affect all foreign companies entering Ireland. How many potential or willing non-executive directors are there in Ireland who would be prepared to take on the role? How many non-executive directors are qualified to take it on? I cannot think of anyone I could ask to go on a board and sign the appropriate statements, unless a huge sum of money is to be paid, because it is not worth anyone's time to take on the job considering the potential penalties likely to be involved.</P>
    <P>The foreign companies in Ireland will incur heavier costs than other companies in other EU countries and Ireland will be at a huge disadvantage. I am thinking of foreign direct investment, but also of Irish companies like my own. In the ten years I have been in this House I have never talked about my own company. We compete with foreign companies in Ireland. They will not have to comply with the stipulation at issue. Irish companies will have to find directors willing to sign up to compliance, people who have not worked in the company during the previous five years, people who will have to be paid large sums of money. The company must then find consultants to put those people's minds at rest before they sign up.</P>
    <P>If I am hot under the collar about this issues, it is because I believe that while legislation and a supervisory body are needed, as well as rules and regulations, we should not take the step that makes them so much tougher and more stringent than in any other country. If we do, it will mean that when any company considers setting up in Ireland, it will be warned that it will have to endure a regime tougher than anywhere else, a regime very difficult to adhere to. Every Irish company to whom the legislation applies, and I know of one, is competing in general terms with trading companies from outside the State, to whom as far as I know the legislation will not apply. Some Irish companies are in direct competition with such companies. Why then should we put in stipulations that are so much tougher, and a regime that will be so stringent and controlled that it will make it difficult to find anyone to take on the non-executive role?</P>
    <P>Non-executive directors will be difficult to find. Their own personal exposure regarding compliance statements will be too great. The require<Col N="1159" />ment of the audit committee for the non-plc is far too onerous. I can understand its being applied to a public company, as it is in the United States, but I do not understand its application to private companies which have not got outside shareholders.</P>
    <P>Directors cannot be expected to be familiar with the level of detail required to sign a compliance statement without using teams of consultants. This issue has not received the attention it deserves and the IDA will have very serious concerns when it considers it. We have not had a proposal on this issue from the IDA. Perhaps they have missed it or not done anything about it yet, but every foreign company coming into Ireland will now face the consideration of Irish regulations being so onerous, costly and detailed that they will have to be changed if we are to remain competitive in attracting foreign investment into Ireland.</P>
    <P>I look forward to Committee Stage in the belief that we will consider the very serious provisions that this Bill is introducing.</P>

      <P>I propose to share my time. As we are all aware, corporate governance is very much a hot topic at present in light of events in this country concerning offshore accounts and various tribunals, and internationally with the Enron scandal and the trouble AIB had with its American subsidiary, Allfirst. How businesses are run is something in which community and investors alike are taking renewed interest. It is clear that the measures introduced in the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill 2003 are firmly rooted in the public and political response which followed each of these events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I welcome the opportunity to discuss the legislation in the area of the regulation of the accounting and auditing professions. The Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill 2003 arises directly from the report of the review group on auditing and the recommendations contained in it form the substance of the Bill. The review group was established by the Tánaiste following the Committee of Public Accounts parliamentary inquiry into DIRT, which examined the regulations and the professional rules governing the auditing profession. I congratulate the Tánaiste on her achievement and her work in the area. The review group was chaired by Senator O'Toole <Col N="1160" />and he too should be congratulated on his superb work in that role.</P>
    <P>This legislation heralds important developments for the accountancy profession. The main function of the Bill is to provide for the establishment on a statutory basis of an independent regulatory body, the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority. The IAASA has already been set up on an interim basis, and has fulfilled its role as a supervisory authority. Though the powers awarded to the IAASA in this legislation are extensive, many of them are very appropriate.</P>
    <P>The principal function of the authority under the new legislation will be to supervise how the prescribed accountancy bodies regulate and monitor their members. In addition, the authority will have the power to intervene in the disciplinary process of the accountancy bodies where it deems necessary, carry out independent investigations in public interest areas, and apply to the courts to compel the directors of a company to amend accounts that are not in line with accounting standards. In addition, the authority will be given the responsibility of promoting adherence to high professional standards in the auditing and accountancy profession.</P>
    <P>I certainly welcome this measure which represents a firm move by the Government to encourage compliance with our tax regime and laws. Undoubtedly, there is sometimes a tendency for companies to try to work around the tax regime. This is a time for legislators to encourage a culture of compliance with our tax regime. We have a shared objective in that all of us strive to promote a situation whereby auditors are trusted as guardians of honesty. This legislation will be beneficial to the reputation of these professions and protect the whole industry from damage caused by any non-compliant members.</P>
    <P>As has been the practice to date, the Bill aims to ensure the authority will be independent of the accounting and auditing profession, while still having at its disposal all the necessary expertise for effective regulation. The number of accountants on the board of the authority will be strictly limited to not more than two out of 13 persons. I am aware that, for this reason, a number of accounting companies have criticised the Bill because they fear the authority will lack the necessary expertise to carry out key functions. Though it is unusual for a profession to be so under-represented on its supervisory authority, I understand the independence of the authority must be upheld at all times. Accordingly, I welcome this measure as a move not to prejudice the autonomy of the authority.</P>
    <P>Although the Bill has clear aims and will have positive effects, there has been considerable controversy in relation to some of its provisions. I wish to address the relevant sections. Section 43 introduces a system whereby company directors will be required to draw up a compliance statement which will cover each company's policies and procedures concerning its compliance with its statutory obligations, including those arising under company and taxation law, which will be reviewed by auditors. Each company auditor will <Col N="1161" />be responsible for the review of this compliance statement.</P>
    <P>While I am satisfied the Minister of State wishes to ensure, as do we all, that the future regulatory system will have a positive influence on standards throughout the profession, we also have a responsibility to ensure the profession can survive in the new regime. I foresee some problems in that regard. I fear the Bill may place an intolerable burden, especially in a financial sense, on directors of small and medium-sized companies. Furthermore, although most accountants and auditors adhere to very high professional standards, a company's auditor may not be sufficiently confident to comment in relation to anything other than auditing, accounting or taxation of a firm. However, this legislation would seem to demand more. We must recognise that an auditor does not have a legal qualification and, therefore, cannot be expected to comment on compliance with anything other than tax law. I respectfully request the Minister of State to review this section, possibly with a view to confining it to larger companies or, at least, delay it until the exemption threshold for audit is reviewed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief comment on this Bill. Ministers are sometimes accused of not being totally <i>au fait</i> with the subject matter of legislation they are introducing. That certainly cannot be said in this instance. The Minister of State dealing with the Bill has a great deal of expertise in the area concerned. As an accountant, I have looked at the situation from both sides. Initially, I worked with a firm of accountants for five years during which I had considerable auditing experience. I subsequently worked for 11 years with a company in the fresh food industry, in the course of which I had considerable contact with Senator Quinn's company.</P>
      <P>During my term as a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas since 1989, there has not been any primary legislation in this area, just regulations. I appreciate that there was a companies Act in 1990 but that did not really deal with the area covered by the Bill. During my time in accountancy practice the bible was the Companies Act 1963. Accordingly, I am glad the legislation is now being updated. I agree there is need for a supervisory and regulatory authority for recognised accountancy bodies. Previously, those bodies were self-regulatory and, by and large, did a good job. In my time there were only three or four accountancy bodies whereas there is now a plethora of different bodies and the situation could spiral out of control, with lower standards in some companies if not properly regulated. That could do a great deal of damage to the image of the profession. Accordingly, I am glad the Bill has been introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My initial reading of section 9 gave me some concern that power was being taken from the Minister and given to recognised accountancy bodies. I recall a situation in the past where a particular body of accountants sought the power to sign off on limited companies' accounts. There was a very strong lobby from the established <Col N="1162" />accountancy groups at the time to prevent this. However, the then Minister intervened and, quite rightly, gave the relevant power because the body in question had the required expertise to do the job. I was concerned that, by removing that power in the Bill, something similar could happen again in future. However, section 11 and the composition of the supervisory authority seem to suggest that that cannot happen.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 15, I support the concept of a reserve fund to enable the authority to instigate investigations concerning members of prescribed accountancy bodies. How will wrongdoing or bad practice be brought to the attention of the authority? In the case of an accountancy firm, is it envisaged that a client of the firm might report on it? In the case of a business, might the report come from a customer? I am not sure what is envisaged in that regard. There are many accountants in the public service who have no dealings with the general public. If there was a difficulty in that regard, who would make a report to the supervisory authority? </P>
    <P>With regard to staff recruitment, I realise it is early days yet in terms of determining the number of personnel to be involved in the new authority. However, I have to ask the question as to where the authority will be located. I sincerely hope it will not be in Dublin, where everything appears to have to be located. Despite much talk of decentralisation and getting people out of Dublin, every newly established body seems to be located in Dublin. That is nonsensical. I am not necessarily making a case for Waterford, although, perhaps I am doing so to some extent.</P>

      <P>If it was just over the county boundary, I would have no problem with it. However, my point is that it should not be located in Dublin. We must get away from that practice.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision in section 34 to correct a previous anomaly whereby a shareholder could be an auditor. I was not aware of this. Even if a person has only a small holding, there would still be a conflict of interest and it is only right that the anomaly should be eliminated. The customary arrangement in an accountancy practice has been that if one of the partners had an involvement with a company, the accounts of that company would be signed off by another partner in the firm. However, that is not at arm's length and I wonder if the arrangement would be outlawed. We have to be very careful in that regard.</P>
      <P>There are other points I had hoped to make but, due to shortage of time, I will confine myself to commenting on section 42 which is important in relation to the independence of auditors where substantial accountancy work is undertaken. In my experience, I visited companies every two months in the course of which I prepared VAT returns, wrote up their cheque journals and cash books and, at the end of the year, did their audit. I welcome the provision to introduce a measure of independence in that regard. The Bill is a step forward and I commend it to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions to this debate in which many interesting points have been raised, of which I will address as many as possible in the time remaining to me. First, I wish to stress that the purpose of the Bill is to promote a culture of corporate compliance in Ireland. I wish to reassure Senators Coughlan and Leyden in relation to their concerns about impositions on businesses, particularly small businesses, by making it clear there is no question of seeking to impose rules, regulations and conditions, the purpose of which serves simply to penalise commercial enterprises. I also wish to make it clear that it is neither my intention, nor the purpose of the Bill, to impose unduly onerous requirements on auditing and accounting practitioners. Above all, the Bill strives to achieve a balance between the need for a climate of minimal State interference with commercial enterprise, at one end of the spectrum and, at the opposite end, the view that all conceivable aspects of commercial operations should be legislated for in detail.</P>
      <P>The implementation of many of the requirements that will flow from the present legislation is a matter of good practice and in many instances a restatement or refinement of obligations that are already in existence. Therefore, the effect of the new legislation should not be such as to induce trauma and panic either in commercial enterprises or among the practitioners who are being addressed in the Bill. Most of all, it will introduce a climate of certainty in the commercial sphere.</P>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senators Coghlan and O'Toole regarding the move from self-regulation to supervised regulation and on how the balance reflected in the Bill was achieved. Senator McDowell also supported the structure and I am satisfied that the balance is right. However, the authority must have the power to intervene as per sections 23 and 24.</P>
      <P>Senators Coghlan, Leyden, O'Toole and McDowell raised points regarding the constitution of the board of directors. It is intended that the board of directors of the supervisory authority will consist of a maximum of 12 directors, in addition to the chief executive officer who will be an <i>ex officio</i> director. The 12 directors will be made up of two persons, nominated by agreement among the prescribed accountancy bodies; two nominated by the Minister and one nominee of each of the bodies set out in paragraph(<i>c</i>)(ii), which are the designated bodies. The provision in section 11 restricts to two the directors appointed by the Minister who can be members of prescribed accountancy bodies. Owing to the fact that there is no restriction as to the profession of the chief executive, the directors could consist of a total of three members of prescribed bodies. These numbers, including the maximum specified in relation to members of prescribed accountancy bodies, can be altered by means of a regulation under section 46 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several Senators have said that the number of directors who are permitted to be members of prescribed accountancy bodies should be <Col N="1164" />increased beyond the present level of two. As I have already said, this can be achieved by ministerial regulation under section 46 and what the Senators propose could also be achieved by increasing the overall number of directors. However, I am not considering that proposition. I will give consideration to increasing the ceiling set in relation to the number of directors who can be members of prescribed accountancy bodies.</P>
    <P>It must be borne in mind that the substance of the work of the authority will be carried out by the executive of the body rather than the board. Furthermore, some of the work will be done by sub-committees of the board which could, if necessary, include members of the prescribed accountancy bodies or experts who are not members of the board. The independence of the authority is an over-riding consideration and it is essential for us, as regulators, to ensure that the authority is constituted so as to obviate any possible claim of bias against it.</P>
    <P>Senators Coghlan, O'Toole, Leyden, Maurice Hayes and McDowell referred to the requirement in section 43 of the Bill for companies to prepare a compliance statement and for auditors to endorse and confirm the validity of such a statement. The thrust of some of the interventions has been that this requirement is unduly harsh and punitive, especially with regard to smaller companies. On the other side, Senator O' Toole set out arguments in its support. I expect companies to be in a position of compliance with all of the various requirements on them in relation to all applicable legislation. The move from being in compliance to declaring such compliance appears to be a logical step. Furthermore, the process of verification by auditors of such compliance would not appear to be an inordinate burden. One does not have to carry out an audit to see if it is being complied with. We can go into detail on that when we take Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>To argue against such a requirement is to suggest that it is acceptable for companies not be compliant with their various legislative obligations or that somehow or another it is not appropriate for them to state that they are so compliant or that their auditor should equally not have to stand over such compliance. It does not seem to be unfair to ask companies to comply with their legal obligations to state that they are in compliance and that their auditor certifies that such is the case.</P>
    <P>It is not the purpose of the legislation to impose undue burdens on companies or professionals acting in the commercial sphere. However, if operators in the marketplace can demonstrate how compliance with this requirement will impose an inordinate cost or other burden upon them and make such a case to me, I will review those aspects of the provision which are considered to present difficulties.</P>
    <P>In response to Senator McDowell's question, I can clarify that the compliance statement relates to all statutory obligations of a company. The mechanism provided for in this section will work in practice and achieve what we expect from it.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn raised the issue of non-executive directors and the problems that this section <Col N="1165" />could introduce to the field of foreign direct investment. The committee is mandatory for public limited companies, but not for private companies that meet the thresholds of balance sheet value of &euro;25 million and turnover of &euro;15 million <i>per annum</i>. If those companies do not establish a committee, they have to explain why they have not done so. The compliance statement is not required to be signed by the non-executive directors, but by the directors as a whole.</P>
    <P>Senators Coghlan and Leyden asked that the thresholds for audit exemptions should be raised. I am mindful of the need to establish realistic thresholds and I assure the Senators that my Department is continually monitoring the thresholds for audit exemption. I have asked the relevant officials, in the context of the present legislation, to advise in relation to the current threshold and I expect this advice to be forthcoming in the near future. Senators will be mindful of the need for balance in relation to prudential considerations and impositions on small companies.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan suggested that some work being assigned might be more appropriately and cheaply done by another body such as the single regulatory authority. The decision to establish IAASA was based on the clear recommendation of the review group on auditing. Senator Leyden also supported this in his contribution. I am not convinced that any possible alternative body would possess the necessary expertise to discharge this work, as it is to be carried out by IAASA.</P>
    <P>Senators Coghlan and McDowell referred to the time taken to publish the Bill. I guarantee the Senators that considerable work has been going on since the report came into being in order to get it to the House today. As Senators will notice from the submissions that they are no doubt receiving from different bodies and individuals, it will be some time before it is finalised. Hopefully, that will be in the not too distant future. I reassure Senators that the officials have been working strenuously over the past few months and years to bring the Bill to this stage.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan raised the matter of the regulation of accountants and the use of the term &ldquo;accountant&rdquo; to describe individuals who are not qualified and do not come under this legislation. The audit review group considered the issues and was unable to agree on how the matter could be determined and how they could be regulated. However, the interim IAASA body is keeping the issue under review. I am sure the statutory IAASA, when it is established, will also consider the question of people using the term &ldquo;accountant&rdquo; in relation to financial matters and we will hopefully be able to come to a conclusion satisfactory to all concerned.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan also raised concerns about increased regulation. The company law review group has recommended simplification, and it will be a feature of the Bill to implement this recommendation. Our effort is to achieve balance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1166" />Senator McDowell raised the issue of auditor independence and was not sure that the Bill would achieve it. However, section 42 requires full disclosure. Also, the audit committee will oversee matters in companies required to establish them. It is worth mentioning that the EU recommendation addresses this issue. This Bill will improve the independent standing of auditors.</P>
    <P>Senator Maurice Hayes said that, based on what Senator O'Toole had to say, the Bill was a non-negotiable document. Senator O'Toole said the report of the review group on auditing, on which the Bill is based, was itself a compromise. He pointed out the dangers of fundamentally unpicking every line of it. I do not think he meant that no changes or amendments could be made to the Bill during its passage through each House.</P>
    <P>Senator White asked about the provision by auditors of services other than auditing. Section 42 will result in full disclosure of the fees for audit work, audit related work and non-audit work. I strongly support that provision. People will be able to see the position from the accounts. I thank Senator Leyden for his words of congratulations to all concerned in bringing forward this Bill. Senator White also said she supports the requirement that firms over a certain size should have to establish audit committees. The establishment of audit committees is in line with the recommendations of the review group on auditing. It is important to note that the thresholds set out in section 40 are such that only sizeable companies are comprehended by this requirement.</P>
    <P>Section 40(3) provides that the board of directors of private companies that exceed the stipulated thresholds can state in their report under section 158 of the principal Act that they have not established an audit committee and setting out the reason for their actions. The Act does not demand that audit committees be established in all cases involving private companies where it is relevant to do so. It allows latitude in a case where a company decides that it is not in a position to, or prepared to, establish such a committee but instead to explain its decision in this regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Kenneally asked how wrong-doing will be brought to the attention of the supervising authority. That could be done by clients, members of the public, the media or personal contacts from any source. I thank Senators Kenneally and MacSharry for their support for the Bill.</P>
    <P>I thank all Senators who contributed to this most useful and informative discussion. I hope I have clarified most, if not all, the questions raised. I have undertaken to reflect on a number of points raised, in particular those supported by written submission. Those matters will be revisited on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil. In accordance with Standing Order 103, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage. On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil. This is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad. The only matters, therefore, which may be discussed are the amendments made by the Dáil. For Senators' convenience, I have arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments. Senators may speak only once on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. J. Browne Mr. J. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. J. Browne)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are four amendments to present to the Seanad. On amendment No. 1, following the publication of the Bill, officials from my Department met with the IRFU and the FAI. Both organisations pointed out that section 4(1), as published, would make it possible for a qualifying broadcaster to apply to the High Court for access to a designated event right up to the day before the event takes place. They argued that this would severely restrict their ability to do a deal with a non-qualifying broadcaster where a qualifying broadcaster either decides not to apply to the High Court for access or decides not to pay the reasonable market rates set by the court.</P>
      <P>There are two issues involved. The first issue is that the event organiser, and not just the qualifying broadcaster, should be able to trigger the High Court route, so as to bring the matter to a head. The second issue is that the High Court should be given sufficient time to take a decision well before the event takes places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In light of these concerns and the contributions made on Committee Stage in Dáil Éireann, I propose, in amendment No. 1, to allow an event organiser to request the High Court to invite qualifying broadcasters to make an application under section 4(1)(<i>a</i>) to the court for access to a designated event; and to extend the period during which an event organiser or a qualifying broadcaster may apply to the High Court from 28 days to 56 days. These amendments would allow an event organiser to bring the matter to a head at the earliest possible time. If, having being invited by the court to do so, qualifying broadcasters <Col N="1168" />decide not to make an application under section 4(1), then an event organiser is free to sell television rights to a non-qualifying broadcaster.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 is a technical drafting amendment which does not change the effect of section 5, as published. I am advised by the Parliamentary Counsel that subsection (3) is not required as the matter dealt with is already provided for by section 48 of the Arbitration Act 1954.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 has the objective of increasing the flexibility available to the High Court or to an arbitrator when making a decision on terms and on reasonable market rates. Subsection (<i>f</i>) of section 6 provided that the court or arbitrator shall have regard to &ldquo;such other matters as may appear to be relevant to fixing reasonable market rates&rdquo;. The amendment provides that the court or arbitrator shall have regard to &ldquo;such other matters as may appear to be relevant&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 6 offers guidance to the court or arbitrator as to certain matters that must be considered when fixing terms or reasonable market rates. The list of criteria is deliberately limited and not overly prescriptive. The purpose of section (<i>f</i>) is to allow the court or arbitrator flexibility to take into account any matter it considers relevant. The amended provision increases the flexibility available to the court or to an arbitrator.</P>
    <P>I have taken the view that a statutory obligation on the Minister of the day to review the designation order from time to time would reassure all parties affected by the designation that any problems which may emerge after the initial designation can be addressed. Accordingly amendment No. 4 inserts a new section into the Bill which provides that the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources must undertake a review of the designation of events under section 2 of the 1999 Act and that the first review must be not later than three years after the passing of this Act, with subsequent reviews taking place not later than three years after the previous review. The Minister has stated that it is his intention to undertake the first review in two years' time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill was initiated in the Seanad, as you pointed out, a Chathaoirligh, and clearly the Minister has been listening to a number of points raised by the Opposition in the Dáil and, indeed, by ourselves. He obviously did not listen to all of them since they are not all reflected in the amendments, but I welcome the level of flexibility shown by the Minister and thank him for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only point I would make, and this is being very brief about it, has to do with amendment No. 4. I wonder about the setting of a review, and subsequent reviews, &ldquo;not later than three years&rdquo; after the passing of this Act. I suppose three years is not that long a period, but I would pose the following query which the Minister of State might clarify. The amendment states, &ldquo;the Minister <Col N="1169" />shall review, from time to time&rdquo;, and therefore I take it that the Minister is providing in legislation for a mandatory review. I seek clarification that there will be a mandatory review and the first will take place in two years' time.</P>

      <P>I, too, commend the Minister on the changes which have been made in the Dáil, which have improved the quality of the legislation. On amendment No. 1, it was nonsensical that the qualifying broadcaster could wait until the very last day to go to the court about a particular designated event. The Minister has extended the period during which they may apply to the court from 28 days to 56 days but, closer to the date, how far in advance of the event is the cut-off point when the qualifying broadcaster can go to court?</P>

There has been a long and detailed discussion, both here and in the Dáil on Committee Stage. As she rightly stated, the amendments reflect the views of the Opposition and of members of my party.

      <P>I thank the Minister of State and his officials for the work which has gone into this legislation. It is clearly a reflection of a changed world, not only in the European context of communications and broadcasting with which we largely deal but also, particularly in the era of digital and satellite broadcasting, probably in a global context. Until a short while ago, this kind of legislation would have been unheard of and we would not have imagined that it would ever be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must remain vigilant, not only in the context of these events but in the wider context of ensuring that our own identity is retained against <Col N="1170" />a climate of global pressures of communications and also against the continuing trend of consolidation of media ownership in large conglomerations of huge, powerful players who can be more powerful than Governments. In that regard, our membership of the European Union is critical. We have the power and the authority to ensure our culture is protected and when events such as this occur, we are able to act to make sure the trends do not go against us and that our communications companies are protected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to describe the extensive investment and reform programme which the Government has been promoting under the national cancer strategy, particularly since the launch of the health strategy in November 2001, and to set out the current position on cancer services nationally.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to the development of co-ordinated and patient-focused cancer treatment. The health strategy signifies the clear and high priority which my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, attaches to cancer and cancer care as part of the overall health system. The first national goal of Better Health for Everyone contains a number of critical objectives on cancer care and significant progress has already been made on many of them.</P>
      <P>An effective cancer care policy must be multi-faceted, broadly based and address the major influences which impact cancer incidence and mortality. The main elements of a cancer policy include health promotion, prevention, primary care and acute and palliative care services. All these services have benefited from investment and improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cancer is a major challenge to our health services. Approximately 21,000 new cases of cancer are recorded annually and one in three of our citi<Col N="1171" />zens will develop cancer in the course of their lifetime. Cancer is more common in older people and, as the population gets older, we can expect cancer cases to increase accordingly. The reduction since 1994 in cancer mortality rates is as a result of improved diagnosis, earlier interventions and improved and more widely available cancer treatments. It is expected that these trends will continue as a result of developments in cancer services and continued improvements in treatments.</P>
    <P>Since the implementation of the national cancer strategy, a cumulative figure of &euro;400 million has been invested in the development of cancer services. This level of investment is many times the increase of £25 million initially envisaged in 1996 to implement the national cancer strategy. The national cancer strategy acknowledges that the cause of most cancers is multifactorial, but that there is strong evidence that lifestyle factors, in particular smoking, alcohol and diet, play an important role. The promotion of healthy lifestyles is a key element of the work of the Department's health promotion unit and spending by the unit since the launch of the national cancer strategy on these topics is in excess of &euro;17 million.</P>
    <P>Under the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002, the Minister established the Office of Tobacco Control on a statutory basis. This indicates a commitment to a range of anti-smoking measures. In this regard, a ban on smoking in all workplaces from 1 January 2004 was announced. This ban will include the hospitality industry, where many workers are exposed to passive smoking.</P>
    <P>For all health behaviours, there is a shortage of national data representative of the various social sub-groups in the Irish population. To combat this, the health promotion unit commissioned the national surveys of lifestyle, attitudes and nutrition, SLÁN. The first SLÁN survey was commissioned in 1998 to provide baseline information on a range of lifestyle-related health behaviours in the Irish adult population, with sufficient power to detect differences across age, gender and social strata.</P>
    <P>In 2002, the health promotion unit re-commissioned the next phase of the national health and lifestyle surveys, with a larger population sample, which my colleague the Minister for Health and Children is currently launching. Some positive trends are emerging from this second survey. The top-line indications show that, across almost all demographic categories, smoking rates have fallen, but this trend has been most marked among girls and young women, a key target for our recent anti-smoking initiatives and an area of concern to us. The overall rate of smoking in schoolgoing children has fallen. While overall exposure to tobacco smoke is down, the rates of exposure at work and in licensed premises and clubs remain high.</P>
    <P>Alcohol once again proved to be a problem, despite an increase in the number of school children reporting they had never consumed an <Col N="1172" />alcoholic drink. One of the most positive findings in the second survey was the increase in adherence to the recommended consumption levels of fruit and vegetables in all social groups and in men, in particular.</P>
    <P>There is increasing recognition internationally of the importance of primary care in the delivery of cancer care. The primary care strategy will provide us with the capacity to ensure that people can experience a well co-ordinated and integrated package of services appropriate to their needs in their own communities and in their homes. It will broaden focus of services to include health promotion, prevention and supportive care for those who have recovered from cancer, are living with cancer or are dying from cancer.</P>
    <P>Investment to date under the national cancer strategy has enabled the funding of 80 additional consultant posts with support staff in key areas such as medical oncology, radiology, palliative care, histopathology and haematology. The benefit of this investment is reflected in the significant increase in activity which has occurred. For example, the number of new patients per annum receiving radiotherapy treatment increased from 2,402 in 1994 to 3,809 in 2000. This means that an additional 1,407 patients were accessing these services, representing an increase of 58% nationally. The number of new patients per annum receiving chemotherapy treatment increased from 2,693 in 1994 to 3,519 in 2000, representing an increase of 30% nationally.</P>
    <P>Breast cancer is the individual site-specific cancer which has received the most investment in recent years. Since the implementation of the national cancer strategy approval has been granted for an additional 39 consultant posts with a special interest in breast disease across the modalities of surgery, radiology and histopathology. Since 2001 there has been a cumulative investment of &euro;30 million in the development of symptomatic breast disease services. The benefit of this investment is reflected in the significant increase in activity which has occurred, with in-patient breast cancer procedures increasing from 1,336 in 1997 to 1,839 in 2001, an increase of 37% nationally.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, announced the national extension of BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, on 27 March last. BreastCheck provides breast screening services for women in the 50 to 64 year age group in the Eastern Regional Health Authority, North-Eastern Health Board and Midland Health Board areas. This programme is proving extremely successful in identifying breast cancer among women in this age group and also provides for the necessary surgical care of women who require breast surgery. To the end of December last year, 110,636 eligible women had been called for screening and 83,000 had been screened, representing an uptake rate of 75%.</P>
    <P>The BreastCheck clinical unit in the western area will be located at University College <Col N="1173" />Hospital, Galway, with two associated mobile units. The area of coverage will be counties Galway, Sligo, Roscommon, Donegal, Mayo, Leitrim, Clare and north Tipperary. The BreastCheck clinical unit in the southern area will be located at South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital, with three associated mobile units. Counties covered include Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Waterford and south Tipperary.</P>
    <P>Under the extension, approximately 130,000 women in the target population of 50 to 64 years of age will be eligible for screening. The programme expects to diagnose approximately 400 cancers per annum among this population. Under the business plan submitted by BreastCheck to the Department, the national expansion of the programme to the west and south has been costed at &euro;27 million, including &euro;13 million in capital costs. Discussions are ongoing involving officials at the Department, BreastCheck and relevant health agencies in relation to the detailed implementation of the programme.</P>
    <P>In relation to the development of services for women with cancer, the commitment of the Government is further evidenced by the introduction of the cervical screening programme. Cervical screening is a valuable preventive health measure when delivered as an organised screening programme. To meet the additional demand for cervical cytology laboratory services, additional resources of &euro;2.5 million were made available in 2002 and a further &euro;1.4 million is being made available in 2003 to develop both the laboratory and colposcopy services.</P>
    <P>An expert review group on radiotherapy services was established by the Minister to ensure we effectively plan the current and future development of this key element of cancer care. The current debate on radiotherapy services is very narrowly based and confined to geographic location without any real discussion of the principles that should underpin the national provision of services. International evidence is that radiotherapy is a service that can best be provided in a limited number of centres. It is certain that the future demands to provide a comprehensive service that is quality and equity driven will be extremely expensive. The objective will be to develop proposals on foot of the report that will provide us with a model of radiotherapy services that is patient centred, attracts and retains the best medical and scientific expertise, and ensures comprehensive radiotherapy treatments in a timely and quality manner.</P>
    <P>I wish to advise the House of a number of developments in radiotherapy. In recent years significant investment in new radiotherapy services has taken place in Dublin, Cork and Galway. Some &euro;25 million has been invested in the renovation and upgrading of St. Luke's Hospital, ensuring it continues to meet the demands placed upon it as a world class centre for the delivery of radiotherapy. Almost &euro;9 million has been invested in phase one of a substantial new building project development at Cork University <Col N="1174" />Hospital for radiation oncology services, which was completed in 2002. A new radiotherapy department is under construction at University College Hospital, Galway. This development is part of the phase two project at the hospital. In excess of &euro;100 million has been allocated to this project which is due for completion this autumn.</P>
    <P>The report of the national advisory committee on palliative care was approved by the Government in the summer of 2001 and launched in October of that year. The report describes a comprehensive palliative care service and acts as a blueprint for its development. The Government has agreed to the implementation of its recommendations over a five to seven year period. The implementation of the report will be undertaken as part of the implementation of the national health strategy. Since September 2001 almost &euro;11 million has been allocated to the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to begin implementing the report's recommendations.</P>
    <P>In February this year the first all-Ireland cancer network was launched under the auspices of the Ireland-Northern Ireland-National Cancer Institute cancer consortium. Its principal role will be to initiate and co-ordinate clinical trials in cancer hospitals in both parts of the island. The Department has demonstrated its support by investing significant resources in this trilateral programme. Under this scheme, awards to the value of &euro;3.5 million have been made available to allow hospitals to recruit and train staff, improve facilities and take part in world class clinical trials. I express my gratitude to the United States' National Cancer Institute for this tremendously innovate research development and the interest it has taken in this jurisdiction as part of the peace process.</P>
    <P>International evidence is that better clinical outcomes are achieved in hospitals with specialist staff, high volumes of activity and access to appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic facilities. I cannot stress that international evidence enough, in either this House or the Lower House. Best results in treatment are achieved where patients are treated by staff working as part of an integrated, multidisciplinary specialist team. This core principle must inform the current organisation of services and how we plan future services across the various modalities of cancer care.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the work of the national cancer forum, a multidisciplinary group of experts appointed to advise on cancer services, including hospital services. The forum has advised the Minister that the current organisation of these services is not in line with international best practice. This is a very important message, one that every Member of the Oireachtas should transmit, although I have no doubt that many will refuse to do so. The forum will be reflecting further on this issue as it prepares the next cancer strategy, which the Minister expects to receive later this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1175" />International evidence is that technically challenging surgery, for example, can best be supported if it is concentrated in a relatively small number of centres. This is a message that is evidenced based and needs to be directed and pursued at a number of levels in our society. It must be understood that having a service is no longer sufficient; it must be a service organised in such a way that it is capable of delivering quality in line with international standards and practice. We must face the reality that we cannot continue to expect to be able to deliver the highest quality of cancer services across over 30 acute hospitals. Perhaps I am being somewhat cruel on the Seanad in saying so because it is in the Lower House that this particular issue comes to the fore even more.</P>
    <P>As regards our achievements in improving cancer care, I have presented information to the House in terms of increased manpower and activity. This is an important measure of improvements in cancer care but we also need to develop further our understanding of the process of care. The ultimate objective in terms of the delivery of cancer care is that those in receipt of services experience outcomes on a par with best international standards.</P>
    <P>Health information is fundamental to assessing and implementing quality programmes. The national health strategy has provided for the establishment of an independent health information and quality authority to lead the development of health information to support these requirements. The authority will exercise a pivotal role in relation to a number of key information functions. It is only through focusing on specific information developments such as this, to build on the excellent work of the National Cancer Registry, that we will be able to demonstrate continuously the positive impact that cancer services can have, and also identify the areas which may need to be addressed to strengthen further our cancer care system.</P>
    <P>We are very fortunate that those involved in cancer care provide a professional and high standard of care that is appreciated by those with cancer and their families. I recognise their dedication and commitment. It is hoped the substantial investment is reflected in an improvement in health outcomes for cancer patients.</P>
    <P>The developments I have outlined describe an overall framework through which cancer services can be developed and provided in the most co-ordinated and effective manner. I am glad to have the opportunity to outline the substantial developments that have taken place in cancer services, to which the Government has demonstrated a consistent positive commitment. In recognising that a lot has been achieved I fully accept that more must be done. Cancer care is too important for us not to do so.</P>

      <P>We will not be too hard on the Minister of State whose contribution I welcome. I also welcomed the announcement of a ban on smoking in all workplaces from 1 January next. The majority do not recognise the health problems smoking has caused here and elsewhere during the years. Passive smoking must be attacked at all times. It is welcome that people will not be permitted to smoke in pubs, restaurants and workplaces in the future.</P>
      <P>When I had a pub, I worked behind the counter and very much enjoyed working there. It was an old-fashioned pub, a little like Doheny and Nesbitt's, only on a smaller scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney" hpid="Ms Feeney Ms Feeney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan" hpid="Mr. Feighan Mr. Feighan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I was never a smoker, I found my health deteriorating, which was one of the reasons I left the pub. After five years working there I knew that it was not the work that would kill me but the people who smoked. One could not tell people at the time that they could not smoke in a pub because we were told that it was part of the atmosphere and ambience. Therefore, I welcome the Government's attack on smoking in public places, bars and restaurants. One would not have the nerve to tell a customer to stop smoking. I genuinely believe that because I finished working in the pub at that time and I am no longer a passive smoker in such an environment I am much healthier.</P>
      <P>Young girls are a key target of anti-smoking initiatives. Such initiatives which target young people must continue because it is considered modern for young people to smoke. I attended a conference recently and it is worth noting that since its introduction several hundred years ago more people have died from tobacco related illnesses, which include cancer, than in the Second World War. That was a stark message, which indicated that smoking and its effects had to be targeted.</P>
      <P>Cancer is one of the most emotive issues. There are few people who have not been touched by the effects of the disease within their own or extended families. I want to deal with the issue in a sensitive and compassionate way. Hard questions must be asked of those whose responsibility it is to deal with and provide resources for best practice in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lack of radiotherapists. We are told to expect even higher rates of cancer in the years ahead with our ageing population and lifestyles which contribute to the disease. Even now we cannot claim to be taking adequate care of those who need the necessary supports. Every week more than 300 families are affected by a cancer diagnosis. Unfortunately, one in three will be diagnosed with cancer while one in four will die <Col N="1177" />from it. Many of those diagnosed with cancer are unable to receive radiotherapy while those who can have to wait long periods &ndash; twice as long as recommended because of the shortage of radiotherapists. I undertook a study and found that only eight radiotherapy oncologists worked in the State compared to 12 in Belfast alone. That is the latest figure, which is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>There was a problem in regard to the BreastCheck screening programme which the Government failed to extend effectively. This vital service was only available in three health board areas. I welcome the fact that it has now been extended. However, it must be provided throughout the country as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>A new breast cancer diagnosis is made every five hours. According to the Irish Cancer Society, research indicates that Irish women have a one in 13 chance of developing the disease and a 10% lower survival rate than women in the United States. Screening can detect cancer 18 months before a lump appears. Therefore, the need to extend the screening programme is imperative. I hope the 13 breast units recommended in report of the national cancer forum will be implemented. I pay tribute to Deputy Cowley and all those who marched to secure this service. The death rate from breast cancer could be halved with better treatment.</P>
    <P>An international cancer conference in Dublin was told by Professor John Reynolds, consultant surgeon at St. James's Hospital and professor of surgery at Trinity College, that gaps in the provision of radiotherapy were affecting individual patient outcomes. The position could be put much harsher. We were promised the report of an expert review group on radiography services in February 2002 and again in March 2003 but it has yet to be published. I would like it to be published as soon as possible. Professor Reynolds spoke of the need for more structured cancer clinics involving a multidisciplinary approach. With modern developments in communications between hospitals there are possibilities for co-ordinating their strengths.</P>
    <P>One of the areas requiring urgent development is that of supportive care for cancer patients with improved co-ordination between health services. Great work is being done by the voluntary sector. I pay tribute to the hospice and the various agencies and voluntary organisations which put so much time, funding and expertise into helping cancer patients. In my area Mayo-Roscommon Hospice and North West Hospice have always been to the forefront. I know that their views are taken on board. This is a time to acknowledge the work they do.</P>
    <P>Only last month it was suggested that the benefit of cancer treatment was being outweighed by the arduous journeys patients had to make to obtain it. It is an emotional time for patients and their having to travel a long distance to gain access to treatment does not help. A cancer specialist, Dr. Ian Fraser, talked of the huge commitments being made by patients to gain treat<Col N="1178" />ment. I am aware that one woman was away from her family for 500 hours. Dr. Fraser estimated that &euro;36 million was spent by the South Eastern Health Board over ten years bringing patients to Dublin for treatment. This is unacceptable and cannot be best practice; it must be reviewed. These patients are removed from their families at a very difficult time when they most need support. Patients and their families must find somewhere to stay in Dublin, which causes great hardship. Dr. Fraser also expressed his dismay at the long-promised report into cancer and radiography services provision.</P>
    <P>I complimented Deputy Cowley, who marched in Dublin to highlight these issues last month. Those who took part in that march are, like us, seeking a realistic budget for cancer care. However, the influence of the Minister for Finance is the problem. He has decided that finance comes before people's health. The Minister for Health and Children should be fighting more forcefully for extra funding. It is all very well to say that additional funds are not being provided because they are not being spent on the right resources, but the Minister for Health and Children should be fighting for extra funds for all parts of the health service, including cancer treatment services.</P>
    <P>The ridiculous situation of Mr. Earley of the Mater Hospital and the Children's Hospital, Temple Street, was reported in yesterday's <i>Irish Independent</i>. Mr. Earley stated that he is available to perform surgery but that, due to cutbacks, his list of surgical appointments has been cancelled. He also stated that he is being asked to perform operations in the private sector under the Government treatment purchase fund. Comments were also made by the Beaumont Hospital accident and emergency consultant, Mr. Aidan Gleeson, on the implications of the possible closure of 115 beds in the Mater Hospital, at which between 20 to 30 patients are already on trolleys. In addition, there is a strike by public health doctors, who perform a crucial role in monitoring the spread of communicable diseases. With the ever-present danger of SARS on the horizon, all is not well in the health system.</P>
    <P>If we are reducing the funding provided, how can we improve services in this vital area? I was informed confidentially that the budget for St. Luke's Hospital has been cut by &euro;1 million this year. The hospital has coped to date with increased pressure on its services through extensive use of overtime and after-hours treatment. According to its annual report, however, the cutbacks mean that this cannot continue, although St. Luke's is seeking funds to install four radiotherapy treatment machines.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the report will recommend that radiotherapy facilities be located in Dublin, Cork and Galway only. A major issue being highlighted is the concentration of treatment in areas of excellence &ndash; a matter to which I have already referred &ndash; but it is an enormous burden, in terms of the trauma and effort involved, on those who <Col N="1179" />have to travel long distances for short but life-sustaining treatment. What one would expect as a right in a so-called advanced society is hardly just for those who are vulnerable.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said cancer services are a public health priority and that he would strive to ensure that those with cancer would get high quality, effective and evidence-based care. While he may point to the investment made in recent years and to the fact that the level of this investment has been sustained, it is fair to say that there is much to do to bring our health services up to a reasonable standard and to have proper, equitable cancer services.</P>
    <P>The national cancer strategy 2003 is being developed by the national cancer forum in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children. On television last Monday night, comparisons were made between the number of neurologists in Ireland and the numbers in other countries. The results of these comparisons showed us to be in an unbelievably poor position. Why should Ireland lag so far behind? That contributes to the waiting lists and the incredibly lengthy periods patients must wait before seeing specialists. It was suggested that the waiting list for a neurologist is two years. If someone wishes to see a specialist, the situation is serious in the first instance and we hardly need to comment on the possibilities.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister of State well. This is a delicate area and I will give him any support I can to get to the bottom of this emotive issue. There are many problems in the health service, particularly in the area of cancer care. I compliment the Government on introducing a ban on smoking in public places. We need zero tolerance in this respect because tobacco has been a major health problem. We must do everything we can to ensure that young people, particularly young girls, do not find it as attractive to smoke as they once did and if we can do so this initiative will have succeeded.</P>
    <P>I no longer work in the pub to which I referred earlier and I walk everywhere in my free time. I am not smoking and I feel a lot better. I hope we can impart our knowledge to those who are smoking.</P>

      <P>Few conditions generate as much emotive debate as cancer, which impacts in an adverse way on every aspect of society. We have had the extension of BreastCheck, which is very important because it involves a very important section of our community, namely, women. I know far too many women &ndash; and men &ndash; who have gone to their eternal reward at a young age. Great trauma, distress and suffering is caused when a mother is taken, not just to her offspring but also to her spouse and extended family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we discuss cancer, we immediately think of men's health &ndash; an area which should be <Col N="1180" />focused on. Despite discussing the matter with members of the medical profession, I do not know the reasons for the increased incidence of prostate cancer, whether it is an increase, <i>per se</i>, or the result of better diagnostic procedures. Questions are being asked about the PSA test.</P>
    <P>The BreastCheck programme was recently extended and rightly so. It has been established that when cancer is detected in its primary stages there is a real chance to do something about it.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister, Deputy Micheál Martin, in a total ban on smoking. That is the minimum any of us who have a sense of responsibility can do. Of course, we are told <i>ad nauseam</i> that people have a right to smoke, and that is true. However, not everyone else around them wants to smoke. With rights go obligations, and those who wish to smoke have a responsibility to those who do not.</P>
    <P>There is statistical evidence available, as has been pointed out by Senator Feighan, to prove that environmental tobacco smoke has a very adverse effect on those who work in public houses. In the earlier part of my career I also spent a few years behind a bar, and, although I was a smoker at the time, on the morning after the night before &ndash; I was not a drinker then &ndash; I would feel the effects of working in a smoky environment. What is to be done? We strongly support what the Minister is advocating. To do anything less is like having a death wish, and I harbour no such feelings. I am sure that most Senators share that view.</P>
    <P>Another area where our society has encountered great difficulty is among those working in the psychiatric services. People will say that Senator Glynn is on his old hobbyhorse again, being a former psychiatric nurse. As everyone who knows anything at all about psychiatry is aware, psychiatric patients have a long-established habit of tobacco use, or, as I should perhaps say, tobacco abuse, depending on how one views it. I must regretfully admit that far too many of my former colleagues went to their eternal reward at far too young an age. Many of the patients did so too.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Opposition has a job to do. However, even the Opposition will have to acknowledge the great achievements that have been made. I would be the first to admit that we still have a long way to go. Perhaps that is one of the curses of being human. However, as far as can be achieved, the resources that have been put into improving cancer care, as must be acknowledged by all sides, have been extremely significant. In the past, the chances of surviving cancer were low and showed very little improvement from year to year. In recent decades, however, there have been some very important changes.</P>
    <P>In childhood leukaemia, there has been a dramatic improvement in survival rates. Similar improvements have occurred with Hodgkins' disease, testicular cancer and melanoma. In many other cancers, improvements, though less dramatic, have nonetheless taken place. Now there <Col N="1181" />is real hope &ndash; and, according to the saying, it springs eternal &ndash; for patients and families.</P>
    <P>The Government is determined to ensure access to the services which have delivered this optimism for every person diagnosed with cancer. Effectively tackling the problem of cancer means achieving consistently high-quality specialist services for patients, their carers and their families. Everyone who knows anything at all about the treatment of cancer is aware that, just as with alcoholism, it is not merely the sufferer who is affected but the whole family. We must therefore be cognisant of the huge trauma in families where there is a cancer sufferer or sufferers. We must not merely talk about the treatment of the person unfortunate enough to have cancer. We must also consider the immediate and extended family.</P>
    <P>The key goal of the 1996 national cancer strategy was to achieve a 50% decrease in cancer mortality in the under-65 age group in the ten-year period from 1994. That figure was achieved in 2001, three years ahead of target. At this stage &ndash; and I do not wish to be or sound flippant &ndash; much has been done, but we have a great deal more to do. Anyone who thinks differently is simply not in contact with the real world. We fully recognise the huge amount of work to be done.</P>
    <P>The extension of the BreastCheck programme has been an extremely welcome development, as have the numbers diagnosed at an early stage. As has been pointed out &ndash; I repeat it only to underline it &ndash; where cancer is diagnosed early, especially at the primary stage, there is a real chance that something can be done about it. Those are not just my words, for it is an established fact.</P>
    <P>The report of the subgroup of the National Cancer Forum on the development of services for symptomatic breast disease, known, of course, as the O'Higgins report, was published in March 2000 and contains recommendations for the establishment of a network of specialist breast units throughout the country. I am a member of the Midland Health Board, which I have the honour of chairing. It must be brought home to people that one cannot have a centre of excellence for cancer services in every county. That is the reality, and we must grow up about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator listened, she might learn something. The 1996 report acknowledged that cervical screening is a worthwhile preventative health measure when delivered as an organised screening programme. Following the report's recommendations, phase one of the national cervical screening programme commenced in the Mid-Western Health Board in October 2000. A key concern regarding the development of phase one is ensuring a service underpinned by quality assurance and best practice. Under the programme, around 67,000 women in the 25-60 age group will be screened at five-yearly intervals free of charge. Around &euro;3.9 million is allocated the board to cover the annual running costs of phase one.</P>
      <P>The extension of planning and organising a national programme underpinned by quality assurance is a major undertaking with significant logistical and resource implications that requires very careful planning. The experience gained from phase one of the national programme should be of assistance in the context of implementing the commitment. As part of an examination of the feasibility and implementation of rolling out the national programme, the chief executive officers of the health boards are making arrangements to have an external review of phase one carried out during 2003.</P>
      <P>Palliative care has rightly been mentioned. Following a Government commitment to develop a national palliative care plan, the then Minister for Health and Children established the national advisory committee on palliative care in summer 1999 with a view to preparing a report on the development of palliative care services in Ireland. The report of the national advisory committee on palliative care was approved by the Government in summer 2001 and launched by the Minister, Deputy Micheál Martin, on 4 October of that year. The report describes a comprehensive palliative care service and acts as a blueprint for its development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to radiotherapy services. We do not have a sufficient radiotherapy capacity to meet existing and future demands. The provision of radiotherapy requires significant medical, scientific and support expertise and <Col N="1183" />resources, in addition to extensive capital investment. The Minister for Health and Children established an expert review group on radiotherapy services to ensure that we effectively plan the current and future development in this key area of cancer care. I look forward to the publication of this report, which I am sure will address the competing demands of quality and geographical location.</P>
    <P>When we discuss the question of geographical services, we must consider it not only from the point of view of the State but also from that of the island as a whole. The Ireland-Northern Ireland NCI cancer consortium is a trilateral partnership involving the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland and the National Cancer Institute of the US Department of Health and Human Sciences. It was conceptualised by cancer physicians in Ireland, Northern Ireland and the United States who took their idea of a collaborative partnership to their respective Governments. The consortium was established in October 1999 on foot of a memorandum of understanding signed by the then Health Ministers of Ireland and Northern Ireland and the Secretary of State for the US Department of Health and Human Sciences. It seeks to bring together in a collaborative way the cancer treatment communities in all three jurisdictions with a view to enhancing the capacity of our cancer research and service delivery systems.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been said about cutbacks. Any health delivery service that does not examine its operations on a ongoing basis, challenge its own decisions and ensure that value for money is obtained in the delivery of services, is not in touch with reality. Ireland is a small country and far too many of our citizens, young and old, are dying form the scourge of cancer. The application of resources must, therefore, be done in an organised and concerted manner to ensure that the optimal benefit accrues to those who suffer from cancer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. This is an important issue because cancer and cardiovascular disease are the most common cause of death in the country. I am indebted to the National Cancer Registry which published, in March, the Cancer in Ireland Report 1994 to 1998. I commend all those who compiled it because it is a comprehensive and useful document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statistics contained in the report are, at times, cheering, but they are also a matter of concern. They point out that the survival rates, at five years, for non-melanoma skin cancer and even melanoma are quite high. In the case of non-melanoma cancers, every case should be cured and, mercifully, that appears to be the case. The good thing is that the lesion can be detected on the skin and the patient can bring it to the attention of their doctor at an early stage. Melanomas <Col N="1184" />cause more of a problem, because they can spread rapidly early on. I was interested to see that in five years the survival rate in women was 85%, while that in men was 68%.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of the report that I would like a sociologist to examine. Was that difference in the survival rate due to the fact that men with skin lesions waited longer than women to have them seen to? Do we need to educate men about the essential fact of seeing a doctor as soon as they detect a skin lesion, particularly in view of the fact so many of these cases occur in people working out-of-doors and in the west? As we know, sunlight is a major contributor towards non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancer. We must consider the areas of the report to which I refer and examine whether further education is needed.</P>
    <P>Lung cancer is one of the worst scourges. I support the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, in his desire to completely ban smoking in pubs and restaurants because of the awful risks to members of the public. On the Order of Business this morning, Senator Michael McCarthy raised the issue of a man who was stabbed to death in a New York pub because he objected to the fact that another inhabitant of the pub was smoking. The risk that Senator McCarthy, if he is a smoker, might die of lung cancer is far greater than that of his being stabbed to death in a pub &ndash; bad and all though the behaviour of people may be in such establishments, even those in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the incidence of lung cancer among young women is decreasing to any great extent. This is an area that we need to tackle. A recent article in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> stated that smoking is worse than sunlight in terms of the skin-ageing process. One can always identify heavy smokers, even if they gave up the habit many years before, when they come to visit one. It is known that the collagen within the skin thins dramatically in people who are smokers. We must emphasise this fact in the case of young women. When they are 18 years of age, they never think they will reach 50 years of age and that they will not want to look like a saddlebag for a camel when they do so.</P>
    <P>It is on areas such as this that we need to focus in order to try to encourage people to stop smoking. We could be facing a situation where there will be an epidemic of lung cancer in women in their 40s and 50s. I also read an article which stated that in Tower Hamlets in London, for the first time ever a year or two ago, lung cancer beat breast cancer as the most common form of cancer in women. This is the first health board area in England where this has happened. I do not think it has happened in Ireland. Everything we can do about cancer and its prevention must be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children should be applauded in his efforts to prohibit smoking. In Canada, where the prohibition on public smoking is in vogue in almost all the cities I visited, people had a good time in the pubs without <Col N="1185" />smoking. They informed me that the bar trade had initially cut down slightly, but that the table trade, where people were eating, had gone up and this made up for it. I did not meet one member of staff in either Ottawa or Halifax who was not glad that the ban had been introduced. I hope the Minister for Health and Children persists with his intentions in respect of this area.</P>
    <P>There are very good details given in the report about the influence of sex, age and stage of diagnosis on the likely outcome. Women appear to do better than men, in most instances, regarding survival rates. I am concerned about the situation regarding men with symptoms who may be less likely than women to go to doctors at an early stage. General practitioners will state that men are inclined to let things go that bit further than women before making a visit to the doctor. Bladder cancer is an exception. I do not know if women would not notice blood in the urine, which is the main sign of cancer, or do they put up with cystitis more readily than men might. All these issues need more investigation to ensure that people go early to their doctor.</P>
    <P>People who are younger are likely to do better than older people in cancer treatments. We must take into account that older people may die from other conditions in the five year survival period. From the report, it appears that older people were not necessarily as aggressively treated with specific anti-cancer therapy as younger people. A 70 year old woman with breast cancer is as entitled to radiotherapy or chemotherapy as is a 50 year old woman. I realise that in cases where particular cancers have spread, people may decide that the treatment is too dreadful. A friend of mine who was undergoing chemotherapy recently, told me she could only describe it as horrific. It is not like that for every patient. However, everyone is entitled to decide what treatment they will undergo. Older people may, perhaps, be less likely to agree to aggressive treatment, but they must be offered it and we must ensure that ageism is not practised in respect of cancer treatment.</P>
    <P>There is unfortunately a distinct problem regarding geographic spread as to where one is likely to receive treatment. In the west, for example, while people with breast cancer are undergoing more radical surgery, they are not receiving radiotherapy when it might be extremely important for the condition. That is a problem of distance from a radiotherapy unit. While we cannot have a radiotherapy unit at every corner, we need to have a better spread.</P>
    <P>Stage of diagnosis was one of the most important points made in the report, with particular reference to the five year survival rate of those who had progressed to stage 4, where the cancer had spread to distant organs, for example, bone, the brain, liver or lung. Their survival rate was much lower than those diagnosed when the initial cancer was at a very early stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1186" />The type of cancer is important because cancer of the ovary unfortunately is inclined to be diagnosed quite late because people do not have symptoms until quite late and sometimes the symptoms are rather obscure. For example, I have frequently known cancer of the ovary to present as a deep vein thrombosis in the leg. While it accounts for only 3% of cancers in women, it accounts for 6% of deaths within five years.</P>
    <P>We also know that there is a genetic basis in the case of both breast and ovarian cancer. It is not that common but we do have to try to pick out those groups most at risk of breast or bone cancer and the families in which they occur are entitled to screening. I have spoken several times in this House about the fact that the national centre for medical genetics in Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin, which screens for breast cancer is squeezed for money. I do not know if it has run out of money but it undertook a pilot project which was incredibly successful following which it received another &euro;80,000 to continue for a little longer and the last I heard was that it was going to have to let three of its technical staff go. If that happens, it means it simply will not be able to screen the blood samples taken from patients like this, which is really very bad, particularly in view of the fact that we now also know that the cancers which have a genetic predisposition require different treatment from those which do not and we certainly want patients to have the optimal treatment. Ovarian cancer presents a big problem regarding late diagnosis, as does cancer of the pancreas when, once again, late diagnosis leads to a much higher mortality rate. For example, in both men and women cancer of the pancreas accounts for only 2% of cancers but 5% of deaths.</P>
    <P>Let me move on to breast screening. It is extraordinarily important that we provide for screening all over the country. I know the Minister for Health and Children has promised this but what does that mean? He has no money. It is the Minister for Finance who has to promise that there will be breast screening.</P>
    <P>Senator Glynn talked about a prostate specific antigen and screening for prostate cancer which, combined with a clinical examination, does appear to be worthwhile. I must praise those involved within the construction industry who initiated a free screening programme for their members. This was useful, even in trying to get men to take a better interest in their own health. Such screening programmes are costly and have to be shown to be cost effective. I do not know if the incidence of prostate cancer or breast cancer is greater but, again, we have to look at environmental factors because both cancers occur in fatty tissue and there are constant worries about pesticides, herbicides and so on. In a country such as this we really must have ongoing research in these areas.</P>
    <P>We cannot rely on the research of others. Why is breast cancer more common in the Po Valley <Col N="1187" />than in the south of Italy, say in Sicily? There is a big difference in diet. In the Po Valley it is mainly dairy based whereas in Sicily it is based on olive oil. Could this have to do, for example, with the spreading over decades of various organophosphates, organochlorides and so on, which are taken up through the grass, eaten by cows and then consumed by us? We have got to be involved in research in these areas.</P>
    <P>In another way delay in diagnosis is a problem which we and, particularly, the Minister of State and his Department have to address. There is a terrible delay in general practitioners getting appointments in hospitals with specialists in various disciplines. This is a very serious problem. Some hospitals, however, have managed to give priority slots, for example, in the case of symptomatic breast cancer. I think six Dublin hospitals now do this whereby every Thursday one has exactly what one would want. Patients are referred, seen during the preceding days and get immediate appointments. There are ten slots available. General practitioners are only to refer symptomatic cases and I gather are very good about doing this. The team meets on the Thursday and looks at mammograms, X-rays, blood test results, clinical reports and so forth. The surgeon, oncologist, radiotherapist and so forth then decide the best line of treatment for the person concerned. This is what we want. All round the country this will have to be tackled.</P>
    <P>I know there are problems with the medical profession. I looked at the findings of another survey recently which indicated that some doctors were undertaking serious cancer surgery in only ten cases a year, a huge proportion which, perhaps 60%, involved breast and colono-rectal cancers, another very important problem. There are also problems, however, with local politicians who say women in their area should not have to travel that but if they have to travel 20 miles down the road to receive better treatment, surely to heavens they must be persuaded to do so. We cannot have the Taoiseach going to Castlebar and announcing that all will be well there, that they will get their own unit if there are not enough cases being dealt with. This is a very important matter.</P>
    <P>When one hears of elective surgery being put off, as happens every day in our hospitals, frequently they are cancer cases. There are further delays due to problems with acute beds being blocked. Something has to be done about freeing these beds in order that patients will not be contacted by telephone in the morning and told their operations for breast cancer, stomach cancer, colono-rectal cancer are off because every day matters. It is totally unfair on them that this is happening. This is the area where we, as legislators, are important and have to ensure there are no delays. We have to educate patients to go rapidly to their general practitioners and the centre of excellent primary health care in general. First, however, we have to ensure they will get a rapid <Col N="1188" />appointment with a suitable specialist and, when an operation is considered essential, will be brought into hospital without further delay and will receive the cancer specific treatment they need as rapidly as possible. I frequently meet people who have had either radiotherapy or chemotherapy put off for weeks because there was no bed available for them in the hospital.</P>

      <P>I, too, welcome the Minister of State back to the House. I am touched at the nice tone of the debate today, which represents how we all feel about cancer and the treatment services provided for it. It is only right that we should all be singing from the one hymn sheet and it would we wonderful if we could focus our minds on the best possible results for patients suffering from the dreadful scourge of cancer.</P>
      <P>I commend Members on the Opposition benches, people like Senator O'Meara and others who have chased the Minister for Health and Children, as we have. I like to think that we all do that for one simple reason, to get the best possible outcome. It saddens me when it becomes a political football, but I am glad that most Members contributing today are not using it as such, and that we all seem to be coming from the one side.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Feighan that cancer is a very emotive issue. It is a horrible, aggressive illness that affects all our lives and the lives of our families. I commend Senator Feighan on the excellent presentation he made in this House today at a difficult time for him personally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, has seen fit to extend the BreastCheck programme to the entire country. I am especially delighted that many areas in <Col N="1189" />the west like Galway, Sligo, Roscommon, Donegal, Mayo and Leitrim are to have the facility of a mobile unit where screening can be carried out. I support Senator Henry when she talks about the unique nature of generic cancers and how there should be special accommodation made for people who find themselves in that position.</P>
    <P>It is about six weeks since we had a debate on breast cancer, and I covered quite a lot in that debate. I will not reiterate that debate or what my colleague, Senator Glynn, has said. I will talk about the services available from the North-Western Health Board in my constituency and in particular what is available in Sligo town.</P>
    <P>A year ago my constituency was fortunate enough to secure the appointment of a medical oncologist, Dr. Paul Donnellan, and the lives of hundreds of men, women and children in the area served by the North-Western Health Board have changed dramatically. It is a huge development in the delivery of cancer care, a huge improvement over the situation 18 or 24 months ago, and a fine service. The Minister of State spoke today about the focus on patient-centred treatment. The unit we have in Sligo is small but very effective. I say small because I know that in the near future more beds will be sought.</P>
    <P>The North-Western Health Board region has the services of two oncologists, one in Letterkenny and one in Sligo. I recognise the fact that cancer treatments are better delivered in centres of excellence. Senator Feighan may have been misquoted by my colleague &ndash; he actually said in &ldquo;centres&rdquo; rather than in &ldquo;areas&rdquo;. We get the best delivery of such treatment, a fact adverted to by the Minister of State when he said it is not realistic to expect delivery of such a service in 30 acute hospitals. Everybody recognises that.</P>
    <P>Sligo now has chemotherapy services available for all types of cancers, and travel to Dublin is necessary only for radiotherapy. In the not too distant future it is to be hoped that patients from the north-western area may have to travel only as far as Galway for that treatment. I am glad the days are gone when people had to make that terrible journey from Sligo and stay overnight, being very ill and away from the loving comfort of their own families and homes. We never want to return to such stories, because we had them regularly in the media, and I am glad we have moved on and are now capable of delivering such excellent treatment in our own areas by multi-disciplinary teams, the best of professionals.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in saying that what Dr. Paul Donnellan is delivering in Sligo for the North-Western Health Board would be on a par with what is delivered in London, Paris or New York. Five hundred new patients have been seen by the medical oncologist in just over a year since he was appointed. Before that, every two weeks an oncologist from St. Luke's Hospital travelled to Sligo and saw people on an out-patient basis. That situation was never acceptable and I am glad it does not have to be relied on now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1190" />I am also delighted to tell the House of the appointment of an oncology-trained lady pharmacist in Sligo, the first of her kind in my neck of the woods. Such oncology-trained pharmacists are rare, and they are under immense pressure, and over-worked. I am delighted too to report on the excellent nursing staff in the area, and on the numbers of nursing staff in the oncology unit who have an oncology diploma. No doubt this is partly because it is much cheaper for nurses and professionals like them to live outside the capital city of Dublin. Sligo and other areas in rural Ireland have certainly benefited from this.</P>
    <P>The Sligo unit is small, with 14 beds. I have visited it and have been hugely impressed by the high level of care and the excellent service provided by the multi-disciplinary team. Those of us from the area are certainly delighted with our day-ward, our in-patient ward which allows patients stay on an overnight basis, and with our oncology-trained pharmacist.</P>
    <P>The Minister for State touched on the area of clinical trials, and I am glad to see investment in that area. In Sligo, sadly, we have not yet got that far, and we need a second oncologist, or perhaps another oncology-trained pharmacist before we can embark on that. The clinical trials investment is an excellent initiative.</P>
    <P>The North-Western Health Board has spent &euro;1.2 million on chemotherapy drugs last year. It is a service which is getting busier all the time, and I would ask the Minister of State to keep an eye on that area, and note that in order for an excellent service to be provided, it must be adequately funded.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Feighan, I welcome the smoking ban that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, has been talking about. I am not a smoker, but I know that when I frequent a public house, I wake up the next morning feeling absolutely terrible. The Leas-Chathaoirleach is smiling, but the feeling is not due to the effects of alcohol, it is due to the passive smoking I have to endure.</P>

      <P>Senator Henry spoke about young girls and women smoking, and the ageing effects it has on their skin. I am delighted she mentioned this, because as the mother of two teenage daughters, I abhor the fact that they both smoke. I turn a blind eye and do not allow them to smoke in front of me, but I can now go back and tell them the wonderful news Senator Henry has imparted.</P>

      <P>I thank the Leader, in her absence, for arranging this debate. I thank the Minister of State for coming before the House for the debate. As one of those Senators who <Col N="1191" />requested this debate, I acknowledge the early response to that call. This is an issue on which all of us have strong feelings, both as public representatives and individual citizens, with regard to the pervasive frequency of illness and mortality from cancer. Like Senator Feeney, I welcome the broad range of the debate, particularly in relation to the causes of cancer and the issues of prevention and screening.</P>
      <P>I differ from Senator Feeney as to whether we are all singing from the same hymn sheet because it is clear that this is not the case. On this side of the House, we do not believe enough is being done in relation to cancer care, particularly with regard to the inadequate provision of resources, despite the claims we hear every day. I totally reject the line which ran through the Minister of State's contribution and through that of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, in the debate on cancer services in the Dáil last night. The message was that we cannot have a centre of excellence at every street corner, as if we were looking for an airport or, indeed, a centre of excellence in every village and town. Clearly, people are not seeking such provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely not. As one who has campaigned for extension of the BreastCheck programme, I have been told on more than one occasion, for example, that there cannot be a centre of excellence at Nenagh General Hospital. That was never requested; what is being called for is an adequate level of service. People expect, as is their right, to have the best level of service which Ireland, as a wealthy country, can supply. People are at a complete loss to understand the reasons for reports on radio and television news bulletins which state that 150 beds are to be closed in the Mater Hospital and that there will be job cuts in the health services.</P>
      <P>Although a huge amount of money has been spent on the health services in recent years, I was recently contacted &ndash; this is a true story &ndash; by a woman who was in a state of desperation following a call from St. Luke's Hospital, for the sixth week in succession, to inform her that her father, who was suffering from throat cancer, could not be admitted as there was no bed available. As a nurse, the woman in question could see a deterioration in her father's condition. Last Saturday, in Nenagh, a woman told me that, on the previous day, her father had been diagnosed in Nenagh General Hospital with a suspected brain tumour. Efforts to have him admitted to Cork Regional Hospital for a biopsy were unsuccessful, nor was there any indication as to when he could be admitted. Those are factual cases which demonstrate the reasons people are so angry that they are taking to the streets in protest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person from Nenagh would not expect to be treated in Nenagh for cancer of the throat or a suspected brain tumour. However, they would <Col N="1192" />expect to be treated as soon as possible rather than being left waiting indefinitely without any indication as to when their parent will be treated. Although this is a wealthy country, we have not got our priorities right. The Minister of State referred to the national health strategy published approximately two years ago. However, the necessary funds are not being put into the implementation of that strategy. That is the factual position.</P>
    <P>Let us give credit where it is due, however, specifically on the extension of the BreastCheck programme. I congratulate everyone who campaigned for the extension of that programme, thereby shaming the Government into extending it. I do not blame the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, for the non-extension of the BreastCheck programme, I blame the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach for that failure. It was only a question of money. The plans were in place and everything was ready to roll out. All that was needed was the allocation of funds. Some 48 hours before a march in which I was privileged to take part &ndash; leading a women's group from North Tipperary which had campaigned on the issue &ndash; a Government announcement, clearly under pressure, was made.</P>
    <P>As everybody knows, &euro;27 million is a relatively small amount by comparison with what is being spent under other budget headings. People would point to sport, in particular. I do not begrudge expenditure on sport, but we must get our priorities right in that regard. In a previous debate on the need for breast cancer screening, I quoted a figure which the BreastCheck organisation had given me to the effect that in the 55 to 65 age group in North Tipperary alone, there are currently 45 undetected cancers. Accordingly, in the 22 months interval before the screening programme is rolled out, there will be 90 undetected cancers. I hope all of those will be detected by the screening programme. This indicates the urgency of the situation, the importance of screening and the value for money which it provides. Clearly, early detection of cancer will result in substantially less expenditure on medical care and expertise, quite apart from the personal, family and community trauma associated with the later detection of the condition at a stage when it could be fatal.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil debate last night, Deputy Gormley quoted a WHO report which included a shocking prediction that, within the next 20 years, there will be a 50% increase in the incidence of cancer, largely due to environmental factors. It is well known that cancers occurring in the west are quite different to those which occur in China and Japan. This points directly to the conclusion that cancers are actually linked to environmental and lifestyle factors. That, in turn, raises the issue of prevention and lifestyle. We need to make greater investment and work much harder on prevention, not only in relation to smoking, although that is the more obvious issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1193" />I add my voice in strong support of the Government's initiative in relation to smoking in public houses and public places. That is an essential initiative, having regard to the number of deaths from smoking-related illnesses each year. I understand that a majority of patients in St. James's Hospital are there because of smoking-related illnesses. It is not good enough that we, as legislators, should allow a situation to continue whereby people's health is so seriously affected and, indeed, the public purse is adversely affected when we can do something about it. Let us do something about it.</P>
    <P>As an ex-smoker, I share the growing concern about smoking among younger women, in particular, although I did not take up smoking in my teenage years. One might suggest I should have had more sense. However, I did, at least, give up the habit. Evidently, there is a certain glamour or culture surrounding cigarette smoking. That should be addressed in terms of advertising campaigns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Henry pointed out that it does not prolong a person's glamour for very long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, it does not. However, one does not believe that when one is 17, 18 or 21 years of age. When one starts to see wrinkles at the age of 32 years, one might start to think about it. The most powerful message to a smoker is received when someone he or she knows dies. Young people should be brought to places like St. James's Hospital to see people with emphysema dying from cigarette smoking in order that they make the connection between smoking and its end results. It is hard to get the message across to young people but great work is being done by groups such as ASH. Nonetheless, more needs to be done to de-glamourise cigarettes and alcohol. Merely printing &ldquo;smoking kills&rdquo; on the side of cigarette packets is not enough. We need to look at the bigger picture.</P>
      <P>I will leave the detail of the issue of radiotherapy services in the Mid-Western Health Board area to Senator Finucane because he is so eloquent on the issue. As a public representative in the area, I receive regular correspondence on the issue from health board officials at the planning end, practitioners and senior medical personnel to tell me we should have radiotherapy services there. Therefore, if the Minister of State accuses me of localism in referring to the mid-western region, he is also accusing the entire medical infrastructure of the area. I am curious to hear his response to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is important that people receive the best level of service and many wish to attend the Mater Hospital or Beaumont Hospital, it can be a massive inconvenience for those who are ill and their families to negotiate Dublin's difficult traffic conditions. This underlines the issue of the concentration of services in particular parts of the country. There is a case to be made for a greater <Col N="1194" />spread of such services, a point which I hope will be taken on board.</P>
    <P>I also hope we will see the report on radiotherapy services soon, because the recent leaking of reports is an insidious practice. We have seen the drip-drip effect in the leaking of the strategic rail review and other reports, which causes an unhelpful level of anxiety in the community. We need to get the big picture. While it is helpful to employ experts to produce a report, when one is investing huge sums of public money in health, one must get it right rather than fumbling around on the edges. People need to know the reason decisions are being made. I agree with the Minister of State that we should have the best quality services in the best locations, whether they happen to be in Dublin, Cork or Limerick, but it is important to understand the rationale of the argument. The best way to do so is to get the reports published and widely disseminated to ensure the debate on the level of service continues.</P>
    <P>Strategies and reports are good and important but if they are not backed up by funding, they are meaningless. They gather dust on a health board office shelf and may eventually be taken out to compare current circumstances. Most critical is the level of funding the Government is prepared to commit, not only to cancer services &ndash; although they are hugely important and what we are discussing &ndash; but also health services generally. The Minister of State referred to the importance of primary care in the cancer care area.</P>
    <P>I commend those who work at every level in cancer services, from nurses to consultants. I agree with the Minister of State that there have been huge advances. One must pay tribute to the work of the hospice movement in humanising and putting care at the centre of terminal cancer services. An elderly man told me that he recalled his uncle being sent home from hospital many years ago dying with cancer. He lived in the adjoining house to his uncle's and, as a child, could hear him screaming in pain. People have horrendous memories of how things were in the past but those days are gone and should be replaced by an era in which we expect the best quality service. It will take some time to get there but we should see more progress and, in particular, more priority funding by the Government.</P>
    <P>I thank all those who work in cancer care services, whether they are fund raisers or care givers, consultants or doctors because the quality of care provided on a one-to-one basis is truly exceptional. It makes such a difference to any family affected by this terrible affliction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and sympathise with him because he has an almost impossible task, particularly when dealing with a hugely emotive condition such as cancer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Senator Feighan, I hope everyone will stand firm on the smoking ban in licensed premises. Like many other Senators it appears, I spent a good part of my youth working in pubs and <Col N="1195" />although I have never smoked, I am waiting for it to catch up with me. Employers owe it to their employees and are obliged under health and safety at work regulations to give them a safe working environment &ndash; the strongest argument for the ban. When the Minister of State examines these risk areas, he might also examine the promiscuous use of sunbeds. Perhaps promiscuous is the wrong adverb to use because I refer only to the health effects of sunbeds, rather than any other effects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">

    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on the frankness of his contribution. As Senator O' Meara has underlined, it is important that we have an open debate on this matter and that people begin to understand the nature of a strategy and its basis. I hope he will stick to his strategy. It is easy to respond to pressure and distribute money and resources in penny packages around the place but if one has a strategy which is being unrolled and will ultimately cover the whole country, it is preferable. People should reflect on the fact that it is not just a question of money, it is a question of getting people to work the system within a timescale. One cannot pluck oncologists from the trees. They are scarce.</P>
      <P>There is a tremendous dilemma in this form of health care, almost more than any other, of balancing access with quality and correcting for equity. Most would go for quality but there is also a need to understand the problems of people at a distance and try to make services such as mobile screening as accessible as possible.</P>
      <P>There is a need to maintain a concentration of intensive phases of treatment. It is well noted in international literature that the two year and five year survival rates are much better where there is a concentration of people. It is not just a question of maintaining skills or the volume of work; the interaction between people in different disciplines is important. People are coming across new things all the time. This is particularly important when dealing with some of the more obscure or less commonly met forms of cancer.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State might find it useful to take a look at the provision in relation to cervical screening, in particular among young women. A connection has been made between the increase in sexual activity among young women and some forms of cervical cancer. Given their age and the possibility of longer survival periods, it might be worthwhile looking at that area. We should take a hard-nosed look at all screening programmes from a health economics point of view. Some of them are more valuable than others. One can spend a great deal on identifying one single case but that simply diverts resources from other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to put in place good diagnostic infrastructure to ensure rapid results of tests and <Col N="1196" />shorter waiting times for imaging and so on, particularly when dealing with a disease where early intervention is important. The stories of people having to wait for treatment <i>sine die</i> is soul destroying.</P>
    <P>I would have liked to hear more reference to the hospice movement which is an important element of cancer services. People tend to think of the interventionist element of treatment but palliative care is also important.  The primary care system in the North is delivered differently. My sister died of cancer last year. She died at home with dignity and in peace with a huge input from the palliative care services. It is so much better than having to wait around in hospitals.  </P>
    <P>People must realise the Minister of State will not be able to maintain more than a small number of centres. If he is lucky he will have three to start with, but he might never have more than seven or eight. People need to know the difference in survival rates in small centres and large ones. I am not much into league tables but I do think patients are entitled to this information. I am entitled to know whether I will get better care in hospital A than in hospital B. If those sorts of figures were known, people would tend to vote with their feet.</P>
    <P>I am glad the North-South linkage has been referred to. People like Professor Johnson are doing important work in that regard. It might also be sensible to talk about more active liaison between hospitals in the North and the provision of services here in the north-west and north-east in particular. That might be of assistance to some people.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Senator O'Meara speak about the support needed by people working in this area. That is also true of those working in the palliative care and terminal care areas. Those who work in intervention often see improvements in their patients' health, while others work with people who they know will die. Those carers need a great deal of help and support.</P>
    <P>I am not particularly into passing the buck to the Minister for Finance for every shortcoming in the health service. It is facile to say more money would solve the problem. There is no point in prioritising unless one realises some things are not priorities. This issue is of sufficient priority to be ordered within the health service. It is a cop-out to say we must get more money to enable us to do this. It is an important service which deeply affects the lives of so many people, families and communities. There will never be easy answers. There will always be trade-offs between excess and quality of service. The best we can do is ensure people have access to high quality services. That is a price worth paying. I wish the Minister of State well and thank him for coming to the House today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to renew acquaintance with the Minister of State. I raised the issue of radiotherapy with him last November and again this February in an Adjournment debate. I know he is aware of my concerns in relation to the absence of such a service in the mid-west region.</P>
      <P>The leaking of the contents of the expert review group report, which has been anticipated for the past two years, did not surprise anyone in the mid-west region. It has been leaked that the three radiotherapy centres are to be located in Dublin, Cork and Galway. I know strong attempts were made by Waterford and Limerick to secure the location of such a facility in their areas. A deputation from the Mid-Western Health Board, including officials and members of the board, was due to meet with the Minister yesterday. The deputation was to be accompanied by people from the Oireachtas and I am sure this issue would have been high on the agenda of that meeting. The meeting has been deferred because the Minister for Health and Children was busy in the Dáil and could not meet them.</P>
      <P>Senator Maurice Hayes said the provision of services comes down to money in many cases. That is true. What is being put forward in the mid-western area is what has been advocated by the Government for some time, the public-private partnership concept. We have a population of approximately 350,000 in the mid-west region. The Minister of State will be aware of the Caiman-Hyde report prepared in 1995 which said that a population base of more than 300,000 should have two linear accelerators and a radiotherapy facility. In this case, planning permission has been granted on the campus beside the oncology unit at the regional hospital.</P>
      <P>We are fortunate to have the Mid-Western Hospital Development Trust, a trust organisation which provides a great deal of funding for developments in the mid-western region, including the regional hospital. In this case, it was prepared to provide up to &euro;2 million for capital equipment. What then would the Department be required to pay?</P>
      <P>It has been quantified by the Mid-Western Health Board that the staffing resource to run this unit would cost &euro;1.5 million, if it were to be granted now to run for a year, based on current trends. In the scale of spending, that would not appear excessive when compared with the costs incurred both as a result of many people in the Mid-Western Health Board area having to travel to Dublin, a distance in many cases of 150 or 160 miles, and by St. Luke's Hospital which at times has problems providing its great services. In many cases the people from the region I represent receive treatment between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is completely contradictory to all aspects of palliative care that a person with such an illness should have to travel a long distance. In many cases these people have families and must farm <Col N="1198" />out their children while they are absent in Dublin for treatment, which often takes only a few minutes. There is a need to look at the logic of that and ask whether it is desirable that this should happen. In many cases people refuse to undergo a lumpectomy in Dublin, and instead undergo a full mastectomy in the Limerick Regional Hospital rather than have to travel to Dublin for further treatment. That is regrettable.</P>
    <P>I can give case histories, which have been given to me by the Mid-Western Health Board, encompassing young people as well as older people with different forms of cancer. In those cases there is a considerable delay before radiotherapy treatment starts, often four to six months. Where a person who has cancer was probably receiving chemotherapy initially, to be followed by radiotherapy, can we imagine the uncertainty that must prevail in their mind because of the long delay involved?</P>
    <P>This is a new millennium and Ireland has advanced, and it is about time we recognised that the most important issue is health. When I see the liberal dispensing of funding, particularly lottery funding, I often wonder if somebody examines whether we are getting value for money or whether the importance of quality of life is factored in.</P>
    <P>I want to read one telling statement from <i>Cancer in Ireland 1994 to 1998</i> which will probably crystallise what I have been saying. On the treatment of cancer in Ireland, this states:</P>
    <P>With one or two notable exceptions, differences in treatment patterns between the various health boards were not statistically significant . The most notable exception is the lower percentage of lung, breast and lymphoma patients receiving radiotherapy in the Western and Mid-Western Health Boards.</P>
    <P>The position has not changed since. It is logical, on the basis of geography and everything else which stands for best practice, for a radiotherapy unit to be based in the mid-western region. It would be a retrograde step if the Government did not consider the rationale of the persuasive arguments which have been put forward. The Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan, already knows my sentiments in this regard and I have expressed them on many occasions. I feel very strongly about this issue and I will continue to highlight it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank Senator Finucane for sharing time with me. This has been a very well-informed debate. I have been listening to it in my office and I have been very impressed by the contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make two interventions. The first is on the issue which Senator Finucane was discussing and which Senator Maurice Hayes raised. I am slightly at variance with my colleague and I suppose that is because the Seanad allows one to think in a more independent way than the constant party-political knockabout which takes place in the other House. The health services are <Col N="1199" />decimated because of the appalling concentration we place on the issue of politics and geography in deciding how we spend money. Our primary objective in all of this, whether it is the provision of services for cancer treatment or other treatment, must be best practice and quality service to ensure we spend the money wisely.</P>
    <P>There should be no difficulty bringing people to the kind of specialist services we provide for people today if there are good access and transport links. The dilemma is that every region wants the best possible service. That cannot happen in a country the size of Ireland. It is a dilemma which every Government must face because of the understandable lobbying which takes place in all the regions. The mid-west has a good case, particularly the Limerick region because of its population base, but not every region can have those services.</P>
    <P>We as a country must move on. If we are serious about providing the quality services we need, we have to ensure not only that those services are spread throughout many parts of the country but also that they are specialist services and that there are good transport links to get people to those services, particularly in the case of oncology and radiotherapy services for cancer. We must disconnect medical politics from politics generally. Too often we devote too much time to the issue of politics and its connection with the best possible spend from our money, and that is a real problem which we must confront.</P>
    <P>Second, I have long since held the view that the Government must launch a huge campaign on testicular cancer and prostate cancer. The Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan, will be aware that because of the problems of getting many older men to doctors, and of confronting them with the high incidence of prostate and testicular cancer, people are needlessly losing their lives. We have to move, first, to a screening process &ndash; I think a pilot screening process is already in place &ndash; which would ensure that we build up the capacity and the confidence of men to go early to get screened for these conditions. Second, we must embark on a massive advertising campaign to encourage men to get these tests done at an early stage. Too often these diseases are not caught early enough and if they were, much better outcomes could be achieved.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Maurice Hayes's comments about the hospice service and the support it gives to families and people who are dying of cancer. It would be wrong in this debate not to refer to the wonderful work which takes place. I have seen it myself in my own family. I want to record my thanks to the people who do such a marvellous job in caring for people who will confront the ultimate test through this appalling disease. Our thanks and support should go from this House to those who do such tremendous work in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimDooley" hpid="Mr. Dooley Mr. Dooley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues in welcoming the Minister of State to the House and in recognising the excellent work which he, and the Minister, Deputy Martin, are doing in this area. There is no doubt that health generally, and particularly cancer, is an emotive area for very obvious reasons. When people are diagnosed, or presented with a terminal diagnosis, it can be quite difficult for them to accept the situation and therefore there is a recognition that this issue must be treated sensitively. Sometimes I suppose perception takes over from reality, and the Minister of State has addressed that in terms of what is happening with the strategy going forward.</P>
      <P>Clearly there is a problem with cancer in this country. I think we all recognise that. Some 20,000 people develop cancer in Ireland each year and 7,500 people die from the disease each year. This is quite a horrifying thought but it is a reality of which the Government and the Minister are well aware. It is also true that we as a country have a higher proportion of cancer fatalities than a number of our near neighbours and this obviously creates some concerns for us. The statistics are quite a staggering, but I believe that the Government and the Minister are striving to remedy this problem at a much faster rate than many of their critics are giving them credit for. Therefore let us accept the fact that the system is not perfect. Nobody in this House believes that it could be rendered perfect overnight, and no doubt none of the countries in close proximity has a perfect system either.</P>
      <P>What is really in question is the progress being made. There is no doubt that progress is being and has been made. The Minister and others have detailed a number of the initiatives which have been put in place over the years. Certainly this Government and the previous Government have not been found wanting in that regard, but it would seem that some people refuse to accept that this fantastic progress is being made on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>Since the launch of national cancer strategy in 1996 considerable strides have been made in terms of the provision of cancer treatment services. Since 1997 approximately &euro;400 million has been pumped into this area. This money has been invested by the Government. If this is put in perspective, it represents an increase of approximately 1250% on the £25 million that had been originally planned to be spent during that period. As the Minister of State indicated earlier, the Government has allocated a sum of &euro;29 million, in this year alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Critics will say that we have spent a vast amount of extra funds but that we have failed to grasp the higher quality of drug treatments that are now being used by the health services. These higher quality treatments have the unfortunate drawback of costing more money, but the service being delivered and the results of that service are quite good. Much of the treatment available has enabled people to live or live longer even though <Col N="1201" />a terminal diagnosis may have been given at an earlier stage. A substantial increase in this funding has facilitated the provision of some 80 additional consultants' posts along with all the necessary support staff that are required.</P>
    <P>Eighty additional consultants in a country the size of Ireland is quite a staggering number. For this alone, the Government deserves the credit that has been forthcoming from all sides. We have had a reasonable debate and there is a consensus that a great deal is being done, although it is obvious that there is still a long way to go. There was a suggestion that the Government would have some difficulty in increasing the number of consultants to such a level, but it has done so and we need to recognise this. However, all politics is local, and I notice that the Mid-Western Health Board has only been provided with five extra consultants. I ask the Minister to consider the mid-west region if there is any additional consultants become available.</P>
    <P>The increase in funding for various cancer treatment schemes has had a real impact on the number of people being treated in recent years. There was a 58% increase in the number receiving radiotherapy treatment between 1994 and 2000, with more than 3,800 people receiving such treatment per year. There was also a large increase in chemotherapy treatment, with a jump of up to 30% in the number of patients, from 2,694 in 1994 to 3,519 in 2000.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Martin, have played a key role in the implementation of BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme. Under phase one of this scheme, 83,000 women were screened in the eastern region, the midlands and the North Eastern Health Board area. There is no doubt that this will have a huge impact on society in the future. Many people have been identified as being at risk and, in many cases, their lives will have been saved as a result.</P>
    <P>I note with some amusement that rather than praise the Government for the structures that have been put in place, there have been people, not necessarily in this House but in the Lower House, who have accused it of practising cancer apartheid. It would be foolhardy of any Government to roll out a scheme nationally if it had not been properly pilot-tested, did not have the necessary structures and infrastructure available for its implementation and did not have the necessary staff available to operate the service. This illustrates the importance of running a pilot programme. It allows the Government to ensure that when it comes to rolling out the scheme, the best possible service is provided.</P>
    <P>If anything proves the practical and professional manner in which the Government has handled this aspect of the health service, it is BreastCheck. The Government made sure it had all the necessary elements in place before it committed to something that was simply not possible to implement before now. However, the Minister recently announced that the service is to be rolled <Col N="1202" />out nationwide, so the whole country will be able to benefit from this excellent initiative in the very near future.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State and Senator Brian Hayes both addressed the issue of having separate cancer treatment facilities scattered throughout the country. Since the Minister announced his intention of grouping cancer treatment units in order to allow a multidisciplinary approach, this has been found to have the best chance of treating and curing cancer. That is a fact. However, as the Minister tries to reverse the rise in cancer deaths, his efforts are being met with claims of apartheid from groups that are unhappy that a small local cancer treatment unit is not being located in their area or that there is no opportunity for the provision of an international-standard treatment unit there.</P>
    <P>We need to consider how to proceed in the area of cancer treatment. We can either have small, ineffectual units scattered throughout the country, providing a limited level of treatment, or we can have a large, top-of-the-range facility that will act as a one-stop shop for all cancer treatment. We must consider this in terms of what the Minister has identified as the importance of an international best practice approach. We cannot have both. Ireland is a relatively small country and having 30 centres scattered throughout the country, one in each of our main hospitals, would be neither effective nor possible.</P>
    <P>On a parochial level, I join Senator Finucane and others in supporting the imaginative proposal put forward through the Mid-Western Health Board together with the Mid-Western Hospital Development Trust for a radiotherapy unit in the mid-west region. The ingredients are there &ndash; the health board has a site and the trust is prepared to find the money. The expertise will come through a partnership with the Mater Private Hospital.</P>
    <P>This proposal deserves to be considered &ndash; I am sure the Minister will do so &ndash; in light of the fact that it will be effectively paid for &ndash; both the building and the equipment &ndash; and that the expertise will be there. There are obvious concerns in terms of the necessity of having more than one machine in place, but that is something that can be overcome. When people come together, as is happening in the mid-west region, and deal with the health board, the hospital development trust and the local community in order to raise funds, we should encourage their efforts. There are difficulties in this case, but we need to encourage the community to assist in the provision of services. I thank the Minister of State for his attention and for the information he provided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the sincerity and commitment of the Minister of State and the amount of work he has put into this. We have had a useful debate up to now. There have been suggestions, comments and criticisms, but they have been given from the point of view of recognising a <Col N="1203" />challenge up to which we must face. We faced a similar challenge in 1948 in the form of TB. There was a national consensus that something had to be done, but one man, former Minister Noel Browne, grasped the nettle and stated that we had to solve the problem. It is amazing what can happen when a crusade such as this takes place. The Minister of State's heart is in the right place: the sincerity is there. We must make sure the nation is behind him and the Minister in order that we can actually do something about this.</P>
      <P>There are some things over which the Government has no control. I met a very successful Japanese businessman some years ago. He impressed me and when I asked him how he succeeded when others did not, he said something I liked, namely, that &ldquo;Whether you believe you can or you cannot, you are right&rdquo;. He was talking about business, but also about a game of tennis. He said that if one goes into something convinced one has no chance against the other side, one has not got a chance, but if one goes in believing one can win, one can win. All the evidence suggests that there is some link between one's commitment to succeed against something like cancer and one's success rate. Some people give up when they hear the bad news while others say they will beat it. I know a person who was diagnosed with cancer ten years ago. She lost her hair after going through chemotherapy, but she was determined to win and I believe that is why she succeeded. We do not know enough about medicine to know how this works &ndash; perhaps in ten or 100 years we will know a lot more &ndash; but there is a connection.</P>
      <P>A publication from the Irish Cancer Society states that according to the most recent report of the National Cancer Registry, approximately 20,000 new cases of cancer are recorded annually in Ireland. The Minister of State disclosed that today. This means that one in three will develop cancer in the course of their lifetimes and one in four will die. The report also shows that the current survival rate in respect of cancer is only 43%. I know many people who assume that a diagnosis of cancer is the end. One of the jobs we can do in the House is to get across that this is not the case. There is a 43% survival rate. The Irish Cancer Registry says it is &ldquo;only&rdquo; 43%, but this is higher than many people expect. Very often a great deal of this is in the hands of individuals who say they can beat it. In other cases it is not.</P>
      <P>The Irish Cancer Society further stated:</P>
      <P>Despite these alarming statistics, there is still evidence that there are large numbers of patients, particularly elderly patients, with a cancer diagnosis who are not receiving appropriate cancer-directed treatment. There is also evidence that only 30% of people with cancer in Ireland receive radiotherapy as part of their treatment protocol, whereas the national average should be 50%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a matter about which we can do something. This is not in the individuals' hands but in <Col N="1204" />the hands of the State and the Minister. This is a time when the Mater Misericordiae Hospital is closing 120 beds under the watch of the present Government. I do not have an easy answer, but we should look at the national commitment to do something about it. We can win if we really believe in it.</P>
    <P>Early detection is also an element on which we can do something. There is no information needed. As Senator Brian Hayes said, if we can encourage people to be seen early, they can get treatment and can do something about it. I met somebody this morning who told me her brother had just been diagnosed with cancer. She said that he was fortunate to have the money to go to the Blackrock Clinic to get a PET scan because if he had not the money he would not have got it. I do not know how true that is, but she was convinced that he was fortunate to be able to afford it. What sort of nation is this if survival depends on whether someone can afford to get treatment?</P>
    <P>The Irish Cancer Society also talked about the stringent enforcement of tobacco and alcohol laws and this was mentioned by the Minister. While I do not know if sun beds are covered by any law, I did not realise the implications of using them and this information needs to be made available to the public.</P>
    <P>Senator Maurice Hayes spoke of his experience in the North of Ireland. We keep hearing reports of certain parts of the country that have a greater incidence of cancer than others. Is this true? If so, we should carry out research into it. We keep hearing about higher incidence in counties Down and Louth and the east coast in general. Perhaps that has something to do with Sellafield. Can we not carry out research to verify that?</P>
    <P>I read the Irish Cancer Society's submission to the Irish cancer forum, which highlighted preventive measures and awareness. Although there are some things about which we can do nothing, we can do more about those. The Minister has indicated what is happening and we are taking quite a few steps. However, we can do more.</P>
    <P>We talked today about a massive advertising campaign to encourage people to seek information early. As part of early detection and screening, the BreastCheck service needs to be extended nationwide. While I know this is gradually happening, it needs to be done urgently. There need to be national guidelines on access. The Irish Cancer Society places strong emphasis on the need for clarity on the best practice of referring from the GP to the consultant. I gather there are different standards around the country and this needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Different things can be done at individual, community and national levels. The Minister has shown his heart is in the right place and the Government is sincere and committed. We as a nation can do far more if we set our hearts to it. I got to know the Irish Cancer Society through its efforts on daffodil day a few years ago. Its work on disseminating information is only one step <Col N="1205" />along the road. Having read that and identified the issue, I believe we can do more. Let us make sure we do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this important debate. It will come as no great surprise to the Minister that my main focus will be on radiotherapy. As mentioned by other speakers, I realise we cannot have all the services everywhere. Last year we talked about putting a heart and lung transplant unit into one of the hospitals in Dublin. However it was decided not to do this because &ndash; I hope my figures are right &ndash; only 22 people required this procedure last year. I believe they were sent to the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle. If a procedure only needs to be performed once every fortnight, we will not have the expertise here to do that.</P>
      <P>We have to give similar consideration to cancer. However, cancer is totally different because one in three people will be affected by cancer at some stage, making it probably the biggest health issue in the country. Forgetting about location for a moment, the radiotherapy services are not being provided for everybody at present. I do not denigrate St. Luke's Hospital in Dublin, which is doing a fantastic job. A very good friend of mine has spent time there and while he was lavish in his praise for the care and treatment he got, that is not enough.</P>
      <P>We are all frustrated waiting for the report of Professor Hollywood on radiotherapy services. The Minister has been given completion dates, which have not been achieved. We are now told we will see that in the next few weeks. Although I do not know the contents of the report, there have been certain leaks.</P>
      <P>All the oncologists at Waterford Regional Hospital tell me that the three strands of treatment available &ndash; chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy &ndash; must all be available at the one location. We lost an oncologist who moved to Cork because he was frustrated at not being able to treat his patients properly. I fear that will happen in other areas if we do not provide all the correct services. Everybody in the entire south-east region is at one in wanting a radiotherapy service in Waterford. That does not happen often as we are usually pulling against one another. The leaks seem to indicate this will not turn out the way we in the south-east want.</P>
      <P>I have a difficulty with the fact that vested interests are involved in producing this report in that most of the people on the review group were located in Dublin, with a number from Cork also. I accept that is where the experts are located and we could not get them from anywhere else. However, they will look after their own patches to the detriment of the rest of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also suggested this report will say that by about 2010 the south east region will have the population base to merit the provision of linear accelerators in the region. If that is the case, we should start working towards that now. We all <Col N="1206" />know the decision about Galway was taken many years ago and it is still not there because of the huge lead in time to provide these services. Everybody accepts that if a decision was made to locate this in Waterford or Limerick it would take a number of years before everything would be <i>in situ</i>. There is no point in waiting to start planning until we reach the level of population necessary because it will take five to seven years after that. From the population projections we know the number of people who will be living in the region in future, so we should be working towards providing adequate services in accordance with those projections. That is only commonsense. If the Hollywood report does not recommend such a unit, then at the very least we should be working towards providing it in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for a constructive discussion on the causes, prevention and treatment of cancer. I am grateful for the universal welcome Senators have given to the proposal by the Minister for Health and Children to ban smoking in licensed premises and other such venues. I will report back to the Minister on that positive contribution from Seanad Éireann. Many Senators spoke of their experiences with passive smoking, including Senator Feeney, and when I entered public life I also developed a serious chest problem due to exposure to smoke in public places. Such serious problems need to be addressed.</P>
      <P>Senator Glynn spoke about the right to smoke but the right he was looking for and did not identify was the right to clean air. I hope Seanad Éireann has played its part today in trying to secure that right for our population. All the Senators who contributed to the debate felt there should be a total ban on smoking in public places, including Senator Hayes and Senator Feighan, who began on a very constructive note, setting the tone for the debate. Opposition speakers have expressed legitimate criticisms about the health service, including bed provision, circumstances in particular hospitals and the requirements of different regions. These matters have been echoed on all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to see how constructive a debate can become when it focuses on a particular aspect of the health service, such as the provision of cancer services, rather than the more generalised discussions we have had about health provision in general. Seanad Éireann is at its very best when it focuses on what we can do as a country to tackle serious medical conditions such as cancer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hard questions were posed and Senator Feighan kicked off on the first and fundamental question in this area which concerns the shortage of radiotherapists. It is the most difficult question that I have to address. Since 1997, two additional consultant radiotherapists have been appointed but I accept that is not sufficient given the need to develop radiotherapy services generally. The <Col N="1207" />Minister established the expert review group in order to provide an effective plan for future developments. I accept that our radiotherapy services are not adequate at present to meet current and future requirements for radiotherapy treatment. As soon as the Minister receives the report, which is very close to finalisation, proposals will be developed for consideration by Government.</P>
    <P>Senator Feighan contrasted the fact that we have eight radiotherapists in the State, while in Northern Ireland there are 12 in Belfast alone. I was taken by that fact because one of the key elements that was not mentioned in the debate concerns what the Northern Ireland authorities are proposing to do with regard to radiotherapy services. They are proposing that there should be only one radiotherapy centre in the North.</P>
    <P>I understand that Senators have to press for particular regional claims, however. Senator O'Meara graphically described how all the general practitioners and health board staff in her area have made representations to her about the provision of radiotherapy services in the Mid-Western Health Board's area. Likewise, Senator Finucane made an eloquent plea for radiotherapy services in Limerick, and Senator Kenneally made a very legitimate claim for Waterford. In all those contributions, I was struck by the dislike all country people have for travelling to Dublin. The expert group, however, is not proposing that anybody should travel to Dublin &ndash; it is examining where these services should be located outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>In recent years, a substantial investment has been made in Cork and Galway, as I outlined in my opening remarks. Senators, and the general public, have to look at what is happening on this island of ours. We are living in an era of North-South co-operation and in Northern Ireland it has been decided to centralise the radiotherapy services in one unit in Belfast. It is proposed to construct a comprehensive radiotherapy facility in Belfast to treat all cancer patients in Northern Ireland, which has a population of 1.7 million. Therefore, patients from Fermanagh, Derry and the Mournes will have to travel to Belfast to receive such treatment. I appreciate that, naturally, Opposition Senators will not fall over themselves to point this out to the public but I have to do so because it is relevant to the decisions we are making.</P>
    <P>Senator Brian Hayes spoke about this subject in the course of the debate and, as someone who has been elected to represent a Dublin constituency, I feel strongly about this too. Of course we want patients to receive the very best service but that requires a centre of excellence that must not only have a critical throughput of patients but also connections with the other disciplines. That is the multidisciplinary approach that requires all the medical expertise to be concentrated in that unit to be made available to patients who require it.</P>
    <P>In general, I welcome the quality of today's <Col N="1208" />debate and I am sure the Minister for Health and Children will take into account what has been said. Many Senators expressed their great appreciation for the tremendous work undertaken by the hospice movement. In my opening remarks, I referred to the substantial State investment that has been made in palliative care in recent years. That investment can only work, however, if we have co-operation from the hospice movement, which has been forthcoming. I acknowledge the great work that has been done in that regard. I join with other Senators who paid tribute to the work of the hospice movement, which has helped the State so much.</P>
    <P>Senator Glynn referred to psychiatric support services. The national cancer forum, under the chairmanship of Professor Redmond, is examining a new national cancer strategy to identify the key areas to be targeted, including psycho-oncology. The forum has identified a great need for this service due to the important role it can play not only for cancer patients but also for their families who are also affected when their loved ones contract such a condition.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry cited statistics widely in her contribution, as well as raising a number of detailed matters. It was refreshing to hear her discussing men's health issues. Along with Senator Brian Hayes, she drew attention to the unwillingness of the male of the species to seek early diagnosis and treatment. That has been identified as a major problem in the development of fatal cancerous conditions. Senator Henry also expressed her concerns about the epidemic of lung cancer among women in their 50s. In fact, the Minister for Health and Children launched the SLÁN report on tobacco consumption today.</P>
    <P>The good news is that overall cigarette smoking rates across virtually every demographic category have fallen since the first survey was carried out five years ago in 1998. I will share some of the statistics with the House because they bear public examination. The highest smoking rates are still among the younger adult population. Some 34% among those aged between 18 and 34 still smoke, which is a fall from the 39% rate in 1998, but the rate is still very high. That suggests why Senator Henry could confirm that we have the epidemic of lung cancer among middle aged women. The rate of cigarette smoking among those between the ages of 35 and 54 is 25%, which is a fall from the 30% rate in 1998. The rate among those aged 55 and upwards is 17%, which is a fall from the 20% rate in 1998. Among school-going children, 19% still report they are smokers in contrast to 21% in 1998.</P>
    <P>Exposure to passive smoking has fallen in the workplace, at home and in public transport, but passive smoking in pubs and clubs affects 47.3% of men and 31.6% of women, another matter to which many Senators testified. There is some improvement in regard to the fall in the rates of cigarette smoking. I have no doubt that the great welcome the Seanad has given to the Minister's proposal to ban smoking in public places will give <Col N="1209" />a decisive push forward on those figures and will set a tremendous public example in regard to cigarette smoking, which would help us to get those figures down even further.</P>
    <P>There were many other points to which I would like to refer. I appreciate my time is short, but Members might bear with me.</P>

      <P>It is also important to note the matter of expenditure. Senator O'Meara raised the hard cases that exist in the health service and the great difficulties we have in this area. If we are to develop cancer services we need to invest money but we also need to be efficient in how we spend it. That is the way forward in the health services. It is not enough simply to propose new expenditures; we must engage in a critical examination of our existing expenditures.</P>
      <P>I am glad to note from the report on surgical procedures that the cancer forum has examined oncology surgery between 1997 and 2002 in respect of a number of site specific causes, including lung, breast, pancreas and colon cancer. The forum concluded that there are too many hospitals, given the total number of procedures that are performed in our hospitals. We do not have the patient caseload to support the current organisation of oncological services. The forum has advised that the current organisation of services is not in line with international best practice. I outlined that to the House in my opening contribution and I am now giving Senators the details in greater specificity.</P>
      <P>This report needs to be addressed at a number of levels in our health services. The medical profession must assess the report to ensure that, in a balanced way, we reform our arrangements for organising and delivering our health services. At the level of the individual health board, we will have to examine this report to benchmark each local hospital organisation against international best practice. The forum will reflect further on the data established in this report in developing the national cancer strategy.</P>
      <P>There has been a great deal of examination in this area and much work has been done on prevention. We intend to continue the work on prevention in relation to smoking and there are other key causal factors. Senator Henry rightly raised the question of obesity as a further factor which is tending towards cancer conditions. In relation to hospital provision, there is scope for efficiencies and much scope for improvement.</P>

      <P>I thank the Leader of the House for organising this debate at such short notice. It is important that we should at least publicly reflect on the current situation in Northern Ireland before the House goes into recess for Easter. I thank her sincerely for organising this debate.</P>
      <P>Last week was an important week historically for this country. At one level it was five years since the Good Friday Agreement was negotiated, but it was also an important week in the history of my party. Some 80 years ago last week to the very week Cumann na nGael was established in Dublin, nine months after the first Free State Government was established. In a sense my party was a Government first and a political party second.</P>
      <P>The great success of that first and second Government of the Free State was twofold. One, it immediately brought about a civilian control of the Army which was not even achieved in the first Dáil in 1919. Second, by 1930 the Army was half the size it was in 1922. That underlines the importance W. T. Cosgrave and the first and second Governments gave to demilitarisation and taking the gun out of Irish politics. I reflect on that historical point this evening so that we can all point the way to progress in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the current impasse is depressing it is also encouraging from the point of view of where we go forward from today. I am greatly encouraged by the fact that both Governments are together on this issue. Both Governments are demanding action, acts of completion &ndash; call it <Col N="1211" />what one will &ndash; not only in respect of the final bits of the Agreement that need to be implemented or because we want consistency in the way forward in terms of implementing the Agreement, but also because the final acts of completion from the republican and loyalist armed groups need to be resolved. It is in that context I put this debate.</P>
    <P>If we ask Unionists to sit down with Sinn Féin, as we do, we must understand that there is a price for that and the price is full and complete decommissioning, acts of completion and the end of paramilitarism on this island once and for all. That is the consistent view of the Irish people, as expressed in the Good Friday Agreement. We must uphold the wishes of the Irish people, North and South, in the acceptance of that Agreement in 1998.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin is an important part of the peace process. It has helped the IRA move hugely over the past ten years with the help of others, Senator Mansergh and many other important contributors. I fully accept that. Sinn Féin and the IRA must now make the decision once and for all to put their paramilitary past behind them and look to the future only as a political party. That was the same context in which W. T. Cosgrave and the first and second Governments operated in the 1920s and it brought us down the road of accepting democracy in this country.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, when Sinn Féin and the IRA make the decision to abandon paramilitarism we will have democracy on this island. I support the work of both Governments in their efforts in Northern Ireland over the coming weeks to bring about the democracy that we all want in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Ms O'Rourke Ms O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the leaders of all the parties and the two other Members who will contribute to this debate. We met informally this morning after the Order of Business and decided that we wanted to express our opinion and that it was correct we should do so. We are all determined that we will be careful, bearing in mind that I informed the Taoiseach's office of this proposal and it was approved by it.</P>
      <P>It is important to consider what the Taoiseach said about this matter in the Dáil yesterday. It was clear that he had worked very hard on it, particularly since early March when the process entered what we believed would be the definitive stage. I was touched by the offers of support and encouragement by all parties in the Dail and I thank Senators for the support that has been offered on a cross-party basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt this is an extremely tense time in the process. It is interesting that the negotiations are taking place on the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Good Friday Agreement. Easter is a symbolic time of renewal, rebirth and affirmation for people of all religions and political parties. It is also symbolic that we are discussing this issue while nature is exhibiting itself in such a fine way across the country. In this period of <Col N="1212" />renewal, it is important to consider the phrase &ldquo;acts of completion&rdquo; that was used by the Taoiseach. Matters have been considered with heightened awareness since last Thursday, when it was hoped the necessary words could be issued to give weight to the acts of completion. The latter come to pass, but that should not lead us to believe that it will not happen. If one is optimistic, one looks on each challenge in an optimistic way. This challenge should draw the highest form of response from all parties, particularly Sinn Féin and those it influences within the IRA.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that paramilitary activity and capability should be brought to their final act of completion. For five years we followed the progress of the Good Friday Agreement. agreed to the establishment of and participated in the North-South bodies, enthusiastically supported the joint ministerial groupings and members of all parties supported the forum chaired by Senator Maurice Hayes. Senator Mansergh also did much work on this matter. The various parties have all supported the Taoiseach, the British Prime Minister and President Bush, who visited to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is clear that, after five years of patience from everyone involved, the road to peace will not be immediate nor will it be like the end of a fairy story in which everyone lives happily ever after. That could not happen. There comes a point in such a process when, if added weight and impetus are to be given to the cross-Border institutions and the work we want to do together, we need certainty from the current talks in order to give fluency to subsequent decisions and actions to be undertaken on a North-South basis. There is much at stake and for those who will spend Easter reflecting, talking and encouraging and I hope that the end will be an act of affirmation. We look forward to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not here yesterday or this morning because I was in Geneva, at a UN human rights conference. The conference was held in the United Nations building, which formerly housed the League of Nations. It is a formidable structure, a classic 1930s building on a huge scale. It is worth remembering what happened to the League of Nations, in spite of all the optimism which Ireland, through Éamon de Valera, invested in it. The League collapsed in the greatest war the world has ever seen.</P>
      <P>Good things do not happen inevitably. The best intentions in the world do not mean that what we desire will happen. The League of Nations is a very good example of the fact that things do not always happen because they are good things we wish to happen. We will all have to reiterate that line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be restrained today. When I think of the things I and others say here in normal party political banter, all of us still feel we have to tip-toe a little around one party and my patience is wearing thin. I stuck my neck out for some of the people involved in that party's activities in the <Col N="1213" />North because human rights were still central and there were issues of injustice. Other people did likewise and I am not claiming a singular role. However, as I have said to the party directly, it is wearing out the patience of those who were the closest it had to allies at a time when doing so was very difficult. I opposed extradition and section 31 because it was the wrong way to go, even though if all the republican movement's grievances were entirely as it presented them, none of those grievances, singly or together, would have justified the killing of one human being. They were not of that scale or intensity and we all have to live with that.</P>
    <P>I would not have believed 20 years ago that any leader of Ulster unionism, however uneven his path, would have come as far as David Trimble and an entirely new leadership of the Unionist movement have come in an attempt to reconcile what most of us feared was irreconcilable. It is worth remembering that it is almost nine years since the first IRA ceasefire, but that organisation still has weapons and explosives in usable condition. The latter must be the case or there would not be a question of putting them beyond use. I accept that the ceasefire has been almost universally observed and maintained almost 100% at the level it defined. Punishment beatings and so on are not part of the role of any paramilitary or law enforcement organisation. The IRA must begin to realise that the retention of usable weapons for the best part of ten years &ndash; it is nine years since the first ceasefire &ndash; is a statement that others are entitled to look at in a different way.</P>
    <P>One cannot have a successful construction of institutions and trust if someone claims victory. I do not want to claim victory and I will not do so, but I am entitled to claim the truth. Our current problem relates to what is true &ndash; the issue is truth. As I said at the beginning, on this occasion I will restrain myself but, like many others in Irish politics, I am very close to a position where some of the truth that we keep within ourselves about our thoughts will have to be said publicly, and it will not be very nice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, you more than most people in the House will recognise how far we have come in these debates, for you will recall the many occasions &ndash; almost weekly &ndash; when we had to stand before the House to condemn the latest incidence of barbarity, atrocity or slaughter. Thankfully, we have come out of that, though we are reminded of the final case in Omagh, which surpassed in its barbarity much, if not all, that went before. On these occasions, we are also reminded of the words of sanity and reason, not to mention the Christian love, that emanated from Senator Wilson when he spoke of how ridiculous it was to be fighting over what he said was a &ldquo;little cabbage patch&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all hoped that the declaration that we awaited last week would come through and that the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Blair would be <Col N="1214" />able to bring finality to the peace process, for that is how I regard it &ndash; not as finality to the peace but that we should have peace without there being a process any longer. I also made the point last week on the Order of Business that the judgment of history will be particularly severe on those who do not grasp this opportunity. What we saw was depressing. I quote the famous phrase, &ldquo;But when the floodwaters have subsided and we look across the landscape, we see again in all their glory, the dreary steeples of Fermanagh and Tyrone.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was disappointment, and I share Senator Ryan's frustration. There was anger, and I was one of those who was angry, for we had held the line for so long. We were described as appeasers &ndash; I remember being described as such &ndash; because we thought that the prize of peace was worth that. We were let down. Five years ago we had the landmark Good Friday Agreement, and the overwhelming majority of the people on this island endorsed that. Those who continually assert that they have a democratic mandate might reflect on something that was not merely a democratic mandate but a democratic imperative for politicians North and South. We changed our Constitution to copperfasten the mandate and the peace process. Everyone was prepared to take a leap of hope, trust and confidence, but what we have had repeatedly is inches. It brings a cross-party resonance to the phrase &ldquo;not an inch&rdquo;. It is no longer the custody of one party.</P>
    <P>I am really getting very tired of the interminable theology of partition and the semantics that attend it concerning the meaning of the principle of consent. Those of us involved in the first Forum for Peace and Reconciliation can recall how long it took in drafting a report to try to get that matter incorporated. Ultimately, of course, it was not to be incorporated.</P>
    <P>Prime Minister Blair, the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and President Bush must be totally exasperated at this point. I am with Mr. Blair when he speaks of the need for an end to ambiguity. We need no more nuances, ambiguity or sophistry. We need plain simplicity. We are so conscious of the sensitivities, and rightly so, that we are very reluctant to apportion blame, but it is becoming increasingly difficult not to do so. I am trying to be moderate in my language, but I am getting angry and frustrated.</P>
    <P>We have rights, including the right to demand that we do not sit like rabbits transfixed by the headlights of a car while the driver decides whether he will run us over or pass us by on one side. After all the circumlocution, the doublespeak, the ambiguity and the lies, we are reduced to stark simplicity. We simply want to hear that the war is over, that there is finality and that the ordinary political process will assert itself. I recall the words of Senator George Mitchell at the conclusion of his account of his experiences in Northern Ireland. He spoke of bringing his son back to sit in the Chamber and hear the ordinary langu<Col N="1215" />age and the ordinary work of politics, for that is what must prevail.</P>
    <P>I was offended by the suggestion that the Government had been spinning when it appeared that the declaration would not come forward. If we have had spinning, then we have had it non-stop for the past ten years. It is equally offensive to hear the call for decommissioning of weapons in Iraq. For goodness sake, think about home before thinking about Iraq. People say they are opposed to war, but there is a war here, and they must say that it is over and that the weapons are gone and will not be used. That stark simplicity is all that we are waiting to hear. I support both Governments in everything that they are trying to do in that respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I too am grateful to the Leader for arranging the debate and to the other leaders for allowing me to participate in it.</P>
      <P>It is difficult that we are not totally informed of what is going on. We must deal with what we see, the public press and what we can infer from people's body language. None of us wishes to make a delicate situation more difficult to resolve. Senator Dardis asked us to remember the past, and I too remember. When we look back, we must marvel at how far we have come, and that is particularly true in Northern Ireland. I pay tribute to those on all sides who helped bring that about. However, having gained so much, what a tragedy it would be to lose any of that progress.</P>
      <P>I do not want to sound patronising. It is not a question of applying deadlines or anything else, but there is a sense that completion should be achieved now. We must ask ourselves where the optimism is that was there last week. Where was it when Northern Ireland was being paraded as a template for conflict resolution around the world?</P>
      <P>I ask people on all sides to recognise their own work in constructing the process and their responsibility to the process itself above other requirements. People must face up to the logic of their own position. Yesterday morning I was on the Shankill Road in Belfast among some people whom one might not immediately recognise as pillars of the democratic process. However, they were saying almost the same thing as Senator Dardis. They wanted to know that the war was over so that they could get on with politics and the arrangement of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sad thing is that we all know that the war is over. We all know that to all intents and purposes we are not going back to where we were. If that could be recognised and made manifest in some demonstrable way, it would advance matters enormously. It is quite clear that one cannot have a peace process without the Unionists or at least a sufficient number of the Unionist population to support it. At the moment they are sceptical and require reassurance, and they are entitled to that. It is equally true that one cannot have a peace process without republicans, and <Col N="1216" />they too need to come in. Where, on the one hand, Unionists in particular, but also the rest of us, want to hear that the war is over, on the other hand republicans need to know of a wholehearted Unionist commitment to the process so that, when they do come in, things will go from there.</P>
    <P>It is not by any means the end of the world if we do not get everything buttoned up this week or next, but it makes things more difficult, one reason being that people are going into an election. That election should be held, but the electorate is entitled to know what they are being asked to vote on. The best we can do at the moment is commend the Governments, particularly for sticking together on this matter, but also for their patience, ask all the parties to consider the mutuality of their interests in the process and their commitment to make it work, and wish them all well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Leader for allowing time for this short debate. I was at a meeting of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation in Dublin Castle when the Canary Wharf bomb went off. It was late in the meeting and few people were there. I could see that the members of Sinn Féin who were present were devastated by what happened. They did not expect the bomb which was beyond their knowledge or control.</P>
      <P>However, we must say to them that they have to look at the significant progress which has been made, not just in Northern Ireland, but on the whole island of Ireland and between this island and our neighbouring island. They must say to those members of the IRA whom they know that they can no longer have a role as an armed force.</P>
      <P>The disappointment for all of us is significant because much work has gone into the process and everyone has to be congratulated, particularly, as Senator Maurice Hayes stated, the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister for having held together so well and for so long. This has been important because Governments can fall out over things. However, the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister have kept together in a splendid manner.</P>
      <P>Sinn Féin has to stop talking about the Unionist veto. We all have a veto. We all have rights. None of us wants a private army on this island. We are the people who are saying that this clear declaration has to be made. I hope they will go back and use whatever influence they have so the progress we have made will not be lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh" hpid="Dr. Mansergh Dr. Mansergh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader and the Opposition leaders for this opportunity to address this important issue. Our support goes to the Taoiseach, the British Prime Minister and all the parties and officials involved. I know from experience how long, protracted and difficult these discussions can be. However, in the end they proved fruitful. When we look back over ten or 15 years, we can see that significant progress has been made. Whenever one goes into the <Col N="1217" />international arena one hears talk about the process. President Bush used the phrase, &ldquo;the incredible progress of the Northern Ireland peace process&rdquo;, to describe it. I attended another conference last week where the Northern Ireland peace process was seen as one of the successes compared with others which are in grave difficulties.</P>
      <P>If there is hesitation and difficulty at the moment, it is partly because of the sheer ambition of the hurdle that is now to be cleared. It is about some of the issues that have been discussed, but it is also about policing and completing the participation in policing. It is also about dismantling many of the military installations, about justice and equality and putting the institutions back on a firm and stable basis. I have lost count of the number of times the institutions have been suspended or their operation partially interrupted. The stop-go course is not serving anyone's interests. At the early stages of the peace process, I remember being preached to about the importance of maintaining momentum. It is difficult to maintain momentum if there is stalling on completing what each party has to do. One cannot expect other people to complete their entire agenda while one holds back on one's own agenda.</P>
      <P>It is nine years since the first ceasefire and five years since the Good Friday Agreement. A line has to be drawn under the past. The republican tradition, much of which is honourable and underlies this State, dates from a pre-democratic past. In a Northern Ireland context, the conflict, however deplorable, arose out of a type of one-party state, the denial of civil rights and so on. We can argue about the rights and wrongs of all that but those circumstances have fundamentally changed. We have a democratic framework that has been established by the concurrent self-determination of the people of Ireland, North and South. It requires clarity and an exclusive commitment, not merely from the political parties, but also from organisations associated with them. All the main players, be they republican, loyalist and everything in between, have given that commitment. It is necessary for the organisations associated with them to act in consequence.</P>
      <P>It is a difficult hurdle. I know the difficulties involved in taking that step and even some of the risks and dangers for some of the people involved. It is essential that the step be taken. Naturally I would prefer if that step were taken tomorrow rather than next week or next month. I have no doubt it will be taken. However pessimistic I might be in the very short term, I am optimistic in the short to medium term because there is no other course open to anyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my understanding, the word &ldquo;republicanism&rdquo; means democracy. It does not mean something opposed to democracy or an alternative to it. We all have to give our support and hope that the important and somewhat tense discussions will have the desired result. We hope thereafter that we will see a new stability and quality of <Col N="1218" />peace that unfortunately we have not fully seen to date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>In view of the proposals by the Department of Finance to raise funds by the sale of some Office of Public Works property, Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for Finance to apportion the first moneys raised to the building of the long-proposed new Central Mental Hospital at Dundrum in view of the disgraceful conditions under which the patients in the present hospital are kept, despite repeated condemnation by international human rights bodies.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to see the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, in the House. He is in charge of the important area of the sale of Government property. The Government does not have any more money of its own. Senator Brian Hayes was giving out during the last debate that I am always saying that the Minister for Finance should come to the House to discuss health matters, as the Minister for Health and Children has no money and the Minister for Finance makes the decisions. In reality, the Minister for Finance has no money of his own. The money he has is ours &ndash; it is taxpayers' money. As a compliant taxpayer for 35 years, I like to know what is happening to my money.</P>
      <P>Most of the money raised by the State comes from taxpayers. It comes from people like me in the PAYE sector who send in their subscriptions on a regular basis. However, we seem to have little control over what happens to our money. Even if one is a Member of Seanad Éireann, it is very difficult to have much say over what happens with money because money Bills are not looked on in any favourable in the House. One cannot bring forward Private Members' Bills that would involve any cost to the Exchequer. We are, therefore, in quite a weak position, but we have some sort of duty to try to express our opinions on how money is being spent.</P>
      <P>Over the years, taxpayers' money has been spent on buying property which is managed, on behalf of the State, by the Office of Public Works. I am sure it is managed very well. From time to time, the Office of Public Works sells various properties and buys others. However, it is not really involved in any major sales. We have made some major purchases such as Farmleigh House, the renovations to which cost a considerable amount. I did not make too many objections to that because I was of the opinion that if it was going to be a useful institution for the State, so be it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Finance recently announced that there will be a sale of State property and that the Minister of State will be in charge of this. I am sure he is a very suitable person to be in charge of the sale which, it has been <Col N="1219" />stated, will raise up to &euro;100 million. That is a great deal of money. At the launch of the Office of Public Work's annual report last Monday, the Minister of State said that there are five to six sites of varying values which could be sold to raise this &euro;100 million. I do not expect the Minister of State, for commercial reasons, to provide a list of all the sites he proposes to put forward for sale within the next year or so because that would not help in terms of their final sale price. On the other hand, I would like to know some of those that are going to come up for sale in the near future which will cause no concern on the property market. The Minister of State and the Department of Finance will have ideas about what should be done with the money. However, Members and people in general will also have ideas. It is a great pity that such a small number of people seem to have any input into how this not inconsiderable amount of money from the sale of our property is to be used.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Rourke has tabled an amendment to the motion. The property in Lad Lane has been recognised as the first property that the Minister of State is going to put on the market. The amendment to my motion supports the proposal by the Minister of State to use funds raised by the sale of the Office of Public Works property at Lad Lane for a list of what appear to be quite worthy programmes. Why was there no discussion among other Members with regard to where we thought that money could best be spent? I am sure that the National Educational Psychology Service needs money for a regional office to expand its service, but I do not know that it is more worthy than the cause I put forward tonight. Senator O'Rourke's amendment refers to &ldquo;the purchase of sites for the Garda building programme to accelerate the provision of new Garda stations across the country&rdquo;. We have already heard that various Garda stations are going to be sold. Would it not be possible to use the money from some of those sales to finance the provision of the new stations to which the amendment refers in order that funding can be provided for projects which some of the rest of us think are important? I feel that very narrow criteria are being used to consider how the money should be spent and that my suggestion is as good as any other. The Minister of State has earmarked Lad Lane for this, but I suggest that we should raise money for a new Central Mental Hospital. Senators Feighan, Mansergh and Quinn may each have projects to which they would prefer the money was given. We are all entitled to further discussions regarding how these moneys are being spent.</P>
    <P>The Central Mental Hospital was built in 1852 and, because it has been carefully maintained and is in exactly the same state as when it was built, it is a listed building and cannot be altered. I do not know that this could be described as a great triumph for the State because within that hospital are some very ill people with serious psychiatric <Col N="1220" />diseases who have no hope of improving in such a therapeutic environment. A total of 57 of them sleep on concrete plinths in single cells. I suppose they are not cages because they have walls, but there is no window except at roof level. There is no sanitation, so patients have to defecate and urinate into plastic buckets and slop out every morning. For people in the whole of their health this would be bad enough, but for those who are really ill it is utterly appalling.</P>
    <P>It is approximately 20 years since a Minister for Health visited the hospital. Barry Desmond was the last Minister to go there, prior to Deputy Martin's recent visit. Deputy Martin's visit was arranged after it became well known that President McAleese was going to visit the institution. The Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform also visited the hospital. The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy O'Malley, promised me in a debate on psychiatric services that he would visit it and he was as good as his word.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children was reported in the paper as saying that the conditions there were &ldquo;grim, grim&rdquo;. Good and all as are the Minister of State's projects, I do not believe anyone is saying that there are Garda stations which are &ldquo;grim, grim&rdquo; or that the premises of the National Educational Psychology Service are &ldquo;grim, grim&rdquo;. Who is responsible for prioritising the way in which the money raised from the sale of State property will be spent?</P>
    <P>The plans for this new hospital have been in existence for approximately ten years. It was intended to build it in the grounds of the existing campus at Dundrum. The original cost was estimated at £34 million, but I suppose it would cost much more now. The sale of the Lad Lane property would subscribe at least a third of the price. We introduced in a Mental Health Act last year, but we cannot possibly enforce it because we do not have the necessary resources or facilities. There is a Criminal Insanity Amendment Bill before the House. I pointed out that it was quite impossible to bring this in because the resources are not available to allow us to transport people from the courts to secure hospital instead of to prisons. The Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform stated that he wants to close down the padded cells in prisons, but where is he going to put the people who inhabit them? I have never seen such fanciful planning in my life in respect of legislation, but it seems to be somewhat prevalent in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In England, public private partnerships have been put in place &ndash; I am not opposed to anything of this nature &ndash; where hospitals are built by the private sector. However, this is a costly process because the institution involved usually has to take out either a mortgage or a lease to pay back the private company and some of its resources have to be spent on repayments. We could do something like that in Dundrum, but this is exactly the sort of thing the amendment indicates that the Minister of State is trying to stop by buy<Col N="1221" />ing off leaseholds of properties currently occupied by the State on a long-term payment basis in order to reduce the Office of Public Works' ongoing rent roll in the future. That is a line of progress which will not be very good because the Office of Public Works does not want to do it here so I presume it does not want the State doing it in another direction by getting involved in a public private partnership.</P>
    <P>I suggest that we ring-fence the money that will accrue from these various sales because I have a horrid suspicion that some of it is going to flow back into the Department of Finance and be used to shore up the deficit or deal with whatever other problems exist. I am sure the projects listed in the amendment are very worthy, but I do not believe they are as worthy that which I have put forward. I also do not believe that Members or anyone else is being granted sufficient input into how this money, which will be raised by the sale of our property, will be distributed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State may be pleased to know that I added my name to this motion for precisely the reasons outlined by Senator Henry. I was involved in the opening of the national lottery in the 1980s. One of things that appealed to me about the national lottery was the battle that went on to ensure that the money from ticket sales did not go into Government funds in order to shore up the deficit or that existed at the time. Accordingly I was happy to add my name to this proposal and to support the ringfencing of the money.</P>
      <P>I then read what the Minister of State said during the week and realised that there are State lands with a portfolio value of &euro;2.5 billion, so clearly such sales are likely to happen in the years ahead. Considering that we spent &euro;98 million on rental last year, it clearly makes a great deal of sense not to be paying rent at the same time as we have unused land.</P>
      <P>It is logical too for the Minister of State not to declare what is going to be done, because a &ldquo;fire sale&rdquo; would then be necessary, where something has to be sold without achieving its commercial value. Senator Henry has asked about the purpose of the Lad Lane sales, and what the money will be used for, and the amendment, which I had not seen until now, expands a little on what I heard. Nobody is going to say these are not worthy causes, but regarding the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum, which the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister of State recently visited &ndash; the first Ministers to do so for a long time &ndash; there is little doubt that it makes sense to identify that as the really deserving cause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister recently spoke of his intention to close down the hospital's padded cells, but he also spoke of Shanganagh Castle and his intention to close it. I had never been in a prison until a couple of years ago, when I visited Wheatfield Prison. I went there because I was involved in the <Col N="1222" />curriculum of the new leaving certificate applied. I was impressed with the prison itself, because its governor has managed to make sure that we do not put more people into it than it can handle, unlike Mountjoy and perhaps other prisons where prisoners must share facilities. I was even more impressed with the prison's ability to educate, and one could see that those who had fallen out of the education system were coming back into it in Wheatfield. I was impressed too by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, when, after announcing the closure of Shanganagh Castle, he pointed out that it always had a strong focus on education, and he intended that the money raised from its sale would go to a new closed prison for 16 to 17-year-olds and also to a halfway house for those juveniles when they are freed. This is a perfect instance of ringfencing something for a very good cause.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry's proposal if implemented would not establish a precedent. When I became a Member of this House ten years ago I recall being involved in a debate involving the prison service, and asking myself what the purpose of a prison was. One of the answers I came up with was to protect society, another was to act as a deterrent and certainly as a form of punishment. Another answer was rehabilitation. We were talking about normal prisons for normal criminals &ndash; but what happens when we come to the mentally ill? That is surely a much bigger challenge, one we must face up to.</P>
    <P>The Government's heart is in the right place, going by what the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, has said. The Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill 2002, which will be coming to this House shortly, will set up a mental health review board which will monitor those people detained by virtue of the &ldquo;not guilty by reason of insanity&rdquo; clause or the &ldquo;unfit to be tried&rdquo; provision. They will monitor them every six months and will then decide what is to be done with them, if they are to be released or sent to court. If the board decides that the people concerned need ongoing care and treatment as in-patients, where are we to put them? We will not have Shanganagh Prison, which is for juveniles. Are we to put them back into the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum?</P>
    <P>Senator Henry has visited it and knows the situation. I have not been there, but such a decision would not stand up to reason. We owe something to society, but we also owe something to those people who are criminally mentally ill. If we are to allocate money, I urge the Government that this money should be ringfenced for this purpose. As Senator Henry noted, we all have our favourite areas for this money, but in this case I second Senator Henry's proposal and believe it is worthy of consideration. Not only do we owe it to the State and its citizens to do this, we also owe it to those who are criminally insane and may have no <Col N="1223" />other chance in life than this. I urge the Minister of State to accept Senator Henry's motion.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Seanad Éireann confirms its support for the proposal of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance to use funds raised by the sale of Office of Public Works (OPW) property at Lad Lane in Dublin in the manner set out by him in his recent statement namely: the funding of fit-out works for regional office space taken by Office of Public Works for the National Educational Psychology Service to accelerate the expansion of the service; the purchase of leaseholds of properties currently occupied by the state on a long term/permanent basis to reduce the ongoing Office of Public Works rent roll into the future; the purchase of sites for the Garda building programme to accelerate the provision of new Garda stations across the country; to provide additional funding towards the Garda maintenance programme to improve the working conditions at many Garda stations throughout the country.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I warmly welcome the Minister of State to the House, fresh from a successful party conference. We have managed to work together very well over the past five or six years and I look forward to doing so in the future, despite any suggestion there may be to the contrary.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the matter that Senator Henry has brought up. Other colleagues of mine will respond in more detail on the health matters. It is a hybrid motion, relating to finance and health. Nonetheless, on the health aspect, I have no doubt whatsoever of the priority we have to give to the improvement of physical and mental disability services. I am not personally familiar with the Central Mental Hospital but from all I have read about it during the years, and from what I have heard this evening from Senator Henry, it all suggests &ndash; without casting any aspersions on the good work there, as I am referring only to the hospital's facilities &ndash; that it is not something which in its present state we can be terribly proud of.</P>
      <P>I support the spirit of what Senator Henry intends, and I understand that the various authorities in the Eastern Area Health Board, the Departments of Justice Equality and Law Reform and of Health and Children and others have been working together and have produced reports involving plans to refurbish, modernise and extend the hospital building, and indeed to provide a new residence on the campus. It is clear that this is regarded as a priority, and I am sure that when the plans are ready, plans which have in principle been accepted, this will proceed and be given the proper priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my experience of Government, working <Col N="1224" />obviously as a public servant, decisions on spending priorities in different areas are not taken arbitrarily by a few people. A great deal of preparation, study and groundwork goes into such decisions. Government nevertheless does not have a monopoly of wisdom, and it is important to hear from all sides of the Oireachtas what particular priorities are.</P>
    <P>Having some finance background, I would be temperamentally opposed to ringfencing appropriations that come from one area and transferring them to another. The Office of Public Works, which at one time had a particular reputation, in recent years enjoys a very high reputation in Government as being a very efficient and dynamic organisation. It has had resources in the past ten or 12 years which it did not have before and it has done an enormous amount of good work in the management and refurbishing of property. We see the effects in, for example, refurbished courthouses. A comment was made earlier in this debate regarding improvements that have been made in prisons, and we need such improvements in the areas that Senator Henry has spoken about too. From my experience of working with successive Taoisigh, whose Department has maintained close contact with the Office of Public Works, I am aware of the significant amount of work carried out by the Office of Public Works on refurbishing and cleaning up these premises, Government Buildings and other locations around the country. However, I have to disagree with Senator Henry on one point. Many Garda stations are in an unsatisfactory condition.</P>

      <P>One cannot compare oranges and lemons. There are many priorities in several different areas. One might suggest stopping the road building programme and divert all that money elsewhere. Government has to decide on a balance between different priorities. As I understand it, work on the Central Mental Hospital is under way and a committee has reported. As regards Garda stations, the Minister of State will be aware that I have some interest in a Garda station which has been abandoned in County Tipperary and which a number of social organisations wish to use. Some decisions in this area await the keenly anticipated decentralisation programme, to which reference has been made from all sides of the House within the last 24 hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I thank Senator Henry for introducing this motion, which I support. Comments have been made about the Office of Public Works which, I accept, has carried out many great projects around the country. However, the Office of Public Works has squandered vast financial resources over many years. In some instances, there is a strong case for public private partner<Col N="1225" />ships involving the Office of Public Works which currently has five or six sites for sale. Although I have never been to an asylum, I have visited a prison. Castlerea Prison is regarded as one of the most modern, compassionate prisons and is supposed to be drug free.</P>
      <P>I am trying to visualise the situation in the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, and I have been informed that Mountjoy Prison is a hundred times worse. I find it difficult to make an accurate comparison with the asylum. Senators have described it as a 19th century building where a 21st century building is required. The inmates have no social partnership representation, no vocal lobby and no friend in Cabinet. As public representatives, we have certain responsibilities. As Senator Henry rightly stated, all of us may have our own views as to how money should be allocated. In this instance, however, the required funding is relatively minimal and should be ring-fenced for the Central Mental Hospital.</P>
      <P>The Government may have put plans in place but those plans have been allowed to remain in abeyance indefinitely. If we expect any compassion or forgiveness for our neglect of the people in the institution in question over the years, I urge that we now ring-fence the funding in accordance with Senator Henry's proposal. If we can have agreement on one matter as the Seanad approaches its Easter recess, I hope it will be on the basis of support for Senator Henry's motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley" hpid="Mr. Dooley Mr. Dooley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my colleagues in welcoming the Minister of State to the House. He has been here on a number of occasions and his willingness to make himself available is welcome. I support the courageous initiative he has undertaken and on which action has been needed for a long time. The Office of Public Works has a considerable asset bank. At a time when it is essential to ensure that all elements of financial management are under control, it is critical to sweat those State-owned assets. Any review of State property is likely to give rise to the disposal of elements which are not of immediate use because of geographic location. The first property the Minister of State intends to put up for tender is the facility at Lad Lane. Due to its location and the zoning of the area, there is an opportunity to realise a substantial amount of money for the State. We do not have a precise figure, nor do I expect the Minister of State to quantify it at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that money realised from the disposal of an asset should not be squandered or diverted into current spending initiatives by the Department of Finance. I share Senator Henry's objection to any approach of that nature but that is not what the Minister of State has in mind as, no doubt, he will outline to the House. In recent statements, he has indicated his intentions with regard to the first tranche of the proceeds. That is reflected in Senator Mansergh's proposed amendment, which I second, notably the pro<Col N="1226" />vision with regard to fit-out works for regional office space taken by the Office of Public Works for the National Educational Psychology Service to accelerate the expansion of the service. That is a worthwhile project for which the use of this funding is appropriate.</P>
    <P>The purchase of leaseholds is also part of a process of consolidation of the overall property portfolio. Provided that the money is re-invested in the property portfolio, that is a positive approach which ensures that the State is not incurring a financial loss on the sale of its assets or taking a short-term view of asset disposal. The purchase of sites for new Garda stations is particularly important. I listened with interest to Senator Henry's discussion with Senator Mansergh as to the relative conditions of Garda stations and the Central Mental Hospital. I admit that I have not visited the Central Mental Hospital but I have visited quite a number of Garda stations &ndash; in an observer capacity, I should add.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan" hpid="Mr. Feighan Mr. Feighan">

    <Speaker pid="TimDooley" hpid="Mr. Dooley Mr. Dooley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
      <P>In my constituency, there are many Garda stations in need of repair. That has come about over a period of time, particularly in some outlying areas where gardaí are no longer resident in local stations but use them as office space. Some stations are in poor condition. Just as in the case of schools, which have been the subject of much discussion, there are also Garda stations in immediate and urgent need of repair. I am delighted the Minister of State is moving ahead in that regard, as well as providing new buildings. We have had a great deal of debate in recent weeks on the state of the nation in terms of crime. Many Senators called for action by the Garda on maintaining law and order. We must also have regard for the basic requirements of gardaí in carrying out their duties by ensuring they have proper facilities in which to operate. We will not provide them with that if we do not put a programme of refurbishment in place along with the building of new stations. In that context, I agree with the Minister of State's proposals.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Henry indicated, the services provided in Dundrum are vital and a recent report has recognised the need to have the facilities upgraded. Since 1999, just &euro;500,000 has been pumped into its maintenance, which is a small amount of money considering that the facility houses some 70 to 80 people and that some 160 people are admitted there on an annual basis. The facilities are in need of funding and I call on the Minister of State to consider providing it. I do not necessarily believe in the concept of ring-fencing in this case because a project team in place, which is going through the design and redevelopment of the unit. To ring-fence the money now, would effectively leave it aside when it could be better used or at least used in advance. I am sure Senator Henry would agree and I would like to see is a commitment that, when the <Col N="1227" />design team has got to a point of making a recommendation and we get ready to build such a facility&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand it has been reviewed in recent times. There is a need to ensure that it is provided. Despite the fact that people in the facility do not have friends, as legislators, it is incumbent on us not to see ourselves legislating only for those who have their freedom. It has more to do with the people who need our assistance. The dignity and quality of their lives is of importance to us and I am sure the Minister of State will be forthcoming in providing the finance necessary for the re-design and development of this facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon" hpid="Mr. Bannon Mr. Bannon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. Senator Mansergh referred to what should and should not be priorities of Government. The first priority of any Government should be the health and well-being of all citizens. It is provided for in the Constitution that we cherish all of our citizens equally. I am unhappy with conditions in many of our mental health institutions and, from time to time, the condition of buildings is a topic for discussion on radio and television programmes and in the local media. The buildings in many parts of the country belong to a different era, having been built by a different Administration and they have been outdated for many years.</P>
      <P>I compliment Senator Henry on tabling this motion. I am a member of the visiting committee of a health board and I am often not happy with the admission units where patients sometimes spend two or three weeks for assessment. They are not pleasant places and they should be more welcoming. A stigma is attached to admission units and the issue should be examined in great detail, because, as Senator Henry said, we owe it to our people.</P>
      <P>Many elderly patients in mental institutions have been there for a lifetime and they often have no friends or family and perhaps have Alzheimer's disease. These institutions are the wrong place for such people and every effort should be made by the authorities to move them to more warm, welcoming institutions such as nursing homes. This is happening in some health board areas, but it should be national policy. The only friends in whom patients can often confide are the staff. I join other Senators in complimenting the staff of mental institutions who have often worked beyond their duty. It should be a priority of Government to look after the health needs of our citizens. God knows when anyone can be afflicted with mental illness, to which an unfair stigma attaches and which is, after all, a health condition. I wholeheartedly support Senator Henry's motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD" hpid="Mr. Parlon Mr. Parlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the property plans of the Office of Public Works and I thank Independent Senators for proposing the debate.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works is 150 years old and in that time a substantial portfolio in excess of 1,800 properties has been acquired by the State. It is a rich tapestry which includes everything from small rural Garda stations to large urban office blocks, from small Garda quarters to Farmleigh Estate, from sites of little monetary value to those which are worth millions of euro.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of the 21st century, there was a need to take strategic look at the future of the State property portfolio and examine ways to ensure that we always have a modern and dynamic State infrastructure. In many instances, what was state-of-the-art 40 years ago is now creaking at the seams and some properties that were in full usage at that time are now lying idle. I decided to implement a new approach to ensure that the maximum value was extracted from the State property portfolio. In the past there was a non-commercial approach to State property. However, there is little point in having huge tracts of State land lying idle when it could be put to profitable use for the country.</P>
      <P>The first step in the process of transforming State assets commenced with a full audit of the property portfolio. This was a comprehensive look at the status and value of all the properties and it acts as a guidebook to the hidden value of State property. Following this, I launched the transforming State assets initiative in March of this year. The objective of the programme is to transform the State property portfolio by extracting maximum value. The programme will include straight sell-offs of sites, public private partnerships, joint ventures and land swap deals. It will include a regional mix and a focus on both large urban, small urban and rural sites. Its objective is for value gained from the process to be reinvested in new State infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The first site offered in the programme is a classic example of the latent potential that exists in the State property portfolio. In the swinging sixties, if any of us remember them&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD" hpid="Mr. Parlon Mr. Parlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just barely around then. I have poor recollection, so I will not name any of the Senators who might have a better recollection than me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the swinging sixties, the building maintenance service of the Office of Public Works needed to be in Dublin 2, close to Government Departments where the majority of its work resided. For it to have been located elsewhere would have been inefficient. If we fast-forward to the beginning of this millennium, the argument has come full-circle. In 2003, it is no longer efficient for a builder's yard to operate from a one acre prime <Col N="1229" />residential site between the canal and Baggot Street. In order to unlock the latent potential in this property, I moved the building maintenance service, at a small cost, to a better premises at Collins Barracks.</P>
    <P>We are selling the prime residential site in Lad Lane and making a direct link with the property portfolio by re-investing the proceeds in upgrading other State property and investing in other programmes. All the projects in which I am investing and properties I am proposing to sell are within the Office of Public Works's narrow remit. The Office of Public Works does not have control over all State properties.</P>
    <P>The four key areas identified for reinvestment are the funding of fit-out works for regional office space taken by Office of Public Works for the National Educational Psychology Service &ndash; this will accelerate the expansion of the service; the purchase of leaseholds of properties currently occupied by the State on a long-term-permanent basis &ndash; this will reduce the ongoing Office of Public Works rent roll into the future; and the purchase of sites for the Garda building programme to accelerate the provision of new Garda stations across the country and to provide additional funding towards the Garda maintenance programme. This will improve the working conditions at many Garda stations.</P>
    <P>The National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, provides psychological services in primary and post-primary schools. The mission of NEPS is to help students to develop to their potential and maximise the benefits of their educational experiences. In the early years of the development of the service, priority is being given to children who have learning disabilities. The money earned from the sale of the Lad Lane site will provide a much needed boost to this social service. We will provide investment for offices and building accommodation where children with disabilities can meet with psychologists.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need to modernise our community security infrastructure through maintaining existing Garda stations and building new ones. This year, &euro;11 million has been allocated to new Garda stations throughout the country. This will see the completion of some projects, the fit-out of completed stations and the turning of the sod on nine new Garda stations. In addition, &euro;2 million has been allocated this year for the maintenance of Garda buildings. The targeted input from the sale of the Lad Lane site will make a significant extra impact on maintenance of existing stations and the building of new ones.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that this year the Office of Public Works will spend in excess of &euro;100 million on renting accommodation for Government Departments. The corresponding figure for the year 2000 was &euro;55 million. Thus, the overall cost of renting accommodation has increased by more than 80%. The plan to use some proceeds from the sale of Lad lane to buy out the leasehold interests in some of the properties rented by the Office of <Col N="1230" />Public Works will go towards containing the growth in the rental bill.</P>
    <P>The second phase of the programme is one of the most significant property developments ever in Dublin city and will transform the western entrance to it. The half a billion euro development, when completed, will incorporate some 1.5 million square feet of office, residential, cultural and recreational space. Phase one of this development will be completed in a joint venture between the Office of Public Works and Eircom. The residential element of the total project amounts to 650 apartments and the development will make full provision for 20% social and affordable housing. When completed this development will be home to some 1,500 people and workspace to some 5,000 others.</P>
    <P>This development will take place on a 14-acre site close to Heuston Station which is an under-utilised warehouse space for the Office of Public Works and Eircom. With vision and imagination we will turn a concrete yard, sheds, weeds and thistles into one of the most exciting urban regeneration projects in the history of the State. When the entire development is undertaken, the full 14-acre site is expected to yield some &euro;100 million, 75% of which will revert to the State. This is what transforming State assets is about &ndash; taking land and properties that have outlived their usefulness and transforming them into an asset for the benefit of the State.</P>
    <P>Regarding the issue raised by Senator Henry, the use of money from the sale of Office of Public Works property to build a new Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum, I am informed that the Central Mental Hospital admits approximately 150 patients per year, the majority from the prison system. As the prison population has expanded in recent years, the services of the Central Mental Hospital have come under increasing pressure, resulting in delays in the transfer of mentally ill prisoners to the hospital.</P>
    <P>The shortage of in-patient psychiatric beds for prisoners was commented upon by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, CPT, during its recent visit to Ireland. In response to the concerns expressed by the CPT and with a view to eliminating delays in the provision of in-patient psychiatric care to prisoners, the Government established a special committee to draw up a service level agreement on the admission of mentally ill prisoners to the Central Mental Hospital. There is an acceptance on all sides that the physical conditions at the Central Mental Hospital are unsatisfactory. As has been pointed out by the Inspector of Mental Hospitals on numerous occasions, most of the old building is quite unsatisfactory for its current purpose and conditions in some parts of it are unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Since 1999, &euro;500,000 has been spent on the refurbishment of the hospital but there is an acceptance by all parties that a more substantial redevelopment is required. In December 2000, the East Coast Area Health Board, in conjunc<Col N="1231" />tion with the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Health and Children established a group to advise on proposals for the future of the Central Mental Hospital. They took into account national and regional services provided by the hospital, linkages with community psychiatric services and with the criminal justice system, new mental health legislation, the training role of the Central Mental Hospital for medical, nursing and paramedical staff and future accommodation and resource requirements. The group concluded its work last year and its report was submitted to the Eastern Regional Health Authority and to the Department of Health and Children. The report includes plans to modernise, refurbish and extend the existing building at the Central Mental Hospital and to provide a new residence on the campus.</P>
    <P>The Minister of Health and Children has accepted, in principle, the main thrust of the report of the review group and requested that the East Coast Area Health Board establish a project team to progress the matter as quickly as possible. The project team had its inaugural meeting on the 19 February 2003 and its remit will be to examine critically all options for the redevelopment of the hospital; to put together a design brief for the redevelopment; and to examine various financing options, including the possibility of a public-private partnership.</P>
    <P>The examination of the State property portfolio by the Office of Public Works with a view to identifying vacant, under-utilised, under-developed or surplus property is well under way. The process has produced a number of properties deemed suitable for detailed assessment to determine their potential for disposal or redevelopment. In assessing these particular properties, a range of considerations is being taken into account, including the planning issues in the context of their development potential; their overall condition; the extent to which decisions on decentralisation might impact on them &ndash; we will not be selling off any property that may become a site for a decentralised Department; the alternative uses to which they might be put, including the possibility of their being used for housing purposes, and their market value.</P>
    <P>The sale of Lad Lane and other properties in the Office of Public Works property portfolio is in line with the Government decision on the 2003 Departmental expenditure Estimates. As the Office of Public Works is not responsible for the funding of hospitals, it is not proposed to divert proceeds from the sale of Office of Public Works properties to fund Department of Health and Children projects. The funding of hospitals is primarily the responsibility of that Department and it is up to it to see if the necessary funding for the Dundrum hospital can be afforded within the financial parameters that it must operate.</P>
    <P>My remit is narrow. I do not have any control over properties which come under other Depart<Col N="1232" />ments. The Department of Health and Children and the health boards have substantial properties and lands. That is not the business of the Office of Public Works and neither are the lands which come within the remit of the Minister for Transport, be it through CIE or otherwise.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry cited a figure which recently appeared in the media. She should be careful about how she reads such media reports. I was asked this week, when undertaking our Office of Public Works annual report, what I saw as the likely outcome of sales this year. I said I could not tell. I was asked if it could be &euro;100 million and I said that would be an ambitious target. The article concerned suggested the figure would be &euro;100 million and quoted me as saying it would be ambitious.</P>
    <P>As regards the announcement which appeared in today's newspapers regarding the new site near Heuston Station, that project could realise &euro;75 million over the next five years but it depends on acceptance of our plans and deals to be done at a future date. This is not a goldmine by any means. Like every other ministerial Department, adjustments were made to the Estimates I submitted this year. I have a great deal of responsibility in four areas, two of which are the new offices for NEPS and the refurbishment of Garda stations.</P>
    <P>I accept the Senator's apt description of Dundrum. One could say the same about Garda stations throughout the country from a safety point of view. I have decided to make my own efficiencies and to spend my allocation as best I can to give the best service within Office of Public Works. I cannot go beyond that remit.</P>

      <P>Not wanting to be flippant, I enjoy the way Government uses different sets of units to magnify things. For instance, the new motorway being built in Senator Glynn's area is described by the NRA in kilometres because of course it makes it sound longer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State spent years doing that and he knows he has impressed me. <Col N="1233" />We have had many an interesting and lively discussion in other fora. I do not agree with the Minister of State about many issues but I have a very high opinion of him. That is entirely possible and I enjoy such relations with many people.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed at the tone of the Minister of State's response, and it is not necessarily his fault. I have not read everything the Minister of State has said about this programme which is designed to make sure the most efficient use of any buildings and land assets in the State's possession. That is a tautology, it goes without saying we should do that.</P>
      <P>I hope at some stage he will do the equivalent of what Gordon Brown did in Britain, that is, produce a full portfolio of what the State owns. I am not sure that anybody knows what precisely the State owns, although it is probably all recorded somewhere. It would be a good start, if we are to sell assets, to find out what we have before we start selling. Keeping such a portfolio up to date would pose no difficulty, particularly with the help of modern information technology, once it was formalised and put together first.</P>
      <P>Of course assets should be re-used and looked at. Contrary to what people think, I do not have a huge ideological issue about the efficient use of State assets. They should be used in the way that works most efficiently for the benefit of the community, sometimes by the State retaining them and sometimes by the State selling them because there are different ways of getting the value out of them. However, it would be close to being entirely foolish to sell off land which potentially could be used for building houses. That would be my opinion. It is very difficult to see how the State could be better off in terms of anything to do with the provision of housing by selling off land which could be used for that purpose.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go too far down that road because the real issue here is the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum. The suggestion of a way of funding it is a good idea and it is a bit disappointing to hear, from the Minister of State's speech, that the review started in December 2000. This is not a greenfield issue. The world is awash with reports, both official and unofficial, about the conditions in the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum. In my own involvement with the Simon Community in Cork, which is where most of my time with the organisation was spent, one of the issues with which I was familiar from people in the Dublin Simon Community was the condition of the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum. That was a long time ago &ndash; 20 years.</P>
      <P>A group set up in December 2000 concluded its work last year, the Minister has accepted its report in principle and the project team has met. However, I do not see anywhere in the Minister of State's speech a statement about funding this project. I see proposals to work out what would be needed, to look at alternatives, to put together a brief and to look at various finance options, but so far there is no assurance that anything will be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1234" />Of all the areas of the health service, the psychiatric services is the area which will only benefit if politicians of all parties take them very seriously because there never will be an external public lobby on the psychiatric services, for the obvious reason mentioned by Senator Bannon. If I need heart surgery and cannot get into a public hospital, I will climb up on every platform at every meeting and say that I needed surgery and could not get it. If I need admission for depression, even if I recover perfectly I will not be getting up on public platforms to say I could not get treatment for my depression because there were no beds in the psychiatric hospitals. In spite of all our rhetoric, we still do not see psychiatric illness as just another illness. In spite of all that we have learnt, there are a huge number of overtones.</P>
    <P>Therefore reform of the physical infrastructure of centres like the Central Mental Hospital will only come about because of the hard work of the staff in letting us know about the conditions and because of a political decision made because it is the right thing to do, not because there will be huge public adulation for it. One would hope that the criticisms of international bodies would at least focus the attention of Government on this issue.</P>
    <P>The truth is that, as in all our psychiatric services, there are superb people working in the Central Mental Hospital. Psychiatry is a very difficult and demanding area in which to work, and it is also emotionally demanding. To work in physical conditions of the kind that exist in the Central Mental Hospital must be an even greater burden on people. As I said previously to the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, I am reluctant to make the sort of political speech about the psychiatric services or about the Central Mental Hospital that I would about many other areas because I do believe we need to build a strong political consensus that these are right things to do because they are needed. The Government will get no extra votes for refurbishing the Central Mental Hospital and it will lose no votes for not doing it, but I happen to believe, whatever I might say politically from time to time, that there are enough decent people in all the political parties to recognise that this is an issue which needs to be prioritised.</P>
    <P>Whether the funds come from the Office of Public Works or out of general tax revenue is an interesting debate, and this suggestion is interesting, but the fundamental issue is that if we want to be able to look ourselves in the eye, we must do something about institutions like that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak to this motion. When we speak about psychiatric institutions there would have to be a consensus that in terms of a shelter which provides a service, the Central Mental Hospital is unsatisfactory. It is also important to note that, prior to last February, the first Minister ever to visit the Central Mental Hospital was the Minister for Health and <Col N="1235" />Children, Deputy Martin. That speaks volumes. That tells it all in a nutshell.</P>
      <P>As I happen to be a member of a health board, I had better declare my interest. I had better declare a further interest in that I am a former psychiatric nurse and therefore know a little of what all this is about.</P>
      <P>We must be very careful in speaking about the facility known as the Central Mental Hospital as against the care provided there. In fairness to the staff, there is quite a range of services provided. I will talk about the standard of the facility in a moment.</P>
      <P>The service currently provides the highest known national rate of transfer from prison to hospital of any jurisdiction. A multidisciplinary team approach to care is being developed, with the hospital providing an active programme of assessment and rehabilitation geared towards each patient's needs. That is as good as one will get in any psychiatric setting and I have no reason to believe that is not the case.</P>
      <P>Individual care plans are in use addressing the physical, psychological, interpersonal and social needs of the patient. Rehabilitation is encouraged through the use of the hospital school, woodwork, industrial therapy and recreation departments. There are daily clinics in the prisons in the Dublin area, while community psychiatric nurses provide liaison supports to the prisons and the community mental health services. That is the situation in most psychiatric sector areas. Out-patient facilities are provided at Ushers Island in Dublin city centre. The hospital has a gymnasium and a swimming pool. I could go on.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Senator Bannon, spoke about other psychiatric hospitals. However, when planning the future of psychiatric services commenced, there was uproar over the closure of psychiatric wards. Some argued that it should not happen, that too many lights were turned off and there were too many dark windows at night. The important thing, however, is that the patients were going to a better care setting. It is about the people who are there and those who are providing the service.</P>
      <P>Community care might be a more expensive service but there are differences of opinion even about that. Professor Alan Maynard of York University says it is more expensive, but other experts will tell one it is cheaper. I prefer to believe Professor Maynard. When, with the stroke of a pen, the word &ldquo;psycho&rdquo; was split from &ldquo;psycho-geriatric&rdquo;, the staff of certain geriatric hospitals were the first to object that they would be sent to geriatric settings. The Constitution refers to cherishing all our children equally, but I regret to say that psychiatric patients have often been treated as second-class citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with what the Minister intends to do with resources that are surplus to requirement. What sort of criticism could we expect from Seán and Mary Citizen if we allow great facilities to moulder and gather dust while other facilities are <Col N="1236" />urgently required? This was outlined in the amendment and, in fairness, by Senator Henry. We would be responsible for this. The Minister, by paying a formal visit to the hospital and establishing a project team from such a broad spectrum, has indicated that he is serious about what he is saying. I thank Senator Ryan for putting that on the record because I believe he is right. Over the coming months, we will hear what the project team has to say.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooley made an important point when he said that ring-fencing was not the best idea. If we agree that the redevelopment of the Central Mental Hospital site &ndash; one of the oldest services of that nature in the British Isles &ndash; is urgently needed, which it is, how do we go about it? The Minister has dealt with this in a way that is the accepted norm when it comes to providing capital projects in the public service.</P>
    <P>We must continue to focus on this important service. We need to devolve more resources to the psychiatric services. If anybody thinks the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, is wrong in his approach, all he or she has to do is to walk down the banks of the Royal Canal and see how many derelict lock houses there are. These are beautiful stone structures, worth quite an amount, and in most cases they come with between three quarters of an acre and an acre of land. God only knows who owns them at this stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on this issue and I want to record my appreciation to the staff who provide such an excellent service in adverse conditions in the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum. Far too often over the years, even before I went into the psychiatric service, there have been reports from visiting committees in local newspapers in which the staff were objects of derision. It is not the job of a nurse, a nursing assistant or a doctor to paint walls or do woodwork, but they carried the blame when it was not done. I resent that because it has been the case for far too long. Although the conditions in the hospital are far from ideal, an excellent service has been provided in adverse conditions. As Government spokesperson on this issue in the House, I record my appreciation of their work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators from all sides of the House who took a sympathetic approach to the problem I was trying to explain to the Minister of State. I also thank the Minister of State for his approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I echo what Senator Glynn said about the staff of the Central Mental Hospital. The conditions are bad for the patients, but they are just as bad for the staff. They must also endure them. To try to ensure a therapeutic milieu in a place like that is verging on the impossible. What they are trying to do is unbelievable &ndash; I do not know how they manage it. One former director of the hospital left after about ten years because, as he told me, he felt such a failure for not persuading us politicians to do something about the conditions. That was years ago. Senator Ryan rightly said <Col N="1237" />that if we do something about it, there are no votes in it, but if we do not, there are also no votes. By &ldquo;we&rdquo; I mean the Government, but we all have some responsibility in this matter.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Minister of State does not feel he could fund my hospital. However, I am not totally defeated because he brought up the matter of public private partnerships, as I did when I spoke. This is how some big psychiatric hospitals in the UK have been funded. I do not know whether it is necessarily the best way, but it should be considered. In fact, it is not a good idea, because we are already trying to cut down on rents and mortgages being paid by the State, but we may still have to consider it because, as I said earlier, the Minister for Health and Children has no money. We must get money somehow.</P>
    <P>I am most anxious that money from the sale of public assets could leak into the general coffers of the Department of Finance. This is why I mentioned ring-fencing. Nobody spoke against selling off property that is not being used. It is ridiculous to keep something as an empty monument. Senator Mansergh was clever to get in his bid for the local Garda station for his community groups. I am not picking out the Garda as being undeserving of having their buildings renovated or replaced, but gardaí would be some of those most sympathetic to the need to rebuild the Central Mental Hospital because they must bring patients to that institution.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Government could not allow the motion to go forward, at least as a pious hope. The amendment, at least, explains what is to happen to the Lad Lane money, but there should be far more suggestions put forward about what is to happen to all the money that will come from these sales. I appreciate that the press is inclined to exaggerate in whatever direction it likes, but there should be more openness in terms of the projects we can support. Perhaps the Department could consider once again the possibility of a public private partnership in Dundrum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, to the House on a very important issue relating to my county of Longford. I have brought this motion on social inclusion programme cut<Col N="1238" />backs affecting Longford Community Resources before the House because I want the Minister to explain how he can justify his inhumane destruction of the work community groups are doing to provide support for the disadvantaged, in this case, in County Longford.</P>
      <P>My colleagues and I continually bring the appalling injustices perpetrated by the Government, to the attention of the Seanad. Unbelievably, the Government expects the less well off and disadvantaged to make up for its mismanagement of public funds. Even by its standards, however, it is beyond belief that, in four and a half months, a 6% budget cutback has become a 20% funding cut. It is heartbreaking to think the valuable work that Longford Community Resources does in County Longford on services, projects and training, is being terminated and that the weakest and least vocal are suffering the consequences.</P>
      <P>To cut support to early school leavers, the long-term unemployed, lone parents, small farmers, Travellers, the disabled and the elderly in a county, two thirds of which has CLÁR and RAPID status, is totally unacceptable. Longford Community Resources has been presented with a cutback to its budget of &euro;173,000. This will affect every community group throughout the county. It will affect not only its services to the disadvantaged, but initiatives from the ICA, tourism promotion and parish groups will also be hit. Longford Community Resources had, as it thought, secured funding for a three-year period to the end of 2003 and had allocated budgets to a variety of community programmes and initiatives on that basis.</P>
      <P>While &euro;60,000 was announced for a new community development project, which was actually sanctioned four and a half years ago, Longford Community Resources received details of cuts of &euro;173,000 from its 2003 budget. The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs funds both the community development project and Longford Community Resources. So it would appear that the Department has given a little and taken a lot. Did the Minister really think that the announcement of a small donation would cloud the greater issue of this extraordinary cutback?</P>
      <P>As the festive season of Easter approaches, I hope the Minister will reconsider his decision and give back to Longford Community Resources what it deserves. This money was promised and community initiatives are waiting to be developed. We must acknowledge the great voluntary contribution made by members of many committees throughout the county and I do not want to see their efforts dashed. I appeal to the Minister, on behalf of all Longford people, to rescind this decision if at all possible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Senator for giving me an oppor<Col N="1239" />tunity to put the facts on the record tonight. An amount of &euro;44.6 million has been provided in the Vote of my Department for the local development programme in 2003. This figure represents a reduction of 6% in the local development subhead over the amount provided in the Estimates in 2002. I emphasise the reduction is 6%.</P>
    <P>In 2001 and 2002, the funding under this subhead was &euro;45.5 million and &euro;47.6 million respectively for the three sub-measures of the programme. The outturn of expenditure was &euro;43.2 million in 2001 and &euro;53.6 million in 2002. Towards the end of 2002, ADM approached my Department. As there were some savings in my Department in December 2002 we gave ADM an extra allocation of &euro;6 million. ADM has supplied a copy of the letter that indicated Longford Community Resources was allocated an amount of up to &euro;2,399,805 for the period from 2001 to 2003, which equates to &euro;799,935 per annum. This year it is getting &euro;743,940, a 7% reduction on the annualised amount. The amount received by any partnership is a matter for ADM, which is independent of the Department and handles the whole subhead.</P>
    <P>Recently the board of ADM agreed the allocations to each partnership and community group it funds. As the Senator will appreciate, given that there was a 6% cut in its overall budget, the total amount it can give this year is 6% less. It is a matter for ADM to decide how it distributes that to the various groups. I understand it decided to reduce the funding of each group by between 4% and 7%, depending on the annual budget of the partnership company. No partnership was cut by less than 4% or more than 7%.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1240" />In recent weeks I have frequently heard people talk of huge cutbacks referred to by the Senator. Apparently this comes from the an expectation that money, which was not spent in the first two years of the programme, could be carried over to the last year, which is this year. Under the European programme that preceded this, that was possible. As the Senator will be aware, all unspent money in every Department at the end of a year reverts to the Exchequer, so the idea of multi-annual funding on that basis does not exist. My Department operates on a cash-based accounting system and not on an accruals basis. Since the Department cannot carry forward the money, there was never a question of the partnerships being able to carry forward unspent amounts and accrue them into the third year of the programme.</P>
    <P>It is important to distinguish between, on one hand, commitments of partnerships and community groups and what they thought they might get or supposed carryovers and, on the other, unpaid liabilities &ndash; bills in hand &ndash; at the end of the year that had to be brought forward from 2002 to 2003. Net unpaid liabilities being brought forward by partnerships this year are quite modest and are of the order of &euro;600,000 cumulative between them. I understand some partnerships also have cash balances.</P>
    <P>With the &euro;44.6 million provided for the programme this year, the partnerships will be able to continue with a full programme. I have discussed this with ADM, which is working with the partnerships to minimise as far as possible the impact of the 6% cut in funding this year.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 7.30 p.m. until 2.30&nbsp;p.m. on Wednesday, 7 May 2003.</P>
