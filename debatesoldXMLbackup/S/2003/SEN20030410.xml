      <P>The Order of Business is No. 2, Official Languages (Equality) Bill 2002 &ndash; Committee Stage (resumed), to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business until 1.30 p.m.; No. 3, Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003 (Seanad Bill amended by the Dáil) &ndash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken on the conclusion of No. 2 or at 1.30 p.m., if No. 2 is not concluded earlier, and to be concluded not later than 2.30 p.m.; No. 4, motion for earlier Signature of the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003 (Seanad Bill amended by the Dáil), to be taken immediately without debate on the conclusion of No. 3; and Nos. 5 and 6 are to be taken together for the purposes of debate on the conclusion of No. 4. Nos. 5 and 6 relate to the appointment, by the President, of Ms Emily O'Reilly to the offices of Ombudsman and Information Commissioner. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, will open the debate, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed five minutes. The debate will be of 40 minutes duration, the same length of time accorded to it in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. B. Hayes: I oppose the Order of Business on several grounds. It is an absolute joke that we are to be asked to discuss the changes that the Dáil has made to the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003 in one hour's debate. I understand that there are 27 amendments to the Bill. That is not the way to do business. It is not the Leader's fault but that of Standing Orders. My party's spokesperson and those of other parties are to be allowed to make only one response to the 27 amendments. On that basis, we oppose both the Order of Business and the way in which the Government is moving the motion for Earlier Signature. In effect, the a guillotine is being applied to the President who is being told to &ldquo;Sign this, or else&rdquo;. I ask the Leader, even at this late stage, to reconsider the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>Yesterday we all witnessed the scenes in the Iraqi capital Baghdad following the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime. Whatever the views of Members of both Houses on the war, and its legitimacy or otherwise, I hope we can all agree that the future of Iraq belongs to its people. We all <Col N="978" />wish that there will soon be no Americans in Iraq and that Saddam Hussein, the Ba'ath Socialist Party and all the trappings of the regime will be gone. The Iraqis are a proud people with considerable talents in a country rich in resources. We hope that such a future can be achieved.</P>
    <P>The future to which I refer would be best realised where the United Nations is centrally involved in planning with the Iraqi people. The Irish Defence Forces have particular knowledge and expertise in terms of building the capacity for a peaceful and secure future for people in countries such as Iraq. Ireland should be part of any successful United Nations force deployed in Iraq the coming months. We have specific knowledge in peacekeeping and peace-making. The Iraqi people and the people of the region would welcome help from the Government and the Defence Forces. It is something we should debate.</P>
    <P>The Leader will be aware that some of her colleagues want to gag her and her parliamentary colleagues. We will not have the Leader of the House driven underground. She is in no way an endangered species. If that happens, she will find great defence on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Toole: Senator Brian Hayes took the words out of my mouth. I have been extremely upset about this since this morning and have already had words with the chairman of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party, good Louth man that he is. I am appalled to think that whatever drove the Government to this stopping, blocking and stemming of information which led to the extraordinary amendments to the Freedom of Information Act has extended to the parliamentary party where the new rule is that people will no longer be in control of what they say. We say to our colleagues in Fianna Fáil that this is appalling. We will probably have to listen to the Progressive Democrats for the view of the Government from now on because those in Fianna Fáil will be put down and put to sleep if they speak out of turn. If we can be of any assistance in this matter&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mr. Leyden: Like the ICTU.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Toole: We saw how Fianna Fáil Members were gagged during the passage of the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill and, now that the Government got away with that, it is trying to say the same to parliamentary party members about internal party affairs. Before long, it will be able to send statues to the Chamber.</P>
    <P>An Leas-Chathaoirleach: Is the Senator looking for a debate on the matter?</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Toole: A constitutional issue is involved, especially for this House because constitutionally it recognises groups rather than parties. It is unacceptable for an external force such as the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party to try to gag the duly and democratically elected members who happen to take the Fianna Fáil Whip in the <Col N="979" />House. We should take some stand against this. It is unacceptable and unfair that Fianna Fáil Senators should be told to shut up by their party leadership. They deserve better. We are on their side in this one. It was bound to happen because it was heading in this direction for a while. Fianna Fáil Senators should resist and not put up with it.</P>
    <P>Mr. Leyden: How does the Senator keep the ICTU down? He seems to control it very well. It has one voice, one leader. It is wonderful.</P>
    <P>Mr. B. Hayes: The Senator should keep an eye on the bigger picture.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Toole: There is great concern, especially in the Fianna Fáil Party, about the influence of Senator bin Leyden in the operation of the party, that he can be an undermining influence.</P>
    <P>An Leas-Chathaoirleach: Senator O'Toole must refer to another Senator by his or her proper title.</P>
    <P>Mr. Leyden: That was probably unparliamentary. Senator O'Toole will have to correct the record.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Toole: I have very mixed views about what happened in Baghdad last night. While we have always said we would celebrate the end of Saddam Hussein's regime, all I could think of was <i>Gulliver's Travels.</i> It reminded me of the scene from Lilliput where the huge giant was toppled over by the little people. It looked to me like some dumb show put on for the American viewing public.</P>
    <P>We need to examine seriously how this will move forward. Now that that aspect is over, can we examine others? I am most concerned about where we stand on the United Nations. I have no doubt that the United States is opposed to UN involvement. This war took place apparently to disarm the regime in Iraq and has changed its emphasis towards putting a new regime in place and installing democracy. While none of us could oppose this, it was not the reason given to the United Nations and there is now a view in the United States that the United Nations should not be involved. This is a serious issue. I appeal to Members on both sides of the House to keep a close eye on what happens, especially to the Kurds who have always been the meat in the sandwich between the Turkish and Iraqi regimes and when it suited western governments.</P>
    <P>One issue we need to examine closely and on which there was a huge discussion recently is the lack of fair and free access to health services. There is an appalling headline in today's newspapers to the effect that men from County Kerry are more likely to die from a heart attack than any other group. Will someone show concern for us and ensure there is equality of access because, again, we are discriminated against, this time in coronary disease?</P>
    <P>Mr. Ryan: No one with a spark of humanity <Col N="980" />would wish other than that the war in Iraq would end quickly and in a way that protects the lives of Iraqis. While overwhelming military force can win a war, I am not convinced that the stability that is the most precious thing Iraqis seek will emanate from it. There is a huge issue concerning who is responsible for the consequences of the disorder, anarchy and considerable chaos that appears to be breaking out. The state of the hospitals in Baghdad alone, as described in this morning's media raises the question of proportionality.</P>
    <P>There is an irony in the advocacy and enthusiasm for democracy in Iraq, given that the war was essentially launched from Kuwait which has no intention ever of becoming of a democracy. I find it ironic that a war to install democracy in Iraq was launched from a country that will never be a democracy and does not recognise women's rights to participate in politics. This is not to speak of that other great ally, Saudi Arabia, which has no great enthusiasm for democracy either.</P>
    <P>I must express scepticism about the prospects for a seriously free democracy in Iraq. Anyone who watched the most recent presidential election in Bolivia will have seen the unqualified intervention of the US ambassador in that country, advising the people of the serious consequences of voting for the wrong candidate. That is not the way to install the type of democracy in which I believe.</P>
    <P>I would like to have a debate at some stage, presumably after Easter, on the question of law enforcement in this country. We heard from Senator O'Meara last night about the lack of enforcement of environmental law in County Tipperary. It is now beginning to be enforced as a result of my colleague's activities. We know that a State body, Aer Rianta, has been pumping raw sewage into the Shannon Estuary for the past few years. Until a huge fuss was made, no one was prepared to enforce the law.</P>
    <P>As another example, I drive regularly from Cork to Dublin and when the new speeding regime was introduced, something I support fully, I assumed I would be slowed down by all the trucks that would not be able to drive above 50mph miles an hour, which is their speed limit. However, I have no problem because they all drive at 60mph. No one enforces the law against huge juggernauts travelling at between 60 and 65mph on roads that are probably not suitable for such vehicles and most assuredly are not for them travelling at 65mph. It is an issue in this country that we are very good at putting laws on the Statute Book and very poor at enforcement. I would like us to discuss this issue about why we are so poor at enforcing laws.</P>
    <P>On an issue related to enforcement, whatever attempts Fianna Fáil may make to gag its members, I hope it will not enforce those very well either. I would hate to have our Leader silenced.</P>
    <P>Ms O'Rourke: Why do Senators always refer to me?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="981" />
    </P>
    <P>Mr. Bannon: We are concerned about the Leader.</P>
    <P>Mr. Ryan: She is the one with whom we identify most.</P>
    <P>Mr. B. Hayes: The Senator should speak for himself.</P>
    <P>Mr. Ryan: The Leader can deal later with Senator Brian Hayes.</P>
    <P>An Leas-Chathaoirleach: Senator Ryan should conclude.</P>
    <P>Mr. Ryan: The culture is extraordinary because the Taoiseach has already required all Cabinet members to undertake that they will not keep diaries or publish memoirs. We now have the filleting of the Freedom of Information Act and the silencing of Fianna Fáil. Is there much left for the Government to do to suppress information?</P>
    <P>Mr. Minihan: Yesterday we were referred to as sheep. Perhaps, therefore, the Opposition is talking about the silencing of the lambs.</P>
    <P>We have raised the issue of Iraq on many occasions on the Order of Business in recent weeks. It is important that we continue debating it as new developments unfold. There is no doubt that the victims are the people of Iraq but international peace and stability, the United Nations and the European Union have also suffered. Ireland will have a leading role to play in this respect given that we will take over the EU Presidency in January next. We should now start the process of healing the rifts in both the European Union and the United Nations.</P>
    <P>I concur with the comments of Senator Brian Hayes that the future of Iraq has to be for the Iraqi people but the United Nations has a huge role to play. We should be proactive in bringing forward new resolutions to ensure this process begins. There is no doubt that the months ahead will be critical in ensuring peace and stability in the Middle East and the future co-operation of states, particularly in the European Union. The Government will have a huge leadership role in the months ahead. This should begin immediately. We could facilitate it by debating the issue in the House. I ask the Leader to organise such a debate as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Mr. Bannon: Will the Leader invite to the House the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, who has responsibility for the social inclusion programme, to explain how he intends to support the most disadvantaged in society? It was announced in the budget that 6% of funding would be cut from the programme but it now transpires that 40% has been cut. Is the Minister aware that contracts are being terminated and services withdrawn because those administering the programme had to review their plans because of a recent letter sent to each <Col N="982" />Leader board? Senator Leyden and I have letters concerning counties Longford and Roscommon.</P>
    <P>Mr. Leyden: Indeed I have.</P>
    <P>Mr. Bannon: I support my colleagues in respect of the debate on the appointment of the Information Commissioner. This needs to be examined. We need to be more open about the manner in which we make appointments to such vital public offices in the future.</P>
    <P>With regard to the muzzling of Fianna Fáil Party members, I fully support my party colleagues in supporting the Leader on this major issue.</P>
    <P>An Leas-Chathaoirleach: That does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>Mr. Bannon: In <i>The Irish Times</i> today I read that there is a move to rattle the position of the Tánaiste as leader of her party. The picture in the newspaper speaks 100,000 words.</P>
    <P>Mr. Leyden: This is a very stimulating debate.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Toole: This might be the Senator's last chance to talk without being muzzled.</P>
    <P>Mr. Leyden: Let us consider the case of Amina Lawal who was sentenced to be stoned by the courts in Nigeria for having a child out of wedlock. She has been successful in getting a lawyer to represent her and proceed with the appeal. The imposition of such a sentence breaks all international codes and laws. Perhaps the conflict in Iraq is attracting all the attention of the media around the world but the plight of Amina Lawal is very important. Ireland has had very close links with Nigeria, perhaps too close in the recent past, and should withdraw all support for that country if it proceeds with the stoning and murder of this young lady. The stoning, if proceeded with, will break the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture. The young lady in question now has a child and because she is breast-feeding&mdash;</P>
    <P>An Leas-Chathaoirleach: Has the Senator a question for the Leader?</P>
    <P>Mr. Leyden: The House has already expressed its condemnation to the Nigerian Government and I wish to renew this condemnation in the House and make it clear that we will take action if the Nigerian Government proceeds with the sentence against Amina Lawal. She is mothering her young child but the grossly unfair sentence still stands. As a country with very close links with Africa, Nigeria in particular, we have a moral responsibility to make sure the sentence is not carried out. I ask the Leader to use her good offices to convey this view, expressed unanimously by the House, to the Nigerian Government and the ambassador.</P>
    <P>Mr. Coonan: In the calm of post-war Iraq and in view of the comments made by the Minister for Defence that there is no such thing as complete <Col N="983" />military neutrality, will the Leader organise a debate on the Defence Forces given that the Minister has proposed the abolition of many of the FCA units, sold many military barracks and failed to invest funds in equipment for our Army personnel such as helicopters? I would like the Minister to be invited to the House, not just because he is a neighbour of mine but because these issues have not been debated. It is opportune and timely that we do so.</P>
    <P>Mr. Morrissey: Will the Leader arrange a debate, sooner rather than later, on the port tunnel? We read articles on a daily basis about its height restrictions, the number of trucks it can accommodate and the damage that might be done by super-trucks. There are no European height restrictions on tunnels. However, there has been an ongoing debate at official level for the past 12 months and Owen Keegan of Dublin City Council has bandied about figures of &euro;140 million down to &euro;20 million. In December a solemn commitment was made to having a transport study conducted on the figures pertaining to the numbers of trucks that would breach the present height restrictions. Those figures are not emerging as quickly as we would like. We were told a month ago that we would have them within a week, after an initial leak of the interim figures. It is bizarre when one realises that the Luas bridge in Dundrum, in the Minister's constituency, has been increased in height to five metres at an undisclosed cost. Also, the East Wall Road bridge has been increased in height to five metres by Iarnród Éireann, yet the height pertaining to the biggest tunnelling project in the country is lower. There seems to be a big cover-up going underground. Will the Leader invite the Minister to the House before Easter, even for one hour, to discuss this subject?</P>
    <P>Mr. Higgins: Like other Members of the House, I welcome the fact that the war in Iraq is drawing to a close, whether one agrees with it. We must now keep an eye on future developments, particularly in respect of the roles of the European Union and the United Nations. There are other Saddams who are equally oppressive and insane. I refer, in particular, to Mr. Mugabe, President of the forgotten people in Zimbabwe. I am not advocating any kind of military intervention or invasion from outside, but South Africa has a particular role and influence in this case which it has not exercised. At some stage we or the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs should consider inviting the South African Ambassador to Ireland with a view to discussing what influence that country can bring to bear on dealing with Mugabe and trying to do something for the poor people of Zimbabwe, not simply the white settlers. There is a huge incidence of AIDS, hospitals do not have medicines and people are literally starving. They are reduced to eating the bark off trees.</P>
    <P>I wish the Taoiseach and the British Prime <Col N="984" />Minister, Tony Blair, well in their deliberations today.</P>
    <P>Mr. Ryan: Hear, hear.</P>
    <P>Mr. Higgins: This is a most important day from the point of view of this country's welfare and particularly that of Northern Ireland. We want to see the Assembly and the Executive up and running as quickly as possible to restore power to the people, rather than having devolution where matters are run from London. I wish the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister well and hope matters will be finalised today.</P>
    <P>Senators: Hear, hear.</P>
    <P>Mr. Kitt: I join Senator Higgins in extending my best wishes to the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister at today's talks.</P>
    <P>I hope the United Nations will take a central role in Iraq, particularly in regard to the distribution of food and humanitarian aid, in respect of which I agree that there should not be any militarisation. This sentiment was expressed to us at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs last week. I support the involvement of Irish forces in Iraq.</P>
    <P>The report on the abuse of the elderly has recently been published and I am pleased that the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Callely, has already met the Garda Commissioner to discuss the issue. It would be worthwhile to debate the report on the treatment of the elderly. There is a worrying article in one of today's newspapers on the issue.</P>
    <P>In regard to the alleged muzzling of Fianna Fáil members, the chairman of the parliamentary party, Deputy Kirk, should be commended for allowing us an opportunity to discuss the matter. We have a number of weeks to make submissions. It shows that Fianna Fáil is not only a good party in government, it is good in opposition also. It is a little like the Kilkenny hurlers, of which it is said that the second best team in Ireland is the Kilkenny substitutes. I look forward to that debate.</P>
    <P>Mr. B. Hayes: They speak out of both sides of their mouth at the same time.</P>
    <P>Mr. Browne: I regret that we have not had the Minister for Transport in the House this term. Transport is an important issue, one that affects us in our everyday lives. I concur with Senator Morrissey's sentiments in regard to the fiasco of the Dublin Port tunnel which has now gone over budget by &euro;300 million. Four weeks after it was asked to do so, the NRA has still not given the relevant information to the Joint Committee on Transport on the overspend, in spite of repeated reminders. How does the Government plan to honour its promise to ensure no heavy goods vehicles will pass through the city centre, given that some vehicles will be unable to use the tunnel? It would be helpful if the Minister came into the House and made the figures known. We have heard that 1% of vehicles will be unable to use <Col N="985" />the tunnel but there has also been speculation that the figure may be 5%. It would be useful if we had a debate on the subject to allow the Minister to outlines the facts in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>I also have a question in regard to the penalty points system. There appears to be widespread confusion as to exactly when points will take effect. Some are of the opinion that they date from when the fine is paid, while others believe they date from the day the speeding offence is committed. It has come to my attention that if a fine is overpaid, one can buy extra time. An overpaid fine cannot be processed and will be sent back, thus prolonging the actual payment of the fine. This anomaly could have great significance if the endorsement only takes effect on payment of the fine. The effect of such an aberration might only become apparent in three years' time. It is vital that the Minister comes into the House to clarify these matters.</P>
    <P>Mr. J. Walsh: I concur with the sentiments of Senator Higgins in extending good wishes to the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, as I am sure does every Member of the House. I hope it will resolve the issues that have divided and affected the operation of the Assembly.</P>
    <P>I join those Members calling for a debate on transport. It is not correct to say, as Senator Browne did, that we have not had a debate on transport during the lifetime of this Seanad. The Minister has been here on at least one occasion.</P>
    <P>Mr. B. Hayes: He did not say that.</P>
    <P>Mr. Browne: I did not say that.</P>
    <P>Mr. Ryan: Senator Jim Walsh, without obfuscation.</P>
    <P>An Leas-Chathaoirleach: Senator Jim Walsh, without interruption.</P>
    <P>Mr. J. Walsh: I agree that we should have a debate which would take in such issues as the port tunnel and the operation of the penalty points system, in regard to which I have some reservations in that if there is a long period before people are notified of the points they are accruing, it could be unfair to the individual.</P>
    <P>An Leas-Chathaoirleach: Is the Senator seeking a debate?</P>
    <P>Mr. J. Walsh: Yes. I also wish to refute the comment made by Senator Ryan in regard to the operation of articulated trucks. They cannot get into top gear at under 50 mph. There is a need for a debate on transport. Will the Leader include a provision whereby the application of speed limits which in some cases are pitched artificially low would be reviewed? I believe that is the Minister's intention.</P>
    <P>Mr. Ryan: They should change the gear.</P>
    <P>Mr. J. Walsh: This morning we again heard about negative coverage in the newspapers in regard to the health service. I seek a debate on <Col N="986" />health matters that would specifically focus on the recently published report which surveyed patients' views on the health service. This revealed generally positive feedback with satisfaction rates of up to 80% or 90%.</P>
    <P>An Leas-Chathaoirleach: Is the Senator seeking a debate?</P>
    <P>Mr. J. Walsh: I am seeking a debate on the matter. It is essential that there is balance in the perception of the health service for the morale of those involved in it, as much as for the confidence of those who use it.</P>
    <P>Mr. Scanlon: It has come to my attention that there are a number of European companies successfully operating out of Ireland, particularly in the food sector. Some of them are not giving an opportunity to Irish companies to even give quotes to supply some of the products being sold by them here. I am aware of a factory in Finglas that employs over 200 people which approached one such company to supply a product manufactured here but despite many attempts to get an opportunity to quote, it never got to do so. That is wrong. It is something that is happening regularly. We should have a debate to discuss the matter. Irish jobs are at stake. It is very unfair if companies come here from Europe or elsewhere, trade successfully and make good profits but prevent Irish workers from participating in their enterprises.</P>
    <P>Ms O'Meara: I wish to formally second Senator Brian Hayes's motion. I do not think it was seconded. In regard to the Order of Business&mdash;</P>
    <P>An Leas-Chathaoirleach: He does not need a seconder. He is opposing the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>Ms O'Meara: My apologies. I seek to have a debate on the war in Iraq. I know we will not be able to have it this week but, perhaps, we can have it next week. It is urgent that we do so.</P>
    <P>Will the Leader put cancer services as an item for discussion on the agenda? An urgent debate is required. There are many Members who wish to contribute to such a debate and raise important issues.</P>
    <P>Ms O'Rourke: I concur with those Members who referred to the Taoiseach's meeting today with Tony Blair. The Good Friday Agreement was signed five years ago on this date, 10 April. This anniversary is highly significant and the House was very much united on the issue. Everybody in this House welcomed the development wholeheartedly.</P>
    <P>Senator Brian Hayes is opposing the Order of Business, as he is fully entitled to do, in regard to the closure of the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill and the attempt to guillotine the President. Many of us, on all sides of the House, are aware that the President is not for guillotining. She is well able to express herself and I do not think the Senator's allegation is correct.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="987" />I agree that Iraq should be for the Iraqi people. I saw the scenes last night on television which were repeated on every station. I found the toppling of the statue and the forced gaiety and jollity nauseating. Nobody is in favour of Saddam Hussein. How could anybody be? However, the scenes we witnessed last night do not bode well for the future.</P>
    <P>Senator Brian Hayes also raised the possibility of the Defence Forces going to Iraq. Speaking to my colleague, Senator Minihan, I think it would be very appropriate for us to send a peacekeeping force there from the UN and the EU. It is a very fine idea, and as Senator Hayes said, the Irish have long experience of peacekeeping in troubled areas. I thank the Senator for his expression of solidarity with me. I do not know why Senators are all expressing such sentiments as this matter has nothing to do with me.</P>
    <P>Mr. B. Hayes: Not yet, but it could in the future.</P>
    <P>Ms O'Rourke: I see. Senator O'Toole is also perturbed about members of my party being gagged. I can tell him that none of us will be gagged. The story is massively&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mr. Minihan: The Leader should not upset Senator O'Toole as she might give him a heart attack.</P>
    <P>Ms O'Rourke: That is true. The story has been massively inflated, but we are delighted that the Senator is prepared to be Sir Galahad and ride to our rescue. Senator O'Toole also expressed his worry about the heart condition of his Kerry neighbours.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly that we should have a debate on the post-war role of the EU and the UN. One's views and comments can so often be distorted. We are all genuinely glad that the war is over but the fear now concerns what is to happen next. Coupled with the scenes from Iraq shown on television this morning were scenes from Afghanistan, which is entirely riven by dissent, apart from a very small area in the centre of the capital city, Kabul. A party of occupation, which is what the American and British forces are, is not the right conduit for aid and for setting up a proper administration run by the Iraqi people themselves.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan raised the issue of Iraq and the instability that will now follow. The war, he said, was not about democracy but was supposed to be about weapons of mass destruction. It was never to be a war to bring about a change of regime. That only came about later when it was found that there were no weapons of mass destruction.</P>
    <P>The Senator also called for better law enforcement, arguing that we pass laws but then do not have sufficient personnel to enforce them. He talked about the speed of trucks, a point that was answered by Senator Jim Walsh, but trucks are passing drivers which are trying to stick to the speed limit. I have noticed in the past two or three weeks that more drivers are becoming care<Col N="988" />less again. I do not know whether this is just custom or whatever.</P>
    <P>I wish Senator Minihan good luck, as chairman, at his party convention tomorrow. I think he will have a few sticky wickets&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mr. Minihan: Not at all.</P>
    <P>Ms O'Rourke: No doubt he will be able to deal with them. Senator Minihan also asked about a debate on Iraq and the role of the UN and the EU. I fully agree that it would be a very worthwhile debate. I wonder whether we will have time next week, but if not, we will have it immediately when we come back after Easter.</P>
    <P>Senator Bannon asked for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, to come to the House to explain how he intends to support the disadvantaged. The Senator also expressed his care for me, for which I thank him.</P>
    <P>Senator Leyden talked about the stoning of a young woman, Amina Lawal. The Nigerian embassy was the only agency, group or embassy to whom we wrote from which we never heard back. I was quite amazed. I got confirmation about a week ago that they never replied. That sentence still stands, and we should issue another firm letter to the Nigerians.</P>
    <P>Senator Coonan wants the Minister for Defence to come to the House to debate the meaning of neutrality, as now appertains. Senator Morrissey raised the issue of the port tunnel. He is right to do so because we need clarification. It appears that the height of the tunnel will not be raised and that the huge trucks will be banned. This information was conveyed in a vague statement, and we want more clarity on the issue.</P>
    <P>Senator Higgins raised the issue of Iraq and also the rule of President Mugabe in Zimbabwe, and he suggested perhaps inviting the South African ambassador to the Committee on Foreign Affairs. The Senator also expressed good wishes to the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator Kitt called for the Minister of State with responsibility for the elderly, Deputy Callely, to come to the House. That would be very useful, and I know the Minister of State is keen to do so.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne called for debate on transport and the port tunnel and sought clarification about penalty points and about when one pays, when they are enforced and so on. We do need clarification on this issue because these are the things people are asking us about.</P>
    <P>Senator Jim Walsh supports the call for a debate on transport, and I know he has much knowledge on that. He talked about the speed of trucks, but my experience, like Senator Ryan's, is that they are overtaking cars. I do not know what gear they are in but they are overtaking. The Senator asked about the health service survey. We do not ever hear the good news being debated, which is the point the Senator is making, only the bad.</P>
    <P>Senator Scanlon talked about Irish companies not being asked to tender by European compan<Col N="989" />ies set up here who are sourcing material or components. I did not know that Irish companies were not being asked in some cases. They cannot get preferential treatment, and that is obviously not what the Senator meant. His concern is that Irish companies are not being allowed to issue quotes. We will take that up with the Tánaiste.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Meara raised the issue of Iraq and <Col N="990" />seconded Senator Brian Hayes's call for a change to the Order of Business. She also called for a comprehensive debate on the availability of cancer treatment, the numbers involved and so on. That would be very worthwhile.</P>
    <P>Question put: &ldquo;That the Order of Business be agreed to.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>Mr. Ryan: Bhí muid anseo ar feadh tamaill fhada inné agus ní raibh mé in ann bheith anseo Dé Máirt. Rinne mé iarracht inné bheith chomh dearfach agus ab'fhéidir liom. Tá mé i bhfabhar prionsabail an Bhille so bhí an-díoma orm nuair a chuala mé aréir go raibh an tAire ar an raidió ag tabhairt amach nach raibh Páirtí an Lucht Oibre anseo Dé Mháirt. Ba chóir go mbeadh náire air a leithéid d'úsáid a bhaint as an Ghaelainn chun party politican broadcast a dhéanamh ar Raidió na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Brisfidh sé an spiorad a bhí istigh sa Teach seo má leanfaidh an tAire ar aghaidh mar sin. Tá sé olc go leor nach bhfuil sé sásta glacadh le leasú ar bith, agus geallaim don Teach seo go nglacfaidh sé le leasaithe sa Dáil, cé nach bhfuil sé sásta éisteacht linn anseo. Titfidh sé amach, áfach, nach raibh a fhios ag éinne go dtí tráthnóna Déardaoin seo caite go raibh an Bille seo, atá ar an chlár oibre le bliain go leith, le bheith anseo Dé Mháirt. Ansin téann an tAire ar an raidió ag tabhairt amach faoina daoine nach raibh i láthair le baint leis na rudaí a bhí eagraithe chun gnó an Aire a dhéanamh. Más mar sin a theastaíonn ón Aire go ndéanfar an díospóireacht bíodh sé mar san, ach mí mar sin a theastaigh sé uaim-se. Tá a fhios ag an Tigh gur láimhseaíleas ceist na Gaeilge sa Tigh seo ariamh. Níor thugas faoi éinne agus níor ionsaíos éinne. Tá an Ghaeilge ró-thábhachtach domsa chun í a úsáid chun dul i gcoinne dhaoine eile. Má tá sé d'aidhm ag an Aire an Ghaeilge a úsáid chun party political broadcast a dhéanamh ar Raidió na Gaeltachta, bíodh sé mar san againn agus beidh. Ach ní ghlacfaidh mé lena leithéid.</P>
    <P>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív): Níl a fhios agam ar éist an Seanadóir leis an rud a tharla ar Raidió na Gaeltachta. Cuireadh ceist orm cén fáth a laghad daoine a bheith sa Teach agus a bhí Dé Máirt. Mhínigh mé gur nós é sin ar Chéim an Choiste. Cuireadh an cheist orm an dara huair agus dúirt gurb é an gnáth rud a bhíonn ann ná go mbíonn úrlabhraí na bpáirtithe éagsúla ann agus mar sin nach mbeinn ag súil le leath de Fhine Gael a bheith anseo. Is iad siúd a bhí ag cur na ceiste agus dúirt mé go raibh daoine ó na páirtithe éagsúla ach nach raibh éinne ann ó Pháirtí an Lucht Oibre. Ba fíric é sin.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 25.</P>
    <P>Mr. McHugh: I move amendment No. 52:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="991" />In page 30, line 31, after &ldquo;so.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;After the Commissioner has ruled on a complaint a person has made or which has been made on behalf of that person nothing in this Act shall prohibit that person from initiating legal proceedings should he/she choose to do so.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is an important addition because the rationale behind it is to allay any misunderstanding and specifically to strengthen section 25 in favour of the citizen. It comes from a citizen's rights point of view and it is important that this amendment be included.</P>
    <P>Éamon Ó Cuív: Ní feidir liom glacadh leis seo. Mar a mhínigh mé cheana, ní chuireann an Bille seo isteach ar aon cheart bunreachtúil. É sin ráite, níl mórán ciall le coimisinéir a chur in áit agus seans a thabhairt don saoránach, muna bhfuil sé in ann sásamh a fháil, dul go dtí na cúirteanna. Ní bheadh aon chiall leis an dara córas a chur i bhfeidhm, is é sin le rá córas cúirte chomh maith le córas coimisinéara.</P>
    <P>Tá mé go mór i bhfábhar chóras an choimisinéara mar feictear dom go bhfuil sé i bhfad níos éasca ag an gnáth phobal a gcearta a bhaint amach trí chóras coimisinéara ná mar a bheadh dá gcaithfidís dul chun na cúirte leis na cearta atá san mBille seo fháil. Mar sin, níl i gceist agam glacadh leis seo. Ní fheicim go mbeidh gá ag an saoránach dul go dtí na cúirteanna. Is é atá i gceist ag an mBille seo go mbeidh coimisinéir ann agus dualgas láidir air cearta an tsaoránaigh a chosaint. Más gá, is féidir leis an gcoimisinéir dul chun na cúirte. Is ar an ábhar sin nach bhfuil i gceist agam glacadh leis an leasú seo.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
    <P>Section 25 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 26.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 26 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Ryan: Chím nach bhfuil oifig an choimisinéara faoi scáth an Acht um Shaoráil Faisnéise. Tá a fhios agam nach mór is maith leis an Rialtas an Freedom of Information Act. Ní thuigim cén fáth nach bhfuil oifig an choimisinéara faoi scáth an Achta sin. Tá, mar shampla, the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation, now transmogrified into ComReg agus coimisinéirí agus rialóirí cosúil leis an electricity regulator faoi scáth an Achta um Shaoráil Faisnéise. Níl sé éasca a thuiscint cén fáth, ach amháin ar chinneadh dearfach a deineadh ag an Rialtas, go bhfuil eisceacht á dhéanamh anseo. Tá a fhios agam nach bhfuil Oifig an Ombudsman faoi scáth an Achta sin ach tá sé soiléir gurb é an fáth leis sin go bhfuil ról faoi leith ag an Ombudsman. Ach is a mhalairt de scéal ar fad atá anseo. Is é mo thuai<Col N="992" />rim gurb í an tslí is fusa ná an coimisinéir a choimeád ón Achta um Shaoráil Faisnéise.</P>
    <P>Éamon Ó Cuív: Breathnóidh mé ar an gceist sin arís. An bunús atá leis seo ná gur Ombudsman é an coimisinéir. Beidh an cineál feidhme céanna ag an ombudsman seo agus atá ag an gháth Ombudsman. Go deimhin, b'fhéidir go mba cheart dom ombudsman na Gaeilge a thabhairt air in ionad coimisinéir na Gaeilge. Tharraing an difríocht focal sin go leor cainte ins an meáin ag pointe amháin. An bunús atá leis seo gur ombudsman é agus ní thagann Oifig an Ombudsman faoin Acht um Shaoráil Faisnéise.</P>
    <P>Breathnóidh mé ar an gceist arís. Bheimís ag déanamh idirdhealú an-mhór idir é agus an Ombudsman, ainneoin gur ombudsman an coimisinéir ach go bhfuil feidhm eile ag an Ombudsman. Bheadh sé spéisiúil fáil amach an bhfuil Ombudsman na leanaí ag dul leis an nósmhaireacht céanna leis an Ombudsman. Nuair a bheidh an t-eolas san agam breathnóidh mé arís air.</P>
    <P>Mr. Ryan: Glacaim leis go bhfuil an tAire chun smaoinimh faoi seo. Tá deighilt bhunúsach idir an gcoimisinéir seo agus an Ombudsman. Tá sé soiléir in alt 33 nuair a deirtear:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this Act shall be construed as conferring a right of action in any civil proceeings in respect of any failure to comply with any duty imposed by or under subsection (1) of section 19.</P>
    <P>Níl a leithéid ag baint leis an Ombudsman. Má dhéanann an gnáth Ombudsman fiosrú faoi rud, níl aon bhac dleathúil ar dhaoine na cúirteanna a úsáid chun pé rud atá i gceist a leanúint, tar éis don Ombudsman an jab a dhéanamh agus ní bheadh sé ceart go mbeadh. Is iad na aidhmeanna atá ag an reachtaíocht seo, a bhfuilimid ar aon aigne fúthu, má theipeann ar chomhlacht poiblí an scéim atá leagtha amach dó a chur i bhfeidhm an pionós is mó atá in ann dó ná go scríofar tuarascáil agus go gcuirfear os comhair Tithe an Oireachtas é. I gcás an Ombudsman, má mholann sí rud éigin agus má theipeann ar an eagraíocht Stáit an moladh sin a chomhlíonadh tá sé de chead ag saoránach an cheist a leanúint tríd na cúirteanna. Ní féidir a rá go bhfuil an stádas céanna ag coimisinéir na Gaeilge agus atá ag an Ombudsman. Sin an fáth gur chóir go mbeadh sé nó sí faoi scáth an Achta.</P>
    <P>Éamon Ó Cuív: Mar a dúirt mé, breathnóidh me air. Tá mórán den stádas céanna ann. Ar ndóigh, níl aon fhadhb nó aon chosc ar dhuine nach bhfuil sásta le freagra an choimisinéara ar dhul chun na cúirte. An t-aon rud nach féidir leis a dhéanamh ná an Bhille áirithe seo a úsáid mar chuid den chás &ndash; tá difríocht ann. Mar atá ráite cheana, is féidir leis an gcoimisinéir féin dul chun na cúirte. Má bhreathnaímid ar an gnáth-shaoránach, is é bealach an Ombudsman agus an choimisinéara an bealach is fusa agus is saoire. Bainfidh <Col N="993" />an bealach seo an dualgas de bheith ag dul isteach i gcúirteanna.</P>
    <P>Feictear domsa gurbh é an gnáth-bhealach sin an bealach is fearr le cearta daoine i gcás rudaí mar seo a chinntiú. Is beag duine go bhfuil d'acmhainn aige bheith ag plé leis na cúirteanna, mar tá na cúirteanna daor. Is fearr i bhfad go bhfuil duine ceaptha leis an obair a dhéanamh ar a shon agus tacaíocht reachtaíochta aige. Mar a mhínigh mé inné, níl amhras ar bith orm ach go mbeidh dualgas an-láidir, dá bharr seo, ar na heagraíochtaí éagsúla ag plé leis an mBille.</P>

    <P>Mr. McHugh: I move amendment No. 55:</P>
    <P>In page 32, subsection (5), line 23, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This technical amendment may have been agreed by the Minister. It was listed as a Government amendment, as well as an amendment in my name, on the first Order Paper. Perhaps I can be given clarification in relation to this amendment so that it may be agreed.</P>
    <P>Éamon Ó Cuív: Tá sé fíor-thábhachtach d'fheidhmiú éifeachtach na reachtaíochta seo go mbeadh discréid ag an gcoimisinéir maidir le feidhmiú fhorálacha áirithe atá sonraithe sa Bhille. Is sampla amháin an fhoráil áirithe seo ina bhfuil sé riachtanach go mbeadh discréid ag an Aire maidir le feidhmiú an fhoráil. Creidim gur chóir go mbeadh an coimisinéir i reacht a chuid nó a cuid discréid a úsáid maidir le cénuair a chuireann sé tuairisc ar aghaidh chuig Tithe an Oireachtais, ag cur san áireamh go mbeidh sé nó sí neamhspleách i gcomhlíonadh a chuid fheidhmeanna agus go mb'fhéidir go mbeadh roinnt de na moltaí nár comhlíonadh an-bheag i gcomhthéacs feidhmiú ginearálta na scéime atá aontaithe leis an gcomhlacht poiblí i gceist. Ar an gcúis sin, níl mé ag glacadh leis. Sílim féin go gcaithfear an discréid a fhágáil.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="994" />
    </P>
    <P>Mr. McHugh: I would like some clarification because on the first Order Paper, from which I am working, it is listed as a Government amendment. Perhaps it is a clerical error. If one is working from the second document, it is not listed as a Government amendment. Perhaps the error is on the first day's Order Paper. If I cross-reference with the amendments listed under section 27 on the second list, I can see that amendment No. 55 is not listed as a Government amendment. Perhaps the Minister may have taken a U-turn in the last couple of days.</P>
    <P>Acting Chairman (Mr. Kitt): Níl sé anseo mar leasú on Rialtas. Baineann leasú Uimh. 56 leis an Rialtas, ach baineann leasú Uimh. 55 leis an Seanadóir McHugh.</P>
    <P>Mr. McHugh: Stopfaidh mé ansin.</P>
    <P>Éamon Ó Cuív: Sula nglacfar leis an alt seo sa mBille, b'fhéidir go mbeidh orm teacht thar n-ais ar Chéim na Tuarascála le leasuithe teicniúla eile.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>

    <P>Will the House agree to discuss amendments Nos. 57 and 59 together?</P>
    <P>Acting Chairman: Amendment No. 57 will have to be discussed on its own as amendment No. 59 was already discussed with amendment No. 28.</P>
    <P>Mr. McHugh: It was discussed yesterday. I would like to propose amendment No. 57, which relates to the issue of the privatisation of State bodies and whether the use of Gaeilge on stationery and signage is still an issue. This point was made under section 11 and I will not reiterate it. If a State company is privatised, will it continue to fall under the authority of this Bill in relation to the use of Irish on stationery? Will such a company have to continue to facilitate the use of Irish in the workplace?</P>
    <P>Éamon Ó Cuív: Phlé muid seo inné i gcomhthéacs eile. Má bhreathnóidh an Seanadóir ar an sainmhíniú ar &ldquo;comhlacht poiblí&rdquo; ata sa mBille, feicfidh se go bhfuil sé thar a bheith leathan. Clúdaíonn sé an rud atá i gceist ag an Sean<Col N="995" />adóir. Táimid ag breathnú ar leasú a thabharfadh isteach, mar shampla, comhlachtaí a oibríonn faoi cheadúnas ón Stáit. Mar sin tá an cheist atá ag an Seanadóir clúdaithe cheana féin sa mBille faoin gCéad Sceideal. Tá sainmhíniú uafásach leathan ar chomhlacht poiblí sa Sceideal.</P>

    <P>Acting Chairman: An bhfuil sé sin aontaithe? Agreed.</P>
    <P>Mr. McHugh: I have proposed two amdendments to this extremely important section. It is imperative, for the effective operation of the legislation, that the commissioner publishes commentaries on its practical application on a regular basis. Without wishing to repeat what I said on Tuesday, I welcome the role of the commissioner under this legislation. There are grey areas in relation to the role of the commissioner and this is the reason I am proposing these amendments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="996" />
    </P>
    <P>Mr. Ryan: Gabhaim leithscéal leis an Seanadóir McHugh ós rud é gur dheineas piggyback ar chuid dá leasaithe.</P>
    <P>Tá mé cinnte go ndéarfaidh an tAire linn go bhfuil discréid ag teastáil ón gcoimisinéir. Ní aontaím go bhfuil discréid aige ar an ábhar seo. Seo an oifig is tábhachtaí sa Stát ó thaobh na Gaeilge de agus ó thaobh tacaíochta a thabhairt don nGaeilge agus rudaí mar siúd, agus ba chóir go mbeadh sé de dhualgas ar an gcoimisinéir na tráchtaireachtaí seo a gcur amach ó am go ham. Fiú amháin dá mba rud é nach raibh an t-alt seo sa Bhille bheadh an coimisinéir ábalta tráchtaireachtaí a chur amach mar níl sé ciúinithe de réir an Bhille. Má luaitear tráchtaireachtaí sa Bhille ba chóir go ndéarfaí go bhfuil sé de dhualgas ag an gcoimisinéir iad a fhoilsiú. Sin an fáth go dtacaím leis an dá leasú seo.</P>
    <P>Éamon Ó Cuív: Ní hé go bhfuil discréid ag an gcoimisinéir. Teastaíonn discréid uaidh maidir le tuarascálacha speisialta. Mar a fheicfear in alt 31, beidh air tuarascáil bhliantúil a cur ar fáil a chuimseoidh a chuid oibre agus a chuirfidh síos ar cén chaoi ar éirigh leis agus ar na nithe a d'éirigh i gcaitheamh na bliana.</P>
    <P>De bhreis ar an ghnáth thuarascáil chuimsitheach ar obair na bliana táimid ag iarriadh deise a thabhairt dó tuarascálacha a réiteach ar nithe faoi leith. Feicimid é sin i gcás Oifig an Ombudsman, sa mhéad is go gcuireann sé tuarascáil bhliantúil amach a dhéanann tagairt do na cineáil cásanna is mó a tharraing deacracht dó i gcaitheamh na bliana. Chomh maith leis sin, feicimid an Ombudsman, ó ham go chéile ar a dhiscréid féin, ag foilsiú tuarascálacha speisialta, mar shampla, an tuarascáil ar cheist an úis a bhain leis na Coimisinéirí Ioncaim. Tugann an t-alt seo an cumhacht breise sin dó.</P>
    <P>Thiocfainn go hiomlán leis an Seanadóir go mba cheart go mbeadh dualgas ar an gcoimisinéir tuarascálacha rialta a gcur amach agus beidh, faoi alt 3. In aghaidh na bliana a déanfar sin.</P>
    <P>Labhrás Ó Murchú: Tá sé soiléir ón díospóireacht a bhí againn maidir leis an gcoimisinéir cé chomh tábhachtach is atá an post seo. Is é an coimisinéir a chinnteoidh go n-éireoidh leis an gcóras atá i gceist againn. Ag faire ar an Ombudsman, faoi mar a bhí againn go dtí seo, tá a fhios againn go raibh neamhspleáchas ag gabháil leis agus go raibh sé sásta labhairt amach. Beimid ag brath go mór ar choimisinéir dá leithéid a bheadh neamhspleách agus a mbeadh tuairimí láidre aige nó aici. Beidh an chuid is mó de fheidhmiú an Achta ag brath ar an gcoimisinéir.</P>
    <P>Mr. Fitzgerald: I wish to make some brief comments on this section. Senators Ó Murchú and Ryan have referred to the provision that the commissioner may prepare and publish commentaries on the practicable application and operation of the provisions. That is a central sentence in the Bill. It poses a fundamental question as to who owns the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="997" />I can only speak from my perspective and from the aggregate of my life experiences, growing up, going to school and college, teaching for 12 years and then coming into this House. I taught the Irish language as best I could for 12 years. I taught in an inner city school across the road from here. I tried to imbue a love of the language in the pupils and if I did nothing else I would be happy. I think there is a little bit of evidence of my efforts both around and outside the city to prove that.</P>
    <P>As somebody who was not very proficient in spoken Irish, I set out from the beginning to imbue a love of the language in my pupils. I am motivated by those factors and from the influences I had from my students and from the people around me who were all imbued with a love of this distinctly Nationalist identity which the language has. This is irrespective of the percentage of the population that uses it as daily speech.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a milestone in the development of the Irish language. It comes at a critical juncture. The Minister is at another crossroads, in a sense, as to the direction of the language in the future. This Bill belongs to everybody living in Ireland. It does not just belong to me as an Irishman but it belongs to every person living in this country, whether that person is an Irish citizen, a foreign citizen who is residing here or a citizen of another country who is staying here temporarily.</P>
    <P>The Bill is holistic and there is a flexibility and widely-embracing approach and philosophy underlying it. The Bill reaches out to people of all ages, nationality and culture who come to reside here. It demonstrates our welcome and friendliness towards them. It has a spirit of enablement, facilitation and encouragement. The Bill will be a success in making a significant advance in furthering the use of our native language.</P>
    <P>Some people use Irish every day in their daily lives and have Gaeilge ó dhúchas. I use Irish occasionally like many other people. We use Tá and Níl in this House during divisions. Many of us proudly sing the national anthem even when we cannot sing. There are many people who cannot speak any Irish but who are proud to sing the national anthem. There are those who welcome the appearance of bilingual road signs and bilingual publications. These people are also delighted by the fact that their friends are able to engage in bilingual social intercourse, even though they may not be able to participate to the degree they would wish.</P>
    <P>It is important not to target critical and crucial legislation of this nature at certain organisations that are professionally involved in the promotion of the language. It must also not just be targeted at teachers of the language or at places where the promotion of Irish is carried out in a structured way. It should be aimed at society in general. It would be a travesty if a message went out that the Bill is anything other than all-embracing in its <Col N="998" />approach and philosophy. This legislation seeks to reach out and encourage partnership in terms of the use of the language in the 21st century. The need for that partnership was emphasised yesterday by the Minister and Senator Ó Murchú.</P>
    <P>What is at issue here is the environment of Ireland. People say that the language is catered for under the Constitution and that it is the first official language of the people. That type of &ldquo;doff the hat&rdquo; attitude was prevalent in the past. I do not wish to personalise this but, as a teacher, the Acting Chairman will be familiar with the &ldquo;doff the hat&ldquo;/&ldquo;tá sé lá breá&rdquo; attitude. There is no such thing as doffing one's hat to the Irish language. I reject that kind of accusation. The perpetuation of allegations of that nature in the past did far more harm to the promotion of the Irish language than many other criticisms that were levelled at it.</P>
    <P>I referred yesterday to the informal way Bord na Gaeilge broke down so many barriers. Community organisations were pleased to embrace the spirit, promotion and vitality that seemed to emanate from Bord na Gaeilge. I witnessed this in my constituency where a number of community organisations, including shops and businesses, made a bilingual effort. This created a friendliness about the use of the language in ordinary everyday intercourse, whether shopping, socialising, having a drink in the pub or whatever. There was a friendly feeling that encouraged one to participate, which is very important. There should never again be an assertion among people who have a love for the promotion of the Irish language that A, B, C or D is a &ldquo;doff the hat&rdquo; merchant. That day has, hopefully, passed and we have entered a more enlightened period. We have learned from the experiences of other countries which are finding it difficult to promote the growth of their native languages.</P>
    <P>A medium which has helped to popularise the Irish language in recent times is TG4. I confess that I do not switch over to TG4 each night and decide to give myself half an hour of intensive listening and viewing of Irish language communication. However, I am drawn to TG4 through sport. While I participated in it most incompetently, I have a great love and passion for sport. I have a great passion for sports people and sports commentaries. The contribution TG4 has made, not just to sport but &ndash; through it &ndash; to popularising the use of Irish in an informal setting, has been monumental. I laud it loudly and enthusiastically for the manner in which it has done so.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that Dr. Éamonn Ó Hogáin recently edited an Irish-English dictionary of political terms, which was a fantastic initiative. I used it recently when making a contribution and it is a good ready reference. When speaking to the Minister outside the Chamber, I was pleased to hear that he has an idea in mind to publish a dictionary of terms or phrases that would be used in ordinary social intercourse. This is a marvellous idea and I encourage him to bring it to completion and promote it throughout the country. It would be a great promotional exercise in a very informal, <Col N="999" />friendly &ndash; I keep using the word &ldquo;friendly&rdquo; because it is key to this entire area &ndash; environment throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Irish is a central part of our uniqueness, distinct identity and nationhood. Every Irishman and Irishwoman, irrespective of whatever negative experiences they may have had growing up or going through school and facing people like me in the classroom, has within them the love of their nationhood. They have within them the acknowledgement that Irish is a central and key part of that nationhood. The central message of the legislation, which I warmly welcome, is that it is for the benefit of all the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Mr. McHugh: I welcome the holistic arguments Senator Fitzgerald put forward. We need to be careful in regard to the Irish language. If we choose a completely holistic approach, we might take our eyes off the ball.  In many Gaeltacht regions, there are native Irish speakers who have a capacity to speak in Irish. These people should be facilitated in every way possible. The amendments propose that district courts within Gaeltacht boundaries should have a facility for bilingualism for native Irish speakers. When I visit pubs in Gaeltacht areas, I hear native Irish language speakers but I cannot become involved in the conversation. These people are not being arrogant by speaking Irish. It is a defence mechanism which is being manifested because they feel that sufficient systems are not being put in place for them to speak Irish.</P>
    <P>There should be a two-tier approach in this regard. Native Irish speakers should be a facilitated as a priority. Any requirements necessary for native Irish speakers, including hearings in the Circuit Court and correspondence to and from Government Departments, should be facilitated. I would include myself in the category of people who feel the Irish language is an important component of Irish society. That was reflected by my participation in a summer school at Glencolumbkille, trying to refresh my Irish language skills. I signed up to the course available here in Leinster House and, hopefully, by next September, I will have refreshed my Irish even further. I am part of that section of the population, referred to by Senator Fitzgerald, that is eager to learn the Irish language but has had negative experiences in doing so. We should not use this as a crutch anymore. People should get on with it.</P>
    <P>There should be a facility for that grouping of people and that must be done through the community brief. I agree with Senator Fitzgerald's point on ownership, but in order to have ownership people have be empowered. The only way people can empower themselves is by initiating groups and committees. The committees can be set up, <i>ad hoc</i>, to organise table quizzes, getting Irish language signage for shops and placenames and involving people at local level. That is the second tier on which the Bill should be focused and which the Minister is looking at in holistic way.</P>
    <P>Sometimes people mistake it as arrogance <Col N="1000" />when they see an Irish speaker in a group who will not speak anything other than English. Native Irish language speakers feel angry that there are no proper mechanisms in place to facilitate them. We should never take our eye off the ball in facilitating and looking after a native Irish speaker.</P>
    <P>The language is sadly declining but, not looking at it pessimistically, it can be rejuvenated.</P>
    <P>Labhrás Ó Murchú: What Senator McHugh has just said should be made compulsory reading for everyone interested in the Irish language. We often hear about those who have not got a good command of Irish and we are concerned for them. Senator McHugh made an impassioned plea for the language, though he himself will be at some disadvantage as a result of the progress made by this Bill. He is right that there is anger, not among the people who are anti-Irish language, but among Irish speakers themselves who regard Irish as their language, be they from the Gaeltacht or outside.</P>
    <P>The Seanad has acknowledged on many occasions that one of the greatest developments in regard to the Irish language is the establishment of the gaelscoileanna. Now, there are waiting lists for these schools and situations where schools are seeking to expand in extra buildings. Native Irish speakers feel they have rights and want to ensure they are not seen as second-class citizens.</P>
    <P>Much that Senator McHugh has said actually underpins the Bill. We are disagreeing on one fraction of the approach. I take on board what Senator Ryan said, that the attitude in the House has been one of teamwork and co-operation. That is one of the reasons we have had no hostile debates in the House. Agus tá daoine &ndash; Senator Ryan agus mé fein agus daoine eile &ndash; ag labhairt Gaelige anseo sa tSeanad go minic.</P>
    <P>I feel many of the items that came up during the debate on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, have the same focus in the debate. How much should we write in stone? How far should we further the powers of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, the commissioner and the almost 300 associated bodies? They all will have not only the power but also the responsibility.</P>
    <P>When the passage of the Bill is finished, the message from the House should be that this is an historic development. It is powerful in its own right and underpins the right that already exists in Bunreacht. The major task will happen when the Bill is enacted. Much will depend on the speed at which we approach the task, the professionalism and the public relations.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Pat Kenny radio show when the officer responsible for bilingualism in Canada was in Dublin at the invitation of Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge. I was encouraged listening to the guests on the show at the absence of hostility on a mainstream radio programme to the Irish language. The Irish participants were, with a sense of pride, saying that they had done their education through Irish and had gone to the Gaeltacht. I could see a whole new impetus in <Col N="1001" />the language. I believe this is what is needed to underpin that.</P>
    <P>I will monitor the implementation of this new plan on a regular basis. I am sure it will be done by Deputies. We will ask questions to see how the Bill is working. We will ask the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, to discuss it in the House. This will not be put on a shelf; it will be an organic development. With the spirit shown by Senator McHugh and other Senators, the partnership we have established will be genuine and historic. I praise Senator McHugh for his last statement.</P>
    <P>Éamon Ó Cuív: Beidh ar an gcoimisinéir uair sa mbliain tuarascáil chuimsitheach a chur ar fáil don Teach ar imeachtaí na bliana faoi alt 31. Ar an ábhar sin, is rud breise é seo gur féidir leis tuarascála eile a réiteach agus sin an fáth go bhfuil alt 30 ann. B'fhéidir go bhféadfadh duine a rá gur cheart go mbeidís a mhalairt bhealach chuile thart, ach sin ceist eile ar fad.</P>
    <P>Tacaím go mór leis an gcineál smaoinimh atá ag an bpobal uilig don nGaeilge. Is í an teanga náisiúnta í, ní amháin do lucht labhartha na Gaeilge ach do mhuintir na tíre ar fad, is cuma an bhfuil Gaeilge acu nó nach bhfuil. Níl duine ar bith sa tír nach mbraitheann go mbaineann an Ghaeilge leis, a bheag nó a mhór, ar bhealach éigin. Tá an t-amhrán náisiúnta i nGaeilge, úsáideann gach duine téarmaí oifigiúla i nGaeilge agus tá súil agam go gcuirfidh an Bille seo le feiceáil na Gaeilge i measc an phobail, fiú i measc an phobail nach bhfuil Gaeilge acu.</P>
    <P>Ní ón nGaeltacht me. Rugadh agus tógadh i mBaile Átha Cliath mé. Ní bhfuair mé mo chuid oideachais trí Ghaeilge ach oiread. Murach gur teanga náisiúnta na hÉireann í an Ghaeilge, ní bheadh an oiread speise agam sa nGaeltacht ó thaobh teanga de. Is breá liom muintir na Gaeltachta ach is breá liom muintir na Galltachta fosta. Ní chreidim go leanfaidh muintir na Gaeltachta nó Gaeilgeoirí na tíre ag labhairt na Gaeilge muna bhfuil an Ghaeilge mar teanga náisiunta, mar ní tréibh faoi leith iad lucht labhartha na Gaeilge, is gnáth-Éireannaigh iad. Is gnáth-Ghaillimhigh nó gnáth-Thír Chonailligh nó gnáth-Chiarraíocha iad na daoine sna Gaeltachta ansin. Feictear sin agus aon cheann acu ag imirt i gcluiche cheannais. Mar sin, níl aon todhchaí ag an nGaeltacht, dar liomsa, ach mar chuid den náisiún iomlán.</P>
    <P>Tá an Bille seo ag freastal ar riachtanais na nGaeilgeoirí ach tá sé ag freastal chomh maith, ar an riachtanas coitianta atá ann imeasc an phobail agus ar éilimh na ndaoine a scríobhann chugam, &ldquo;I have no Irish but I was very disappointed to see that State company X has stopped putting up bilingual signs and they are all now in English only. I think this is retrograde&rdquo;. Faighim go leor de na litreacha sin. Tá an Bille seo chomh mór do na daoine sin agus atá sé don chainteoir dúchasach.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom tacú leis an méid atá ráite ag na Seanadóiri. Thagair an Seanadóir Fitzgerald do TG4. Tá rud amháin déanta ag TG4. Is é sin go bhfuil an Ghaeilge curtha aige i go leor seomra suite agus cistiní na tíre mar chuid nádúrtha de <Col N="1002" />shaol na seachtaine. Déanfaidh an Bille seo an rud céanna ina bhealach féin don Ghaeilge. Ag an am céanna caithfidh sé freastal ar riachtanais na ndaoine sin ar mian leo an chuid is mó dá saol a chaitheamh trí mheán na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Question, &ldquo;That the word proposed to be deleted stand,&rdquo; put and declared carried.</P>
    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <P>Mr. McHugh: I move amendment No. 62:</P>
    <P>In page 34, line 18, after &ldquo;commentaries&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;at least twice during his/her official term of office&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
    <P>Section 30 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 31.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 31 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Ryan: Aontaím le gach rud adúirt mo chomh-Sheanadóirí faoi thodhchaí na Gaeilge. Níl aon easaontas eadrainn faoi san.</P>
    <P>Tá ceist agam ar an Aire agus níl mé ag iarraidh a bheith cantalach. An gceapann sé go bhfuil sé ceart i gcónaí freagairt as Gaeilge do Bhaill an Tí seo a labhrannn Béarla leis? Molaim dó smaoineamh ar an gceist seo. Tá argóintí ar an dá thaobh di. Tá a fhios againn an saghas cainte a úsáideann Mícheál Ó Muircheartaigh nuair a athraíonn sé ó theanga go teanga agus tá an cumas sin ag an Aire. Tá an cheist seo dírithe orm féin chomh maith leis an Aire. Cé acu is fearr chun cabhrú le húsáid na Gaeilge ins na Tithe seo? Tá sé de nós ag Airí na Gaeltachta le fada gan ach Gaeilge a úsáid ach ba chóir smaoineamh faoi.</P>
    <P>Maidir le halt 31, rud atá ráite agam féin agus ag an Seanadóir Feargal Quinn go minic go bhfágaimid iomana ama ag eagraíochtaí Stáit chun tuarascála a chur le chéile. Tógfaidh sé ocht mí tar éis deireadh bliana go dtí go bhfoilseofar tuarascáil an choimisinéara don bpobal. Beidh sé mhí, ar a mhéad, aige chun na tuarascála a cur le chéile agus beidh dhá mhí ag an Aire chun smaoinimh faoi sula fhoilseofar é.</P>
    <P>Cén fáth go gcaithfidh an oiread sin ama a chur ar leataobh le tuarascáil bhliantiúil a chur le chéile agus a choimhéad in oifig an Aire sula bhfeicfidh an gnáth-duine é? Tá na tréimsí ama ró-fhada.</P>
    <P>Éamon Ó Cuív: Tá dá mhí ann mar caithfear é a chur faoi bhráid chruinniú den Rialtas agus má thiteann rudaí i rith dtréimhse saoire d'fhéadfaí bheith ag fanacht i lár an tsamhraidh ceithre seachtaine leis an chruinniú sin. Tógann sé seachtain nó coicís fosta é a chur faoi bhráid don Rialtas mar caitear a chur isteach seachtain roimh ré. Ansin caithfidh me dhul ar aghaidh agus an rud a chur faoi bráid na dTithe. Níl dhá mhí míreasúnta.</P>
    <P>Cíallaíonn an sé mhí le tuarascáil go gcaithfidh <Col N="1003" />sí bheith faighte ag deiridh mí na Meithimh má chríochnaíonn an bhliain ar an bhliain fheilire. Chuile uair a bhíonn cruinniú agam leis na Státseirbhísí sinsearacha den Roinn, téimid frid liosta de na comhlachtaí agus eagraíochtaí Stáit atá faoinár mbráid atá ceaptha tuarascáil bhliantúil a chur ar fáil. Sé ceann de na cráchroí a bhíonn orainn ná cloí le spriocanna ama. Bhí comhlacht amháin agus bhí náire orm mar bhí mé ag dul isteach le tuarascáil 2001 don Rialtas. Is historial artifact sin.</P>
    <P>Beidh ar an chomhlacht a dhéanamh laistigh de sé mhí. Dá bhfaighinnse chuile thuarascáil atá dlite agam mar Aire óna heagraíochta éagsúla taobh istigh de sé mhí, bheinn thar a bheith sásta. Breathnóidh mé air arís ach ar a laghad tá spriocdháta an-chinnte ansin. Dá n-éireodh liom gach ceann atá faoi mo chúram a fháil taobh istigh den am sin, ní bheadh mórán gearán ann.</P>
    <P>Is cuimhin liom nuair a ceapadh mar Aire Stáit mé, bhí nós ag mo Roinn aon cheist Dála faoin nGaeltacht a fhreagairt i nGaeilge. Bhí an ceart sin ag Airí ach bhí Teachta Dála amháin agus ní raibh aon Ghaeilge agus bhí sé beagnach trína chéile. Ó thaobh freagairt cheiste Dála, an gnáthrud a dhéanaim ná á freagairt sa teanga ina gcuirtear an cheist. Tá mé ag cloí leis an nós sin ó shin, go mór mór nuair is ceist ó Aire nó duine faoi leith mar glacaim leis go bhfuil an freagra ag teastáil ón duine sin go n-úsáidfear sa dáilcheantar é.</P>
    <P>Tá an Bille seo éagsúil ar dhá bhealach. Tá córas comhuaineach sa Teach so éinne a thiocfadh isteach anseo, bheadh sé díreach mar a bheadh sé i bParlaimint na hEorpa agus duine ag labhairt Fraincíse. Bheadh sé in ann dul i muinín an chórais aistriúcháin.</P>
    <P>Ní léir dom mórán speise ag na meáin Bhéarla san ábhar seo. Thug mé faoi deara arú aréir nár tugadh aon suntas don díospóireacht ar fad ag RTÉ ach oiread in &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; agus is cuma an raibh daoine ag labhairt i nGaeilge nó i mBéarla. Tá fíorspeis, áfach, ag na meáin Ghaeilge, na meáin leictreonacha agus na meáin scríofa ann. Tá siadsan ag cur dua orthu féin tuairiscí a réiteach bunaithe ar a bhfuil ráite anseo. Is éascaíocht don duine nach dtuigeann an Ghaeilge agam agus an dheis chomhuaineach ann le haistriúchán a fháil ar an bpointe ar an mBille is tábhachtaí a bhaineann leis an Ghaeilge. Is beart ciallmhar é a rá go mbeadh ar laghad taifead ag Raidió na Gaeltachta agus TG4 go bhféadfaidís a úsáid díreach mar atá sé mar tá speis acu san ábhar seo agus tá siad ag caint air le blianta nuair nach bhfuil speis ar bith ag na meáin Bhéarla. Sin an fáth go bhfuil me ag labhairt na Gaeilge le trí lá anuas.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Section 32 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 33.</P>
    <P>Mr. Ryan: I move amendment No. 63:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1004" />In page 36, lines 1 to 4, to delete subsection (1).</P>
    <P>I will have to speak in English, because I can neither understand nor pronounce some of the words in the Irish language version of section 33(1). To a degree it illustrates a point I was making yesterday about how, when we get involved in too much technicality, many of us tend to lose &ndash; or at least I do &ndash; our reasonable fluency in the language. I find it extraordinary that having gone through all of this we then say that if a public body produces a report under section 19(1) or produces a policy under that section, &ldquo;I gcás ina ndaingneoidh an t-Aire scéim faoin Acht seo, rachaidh an comhlacht poiblí ar aghaidh leis an scéim a chur i gcrích&rdquo;. Tá sé sin soiléir. A company or a body is supposed to do it once the scheme is put in place, but nobody can make it do it.  Is féidir leis an gcoimisinéir brú a chur orthu agus is féidir leis tuarascáil a chur ós comhair na Dála agus ós comhair an tSeanaid. Ach má theastaíonn ón gcomhlacht gan rud a dhéanamh níl aon slí ag éinne, ach amháin ag an gcoimisinéir, chun brú a chur air. Ní thuigim cén fáth go bhfuil an fo-alt san ann agus sin an fáth go bhfuil an leasú seo á mholadh.</P>
    <P>Éamon Ó Cuív: Tá an coimisinéir in ann a chinntiú go gcuirfear i bhfeidhm é ar an gcaoi céanna go bhfuil an tOmbudsman in ann a chur ina luí ar eagraíochtaí Stáit gníomhú dá réir. I gcás go dtarlaíonn sé ariamh go ndiúltaíonn an Stát-chóras do orduithe a thagann óna leithéid den gcoimisinéir teanga nó den Ombudsman atá bunaithe ag Oireachtas Éireann, ní dlí ach ain-dlí a bhéas sa tír.</P>
    <P>Mr. Ryan: Tá sé déanta ag an Rialtas seo. Dhiúltaigh sé moladh ón Ombudsman faoi cháin ioncaim a chur i bhfeidhm sé mhí ó shin.</P>
    <P>Éamon Ó Cuív: Tá sé á chur i bhfeidhm.</P>
    <P>Mr. Ryan: Níor cuireadh i bhfeidhm é.</P>
    <P>Éamon Ó Cuív: Tá sé á chur i bhfeidhm. Tá sé san mBille Airgeadais. B'fhéidir nár thug an Seanadóir faoi deara é, ach tá.</P>
    <P>Beidh deis ag Tithe an Oireachtais sa gcás go ndiúltaítear glan. Glacaim leis go seasfaidh Tithe an Oireachtais leis an rud a déarfadh an coimisinéir. Más fochomhlacht Stáit é glacaim leis go mbeidh ar an Aire ordú a thabhairt don fochomhlacht Stáit cloí le leagan amach an choimisinéara teanga. Sa chás go bhfuil mé mícheart agus go dteipeann go hiomlán ar chóras an choimisinéara is é a bheas le déanamh ná córas an choimisinéara a scrios agus córas dlí a chur ina áit.</P>
    <P>Is gnáth shaoránach mé féin. Uair amháin bhí orm dul chun cúirte ar mo shon féin i dtaobh rud sibhialta a bhain leis an nGaeilge, b'shin liostáil ar pháipéar ballóide &ndash; agus is aisteach nach féidir leis na meáin, go minic, an taobh ceart den scéal sin a fháil. D'iarr mé rialú ar chúirt agus chuaigh mé ann gan abhchóide mar ní raibh mí in achmhainn abhchóide a íoc. Rinne mé an cás seo a leanas: nuair atá tú ag liostáil ainmneacha i nGaeilge agus ag déanamh innéacs de ainmnea<Col N="1005" />cha  Gaeilge tá sé seafóideach an réamh-mhír Ní, nó Ó nó Uí a chomháireamh san innéacs. Má dhéanann tú é sin faigheann tú Uí Chuív, Ní Chuív agus Ó Cuív in áiteacha éagsúla san innéacs tar éis gur gach uile sheans gur den teaghlach céanna iad. Fuair mé rialú ón gcúirt go raibh an ceart agam ach feicim daoine fós &ndash; tráchtairí móra le rá agus cuid acu ina n-abhchóidithe &ndash; ag déanamh seafóide de seo agus ag rá gur rud neamhghaelach é tosú ar liosta ainmneacha le: Cuív, Éamon Ó; Cuív, Áine Uí; agus mar sin de. Ba cheart dóibh breathnú ar bhreithiúnas na cúirte. Tá a fhios ag éinne a bhfuil taithí aige ar an nGaeltacht nach ndeirtear tí Ó Catháin nó tí Ó Cúalán ach tí Chatháin agus tí Chúaláin. Déantar tagairt do Mhairtín Ó Cadhain go minic mar an Cadhnach agus ní mar an Ó Cadhnach. Sin an t-aon uair amháin a raibh ormsa dul chun cúirte faoi rud agus ní dhéanfainn é dá gcaithfinn dul i dtuilleamaí abhchóidithe agus mar sin de mar ní bheadh a luach agam, bheadh an iomarca anró ag baint leis agus an iomarca éiginnteacht ag baint leis faoin toradh.</P>
    <P>Sin an fáth go ndeachaigh mé bóthar an choimisinéara. Tá sé leagtha sa bplean go soiléir go gcaithfear freagra a fháil ar ais in nGaeilge má scrítear i nGaeilge. Má déantar faillí ar nós freagra i mBéarla a thabhairt ar litir i nGaeilge nach mbeadh sé éasca sin a fhágáil ag an gcoimisinéir agus a bheith cinnte go gcuirfidh an coimisinéir i gceart é gan aon chostas nó dua. Tá an focal dua thar a bheith tábhachtach ag an saoránach.</P>
    <P>Cuirim mo mhuinín sa choimisinéir mar creidim go bhfuil bunús leis faoin reachtaíocht atá molta. Bheadh sé seafóideach, mar sin, nach dtrustaimid an córas seo agus go bhfuilimid ag tarraingt córas cúirte isteach freisin. Sin an fáth go bhfuil mé ag seasamh leis an leagan amach atá anseo. B'fhearr liom an rud seo a choinneáil amach as na cúirteanna agus gléas éifeachtach a chur ar fáil don ghnáth-phobal gan dua agus gan costas. Is é mo thaithí ar ghnath-phobal, ar ghnáth-Ghaeilgeorí agus ar ghnáth-phobal na Gaeltachta go ndéanfaidh siad rud má tá sé éasca, áisiúil agus simplí. Má tá dua agus anró ag baint leis déarfaidh siad, &ldquo;Maise, tá Béarla agam&rdquo; agus gabhfaidh siad bealach an Bhéarla. Déanaimid uilig é, mé féin san áireamh. Ní smaoiním ar phlé le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta nó le mo Roinn féin i mBéarla. Ach déanaim gnó i mBéarla le cuid mhaith de na Ranna Stáit mar ní fiú an t-anró an trioblóid. Cuirfidh an coimisinéir é sin i gceart dom agus ní bheidh orm é sin a dhéanamh níosa mó.</P>
    <P>Ní cheist do na cúirteanna í seo. Is ceist don gcomisinéir í. Déanfar an t-uafás machnaimh ar an té a chuirfear i gceannas ar an oifig. Caithfidh duine éifeachtach a bheith ann a churfidh an córas seo i bhfeidhm go diongbháilte agus go seasmhach.  </P>
    <P>An Leas-Chathaoirleach: Is amendment No. 63 being pressed?</P>
    <P>Mr. Ryan: Dá mba rud é gur ardaíos leasú faoi éifeachtacht nó faoi cé acu is fearr do dhuine, an coimisinéir nó an chúirt, d'aontóinn leis an Aire. Aontaím leis ina iomlán go bhfuil sé níos fearr <Col N="1006" />agus níos simplí go bhfuil coimisinéir ann. Sin an fáth go bhfuil Ombudsman againn chomh maith.  Tá sé i bhfad níos éasca ag an ghnáth duine a bheith ábalta dul go dtí an Ombudsman chun deacrachtaí a bhaineann lena chearta dlí a shocrú.</P>
    <P>Tá sé mar an gcéanna lena lán rudaí, ach hí hionann é sin agus a rá nach bhfuil sé de cheart ag daoine dul os comhair na cúirte chun rud éigin a fháil. Is é an bunús leis na cearta atá agam mar shaoránach i gcónaí ná go bhfuil na cúirteanna ann chun iad a chosaint má dhéanann éinne iarracht iad a thógáil uaim. Ní hionann é sin agus a rá go mbímse os comhair na cúirte i gcónaí. Ní rabhas os comhair cúirte &ndash; parking and speeding fines excepted &ndash; ariamh. Ní rabhas os comhair cúirte ariamh ag lorg mo chearta daonna a chosaint. Ní raibh gá dom, mar glactar leis go bhfuil sé de chead agamsa dul os comhair na cúirte, agus, toisc go bhfuil sé de chead agamsa, cosantar mo chuid cearta. Is é sin an t-aon rud atá ann anseo.</P>
    <P>Níl mé ag iarraidh a rá nach bhfuil an tslí atá leagtha amach ag an Aire níos éifeachtaí. Níl mé a rá nach n-aontaím leis, ach deirim i gcónaí &ndash; mar a tharla leis an Ombudsman le déanaí &ndash; gur féidir le Rialtas diúltú agus gan moltóireacht ón Ombudsman a chomhlíonadh. Sin an rud a dhéanann an Rialtas. Glacann sé le cuid dá thuarascáil, ach ní ghlacann sé leis an tuarascáil ina iomlán. Is féidir leis na daoine i gceist dul os comhair na cúirte faoi, dá mba rud é gur theastaigh sé uathu é a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Sa Bhille seo, áfach, diúltaítear an cead sin do dhaoine. Beidh plean ann, agus má tá comhlacht Stáit ann nach bhfuil ag comhlíonadh an phlean, is é an t-aon fhreagra a bheidh ar fáil do dhaoine ná go gcuirfear tuarascáil os ár gcomhar anseo. Tá díomá orm, mar tá an Bille go léir lagaithe ag an fho-alt seo, agus ba chóir go dtógfaí amach as é. Tá súil agam go dtógfar amach as an mBille é sula rachaidh sé trí Thithe an Oireachtais.</P>
    <P>Ní úsáidfear an ceart go minic. Mar gheall ar an gcoimisinéir, is beag duine a bheidh ag dul os comhair na cúirte, ach tógann sé an bunús agus an bunstruchtúr. Déanann sé damáiste don mbunstruchtúr atá sa Bhille seo muna bhfuil ceart dlí ag daoine na polasaithe seo &ndash; I will say it in English, for it is a little complicated.</P>
    <P>This section essentially provides that one does not have the right to go to court to require a public body to act as it is supposed to do. It is as simple as that, and that idea is quite extraordinary. Arguments about effectiveness or efficiency are simply diversions, for the fundamental fact is that a citizen of this State will not be able to require a public body to do something which it is, we are told, legally obliged to do.</P>
    <P>I have interesting questions about whether this subsection is constitutional. They give people duties in law and then say that, even if they do not do as they are supposed to do, one cannot do anything about it other than write a report to the Oireachtas. It is an affront to the Bill's intent and has nothing to do with efficiency. It has to do with ensuring that people will have those rights only to the degree to which the Commissioner is satisfied to vindicate them. Where public bodies wish to be awkward, there is no process by which the <Col N="1007" />citizen can have his or her rights appropriately vindicated through the courts. The subsection is very wrong.</P>
    <P>Mr. McHugh: I know that the amendment is not my own, but if Senator Ryan is willing, I would like to add something. We are not on new ground here, for there was a similar experience in this respect on the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2002. The citizen's right is being interfered with here. Denying a right to the courts is a fundamental error, and I agree wholeheartedly with Senator Ryan.</P>
    <P>Éamon Ó Cuív: An t-aon rud nach féidir dul chun cúirte faoi ná alt 19(1) maidir le feidhmiú na bpleananna. Is féidir le duine dul chun cúirte faoi gach ceart eile. Ta sé lárnach do ról an choimisinéara an chuid sin a chur i bhfeidhm ar son an phobail ar fad. Tá aimhreas ormsa faoin díograis a bhíonn ar chomhairleoirí dlí an t-am ar fad an bealach a oscailt chun na cúirte. Cuirim an cheist orm féin i gcónaí cén fáth a bhfuil an oiread sin díograise ar lucht dlí an iliomad rudaí a bhfuil baint ag abhcóidí agus aturnaethe leo a thabhairt chun cúirte. Ar ndóigh, chuirfeadh lucht dlí comhairle i gcónaí ar dhaoine go mbeadh siad ag fáil airgid ar an iliomad bealaí ionas go gcaithfear airgead an Stáit in ionad a bheith ag déanamh an ruda agus ag cur an ruda ceart. Seachas é sin a dhéanamh, bíonn siad istigh i gcúirteanna agus i bhfiosrúcháin nó áit ar bith.</P>
    <P>Níl lucht dlí neamhspleách nuair a chuireann siad an chomhairle sin ar dhaoine, mar, ar ndóigh, cé atá ag déanamh buntáiste as an gcóras sin ach lucht dlí? Is minic a thagann daoine chugamsa sa dáilcheantar, agus iad ag bagairt dlí ar chomharsan as rud éigin, agus deirimse leo go minic gur cheart dóibh breathnú thart orthu féin agus ceist a chur cé hé an t-aon dream amháin a bhíonn ag déanamh gnó i gcúirt i gcónaí &ndash; na habhcóidí, na haturnaethe, agus an lucht dlí. Leis na táillí atá ann i láthair na huaire, ní bheag an gnó é.</P>
    <P>Tá an Bille seo ann chun leasa na Gaeilge, ní chun leasa éinne eile. Creidim fós, má bhíonn muinín ann as an gcoincheap maidir leis na pleananna, an Stát, agus an chaoi go gcaithfidh an Stát bheith freagrach do leithéidí an chomisinéara, go mbeidh an coimisinéir in ann cinntiú go gcloífear leis na pleananna. Tá an Bille fréamhaithe ansin. Tá sé le haghaidh gnáthsheirbhíse laethúla, agus tá sé fréamhaithe sa gcoincheap nach mbeidh ar an saoránach dul chun na cúirte le bunseirbhísí a fháil mar a bhí cheana.</P>
    <P>Gabh mo leithscéal má ta mé beagainín ciniciúil faoin mbrú síoraí atá á chur ag lucht dlí gach rud a chur os comhair na gcúirteanna. Go deimhin féin, leis an oiread airgid atá muid ag caitheamh ar tháillí cúirte, dá mbeadh an t-airgread sin againn, féadfaimis an t-uafás a dhéanamh leis na rudaí atá mícheart sa tsochaí seo, mar tá rudaí mícheart.</P>
    <P>Luadh daoine atá ar mhíchumas. Creidim gur iomaí rud a bhféadfaimis a dhéanamh do na daoine sin murach go bhfuil an oiread sin airgid á chaitheamh ar tháillí do lucht dlí, daoine a bhíonn ag éilimh &euro;2,500 in aghaidh an lae mar tháille le <Col N="1008" />seirbhís a dhéanamh. An lá go bhfeicfidh mise táillí réasúnacha ón lucht dlí &ndash; má chreideann siad chomh mór sin sa gceart agus seachas sna táillí atá á n-éileamh acu &ndash; sin an uair a thabharfaidh mé aird orthu nuair atá siad ag iarraidh chuile rud a bhrú isteach sna cúirteanna.</P>
    <P>Mr. Ryan: I have rarely in my life heard such a collection of populist nonsense.</P>
    <P>An Leas-Chathaoirleach: The Senator will agree that we have given the amendment a fairly good hearing.</P>
    <P>Mr. Ryan: I do not believe that we have. We have smokescreens, diversions and populist nonsense from the Minister and I cannot express adequately in Irish my indignation.</P>
    <P>The one time I almost ended up in court was as a prelude to what became the McKenna judgment. Two of the best barristers in the country were prepared to take the case on my behalf all the way to the Supreme Court for nothing. This populist nonsense that it relates to barristers making money is no more than that. It is a smokescreen and a diversion from the fact that the Minister will not give the citizens of the State the right to have enforced through the courts what these public bodies are supposed to do. If it is to be done through the courts, it will be done by barristers and solicitors who will probably do it for nothing. They may be paid if the body loses.</P>
    <P>My former colleague, Mary Robinson, who subsequently became President, took on hosts of cases involving poor people before the courts where she never had a guarantee of payment. When she won on many occasions, she quite correctly sought her full fees when costs were awarded to the plaintiff, but she never had any guarantee of payment in most cases.</P>
    <P>It is a diversionary smokescreen to refer to lawyers' fees. The issue is that the Minister will not give to pobal na Gaeilge the right to go to court to vindicate their rights. He wants to patronise them and do it for them. That is wrong. That is not a bill of rights for a minority in this country. It is a bill for patronage and patting on the head.</P>
    <P>Éamon Ó Cuív: Níl an Bille seo ann don mhionlach agus mhínigh mé é sin cheana. Tá sé ann don phobal ar fad agus do chuile dhuine sa phobal. Tá a fhios ag an Seanadóir Ó Riain gur oileadh gach éinne atá ag cleachtadh sna cúirteanna anois &ndash; iad siúd atá ar na mbinsí agus iad siúd atá ins na cúirteanna &ndash; sa chóras dlí..</P>
    <P>Mr. Ryan: Diversion.</P>
    <P>Éamon Ó Cuív: Má thógtar cás mar atá luaite ag an Seanadóir Ó Riain, tá seans maith &ndash; seans chomh maith agus a bheadh ag capall i rás nach raibh ann ach dhá chapall &ndash; go ndeirtear, fiú má chailltear an cheist, gur tógadh an cheist mar ní a raibh speis ag an bpobal innti agus go n-íocfar na táillí. Tuigeann na habhchóidithe é sin. Is fíor annamh i gcás mar sin nach n-íoctar na h-abhchóidithe ar an dá thaobh agus is fíor-annamh nach muide, na cáin íocóirí, a bhíonn á n-íoc. Tosóidh <Col N="1009" />mise ag éisteacht níos géire le lucht dlí nuair a thosós na táillí ag titim.</P>

    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>An Leas-Chathaoirleach: Amendments Nos. 67 to 72, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together by agreement.</P>
    <P>Mr. McHugh: I move amendment No. 67:</P>
    <P>In page 40, between lines 57 and 58, to insert &ldquo;Insurance Companies&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1010" />I have tabled these amendments in the spirit of the Bill. Will the Minister examine seriously the issue addressed by them? If the spirit of the Bill is to encompass a large section of organisations, then it is important to recognise in the First Schedule bodies which are not part of the public sector, which are separate from the Departments mentioned and which would be perceived as part of public life, such as insurance companies, the National Car Testing Service, the Referendum Commission, the Law Society of Ireland, the Honourable Society of King's Inns and the Bar Council of Ireland. The amendments request the Minister to ensure that the Bill includes these bodies in the spirit of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Mr. Ryan: B'fhéidir nach n-aontaím go hiomlán leis na leasaithe, ach tá ceist agam ar an Aire. Teastaíonn ó Chumann Onórach Óstaí an Rí agus Dlí-Chumann na hÉireann go mbeadh cumas na Gaeilge ag aon duine a fhaigheann cáilíocht uathu. Más mar sin atá sé, cén fáth nach mbéadh seo de dhualgas orthu? Faigheann an dá eagraíocht a dtábhacht agus a gcumhacht ón Stát toisc go dtugann sé an ceart dóibh déileáil le cáilíochtaí dlíodóirí idir barristers agus solicitors. Ní chím cén fáth nach mbéadh an dualgas ar an dá eagraíocht úd.</P>
    <P>Chuireann sé ionadh orm nach bhfuil an Coimisiún Reifrinn mar cheann de na heagraíochtaí go bhfuil téarmaí an Bhille de dhualgas orthu. Beidh an coimisiún ag obair agus ag feidhmiú sna Gaeltachtaí agus ar fud na tíre, agus tá súil agam go leanfar ar aghaidh leis. Ba chóir go mbéadh an dualgas céanna ar an gcoimisiún agus atá ar eagraíochtaí eile a bhaineann le toghcháin.</P>
    <P>Éamon Ó Cuív: Tá mé ag glacadh leis an leasú a bhaineann leis an gCoimisiún Reifrinn, sé sin leasú Uimh. 72. Maidir leis na leasaithe eile, glacaim leo i spiorad ach ní gá dom glacadh leo i scríbhinn agus míneoidh mé cén fáth. I gcás na leasaithe Uimh. 67 go 71, ceapaim go bhfuil seans ann go bhfuil míthuiscint ar an Seanadóir maidir le forálacha an chéad agus an dara alt den Chéad Sceideal a leagann na comhlachtaí poiblí a bheidh aitheanta mar chomhlachtaí poiblí chun críche an Achta. Ní thagann na comhlachtaí atá luaite sna leasaithe faoin bhforáil seo agus seo é an rud tábhachtach. Ina ionad sin, clúdaítear iad faoi alt 1(5) den Chéad Sceideal a bhfuil roinnt leasaithe á mholadh agam ina dtaobh. Ar an ábhar sin, seans go dteastódh an Seanadóir na leasaithe sin a tharraingt siar. Tá siad clúdaithe i alt 1(5) den Chéad Sceideal. Táim ag glacadh le spioraid iomlán an ruda atá an Seanadóir á rá, ach tá na heagraíochtaí ann cheana i bhfoirm eile. Táim ag glacadh le leasú Uimh. 72.</P>
    <P>Labhrás Ó Murchú: Tuigim an rud atá i gceist ag an Aire nach comhlachtaí poiblí atá anseo. Ag an am gcéanna, chun aon dul chun cinn fiúntach a dhéanamh maidir le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge i measc an phobail, beidh sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go mbéadh na comhlachtaí sin ar fad sa chóras. Fé mar a dúirt an t-Aire, tá slite eile chun é a dhéanamh. Cuireann sé díomá orainn uilig go mbíonn ar na heagrais deonacha i gcónaí bheith <Col N="1011" />ag seasamh an fhóid agus ag troid, ag lorg gnáth cúirtéise fiú, ó chomhlachtaí áirithe. Ní chóir go mbéadh sé sin amhlaidh. Ba chóir go n-aithneofar freisin gurb iad na heagrais Gaeilge céanna a bhí in ann a chinntiú go bhfuil an dea-thoil a bhfuil ann anois ann. Is iad siúd a lean ar aghaidh nuair a bhí na meáin cumarsáide agus dreamanna eile thar a bheith naimhdeach ó thaobh na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Bhí na meáin agus dreamanna eile thar a bheith naimhdeach ó thaobh na Gaeilge de. Tá sinn sean go leor le smaoineamh siar ar cé chomh naimhdeach agus a bhí na díospóireachtaí ag an am sin. Ní cheist ionannais a bhí ann.</P>
    <P>Bhí siad thar a bheith nimhneach ó thaobh stádas na Gaeilge. Féach cad é tá tar éis tarlú, áfach. Is féidir le héinne teacht suas agus a rá cad in a thaobh go bhfuil sin amhlaidh.</P>
    <P>Cabhróidh an Eorap linn fiú. Tabhair faoi deara nach sinne an t-aon tír amháin atá ag iarraidh teanga a chaomhnú agus a chur chun cinn agus stádas ceart a thabhairt don teanga sin. Ní ghá ach féachaint ar an Fhrainc agus ar an Ghearmáin. Ní amháin go bhfuil siad ag iarraidh teanga a chaomhnú, tá siad thar a bheith daingean in a dtuairimí nach bhfuil aon teanga eile chun tús áite a bheith aici ar a dteangacha siúd.</P>
    <P>Caithfimid aithint a thabhairt do no heagrais agus na scoileanna. Tá an-mheas againn ar obair na mBráithre Críostaí ar feadh na blianta ó thaobh chur chun cinn na Gaeilge agus bíonn dearmad déanta air sin go minic. Tá an sárobair déanta ag na daoine a bhí báúil leis an dteanga agus a bhí ag saothrú na Gaeilge. Thug siad an bunchloch dúinn agus ní chóir go mbeadh leisce ar an chomhlacht atá ag saothrú sa tír seo agus atá ag brath ar saoránaigh na tíre a bheith mar chuid den pháirtnéireacht seo.</P>

Foráiltear faoin leasú seo go dtagann cuideachtaí a fheidhmíonn faoi cheadúnas ó Stát cosúil le banc tracthtála, gníomhaireacthaí eile a thugann iasachtaí, cuideachtaí arachais agus cuideachtaí teileachumarsáide faoin bhforáil seo.

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Second Schedule, as amended, be the Second Schedule to the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Ryan: Faoi fo-alt (3) den Dara Sceideal, más rud é i gcás duine a shealbhaíonn oifig an choimisinéara, go n-ainmeofar é nó í mar chomhalta den Seanad, an bhfuil sé fíor go mbeadh an coimisinéir ábalta páirt a ghlacadh i dtoghchán agus fanacht mar choimisinéir go dtí go gcuirfí na torthaí ar fáil? Más rud é gur féidir, ba cheart an Bille a athrú. Ní chóir go mbeadh duine mar seo ag glacadh páirte i bpolaitíocht. Leagtar síos go bhfuil sé le bheith neamhspleách agus ní chífar é a bheith mar sin má tá sé de chead aige páirt a ghlacadh i dtoghchán.</P>
    <P>Éamon Ó Cuív: Is pointe cíallmhar sin. Seiceáilfidh mé. Glacaim gur foráil chaighdeánach é seo a tógadh as Acht an Ombudsman. <Col N="1013" />Déanfaidh mé scrúdú air agus tiocfaidh mé ar ais ar Chéim na Tuarascála.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy): I am pleased to have this opportunity to report back to the House on the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003, as passed by Dáil Eireann. The Bill completed all Stages in this <Col N="1014" />House on 20 March 2003 after some 27 hours of debate. Yesterday, the Bill completed all Stages in the Dáil after a total of 39 hours debate, comprising 11 hours on Second Stage, 24 hours on Committee Stage and four hours scheduled for Report and Final Stages.</P>
    <P>The Bill was also considered by the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, which heard oral evidence from a number of interested parties including the members of the high level group, the Information Commissioner, the National Union of Journalists, the One in Four group and others. These hearings lasted for a total of 11 hours. In addition, the Labour Party Bill was discussed for one and a half hours in Private Member's time in the Dáil. This Bill has been discussed by the Oireachtas for some 78 hours in total. Senators will agree that ample time was devoted to the passage of the legislation, despite repeated criticism from members of the Opposition that it was being rushed through the parliamentary process without proper examination.</P>
    <P>As I indicated previously, this is a narrowly focused Bill, the purpose of which is to extend necessary protection to certain sensitive Government records to ensure the effective functioning of the Cabinet process, to ensure the efficient operation of the FOI legislation and to clarify certain technical procedures under the Act.</P>
    <P>Despite some of the more dramatic comments made in both the Houses and the media, the Bill does not represent a fundamental overhaul in the operation of FOI legislation. It is a balanced package of limited measures which has been framed on the basis of five years of experience of operating the Act. It strikes the right balance between openness and transparency, on one hand, and proper functioning of Government, on the other. In common with other organisations, the Government must be able to ensure that its examination of important issues can be concluded effectively and that its collective responsibility for decisions can be exercised.</P>
    <P>One of the cornerstones of the current FOI legislation is that members of the public should have access, to the greatest possible extent, to records held by public bodies which contain personal information about them. There is no change in the definition of personal information in the principal Act. Consequently, access to personal information will remain unchanged after the enactment of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I wish to report to the House on the amendments which have been made to the Bill during its passage through the Dáil. Senators have copies of the full text of the Bill as amended by the Dáil. A list of the amendments passed by the Dáil has also been circulated.</P>
    <P>Senators will recall that one of the proposed amendments contained in the Bill, as initiated and discussed in this House, was the provision to amend section 6 of the principal Act by substituting the word &ldquo;contain&rdquo; for the phrase &ldquo;relate to&rdquo; in paragraph (<i>b</i>) of subsection (5) dealing with <Col N="1015" />personal information. The purpose of this amendment was to clarify the position regarding the right of access to personal records in the light of a judgment delivered by the High Court. It was not the intention to limit access to personal information, but rather to provide decision-makers with clarity in making decisions on foot of requests for access to this type of information and to ensure consistency of approach in this area. This amendment became the subject of public controversy during the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas. Members on both sides of the House expressed concerns that the amendment would result in a diminution, however unintentional, of an individual's right to obtain personal records. These concerns were particularly articulated in the submission of the One in Four group to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service during its public hearings.</P>
    <P>While I continue to hold the view that the original provision would not have interfered with the right of access to personal information, I listened carefully to the concerns expressed about the amendment. In light of these, I decided that it was important to provide reassurance to the public about the Government's total commitment to the principle of full access to personal information to the greatest possible extent as enshrined in the Long Title to the principal Act. This is in line with the Government's track record when related concerns about the interaction between individuals and public bodies have arisen in other contexts. As no alternative solution for achieving clarity in this area was proposed during the debate on the Bill, I agreed on Committee Stage in the Dáil to accept the proposal to delete the relevant section.</P>
    <P>The question of access to personal information also arose during the debate on the proposed amendment to section 22 of the principal Act which relates to the work of tribunals and inquiries. The general intention here is to provide protection for records relating to the work of tribunals and inquiries. Concerns were expressed that, because of the mandatory nature of the proposed exemption, access to personal records would be denied to individuals if the records in question held by public bodies had been submitted to a tribunal. In order to redress this situation, I accepted an amendment on Committee Stage in the Dáil to provide for a discretionary &ldquo;may refuse&rdquo; provision rather than the mandatory &ldquo;shall refuse&rdquo;. This will enable decision-makers to release personal information to a requester, even if the records in question have been submitted by a public body to a tribunal. I also moved an amendment to clarify that the exemption for records relating to tribunals and inquiries will not apply when the tribunal or inquiry has completed its work.</P>
    <P>In response to an Opposition amendment, I brought forward an amendment on Report Stage in the Dáil to provide that records relating to the general administration of tribunals are not <Col N="1016" />covered by the protection of section 17. This is in line with the existing situation under section 46 of the principal Act covering tribunals established under the Tribunals of Inquiry Act 1921.</P>
    <P>I am fully satisfied that the changes I have outlined will facilitate access by individuals to personal information to the greatest extent possible consistent with the spirit of the Act. Senators will recall that, on Report Stage in the Seanad, I indicated that I would be bringing forward amendments in two areas. First, an amendment was made to section 47 of the principal Act to give specific power to the Minister for Finance to vary the up-front fee for certain categories of requester. Second, amendments were made to sections 17 and 18 of the principal Act to permit applications by parents, guardians or the next of kin for amendment of incorrect personal information, and for statements of reasons for decisions taken by public bodies. These amendments are contained in section 30 &ndash; at paragraph (<i>d</i>) &ndash; and sections 12 and 13, respectively.</P>
    <P>I also introduced two amendments on Committee Stage in the Dáil to provide for annual reporting to the Information Commissioner of certificates issued by the Secretary General to the Government in respect of committees of officials established by Government and certified to support the work of Cabinet and of certificates issued by Secretaries General of Departments of State in respect of deliberative processes. The relevant provisions are in sections 14 and 15.</P>
    <P>In addition to the amendments already outlined, I have included a number of operational amendments dealing with issues that arose since the publication of the Bill. While these are technical in nature, I will outline them briefly for the information of the House: incorporation in the Bill of the three regulations, made under the 1997 Act, which deal with the FOI commencement date for local authorities, the operation of section 6(9) of the principal Act covering records held by persons providing services under contract to public bodies and the protection of personal information in the case of records containing joint personal information &ndash; section 4 refers; an amendment to section 17 was made to provide that a head cannot release a record where he or she ought reasonably to have known that the record had already been released under a court order of discovery &ndash; this has been recommended by the Office of the Attorney General as a protection for decision-makers against committing contempt of court; amendments were made to section 25 to address an anomaly in the principal Act whereby a person holding both the Information Commissioner's and Ombudsman's offices can hold a third office, while a person holding only one of the two offices is barred from holding a second office; an amendment was made to extend the time allowed for appealing decisions of the Information Commissioner to the High Court from four weeks to eight weeks, this has been recommended by the Office of the Attorney General as the four weeks is considered <Col N="1017" />insufficient in the context of the legal complexity of the issues arising &ndash; section 27 refers; and an amendment was made to section 28 to provide that a decision of the Information Commissioner should not, in itself, reveal exempt information. For example, in a case involving a risk to personal safety, this amendment will allow the full grounds for a decision to refuse to be withheld. The principal Act already contains such a provision for public bodies. There are also a number of drafting amendments proposed by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to bring legal clarity to the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Bill is a balanced approach containing sensible and practical measures to allow the Government and the public service to work effectively and maintain access by the public to information, particularly any personal information that may be held about them. I thank Senators from both sides of the House for their contributions to a very lively and constructive debate on the Bill.</P>
    <P>Mr. Higgins: I will be very brief because we know this is already a <i>fait accompli </i>and that we simply have to go through the motions. I am at a loss as to the reason the amendments introduced in the Dáil, welcome and all as they are, were not brought forward on Report Stage in this House. If it was proposed to change the Bill or relent in any way, the Minister could have done us the courtesy of introducing whatever ministerial amendments were going to be made on Report Stage in the Seanad. After all, this is a Seanad Bill, yet only on Report Stage in the other House, the Bill having passed through the select committee, did the Minister to decide to bring about these changes, small and all as they are. Rather than having a game of legislative ping pong from this to the other House and back again, it would have made absolute sense to introduce whatever amendments the Minister was prepared to concede in this House in which there was an extensive debate on Second, Committee Stage and Report Stages.</P>
    <P>My attitude to the Bill has not changed because it is one of the most pernicious ever to come before either House of the Oireachtas. The decision to withdraw the section that would have prevented victims of child sexual abuse from accessing relevant records is welcome. This would have prevented grieving parents, for example, from getting details of organ retention from hospitals. It is a sensible move. Even though the Minister still holds the line that there would not have been interference with the existing processes, procedures and rights, he has, by virtue of the fact that he brought forward this amendment, accepted the persuasiveness of the arguments made not alone by the Members of these Houses but by the other groups which appeared before the joint committee to make their arguments on the contents of the Bill. It is a small but sensible and welcome concession.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendments fail to address, <Col N="1018" />however, the central thrust of the Bill &ndash; to impede the public's right to know. They also fail in that there has not been adequate consultation. The Minister has listed the bodies which appeared before the joint committee but a host of other bodies did not have the opportunity of appearing before it because of the deadline and time restriction involved. In eight days time, on 18 April, the five-year rule would have come into operation and Cabinet documents from five years ago would have been made available.</P>
    <P>The amendments fail to take cognisance of the legitimate views of the Ombudsman or the Information Commissioner. One of the bodies to have come out of the closet in the past week or ten days has been the Human Rights Commission, one of the products of the Good Friday Agreement. As I said earlier, we wish the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister well in their ongoing deliberations today. We hope they bring matters to a satisfactory conclusion and that the Assembly and the Executive in Northern Ireland will again be up and running shortly, giving power back to the people of Northern Ireland rather than having direct rule.</P>
    <P>By comparison with our counterparts in the North, we were very tardy in introducing the Human Rights Commission. However, it came out very forcefully last week and stated it felt affronted at the fact that it was not consulted on the Bill. After all, there are fundamental human rights involved in this insidious, pernicious legislation and the commission should have been consulted.</P>
    <P>We acknowledge that the 1997 Act was ground-breaking and went much further than its equivalent in other jurisdictions. It did a public service. First, it exposed massive incompetence in the conduct of ministerial business, for example, in relation to how the national stadium, or &ldquo;Bertie bowl,&rdquo; was handled. This Bill does something that will be undoubtedly challenged by extending the concept of government. It broadens the definition of what constitutes government way beyond what would seem to be provided for in the Constitution. There is no doubt that in this area the Bill would seem to fly in the face of the Constitution but that remains to be seen and tested.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Bill blocks access to Government records for a ten year period. It blocks access, for example, to ongoing dialogue between Ministers. As I said before in the House, from the point of view of openness and transparency &ndash; the buzz words again used by the Minister today &ndash; it is good that the people should see clearly how things operate. This builds public confidence in the process of government and how it works, yet details of even the most trivial, menial exchanges between Ministers will be blocked by the Government. This is an assault on the concept of open government.</P>
    <P>I will briefly deal with a number of the amendments the Minister is now proposing. The proposal, for example, to provide details of the num<Col N="1019" />ber of certificates is a concession but of what relevance is it to give the number of certificates without giving the actual content or the topics involved therein? It is totally unsatisfactory. It is only right that all certificates linked to tribunals be made available. In the other House, Deputy Richard Bruton made a very strong argument that, for example, a harm test could be put in place to determine whether the release of particular documents in relation to tribunals would prejudice the workings of a tribunal. There should be absolutely no question whatsoever of personal records linked to a tribunal being protected from the individual concerned. Again, in the case of a child being abused, parents should have access to the relevant records. Access to records relating to general administration, for example, should not be closed down. For example, the Director of Public Prosecutions should be obliged to account for the official administration of his office. Surely nobody could claim that calling the Director of Public Prosecutions to book in relation to the management and administration of his office presents in any way a security threat to the State.</P>
    <P>The President should refer the Bill to the courts to test its constitutionality. As has been asked repeatedly in these Houses, what is the Government afraid of in relation to the provisions of the existing legislation? They have worked well and been lauded by all and sundry here and abroad and held up as a good model in the attempt to bring openness and transparency to the process. What skeletons lie in the cupboard that would have been revealed on 18 April?</P>
    <P>In procedural terms, I am at a loss as to the reasons the amendments brought forward by the Minister today were not made initially in this House. The Minister said this was a balanced package of measures &ndash; far from it. This is an iron curtain measure. It brings the iron curtain down on the fundamental right to access to information that is important in terms of understanding how the process of government works. I am as vehemently opposed to the Bill now as I was when we dealt with it here on Second, Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    <P>Mr. Moylan: I welcome the Minister back to the House. He has outlined the detailed examination this Bill has gone through and noted the length of time devoted to it here, the select committee and the Dáil. He has said that, to date, we have spent 78 hours debating it. It has been dealt with in great detail.</P>
    <P>I agree wholeheartedly with the Bill. As a member of a local authority and a health board, I am aware of the huge amount of time spent unnecessarily as a result of cranks making freedom of information requests. There have been huge costs in areas where people have been very busy trying to get information, a lot of it simply requested by people with a chip on their shoulder to try to embarrass someone. They had little clear <Col N="1020" />sense of the reason they were looking for the information. I accept the Opposition point that people are entitled to reviews. If people read the Bill in detail, they will see it is a good measure which will substantially improve the principal Act.</P>
    <P>The most relevant section of the Bill relates to Cabinet confidentiality and Cabinet records. Information would have been released into the public domain after five years while Ministers were still in the same Departments. It would have caused a real problem and, therefore, I agree wholeheartedly with the extension. In my opinion, the timeframe should have been extended further.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill. Many of the Opposition opinions and views were expressed to play to a particular gallery. I compliment the Minister and the Ministers of State who participated in the debate on the Bill while it was before House. A lot of muck was thrown in regard to why people took particular stances.</P>
    <P>Mr. Higgins: Not by this party.</P>
    <P>Mr. Moylan: This is a top-class Bill on which much time was spent. The Leader allowed as much time as was necessary to enable people to discuss it and I understand the same was the case in the Lower House. Every section was gone through with a fine-tooth comb.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and his officials on a first-class Bill. No Bill has come through the House which has not had to be looked at again or changed in some way. This is excellent freedom of information legislation for the people.</P>
    <P>Dr. Henry: I welcome the Minister but not the Bill. I am as opposed to it as I was in the first instance. I am sorry I was not here for the Order of Business this morning to vote against the speed with which the Bill has gone through both Houses. The reason I was not here is rather ironic. I was in Dublin Castle at the Forum on Europe, which is chaired by Senator Maurice Hayes who also has concerns about this Bill. At the meeting in question, we addressed the proposed charter of rights for Europe. Baroness Scotland, one of the UK delegates to the Convention on Europe, spoke, as did a former Minister, Dick Burke. One of the conclusions reached during the debate was that rights were of little use if one could not vindicate them. This is another instance of where the people will be less able to vindicate their rights than heretofore. I very much regret the passage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister changed the situation which would have impinged on the individual and against which I and others spoke, namely, whether a file had to contain information on or information relating to an individual which would also have been considered a sufficient reason to allow them to look at it.</P>
    <P>The Minister is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut in regard to much of the remainder of the <Col N="1021" />Bill. I have not heard one person in either House speak against extending, from five to ten years, the confidentiality period relating to Government papers. No one was concerned about that, but people are concerned about the extension in regard to what can be described as Government or Cabinet papers. As stated on Second Stage, if two or three officials gather together in the Government's name provisions relating to the confidentiality of Government papers can be invoked.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Government is so intent on bringing in the legislation. Rumour is always much worse than fact and the only facts which could be any way embarrassing are the exchange of letters between the Minister for Finance and the Ministers for Health and Children and Transport. If the Minister for Finance did not write to the Minister for Health and Children to ask him what he was doing with the money he was sending him on behalf of the taxpayer, I would think it was very peculiar. If the Minister for Health and Children did not write back requesting more money, I would think he was equally in dereliction of his duty in terms of trying to do something on behalf of the patients and staff with whom he must deal in the health service. The same applies to the Minister for Transport.</P>
    <P>I cannot think of what information has come into the public arena which has caused anyone in the current or previous Government any embarrassment. I do not know the reason for this change unless there is something that people think will come out which they do not want to come out.</P>
    <P>I very much regret this Bill because our freedom of information legislation was considered very useful, although occasionally it reached pathetic levels when questions were asked about who spent what on meals on the Visa card &ndash; matters one is obliged to list under expenses in any event. The situation was very satisfactory and I do not see how it was damaging the Government. I very much regret the changes the Minister has made.</P>
    <P>Ms Feeney: I welcome the Minister. My remarks will echo those of Senator Moylan.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on the Bill, particularly on the amendments. Unlike Senator Higgins, I believe they are welcome and important, regardless of what stage or in which House they were accepted. As Senator Moylan pointed out, there are areas of Departments and of Cabinet business which are so sensitive that there must be more than a five-year ban. Every right-thinking citizen accepts that. In the early stage, I had a concern about personal records but it was laid to rest when I read the Bill.</P>
    <P>Like my colleagues, I have no hesitation in welcoming the Bill. I say well done to the Minister on what is excellent legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1022" />
    </P>
    <P>Mr. Quinn: I, rather like Senator Henry, spoke strongly about the Bill on Second Stage. I was very upset not so much by the detail of the Bill, but by the way in which it was sprung on us. This Bill was published on a Friday, we received it in the post the following Monday and we came in here on the Tuesday and had to pass it within days, which is not the way legislation should go through the House. We then discovered it was being taken quickly today.</P>
    <P>Listening to the Second Stage debate and the explanations on Committee Stage, there was much logic in what the Minister was attempting to do. As Senator Henry said, there were some areas about which we had no concerns.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry has just come from the Forum on Europe, while I was with the Vice-President of the Commission, Neil Kinnock, for the past hour or so. He said his job was administrative reform in Europe and he talked about the need for administrative reform, transparency, openness and the need to sell Europe to people. It is much easier to do that if people understand what is going on.</P>
    <P>We could have done a much better job with the Bill if we had taken our time, if it had not been sprung on us and if we had ensured that the aspects of it which are worthy got the attention they should have received. We had set high standards for the rest of Europe to follow, but we have lowered them to a certain extent. We could have made this a better Bill. I am sorry it has come through the House in this way. It is seldom a Bill goes through the House after which we do not stand up to congratulate everybody on it. I hope we will look at the Bill every five years &ndash; as we should do with all legislation &ndash; to see if it needs adjustment. Let us make sure the next time we do that, we give the Bill our full attention and have the time to do so.</P>
    <P>Mr. Leyden: I welcome the Minister and his excellent staff who brought this Bill through both Houses. It is extraordinary that 27 hours were spent debating the Bill in this House and 39 hours in the Lower House.</P>
    <P>There was much misinformation about the Bill, not from the Minister but from the Opposition.</P>
    <P>Ms O'Meara: It is freedom from information.</P>
    <P>Mr. Leyden: Freedom of information. The Bill was to be amended according to the Act. Much has happened since.</P>
    <P>I have never availed of the Freedom of Information Act in my work as a public representative, chairman of the Western Health Board or in any position I held as a councillor. I have never received a request from a constituent to avail of it. Only a small minority do so. There is a tremendous opportunity to obtain total information through the Oireachtas and parliamentary questions, of which I availed often in my time as a Member of Dáil Éireann and to which I replied <Col N="1023" />as a Minister of State. Those answers were given freely and openly with all information provided.</P>
    <P>The Government made a great decision in appointing Ms Emily O'Reilly as Information Commissioner. In anticipation of the recommendation of this House to the President, I welcome her appointment. If ever the Minister wanted to ensure freedom of information, he would appoint an eminent journalist such as Ms O'Reilly. The appointment is proof of his bona fides in this regard. One could not find a more independent minded person to become Information Commissioner and Ombudsman. If the Minister had any intention of trying to limit freedom of information, he would not have appointed somebody as eminent and independent as Ms O'Reilly. The recommendation of this House to the President for her appointment will be unanimous.</P>
    <P>Those in this House and anyone with experience in public life will know that Ms O'Reilly has been extremely effective as a journalist. She did not have to rely on the Freedom of Information Act to write her stories because she had good access and wrote well. One year from now, when the commissioner brings forward her report on the workings of the Bill, we will be pleasantly surprised to find that it has been working extremely well. I commend the Minister for supporting the Bill but also for being prepared, when issues arose, to make amendments to be doubly sure. If anyone had concerns, he made it quite clear that information had to be made available.</P>
    <P>The changes have clearly not affected the rights of individuals to access information. The Minister might confirm that charges were dispensed with in regard to individuals seeking their own records. I think he accepted this in regard to the 1997 Act.</P>
    <P>Mr. McCreevy: There were no charges then.</P>
    <P>Mr. Leyden: What more does the Opposition want than freedom of information for individuals without charges? Where are we going? </P>
    <P>I realise that members of the Opposition are keen to be well in with the press and the media &ndash; RTE, INN, etc. Freedom of information provides a great means for journalists. They think up an idea and put in a freedom of information request on, for example, what took place between the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, with regard to the health service. It is a great idea; the report comes out and the journalist publishes his or her exclusive in, for example, the <i>Sunday Independent </i>without even having to write the story. All he or she has to write is the byline.</P>
    <P>Members of the Opposition are anxious &ndash; some are more anxious than others &ndash; to be well in with the press. That is understandable as one must have something when in opposition. The <Col N="1024" />Members opposite do not have much else going for them.</P>
    <P>Mr. P. Burke: It is hardly the Opposition which is leaking the information.</P>
    <P>Mr. Leyden: The Opposition is a desperate group.</P>
    <P>Ms O'Meara: Did the Senator read the polls recently?</P>
    <P>Mr. Leyden: I sometimes think a preservation order should be put on Fine Gael which will be as obsolete as the corncrake if something does not happen soon.</P>
    <P>Mr. P. Burke: The Senator has the corncrakes in County Roscommon smothered.</P>
    <P>Mr. Leyden: Fine Gael cannot change its leader because pretty soon every member will have been leader. Every member will become party leader for six months and the party will then find out who was the best. The party will probably revert back to Mr. Alan Dukes or Deputy John Bruton at that stage.</P>
    <P>Acting Chairman (Mr. J. Walsh): The Senator should make his points relevant to the debate.</P>
    <P>Mr. P. Burke: The Senator is taking a keen interest in Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>Mr. Leyden: I am, because I am concerned about the party. The Government needs it because it is easier to handle than some of the new parties such as the Green Party and others. They have access to a lot of information.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party is an excellent one, despite its links with Democratic Left. I would like to put in a freedom of information request to find out what happened in Moscow when the current Labour Party president went over to collect a few bob, or when he wrote to North Korea for a little fund for the party of which he was then a member.</P>
    <P>Mr. McCreevy: That information has been burnt.</P>
    <P>Ms O'Meara: Ansbacher would be more relevant.</P>
    <P>Mr. Leyden: Even the typewriter used to type Mr. De Rossa's letter has disappeared.</P>
    <P>Acting Chairman: These amendments must be more extensive than I thought.</P>
    <P>Mr. Leyden: When I was a Member of Dáil Éireann, I said to the current president of the Labour Party that I believed he had been a member of the IRA. He denied it emphatically to the extent that I had to withdraw the allegation. <Col N="1025" />Some years later he freely admitted that he had been a member but that is another story.</P>
    <P>Mr. P. Burke: The Senator might go any way on this Bill yet.</P>
    <P>Mr. Leyden: We can go further. I have a lot of information on what happened in Moscow at the time. The million was there. I also remember a machine that produced £5 notes on the quays.</P>
    <P>Ms O'Meara: Were they in the Ansbacher accounts?</P>
    <P>Mr. Leyden: The man who produced them was never caught and is still on the run. The machine was captured, as far as I remember.</P>
    <P>Mr. McCreevy: The man was caught also but he disappeared.</P>
    <P>Mr. Leyden: The Minister for Finance who must ensure fiscal rectitude is the only person who can produce euros in this country, not a political party which thought itself free to produce its own money at one stage. It was a wonderful idea in that the money did not have to be returned to the commission.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, put tremendous effort into the Bill when they were also otherwise engaged.</P>
    <P>Mr. McCreevy: I could have done with a free printing press for that week.</P>
    <P>Mr. Leyden: We were very impressed with the Minister's representation of a constituency that has a great interest in the equine industry. It is vital that industry is developed in every possible way. However, very unfair comments were made during that period. The Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, and his staff were excellent with regard to the presentations made to this House.</P>
    <P>I make no apology to the outgoing Information Commissioner, Mr. Kevin Murphy. I reiterate that it is not the commissioner's task to comment on any Bill before this House, as I said publicly to him. Furthermore, at the time of the commissioner's recommendations, Government officials did not have an opportunity to assess and process his views on the Bill before the House. When they had that opportunity, they came back with logical explanations with regard to the views expressed by the commissioner and his views were considered by the Minister and his officials.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House. I thank the Minister for the great effort he has put into it. He has taken a lot of unfair abuse. Those who know him would never accuse him of suppressing information about anything. He has spoken openly about his views on fiscal rectitude and his parliamentary party since 1982 or 1983 when he was in the wilderness. He suffered all kinds of abuse at the time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1026" />
    </P>
    <P>Mr. Higgins: Was the Senator backing him at the time?</P>
    <P>Mr. Leyden: I was a good friend of his then as now.</P>
    <P>Mr. Higgins: Did the Senator back him?</P>
    <P>Mr. Leyden: The difference was that I was where he is now and he was where I am. A Minister must bear collective responsibility. The Minister for Finance has brought forward a Bill which is more than adequate to satisfy the needs of the Irish people. I thank him sincerely for the effort he has put into this Bill. I am delighted that it was initially introduced in the Seanad, as it has given rise to great debate and division in both Houses. Some Opposition Members felt that it was a straw to be grasped, but it was a very small straw. I sympathise with the Opposition&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mr. Higgins: We thank Senator Leyden.</P>
    <P>Mr. Leyden: &mdash;because it has so few reasons to criticise the Government. The Opposition felt that the Bill was an opportunity to have a go at the Government. Fianna Fáil is the party that brought forward freedom of information; we are in favour of it. The Minister has brought forward an excellent Bill and I think it will work very well.</P>
    <P>The appointment of Ms Emily O'Reilly as Information Commissioner is commendable. The Minister was very conscientious in recommending to the Government that she be appointed. I do not think any person in this country could say anything other than that she will be an extremely good Ombudsman. Another possible Ombudsman I would like to mention is Mr. Joe Duffy, who, I believe, would do well in the position. His radio programme does tremendous work on many issues. Many good people were available, but the Government chose Ms O'Reilly, a great and eminent journalist who will work this Bill 100%. She will be an excellent ombudsperson. The job title will have to be changed from &ldquo;Ombudsman&rdquo;&ndash; perhaps the Opposition will bring forward an amendment to change it to &ldquo;ombudsperson&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Ms O'Meara: I have no problem with the title of &ldquo;Ombudsman&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Mr. Higgins: Senator Leyden should bring forward the amendment.</P>
    <P>Mr. Leyden: When the new Information Commissioner brings her reports to the Oireachtas, I guarantee that she will have no hesitation in making clear if this Bill is not working to her satisfaction. The Government will have to consider the issues at that time and bring forward changes if they are necessary, although I do not think they will be. Knowing Ms O'Reilly, she will tell it as it is and bring forward recommendations to the <Col N="1027" />Minister. I know he will be very receptive to any views she might express.</P>
    <P>Mr. P. Burke: The Senator is not gagged yet.</P>
    <P>Mr. Leyden: I will never be gagged and neither will the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Ms O'Meara: Will the Chair confirm that it was agreed on the Order of Business this morning that two motions will be brought before the House this afternoon relating to the appointment of Ms Emily O'Reilly as Ombudsman and Information Commissioner? It was my understanding that we will be allowed to comment on that matter when the motions come before the House after this debate, so there is no need to comment on it now.</P>
    <P>Acting Chairman: Absolutely.</P>
    <P>Ms O'Meara: I will make my comments then.</P>
    <P>Ms Feeney: Go to the front of the class.</P>
    <P>Ms O'Meara: In the meantime, I will comment on the amendments that have come back to this House from the Dáil. I agree with Senator Higgins that it is a pity, to put it mildly, that these amendments could not have been brought forward when the Bill was being discussed on Report Stage in this House. This would have given us time to tease them out in great detail, an opportunity we do not now have. That is wrong and I cannot agree with it, particularly as the Bill was initiated and considered extensively in the Seanad. We had a long Second Stage debate, but it was guillotined on Committee Stage. I deplore the fact that we have not had an opportunity to debate the amendments in great detail, although I know that the Dáil has done so. This House is being asked to consider the changes as a group.</P>
    <P>This Bill remains largely unchanged from the version that originally came before the House, although there has been some &ldquo;tweaking&rdquo;, to use the phrase used by the Minister on the last occasion that he was here. He said that there would be some tweaking rather than substantial changes and we have seen the tweaking, most of which has taken place in the sections of the Bill dealing with personal information. I welcome the Minister's minimal change of heart in relation to the substantial issues that emerged in the course of the public debate on access to personal information. The Minister has made concessions in the face of substantial pressure, particularly from the One in Four group and in relation to families' access to records and the right to correct records relating to family members.</P>
    <P>These matters are important, but the Minister has not responded to the other considerable issues that have arisen, particularly in relation to information on Government decision-making, the conduct of such decision-making and how such information relates to public bodies. The greatest <Col N="1028" />undermining has taken place in these parts of the Bill. The changes to the 1997 legislation that were originally published remain in place and the Act is, therefore, in tatters. The framework of accessibility to Government decisions, particularly in respect of how it arrives at those decisions, has been entirely undermined. The fundamental principle of openness contained in the 1997 legislation is now, in effect, gone.</P>
    <P>The change in relation to committees is so minimal as to be almost meaningless. We will be given numbers, but we will not be told who is on the committees or what those committees will be doing. This legislation completes the blanketing in secrecy of the business of Government. I ask once more why this is happening. What harm was done by the 1997 legislation? The Government's argument could have been made if the only change was to extend the Cabinet rule from five to ten years, although I would not have agreed with it in principle. That is not the only change being made in the Bill, however, because extensive alterations are being designed to shroud the operations of the Government and public bodies in secrecy. The major difference the Bill will make will be seen in the coming years.</P>
    <P>Senator Leyden mentioned that his constituents do not approach him about using the Freedom of Information Act. The figures show that the media is not the biggest user of the legislation, as more requests are made by private individuals seeking to access information. The use of the Act by the media is a critical part of its operation. This has been the case in all democracies where similar legislation operates. Despite what some people think, the media operates largely in response to the demand of the public or in the public interest.</P>
    <P>The media is not called the Fourth Estate for nothing. It is one of the pillars of our democracy. Is the media operating in a way that allows the public to make a judgment on how decisions are made and on how taxpayers' money is spent when it decides to access information about the cost of the Bertie bowl, for example? The public should be able to make an informed decision about the spending of its money by the Government, but it will be unable to do so in future because it will not be in a position to access information and the media will be unable to do so on its behalf.</P>
    <P>It is clear that insufficient time has been provided for a satisfactory debate on this matter in the House. The fact that we were not allowed to debate these amendments on Report Stage is unsatisfactory. One cannot determine the quality of a debate by counting the number of hours devoted to it. Legislation has passed through the House in a short period because it was uncontested and because all Members agreed with the fundamental principles contained in it, how it was drafted and what it set out to achieve. When a Bill as monumental as this comes before the House, it should be given the amount of time it needs.</P>
    <P>Senator Higgins drew our attention to the <Col N="1029" />availability of the Information Commissioner's document, which contained vital information, when the Report Stage debate was taking place. The Oireachtas committee did not have enough time to hear from all the interested bodies, such as the Human Rights Commission. It is clear that enough time was not provided for this debate. I reject the idea that the quality of a debate can be measured by the amount of time allocated for it.</P>
    <P>This is a regrettable day, just as this entire business has been regrettable. The legislation that will remain after this Bill has been passed is a shadow of the original 1997 Act. The principles underlying the 1997 Act have been so fundamentally undermined as to render them almost meaningless. The Government has shown clearly that it is intent on doing its business behind closed doors, blanketed by a shroud of secrecy to ensure the public does not know what decisions are being made on its behalf.</P>
    <P>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy): I thank Members on all sides of the House for their valid and constructive contributions to the debate on all Stages of the Bill's progress through the House. The debate was often trenchant and heated but this is a measure of the seriousness of the Members' commitment to carrying out their responsibilities, as legislators. I welcome the contributions made.</P>
    <P>I was a little surprised and disappointed that when Senator Leyden was referring to the Office of Ombudsman and Information Commissioner, <Col N="1030" />he did not put forward the name of his former constituency colleague, Seán Doherty, for one of the positions.</P>
    <P>Ms O'Meara: I think he is going to Europe. He would prefer to be in Brussels.</P>
    <P>Mr. Leyden: I made representations.</P>
    <P>Mr. McCreevy: The Senator did make a late case for former Deputy Doherty.</P>
    <P>Mr. Leyden: We would then have freedom of information.</P>
    <P>Mr. McCreevy: I have considered the views of the House on all Stages and all sections of the Bill. I have equally considered the amendments proposed. I have also taken into account the Government's needs and requirements. It is essential that the operation of the freedom of information legislation does not impede the process of government, the primary focus of the Bill. It is also my responsibility to ensure that legislation operates to provide maximum possible access by the public to information consistent with good government and cost-efficient administration. I am satisfied that both responsibilities are met in this Bill which I am confident will stand the test of time and continue to provide Ireland with one of the most liberal freedom of information regimes in the world.</P>
    <P>Mr. Leyden: Hear, hear.</P>

    </P>
    <P>An Leas-Chathaoirleach: Nos. 5 and 6 will be discussed together.</P>
    <P>Mr. Moylan: I move:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann recommends Ms Emily O'Reilly for appointment by the President to be the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy): I am very pleased to seek these resolutions recommending Ms Emily O'Reilly for appointment by the President as Ombudsman and Information Commissioner. There are certain rituals about debates of this kind in more leisurely times &ndash; a saunter through the legislative provisions under which the Ombudsman or Information Commissioner operates and a backward look at developments affecting the two offices since an appointment was last made. In some cases, that approach is worthwhile &ndash; where the territory is technical or where what the office holders do is not well known. In this case, I do not think it necessary because, as practical politicians and public representatives, one has ongoing contact with the operations of the Ombudsman and the Information Commissioner. In one's public capacity, one is also subject to regulation under which the Information Commissioner and his officers operate under the recent corpus of ethics, electoral and referendum legislation. The Ombudsman and the Information Commissioner have a clear reporting relationship with both Houses.</P>
    <P>The motions are before the House, first, because Mr. Kevin Murphy has decided to retire from both offices and, second, because the legislation providing for these offices has specified that no one can be appointed as Ombudsman or Information Commissioner without this House and the Dáil passing resolutions recommending the person for appointment by the President. Underlying this uncommon appointment arrangement in both cases was a belief that parliamentarians and the public needed to be assured that the person appointed would not be in any way the creature of the Government of the day and would command wide support.</P>
    <P>The appointments are for six years. They can be renewed but only by going through the same resolution and appointment procedure. Retirement is compulsory when the person appointed reaches 67 years. The starting date is 1 June next <Col N="1032" />after the retirement of the current holder of both offices, Mr. Kevin Murphy.</P>
    <P>Some time ago when Kevin Murphy mentioned that he would like to leave these two offices, I had to think about the qualities essential to doing the jobs well. It was quite easy to make out a list &ndash; a familiarity with public administration and knowledge of how it works; an ability to listen &ndash; sometimes with sympathy &ndash; and the ability to sense when the plausible just was not true or was deliberately incomplete; that unexpectedly scarce property, basic common sense; and skill in handling the media without being ruled by headlines. However, the fundamental quality had to be independence. This word is much bandied about and, in this context, usually taken to mean freedom from interference or influence by the Government of the day. That independence has to be expected from an Ombudsman or Information Commissioner. Independence has to mean more than this. It has to comprehend the ability to shake off the shackles of one's own strong feelings; to ignore the assumptions of the &ldquo;crowd&rdquo; from which one comes &ndash; be it party or professional group &ndash; and, should righting wrongs in either job require it, a willingness to upset them. Chilly contacts with erstwhile admirers are something any worthwhile Ombudsman or Information Commissioner must expect. Emily O'Reilly fits the bill admirably from that point of view.</P>
    <P>When Kevin Murphy was appointed Ombudsman, there was a feeling in some quarters that it was asking too much of a top civil servant to go out and do strenuous battle with those who worked in the same corridors he had inhabited for most of a lifetime. Those who were in government with me when he was appointed did not share these views for we knew him as a man who called things as he saw them. There was no need for that particular leopard to change his spots because he had &ndash; we knew he had &ndash; that vital streak of real &ldquo;without fear, without favour, without embarrassment&rdquo; kind of independence. That quality was to be called upon in his dealings as Ombudsman and Information Commissioner with former colleagues whenever the interests of those he was chosen to serve required it.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that Kevin Murphy has roughly two months to serve in both positions and, on past form, that time is unlikely to be spent coasting to retirement. He may think it slightly premature for me to pay tribute to him when he is still very much in harness. Nevertheless, I know that Senators will join me in putting on record our deep appreciation of the immense contribution he has made to the development of the office of the Ombudsman, for embedding into our system a desirable freedom of information culture and making both institutions user-friendly and, closer to home for us, for his energetic participation in regulatory institutions on ethics in Government, electoral practices and referenda, which made his retirement later than he wished.</P>
    <P>One characteristic of his time as Ombudsman was that he saw beyond the individual cases which came before him, treating them as symptoms which could alert him to possible malaise in parts of the public administration. He distilled the <Col N="1033" />lessons thus presented into prescriptions for what I might be forgiven for calling the body administrative. From this came his clear articulation of principles of good administration, which he expected public servants to measure up to and a check list of best practice which let public servants and their clients know what was to be expected. <i>Settling Complaints,</i> the guide he published to internal complaints systems, was both a guide to existing systems and a blueprint for setting them up.</P>
    <P>There are many positions in public life where spelling out specific qualifications in statutes narrows down the field from which candidates can be picked. When it comes to these offices, that does not apply. I am sure most Senators can think of someone likely to have the essential qualifications I mentioned. Before the first Ombudsman was appointed, a civil servant put his finger on another practical requirement by warning that the person chosen to be Ombudsman had to be some &ldquo;known&rdquo;. As he put it,&ldquo;If when you mention the Ombudsman's name and the automatic response is 'Who?', then you have got it very, very wrong.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Emily O'Reilly is certainly well known. She has been one of the most widely read journalists of her generation in this country. She surfaces regularly on radio and television programmes. She has been hard-hitting, but those of us who have at times taken those painful hits will admit that she has been generally fair, if trenchant. She has never made her columns cheerleaders for the conventional or unthinking partners in fashionable denunciations of the unpopular.</P>
    <P>Journalism is an occupation which has, no less than others, its quota of time-servers. It can offer a comfortable life provided one does not run foul of the libel laws, one's colleagues and present and prospective employers. One thread that has run through Emily O'Reilly's writings, whether in newspaper columns or the books she has written, is a willingness to say what she sees &ndash; even when it means annoying politicians, colleagues, and the power structures in the world of journalism. I do not always like what she writes. I often disagree with what she says. That may be a very good sign for the appointments for which she is being proposed.</P>
    <P>The Government is not proposing Emily O'Reilly for these jobs because it expects her to give us an easy run. We are proposing her because we are convinced that she will do these jobs well. The personal credibility of whoever is appointed is vital to the regard in which these relatively young institutions of the State are held and indeed to their utility. Both are, in their own way, the safety valves of our administrative system and nobody &ndash; least of all a Government Minister or head of a public office &ndash; wants an ineffective safety valve, an Ombudsman or Information Commissioner who will not make a racket when something seems to be going wrong. The Government, and the leaders of the Opposition whom I consulted, are confident that Ms O'Reilly will not be silent and will not make noise when none is needed.</P>
    <P>That said, there will in any such office-holder's <Col N="1034" />term be moments when the sparks will fly between them and public servants and, let it be said, between them and Government Ministers. Between an Ombudsman and Ministers or public servants, there will always be a degree of tension. There has to be. They do different jobs and have different outlooks. The same is true of the Information Commissioner. What is important is that an Ombudsman or an Information Commissioner forces the decision-maker to look with fresh eyes at what her or his organisation has done or left undone. Often they agree but when they do not, the interaction between them ensures that all factors are considered, even if the weight each, in all honesty, attaches to them differs.</P>
    <P>I commend the resolutions to the House.</P>
    <P>Mr. B. Hayes: I welcome the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to the House. It is important that we debate these motions which the Government is putting before the House in the name of the Leader. That is why I asked last week that the Seanad be afforded a brief opportunity to debate the issue, not least because the two positions on the Order Paper, for appointment by the President, are very important new offices, established in recent years. They are still in an embryonic stage. I was not prepared simply to nod this through. I was not prepared to say nothing about the appointments and that is why I demanded a debate on the matter. I am grateful to the Leader for accepting the need for a debate, so that we can air our views.</P>
    <P>The Minister is right in that Kevin Murphy has done a terrific job. One of the reasons he fitted the job description was his knowledge of the Civil Service and the public sector. I pay a warm tribute to Kevin Murphy for the dual functions he has performed as Information Commissioner and Ombudsman. He spoke up for the small man and woman. He was a thorn in the side of the Government and the Establishment. Those are the qualities we need in the person appointed to these two very important tasks. I register my thanks to Mr. Murphy and to the staff of his office for the terrific job they have done on behalf of us all.</P>
    <P>It is important that the matter be debated in the House because of the new functions that have been given to the Office of the Ombudsman and Information Commissioner as a result of various legislation in recent years. This is the wrong way to make appointments, plucking people's names from the air which are then proposed by the Government. There were no advertisements concerning the appointment. No one was made aware that the position was to become available, so that other candidates could have put their names forward. The person appointed to these positions was simply a name plucked from the air. This is not a criticism of the individual, but that is the way the system is.</P>
    <P>The system is wrong and it needs to be reformed. The idea, in a modern parliamentary sense, that parliamentarians cannot scrutinise, put questions to and test the proposed appointee is out of kilter with the system in other modern parliaments. High level appointments such as these, particularly where there is a role for the Oppo<Col N="1035" />sition, should be made by way of Government resolution to a committee of the House, who would then interview various people who might be interested in the job.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said that he consulted the Opposition leaders. I understand that he telephoned the Opposition leaders in the Lower House concerning his choice for the new Information Commissioner and Ombudsman. That is not consultation. That is a telephone call.</P>
    <P>Mr. McCreevy: That is not correct.</P>
    <P>Mr. B. Hayes: The Minister will have his chance to reply.</P>
    <P>Mr. McCreevy: I do not have a chance to reply. That is not correct. The Senator can ask his party leader.</P>
    <P>Mr. B. Hayes: I understand a telephone call came to the Opposition leaders. If the Minister describes that as consultation, that is another matter.</P>
    <P>Mr. McCreevy: The Fine Gael leader and the leaders of the other parties can tell the Senator of the matter.</P>
    <P>Mr. B. Hayes: The Minister can reply in due course. He is not a Member of this House.</P>
    <P>Mr. McCreevy: The Senator can check the matter with his party leader and he will inform him.</P>
    <P>Mr. B. Hayes: I have checked with my party leader.</P>
    <P>Mr. McCreevy: He will tell the Senator then.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>Mr. B. Hayes: The Minister seems to be unduly tetchy about this matter. I wonder if he is giving the full information. The real involvement of the Opposition was not in place. I believe that to be wrong. There needs to be a greater role for the Opposition and all parliamentarians in this appointment. The person appointed, who is an eminent person and will do a very good job, would actually prefer that situation because in modern business people want to ensure that there is support for their appointment. The parliamentary scrutiny role is something that the Government should take on board.</P>
    <P>I wish Ms O'Reilly well in the very important job she will do on our behalf. My comments today are not about her but about the process. This Parliament needs to grow up, as does the process, to ensure that we have greater confidence in the appointment of senior office-holders.</P>
    <P>Ms O'Rourke: I am glad to speak to this motion and, like other Members, to welcome the Minister to the House. There are two motions before us, one each for the positions of Ombudsman and Information Commissioner. While there could well be merit in what Senator Brian Hayes <Col N="1036" />says about a new system of appointment, and it may happen in time, today we are dealing with the appointment of Ms Emily O'Reilly to these two conjoined positions.</P>
    <P>I have just checked with the Minister for Finance and he tells me that he had a meeting in which he conversed with the leaders of the main parties in Opposition. When we hear that we take it as given. I am glad to hear it because I am quite sure that it should be done in the case of an appointment like this.</P>
    <P>I am speaking on the recommendation of Ms O'Reilly and on her character and characteristics which befit this position. She is from the midlands, not that that makes anyone exceptional.</P>
    <P>Ms O'Meara: Yes, it does.</P>
    <P>Ms O'Rourke: Good. Our Chief Whip, Senator Pat Moylan, reminds me that she is from Tullamore, which makes her in his eyes even more agreeable and suitable for such a position.</P>
    <P>I would like to record a few of Ms O'Reilly's characteristics and to say that if she uses them in her new positions she will do great good for the citizens. I first came to know her in 1984 when she was a young reporter writing about the Anne Lovett case in Granard in County Longford, a very sad case. I was the Deputy at that time for Longford-Westmeath, having been elected in 1982. I met her and talked to her on that occasion. She was single-minded in pursuit of what she felt, which was that she should have the knowledge with which to write a very good story, which she subsequently did. It is interesting and revealing that recently, in her last recorded column in <i>The Sunday Times,</i> she wrote of the Anne Lovett case and the unfinished business which it left behind.</P>
    <P>I subsequently had contact with her when she was going on the Siemens scholarship to Harvard. I was glad to give her a submission and a reference which she needed to apply for the scholarship. She later took that up, made a very good job of it and came back here and progressed up the journalistic ladder from one position to another, always bettering herself, to use an old-fashioned term. She did full justice to each positon that she embarked upon and she worked well. She has a great way with words, a marvellous facility with language.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make is that if Ms O'Reilly continues to display the same single-mindedness which she has shown throughout her career she will do a very good job for the citizens who will have regular recourse to her. It is a very good characteristic in anyone to be single-minded and determined to get on and she has it in spades. She can bring those well-honed characteristics to bear on the two conjoined positions which she is now entering. I could elaborate on my encounters with her. I have no doubt about her suitability for the job in terms of her maturity and vast experience &ndash; not ignoring her midlands origins, to satisfy Senator Moylan. She is a very just person with <Col N="1037" />long experience of life who started her journalistic career writing with great sensitivity about a very tragic circumstance.</P>
    <P>I wish her good luck in the positions which she now takes up and I have no doubt that she will do Ireland a very great service in them. In so doing I recall that the Minister did not want to overshadow Kevin Murphy because he will remain in harness for two months and will do a lot of work yet. I knew him in the period of huge cuts in 1987-89 and he, too, was very fair and just, but he told you when to get off. That was very good also. I pay tribute to him and to the sterling service he has given this country.</P>
    <P>Mr. Quinn: I mentioned earlier to the Minister that I had spent the previous hour or so with Neil Kinnock, the Commissioner for Administrative Reform in the European Commission. As organisations get older and bigger more bureaucracy develops and then come rules and regulations until very often the citizens' rights are lost. When we adopted the Scandinavian policy of appointing an Ombudsman, we were not quite sure what we were walking ourselves into. I am delighted to see Senator Maurice Hayes here, who has full experience of that in the North of Ireland. When we established the system at first we were not sure exactly how it would work. It worked very well under the first Ombudsman, Michael Mills, and continues to work very well under the second Ombudsman, Kevin Murphy.</P>
    <P>I was very impressed by the Minister's words. He talked about the need for knowledge, sympathy, common sense and independence. They are exactly the qualities that Kevin Murphy displayed. There is one other word that I think we could add and that is courage. Kevin Murphy has shown courage. He has been independent but he was also courageous enough to decide what he wanted to do, even if it ruffled feathers or upset others, and to do it.</P>
    <P>On that basis, I have great pleasure in supporting the appointment of Emily O'Reilly. There is something to be said for the point that Senator Brian Hayes made about whether this is the correct way to appoint someone. Would we be better with a more open appointment through advertising or some other system? That may be correct and there is probably a better way. If somebody wins an election we know they always have the strength of being to say they won the office in fair and open competition. If somebody is appointed, as has happened in the past in our own political field, they never have quite that same strength of being able to say they won the election. It would probably strengthen a future Ombudsman to know that he or she actually won the post in an open competition.</P>
    <P>Emily O'Reilly has shown commitment. Like Senator O'Rourke, I met her in 1984 and she was very bright, young, courageous and enthusiastic at that stage. She had the qualities to which the Minister has referred as being required in this area. I would associate with her the terms dedi<Col N="1038" />cated, committed and independent. I believe she will perform very well and that she has the courage and the ability to do what we want her to do. I would say to her, &ldquo;You have a hard act to follow.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Ryan: Hear, hear.</P>
    <P>Mr. Quinn: It will not be easy but I think she is starting with odds. She has the confidence of the nation behind her and with that confidence she will do a good job. I am happy to support her appointment.</P>
    <P>Dr. M. Hayes: I do not know Ms O'Reilly personally but she is a distinguised journalist whom I read regularly. I saw her on a television programme last night and I thought she was very impressive. I congratulate the Minister on an interesting, innovative and quite courageous selection. It seems to me, as to other speakers, that Ms O'Reilly has the potential to be an excellent Ombudsman, and I am very glad to be able to support her appointment.</P>
    <P>Though this is terribly politically incorrect, I am not all that sold on open competition for jobs like this. In my experience the people who apply for such jobs are the very people one would not want to appoint. To apply for some of these jobs you would need to have a hole in your head, and good luck to those who take them.</P>
    <P>This is a very personalised post. More than anything else it requires common sense, as well as sound judgment and an investigative cast of mind. Each Ombudsman is different and each will bring different qualities to the job. We have been very lucky in this State in the two previous Ombudsmen. By any standards, Kevin Murphy has been an outstanding Ombudsman and Information Commissioner. Michael Mills set up the office and carried it through. The important thing is that there is an office to support the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>It is an interesting precedent that Michael Mills too was a very distinguished journalist. The powers of communication and language which the ordinary citizen can understand are a very important aspect. The alternation between a person who has been steeped in the public service and knows it from the inside, with a person who does not, is also a useful reinforcement and renewal of the office. It is a tribute to the Minister for Finance and a great reassurance to citizens when they know that their watchdog is somebody who does not just roll over and purr every time he or she meets opposition. Ms O'Reilly's record in that regard will stand her in good stead.</P>
    <P>It is a very lonely position, and an Ombudsman has nobody to relate to. I found it a great help that there was a committee for the Ombudsman, and that the Ombudsman's reports were taken before this committee and their consequences were sorted out. It certainly helped to make the writ run more smoothly when senior bureaucrats <Col N="1039" />knew that they could be called before this committee. I suggest that as a possibility.</P>
    <P>I wish Ms O'Reilly well. The Minister for Finance has chosen well and I am sure she will fulfil all the potential that he believes she has.</P>
    <P>Ms O'Meara: I welcome the appointment of Emily O'Reilly to this position. I do not know her as well as other Senators do, but I would definitely regard her as someone of great single-mindedness, of determination, a very hard worker and in particular a very independent-minded person, somebody who does not suffer fools gladly and is not afraid to dish it out when required. Those are very important qualities to bring to this job.</P>
    <P>The fact that the original Ombudsman, Michael Mills, was a journalist very well regarded not only among his colleagues but also among the public almost appeared to create a precedent, to the extent that when Kevin Murphy was appointed there were, as the Minister noted, some questions out there as to whether somebody from inside the public service would do as good a job as someone from outside. As we discovered, he did an excellent job, as his predecessor did.</P>
    <P>In fulfilling the additional functions Mr. Murphy was given by the Oireachtas while Ombudsman he showed his mettle, his talent and his superb commitment to the public service, and I pay tribute to him in that regard. The manner in which he took the role of Information Commissioner and ran with it set a very high standard. I wish Emily O'Reilly very well and send her every good wish. As others have said, she has a hard act to follow, but I do not think she is lacking in talent, courage, commitment or dedication to the task.</P>
    <P>Senator Brian Hayes has referred to the fact that it is worth looking at two things. One is the range of personnel from which this appointment could have been made, and the second is the process of appointment. In terms of the range of possibilities, we have so far had journalists and a public servant. I hope future Governments would not rule out the appointment, for instance, of a legal person who has excellent standing in the community, or indeed maybe a business person.</P>
    <P>What we are looking for is someone who can look at the public service and hold it accountable. This is what much of the legislation which we have established is all about. It is about legislation to do with accountability and transparency and making sure that the public service and we as politicians serve the people we are supposed to serve, the public.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to comment on the process of appointment. As Senator Brian Hayes has pointed out, there is a question over this process. While we can make these comments, the fact is that the appointment is in the gift of the <Col N="1040" />Government. The matter goes to the President, but it the Government which makes the appointment. There is a strong case to be made for broadening that out. Let the Government make a recommendation to the Houses. One can say that this is a recommendation before us today, but we know we are just going through the motions.</P>
    <P>There is a case to be made for a process of examination, a process of having that person come before a committee of both Houses for instance, or the Oireachtas committee responsible for this particular legislation. In effect the appointment would thus be scrutinised. This is an extraordinarily important appointment, and the person chosen is answerable not only to us but to the public, yet the public will never get the opportunity to comment or to ask the person any questions unless through the medium of the press, the area the person comes from.</P>
    <P>I hope we will return to the whole process of appointment. As an NUJ member myself I welcome the appointment of a journalist, but with regard to the Freedom of Information legislation I made the point a short time ago regarding the importance of the media, the Fourth Estate. The fact that a journalist has been appointed to the position makes my point that journalists are very important people in the operation of our democracy, and they are people to whom the public look to ensure that its rights are upheld.</P>
    <P>I wish Emily O'Reilly every success and every good wish in the onerous task that she undertakes on our behalf and on behalf of the public. It is a pity she is inheriting legislation which is far weaker in its powers and operation than the legislation the previous incumbents worked under.</P>
    <P>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy): I thank the Members on all sides of the House for their contributions and I hope that the incoming Ombudsman will be as efficient and effective as the previous two incumbents. In reply to Senator Brian Hayes, and he can check this with his party leader, the conversation did not take place over the phone, it took place face to face &ndash; Senator O'Meara is nodding in agreement. It took place with the three party leaders, Deputies Kenny, Rabbitte and Sargent.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Ms O'Rourke: I move:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann recommends Ms Emily O'Reilly for appointment by the President to be the Information Commissioner.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 2.50 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 15 April 2003.</P>
