      <P>I have received notice from Senator Wilson that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he wishes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to make a statement about the need to retain and maximise the use of Loughan House, Cavan, as a prison and place of detention.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Cummins of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline why Fenor national school, County Waterford, has not yet received sanction to proceed with the construction of a learning resource room when a verbal commitment from the Department was given that the work would commence as far back as December 2002.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Ulick Burke of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to provide funding to the Western Health Board for the reopening of the residential addiction unit at St. Brigid's Hospital, Ballinasloe, County Galway, the closure of which has given rise to serious concerns within the community.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Bannon of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to make a statement on the status of phase 2B of Mullingar hospital, with particular reference to the possible loss of its accident and emergency and maternity services under the proposals of the Hanly report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters raised by Senators Wilson, Cummins and Ulick Burke and they will be <Col N="1054" />taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Bannon may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Ms O'Rourke Ms O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, which has completed its deliberations, concerning the improvement of operational co-operation between member states in implementing measures on the shared organisation of joint flights for the removal and return of illegally resident third country nationals, to be taken without debate &ndash; I will comment on this prior to concluding the Order of Business; No. 2, motion referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, which has completed its deliberations, concerning the establishment between member states of a means of establishing mutual support and assistance in implementing return and readmission measures for the removal of illegally resident third country nationals in cases of transit by land, to be taken without debate; No. 3, a referral motion, where the subject matter of Nos. 12 and 13 will be referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, concerning the application of the principle of mutual recognition to financial penalties and the confiscation of crime related proceeds, instruments and property imposed by member states, to be taken without debate; No. 4, statements on the tourism policy review group, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 1 p.m, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 12 minutes, those of all other Senators not to exceed eight minutes, Senators may share time and the Minister to be called on to reply not later than five minutes before the conclusion of the statements; No. 5, statements on stem cell research, to be taken at 2 p.m. and to conclude not later than 5 p.m, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes, those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes, Senators may share time and the Minister to be called on to reply not later than five minutes before the conclusion of statements; and No. 17, motion No. 29, to be taken between 5 p.m. and 7&nbsp;p.m. There will be a sos from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The four Senators who are members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, <Col N="1055" />Defence and Women's Rights are Senators Kett, Terry, Tuffy and Jim Walsh. If they wish to bring a report to the House, arising from their membership of that committee, on matters which can be taken without debate, it can be placed on the Order Paper for an early future date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Leader on the manner in which she so speedily arranged a debate on stem cell research. I thank her for placing it on the Order Paper today. Will she check if it is possible for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to take questions on the matter? While statements are a very important means of enabling people to state their positions, it would be useful if questions were allowed. There is a facility for that, as the Cathaoirleach is aware. We are in a situation where the Government intends to support the proposal for stem cell research on 27 November despite the fact that, on two separate occasions, a committee has urged the Government not to take that position. Are we left in a legal limbo, where various positions taken by our Government would not have the support of a plenary session of either House of the Oireachtas or a committee? We need to clarify that before the Tánaiste contributes to that very important debate.</P>
      <P>When does the Leader intend to arrange a full debate on the proposed Book of Estimates produced by the Government last week? It is now clear that the least well-off in our society will pay for the economic blundering of the Government. For some months, we on this side of the House have argued that if the benchmarking award is paid, the least well-off will have to pay for it. That has now come to pass. Those in the trade union movement, particularly SIPTU which, last Friday, launched another spate of bellyaching over the current round of cuts, must share some of the responsibility in this regard. If &euro;1.6 billion is to be spent next year on pay awards, it is inevitable there will be less money for health and education. There is a collective responsibility for the cutbacks which are now being foisted by the Government on the people. Those who argue for benchmarking should share responsibility for the cuts.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Toole, on the Order of Business please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier this year, I raised the issue of the various reports on the medical services, including the Hanly and Brennan reports, before they were published. At that stage, I <Col N="1056" />requested a debate where people could establish their positions on the matter, rather than taking up political positions afterwards. We had a debate and people said what they had to say. However, the matter is now bringing politics in general into disrepute. Nobody can blame local politicians, from either side of the House, for defending their own patch, but the only way we will ever deal with this matter is to take ourselves out of the equation. It will only be addressed if a new group, for example, is set up and we agree that it will decide issues and we will implement them. Otherwise, there will be no answers.</P>
      <P>I have full sympathy for those who defend their areas &ndash; I would do the same &ndash; but I cannot see how the matter will be sorted out if we constantly have to look at local arrangements. We are elected to represent either a constituency or a broader group and we are required to defend our people by commenting on the relevant issues. However, we will never get a health service moving forward in this way.</P>
      <P>On a related topic, I was glad to hear a representative of the Fine Gael Party making it clear on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; recently that the proposed development charges had nothing to do with the payment of benchmarking awards. It is good that this is fully and clearly understood. It is another issue on which we should be open and honest. I paid a development charge 30 years ago &ndash; I had to pay the ESB to put up four poles to supply my house. A woman from Kerry told me she had to pay &euro;7,000 to have her new house connected to the sewerage system last year. There is nothing new about development charges. What we have to consider is how the money is earmarked and directed and ensure that it is used properly, rather than pretending it is something new. It is not new, but the ordinary taxpayer should not be required to pay for development to create greater profits for builders than they are already making. We need to take a firm and positive line on those issues.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Bill, which will be before the House this week, I wish to declare an interest as a member of that board. The chairperson of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, Ms Dorothea Dowling, will be available in Leinster House 2000 at 5 p.m. to brief Members who will be speaking on that issue during the week and also to neutralise some of the misinformation and downright lies that have been spread about the proposals in the bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the fact the Leader has organised a debate on stem cell research. I also support the calls for the Tánaiste to come into the House to engage with Members in questions and answers at the conclusion of the debate. The Tánaiste will make a major decision on 26 or 27 November in Brussels. That decision will allow European Union taxpayers' money to be spent on embryonic stem cell research. I believe, and it has been the contention of many Members in <Col N="1057" />recent weeks, that there is no clear mandate from either House of the Oireachtas on this issue. I thank the Leader for organising that debate.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept criticism of the trade unions in regard to benchmarking. We must not lose sight of the fact that is a contract that was negotiated by the Government and the trade unions.</P>

      <P>A serious potato disease, ring rot disease, which has the capability of destroying up to 50% of a potato crop, is raging in Wales. I call on the Leader to make a statement or to get confirmation from the Minister on what measures are in place to prevent an outbreak of that disease here. If adequate measures are not in place whereby imports can be checked and cleared on entry here, I will call for a ban on imports until such time as those measures are in place. </P>

      <P>I notice the social welfare Estimate will be discussed this evening but a characteristic of it is that most of the main social welfare announcements are made in the budget. Therefore, one is looking at only one part of the picture. It seems people want to deny any Minister for Social and Family Affairs the right to make readjustments in existing schemes, but one will not be able to judge the social welfare Estimate until the budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do. I want the Leader to invite into the House at the earliest opportunity the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, to address the serious concerns at local authority level regarding the deficit in funding requirements in local government. Local authorities will not be in a position to pass their estimates over the next few months because of the clawback in capital funding from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Stealth taxes are being introduced on a daily basis and there has been a withdrawal of funding from the Department.</P>

      <P>I join Senator Brian Hayes and Senator McCarthy in asking the Leader to invite the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, to take questions, either before or after her address, on stem cell research. It is a complex issue. Senior medical professionals inform us that stem cells from adults are equally beneficial, if not better, than those from embryos. We need guidance on that <Col N="1059" />aspect. It may not come out in a presentation, but it would emerge in questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader gave a degree of explanation on Nos. 1 and 2. However, there should be more explanation, if not further discussion, on this matter. I am worried about taking without discussion in this Parliament an initiative of the Italian Republic involving adopting a Council decision on the organisation of joint flights in the removal of third country nationals illegally present and so forth. I am not in favour of taking without discussion anything that emerges from Mr. Berlusconi's one-stop-shop, particularly with regard to refugees' human rights. A distinguished international figure expressed concern that people may now be returned to Iraq on the basis that authorities are pretending it is now a safe country. I propose an amendment that there should be a short discussion of Nos. 1 and 2 to ensure further explanation. It is not enough for a committee to look over this material.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Brian Hayes on his neat footwork in introducing the question of cuts against the disadvantaged and his call for a debate on the issue. This is the substance of the Labour Party's motion for Private Members' business this evening. However, Senator Brian Hayes knows that the Order of Business may be reported, but the media does not pay the slightest attention to anything after 5 o'clock. Fair play to him for grabbing the ball and running with it. That is the kind of politics we all appreciate in this House.</P>
      <P>I join those who expressed considerable surprise that the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, is still a member of the Cabinet.</P>

      <P>We should also look at the granting of academic qualifications &ndash; not that I have very many &ndash; because I was offered a few more in an e-mail this morning from a group that said academic qualifications are available from prestigious, non-accredited universities. They include Bachelors, Masters and PhD degrees in any field, with no examinations, classes or textbooks required. The advertisement ends with a request to telephone to register and receive these qualifications within days. It devalues the whole notion of academic qualifications. A number of these agencies create titles that suggest a closeness and relationship to distinguished third level institutions in this country. It is unfair and the House should examine it.</P>

      <P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, is revising planning legislation. It is important that we have a debate on the role of An Bord Pleanála because there are serious examples from all parts of the country of how it operates. What is the composition of An Bord Pleanála? We have received serious complaints about it and we should debate the matter in this House to tease out where the problems are arising. Should An Bord Pleanála be part of local government or separate from it? It would be useful to the Minister to have such a debate before he amends planning legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister for Finance to raise an issue with the banks as a matter of urgency. Credit card scams are estimated to cost about &euro;10 million a year. The banking institutions have promised to introduce changes to PINs and various security protection measures to make credit cards foolproof in the future. Those advances are being made in the UK and it is widely anticipated problems will escalate in this country if we do not take immediate action. While the banks plan to do this in 2005, the Minister should stress the urgency of doing so as quickly as possible. Cloned credit cards are available among the criminal fraternity for &euro;120. This problem has recently received sharp focus in the media. The Leader should ask the Minister for Finance to request that the banks move on this as a matter of priority.</P>

      <P>I have raised this matter before. It appears that because of the practice of spiking drinks in many discos and nightclubs the patrons are afraid to leave their drinks and have to take them into the toilets with them. It is awful that they have to do so. An individual who commits an act of this kind against anybody else should be subject to a mandatory prison sentence with hard labour. This is a terrible crime and I call for an early debate on the matter.</P>

      <P>I draw the Leader's attention to the very short notice we were given of the publication of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Bill, which is to be debated here tomorrow. I am sure it is not the Leader's fault that we have had such short notice. It is extraordinary that this is coming up tomorrow whereas at the same time we have been waiting nine months for Committee Stage of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill. As Senators will remember we had the Second Stage debate in February. Even more interestingly we also had the Second Stage of the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill in February. A woman who might not have been a bit interested in it then might be very interested in it now. What has happened to these two very important Bills?</P>

      <P>I am concerned over last week's disturbance in Mountjoy Prison, which caused serious upset and distress to many of the prison officers involved. This, along with other prison and prison officer issues, needs to be discussed in the House. I call on the Leader to ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to address these issues here and to outline for us his plans for the prisons and the prison officers.</P>
      <P>I also call on the Leader to ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come clean and say whether he had anything to do with the removal of security from the journalist, Paul Williams, who is now out of his house because that security has been removed from him. It is very serious to withdraw security from somebody in that type of work who is in danger of attack from many known criminals.</P>

      <P>I will not say it then. This brings me to the health issue raised by Senator O'Toole. It is a serious issue, which should be debated in this House. I fundamentally disagree with the Senator about taking issues such as this away from this House or from democratic institutions. It may be a matter of regret when Ministers want to go on solo runs. The idea that vital policy issues should not be dealt with by politicians is completely anathema to the democratic process. There is a danger that if we go down that road we will hand more power to Senator O'Toole's friends in the trade unions. Social partnership will take over and we will hand that to them, and they will make decisions they <Col N="1062" />are already making on an issue which has previously been raised in this House, namely benchmarking. On that, while not wishing to re-open the issue, it is absurd for a Senator to maintain it only costs &euro;310 million. That is inaccurate and is complete nonsense. It is a vast sum of money&mdash;</P>

We should be able to say courageously, as Senator Brian Hayes and his party has said, that public servants are a privileged group and that they are doing very well. The cost of this will go on for many years to come and it will be at the expense of far more deserving causes.</P>

      <P>Last week we saw in the Estimates that various Ministers and Departments have reduced substantially their dependence on consultants for reports they had commissioned over the years. The Minister of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has engaged engineering consultants MCOS to study on a county by county basis the conditions of the substandard roads and the potholes throughout the country. If at this stage a Minister has to engage consultants it is nothing more than a slap on the wrist for the management of local authorities and their engineering staff that have programmes planned for every county and various initiatives in hand in terms of roads, water and sewerage. Once more we see this Minister taking power to himself, for some reason or other, which he has lost in other areas. He appears to be saying that local authorities and management at local level do not have the capacity to assess programme needs. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to this House to explain this absolute wilful waste of scarce finances.</P>

We all remember a time when non-national roads were in a bad state and I am sure the Opposition made noises then as well. They are now in a good state. We should ask the Minister, if he is coming to the House, about staffing levels as regards such work. The staff of the national roads design team has been reduced to about a third. The Minister should bring up employment levels, especially for major projects under the national roads programme to meet the needs of the national development plan.</P>

      <P>The Leader of the Opposition, Senator Brian Hayes, asked if the Tánaiste would take questions during this afternoon's debate on stem cell research. I do not know, but I will find out. The request presented to the Tánaiste's office was for a debate. I note the other House sought a similar debate yesterday, but it was not granted. Perhaps a debate will take place there at some stage. However, I do not wish to talk about the other House.</P>
      <P>Senator Brian Hayes also asked about the Book of Estimates. We hope to have a debate on this matter next Wednesday. It is scheduled for then and we await confirmation. He also alleged that everybody is now paying for the benchmarking agreement reached with the trade unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole raised the Hanly report, which was debated here. He put forward the idea that local politicians should take themselves out of the equation, even though they are required to <Col N="1064" />defend situations at local level. He also said there is nothing new about development charges. He is right about that and this is what the Minister has been saying.</P>
    <P>I welcome the arrangement with the interim chairwoman of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board who will meet Members who wish to discuss this matter. I am sure that will prove a most useful meeting.</P>
    <P>Senator McCarthy also raised the issue of whether the Tánaiste will take questions. As yet, I do not know. It is a matter of communicating with her to find out. We are all aware of the disease that is affecting the potato crop in Wales and the Senator is concerned that it will spread here. The Hanly report was also raised by Senator McCarthy. This report was debated at great length in the House and I repeat what the Taoiseach said, that the Hanly report has been agreed by Government.</P>

    <P>Senator Norris proposed an amendment to the Order of Business. He is worried about refugees and asked if we will nod our heads in agreement with what Prime Minister Berlusconi says on the issue. The Senator referred to Senator Brian Hayes raising the issue of cuts before Private Members' time. The question of debates being held earlier was raised at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on the basis that the House hopefully would obtain coverage of good discussions. It appears that debates held between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. are too late for inclusion and that is why Senator Hayes raised the matter at the <Col N="1065" />Committee on Procedure and Privileges. The Senator expressed surprise about the Minister for Defence.</P>

      <P>Senator Finucane referred to the security measures of UK banks. He said we should ask financial institutions here to make decisions on the matter quickly. Senator Glynn referred to the spiking of drinks in discos and asked that mandatory sentencing be introduced in respect of this crime. Senators Henry and Norris spoke about the bringing forward of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Bill at short notice. Ms Dorothea Dowling's briefing would be very useful to the Senators. Senator Henry also pointed out that Committee Stages of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill and the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill have been delayed inordinately. We hope the maternity legislation will be ready next week.</P>
      <P>Senator Terry raised the matter of disturbances at Mountjoy Prison. She asked that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform be invited to speak to the House about the matter and to discuss also the issue of security at the home of Paul Williams. Senator Ross agreed with Senator Norris about the Hanly report and said the right of local people to debate matters which affect their local communities should not be taken away. The Senator said the sum involved in benchmarking was vast and that the public service was a privileged group.</P>
      <P>Senator Ulick Burke said the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government had engaged consultants to look at secondary and non-national roads and to provide him with a full report on potholes etc. That is a great idea.</P>

    <P>There are four Senators on the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's <Col N="1066" />Rights, namely Senators Kett, Terry, Tuffy and Jim Walsh. While an amendment to No. 1 has been put forward, I suggest Members across the parties co-operate to produce a short report for the Seanad which could be discussed in the House. I do not like to say a motion is being taken without debate. It sounds undemocratic, even though it has presumably been discussed quite extensively by a committee. I am sure Members of this House always attend such discussions. I suggest that where we take motions without debate in future, Senators who sit on the relevant committee should produce a report on that committee's proceedings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on the report of the tourism policy review group, which has been eagerly awaited by all those with an interest in the further successful development of tourism. The report is the most important and authoritative document on tourism policy and performance in over a decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I took over responsibility for the tourism portfolio nearly a year and a half ago, I was conscious that the industry was at a turning point. After a prolonged period of significant growth, I recognised that the tourism business was <Col N="1068" />undergoing fundamental changes internationally and that changes in the domestic economy were also bringing about a new series of challenges which threatened to undermine the future of the industry in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to John Travers and the other eminent members of the review group for agreeing to take up my invitation to carry out this work. The quality and depth of their report speaks for itself. From the outset, the group carried out the widest possible consultation, including an open public forum which was advertised in the national press. The body of oral and written submissions it received is a testament to the widespread interest in the exercise. </P>
    <P>The review group itself was unique, including not only public and private representatives of the tourism industry, but also independent business people and other experts who brought a broader and perhaps more critical and independent assessment of the sector.</P>
    <P>The report includes an overview of tourism world-wide, an assessment of the economic contribution of the tourism sector to the Irish economy, an analysis of recent tourism performance, a detailed assessment of tourism in Ireland today and an outline of the challenges and opportunities facing the industry. However, more importantly, it proposes a coherent and integrated strategy for Irish tourism for the next ten years and a series of recommended actions to implement the strategy. It clearly identifies the large number of quite different stakeholders that influence tourism development and it highlights the need for co-ordinated and integrated action to influence the wider agenda that impacts on Irish tourism.</P>
    <P>One of the key conclusions which the review group arrived at was that the ultimate determinant of success in Irish tourism would be &ldquo;an energetic, innovative and profitable private sector, operating within a domestic environment where Government policies and actions are supportive of business investment in tourism&rdquo;. That statement captures exactly what I would like to see for the industry over the coming decade &ndash; an energetic, innovative and profitable sector.</P>
    <P>The review group has set ambitious targets for the next ten years &ndash; 10 million overseas visitors annually by 2012 and a doubling in revenue from overseas visitors to &euro;6 billion per annum. These are extremely ambitious but achievable since it has been done before. In 1990 we had just over 3 million overseas visitors a year. The decade that followed saw us more than double that number. I am pleased to report that the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation, whose considered views on the report I received recently, agree the targets are &ldquo;potentially attainable&rdquo;. Their provisos are that the assumptions on which they are based prove accurate and that the central elements across the entire strategy are accepted and implemented successfully.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1069" />One of the key assumptions underlying the strategy is, of course, that international tourism will continue to grow and that Ireland will increase its share of current and developing markets. This is against the backdrop of yet another challenging year for the tourism industry globally and when, yet again, Irish tourism has had to prove how robust and resilient it is.</P>
    <P>The World Tourism Organisation predicts that 2003 will be a flat year for global tourism and only forecasts the number of visitors to Europe to grow by less than 1%. Based on its analysis, Europe has fared better than the Americas or the Asia-Pacific regions which were affected more severely by the war in Iraq and SARS. The latest figures for tourism to Ireland show an increase in visitor numbers of over 3% for the first six months of the year. The best market intelligence available suggests that this level of growth may be sustained for the year as a whole. On these figures alone, Ireland's performance this year is positive. Ireland has seen an increase in visitor numbers in some of our key markets, including the very important British market. This represents a strong endorsement of the marketing strategies being pursued by the State tourism agencies.</P>
    <P>In considering the performance on a market by market basis, the indications are encouraging. Ireland is set to increase its share in many of its major tourism markets this year, despite the intense competition that is now such a feature of international tourism. Ireland has managed to increase numbers from Britain by over 2% in the first six months of this year even though outbound tourism has been flat. Similarly, in mainland Europe, Ireland appears to be outperforming its main rivals in Germany, France, Italy and Spain. The North American market also appears to be turning the corner with strong growth achieved this year for the first time since 2000.</P>
    <P>The overall projections for the year from the tourism agencies are also positive with forecasts predicting a 3% increase in visitor numbers to 6.1 million visitors, with British visitors up 2%, mainland European visitors up 6% and North American visitors up 7%. If this level of growth is achieved, it would represent a good performance in a difficult year.</P>
    <P>The news this year is not all positive. It is evident that, in meeting the challenges of an increasingly price-conscious market, the industry's bottom line has come under more pressure this year. The average length of stay of overseas visitors continues to decline and the continued growth in the capacity of the hotel sector impacts on the overall share out of bed nights generated by visitors to Ireland. Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland are focusing increased marketing resources on longer stay market segments although the tremendous growth in the short break market has been a major factor, both in Ireland and worldwide.</P>
    <P>Speaking of the increasingly price-conscious <Col N="1070" />market brings me back to another of the key messages from the review group, that the greatest challenge facing the tourism industry is to restore its competitiveness. Restoring competitiveness must be a common goal for the entire Irish economy, but it is especially important for the tourism sector which has to compete internationally for its customers. From a marketing perspective, it is vital for the sustained development of tourism that the industry continues to deliver the quality of holiday experience that tourists to Ireland have come to expect.</P>
    <P>In its report, the review group makes the point that competitiveness is not just about pricing, but must also be a function of the total Irish tourism experience for customers relative to other locations. This starts from initial inquiries about visiting Ireland, right through to travelling here, where people go when they get here, where they stay, who they meet, what they do, what they see and their perceptions about price and quality.</P>
    <P>Another key message of the report is that a high and increasing proportion of visitors have expressed concerns about competitiveness. The industry should recognise that it has primary responsibility for offering better value to its customers, if it is to maximise the opportunities for future growth. Delivering value for money to the customers must continue to be foremost in the minds of all those involved in the tourism sector.</P>
    <P>There is no immediate, single or easy solution. Having identified competitiveness and value for money as key strategic drivers of success for Irish tourism, the review group listed some ten specific actions to deliver the strategy which require responses from both the private and public sectors. The list includes proposals for taking responsibility for restoring competitiveness, inflation, benchmarking, customer relations, management capability, training and making high standards Ireland's competitive advantage.</P>
    <P>Visitor attitude surveys continue to find that Ireland is still highly rated for the beauty of its scenery and for the friendliness and hospitality of our people, indicating that our traditional welcome is much appreciated. In a high wage, high productivity economy like ours, we need to encourage a relentless pursuit of higher standards in all aspects of tourism as a competitive response to lower cost alternatives in other holiday destinations. This brings to mind an event I attended last week in the National Museum where I was asked to present Fáilte Ireland's Irish welcome awards. The Irish welcome is the trademark that represents us to the world at large. It is treasured and we are famous for it at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>It is an extremely valuable and living symbol, both as part of who and what we are and as an attribute that sets us apart and gives us an edge over our competitors in an increasingly competitive marketplace. I put on record my appreciation of the key role that initiatives such as the welcome awards play in helping to achieve our tourism goals. The scheme extends to a wide variety of enterprises across the tourism spectrum. It is <Col N="1071" />based on a customer nomination system and, as such, provides the most appropriate basis for identifying tourism practitioners <i>par excellence</i>. Finally, and most importantly, it serves to acknowledge and celebrate the bringing together of the key ingredients necessary for tourism success.</P>
    <P>Those whose efforts were celebrated last week are at the coalface of Irish tourism, the place where it really matters to visitors whether a professional and excellent job is done and where Irish tourism can create happy and memorable experiences, for overseas visitors and Irish holidaymakers alike. I am sure many Senators know a great number of other people working in tourism areas with which they are familiar who would merit similar awards. The delivery of a quality service is key to the future success and profitability of the tourism industry as a whole.</P>
    <P>As regards the recommendations in the report directed at my Department and the tourism State agencies, I am pleased to report that a number of the actions are already underway. For example, the tourism unit of the Department has been re-configured, advertisements seeking expressions of interest in relation to the national conference centre have been placed in the media and bilateral consultations have taken place with the Department of Finance on taxation issues and with the Department of Health and Children on the anti-smoking regulations. I have been advised that Fáilte Ireland is taking account of the recommended actions and suggested timescales relevant to it in its operational planning for the remainder of this year and next year.</P>
    <P>In addition, Fáilte Ireland has announced a new initiative to address the cost of insurance across the sector in co-operation with industry representative groups, including the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland. Similarly, Tourism Ireland Limited has completed an examination of the recommendations in the report that impact on areas within its remit and it has incorporated a number of these into its three year marketing strategy and detailed operating plan for 2004.</P>
    <P>Where do we go from here? I am determined that the excellent work of the review group will be capitalised on and that the momentum generated by the focus on the tourism industry will gather force. The review group worked with an equal vision and put the emphasis on an agenda for action, identifying the concrete actions that need to be taken to help ensure the implementation of the new strategy. The first two year rolling plan included in the report is a very ambitious and challenging one, involving over 70 individual recommendations. These are directed not only at my Department, the tourism State agencies and other Departments but, perhaps more importantly, to representatives of the tourism industry and individual tourism enterprises. I welcome the significant contribution to the development of policy represented by the report <Col N="1072" />of the review group and I will ensure that the recommended actions are pursued not only within my Department and the State agencies under my remit, but also with industry representative bodies and my Ministerial colleagues.</P>
    <P>Having recently received the considered views of the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation on the report and the shape of the proposed high level implementation group, I hope to be in a position shortly to establish a small group to drive forward and monitor the action plan. I take this opportunity to mention that Tourism Ireland's market plans for 2004 are already well advanced. I am delighted also that the Exchequer provision for marketing in 2004, under the tourism marketing fund, has been increased by a further 3.5%. In early December, I will launch Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland's joint marketing programme for 2004 and I am confident that next year's campaign can build on this year's performance.</P>
    <P>Among the initiatives planned for the British market next year will be a focused drive on the &ldquo;family holiday&rdquo; market, which is so important to length of stay and regionality, an aspect of the tourism industry that I know is of particular interest to many in this House. There will also be increased emphasis on direct marketing, in conjunction with industry partners. The challenge now is to replicate the growth achieved in the 1990s, to improve the quality of our product and our competitiveness and to look to a new horizon for Irish tourism.</P>
    <P>The report of the tourism policy review group not only provides us with the challenges, it also points the way and tells us how we can get there. I will be actively working to ensure that all partners in the process are working together to achieve this vision. I am confident that, with a shared understanding and partnership between key decision-makers in both the public and private sectors, the full potential of the tourism industry can be realised. We have been presented with the most comprehensive, authoritative and visionary document ever produced on one of our most important industries. We have been told in no uncertain terms of the value of tourism to this economy and this country, of the challenges it now faces and how to ensure it can grow as it needs to and as it should be allowed to. I am of the strong belief that we are now at the beginning of something very important that should lead to the full recovery of the Irish tourism industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan" hpid="Mr. J. Phelan Mr. J. Phelan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and what he had to say. I also join with him in complimenting the members of the review group on the publication of the report, New Horizons for Irish Tourism. I largely agree with what the Minister has said. The report contains an in-depth analysis of the tourism industry. I agree with the Minister that the industry finds itself at a cross-roads and compliment him on initiating the process which resulted in this report. I am pleased it makes strong recommendations, unlike many reports which tend to contain weak recommendations, <Col N="1073" />and I hope the Government and those involved in the tourism industry can act on them.</P>
      <P>It is clear from the report and from a number of surveys carried out recently that there are two main problems within the tourism industry in this country, the most serious one of which is the perceived lack of competitiveness. The other, according to a recent survey on the reactions of tourists to Ireland carried out by my colleague, Deputy Deenihan, is the significant problems associated with access to the country and transport for tourists within the country. When the lack of competition is mentioned, the response from the Government, especially by the junior partner, is to ask people to shop around. I hope the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, does not ask those who are considering visiting Ireland and who think it might be a little expensive to shop around. It is important that they continue to come here in increased numbers. It is also worth noting the reaction to the report by those involved in the tourism industry. They have indicated that the goals set out are attainable.</P>
      <P>The perceived lack of competitiveness is felt across all aspects of Irish society. There has been a downturn in our general competitiveness over the past couple of years. In 1999, Ireland was the fifth least expensive of the 15 member states in the European Union, but a recent survey has shown it to be the second most expensive. In four years Ireland has gone from a position of being very competitive on price to one where we find ourselves in big trouble.</P>
      <P>This can be attributed to a number of factors. The problem of rising insurance premiums has probably been the main issue for the business sector over the past few years. I welcome the Bill to establish the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, which will finally be initiated in the House over the next couple of days. The board should have been established a number of years ago and the legislation should have been in the House sooner.</P>
      <P>The report makes a number of key recommendations. It mentions that indirect tax rates should be brought into line with those in competing countries. A simple example concerns the VAT rate applicable to hotels which, at 13.5%, compares unfavourably with France, referred to by the Minister, where the rate is 5.5%. That is a strikingly large difference and goes some way towards explaining the difficulties with costs experienced by the tourism sector.</P>
      <P>I was interested in the Minister's comment that bilateral consultations have taken place with the Department of Finance on taxation issues. While he is not in a position to provide the House with details of the budget, will he outline the extent of these consultations and what, if anything, can be expected from them? Last year, on budget day, we were all surprised at the increase in VAT announced by the Minister. It was not flagged beforehand. If something like that was to occur again this year, it would have a detrimental effect on the tourism industry in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1074" />There has been much complacency in comments made on the rate of inflation. While it has fallen significantly in the past months, the Government and commentators continue to ignore the fact that it is still more than twice the EU average. This also plays a significant role in the perceived lack of competitiveness. The problem of the increased value of the euro against the dollar and sterling is largely outside of the control of the Government, but it goes some way towards explaining the difficulties in the sector.</P>
    <P>Over the past years, there have been large increases in commercial rates on different business. It is particularly prevalent in Kilkenny, where tourism is a major industry. People are having to pay higher levels of commercial rates, thereby disimproving their competitive position. Local authorities will soon be presenting their budgets and it is important that the tourism sector, which is under pressure and is accused of being uncompetitive, should not be saddled again with significant increases in commercial rates, especially as the stage has been reached where they are having a serious impact on the bottom line of many tourism businesses throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The report recommends that the Department should be directly included in the National Competitiveness Council. Considering the number of people employed in tourism and the value of the industry, I wholeheartedly agree. This should be looked at as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>According to a recent survey carried out by my colleague, Deputy Deenihan, the second most important problem encountered by tourists in Ireland is transport. Whether it be accessing the country, either through the airports or sea ports, or getting around the country, there are serious transport problems. I agree with the report's recommendation that the Government should stick rigidly to the national roads programme and roll-out the proposed new motorways and roadways. It is important for my area of Kilkenny in the south-east that the Government continues with its plan to extend a new motorway from Waterford to Dublin. The Minister is familiar with the current state of the road, which is creating a difficulty for tourists attempting to get around the country.</P>
    <P>The report also recommends that the Government look at the possibility of an additional terminal for Dublin Airport. This has been mooted and speculated upon and is being investigated. It should be provided as soon as possible. It is particularly important in light of the projected increase in the number of tourists to which the report refers. At present, there are 6 million overseas visitors to the country every year and it is estimated that this will rise to 10 million. It is imperative, therefore, that the facilities at Dublin and other airports should improve to cater for the additional 4 million visitors it is hoped will visit these shores in the next ten years.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recommendation in the report regarding customer relations management. Many <Col N="1075" />visitors to Ireland who came here perhaps ten or 20 years ago and who returned recently have commented that the céad míle fáilte or the traditional Irish welcome is not perhaps as warm or as prevalent as it used to be. This can be attributed to a number of factors. Many people working in the tourism industry were not born in Ireland and were not reared with the traditional attitude towards visitors to our country. I am delighted the report recommends the putting in place of a customer relations management initiative so that people who are new to the industry could be trained to take on board traditional Irish skills with regard to welcoming visitors.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister outline details of the implementation group? I welcome his statement that he will do so and that he will establish the group as soon as possible. Will he indicate the number of people who will serve on the group, when it will be up and running and the timescale involved in the group carrying out its work in terms of implementing the report?</P>
    <P>My final point relates to litter. Many visitors have expressed surprise at the level of litter throughout the country. It is sad that the litter problem remains prevalent in many areas. I was particularly annoyed and surprised by the statement of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government during the summer to the effect that he was pleased the litter problem in Ireland was largely a thing of the past. Does the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism agree, in light of the contents of the report and what everyone can see with their own eyes, that this problem is not a thing of the past and that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should invest more money in order to employ additional litter wardens and promote litter prevention?</P>
    <P>I welcome this in-depth report and its strong recommendations. I urge the Minister to set up the implementation group as soon as possible so that those recommendations can be acted upon. This report is important in terms of safeguarding the tourism industry in the decade ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KieranPhelan" hpid="Mr. K. Phelan Mr. K. Phelan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Phelan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward, who has done a great deal for agri-tourism in the midlands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tourism is becoming an increasingly vital industry in this country and it is only right that we should take this opportunity to discuss not only the success we have had in developing the industry to date, but also to examine how best to approach tourism policy in the future. To this end, the Minister and the officials in his Department, together with the various State bodies and agencies that operate in the tourism sector and the local tourism authorities, deserve a great deal of credit for the part they have played in creating the success the tourism industry has enjoyed. Without their hard work and intelligent use of resources, we would not have had the great <Col N="1076" />growth in tourism numbers and revenue we have enjoyed in recent years.</P>
    <P>This is particularly significant in light of the tourism situation worldwide. While a number of factors have helped to grow the tourism industry globally, the advent of cheaper and more widely available transport and the increase in economic wealth and available leisure time being just two, it has been noticeable that Ireland has continued to out-perform other countries in attracting tourists and tourism revenue. Throughout the 1990s, visitor numbers to Ireland grew by over 7% on average each year. This compares to a global figure of 4.3%. It is clear that we have been doing something right. We also managed to exceed European and global growth rates in terms of receipts in the 11 years up to 2001.</P>
    <P>These developments have had clear benefits for our economy. Currently, the industry generates &euro;4 billion in foreign revenue earnings, &euro;1 billion in annual domestic earnings and is responsible for 140,000 jobs. The industry is responsible for 4.4% of the gross national product and contributes &euro;2.2 billion in tax receipts each year. When these factors are taken into consideration, it is clear just how important a thriving tourism industry is to our country. It is equally clear that the Government places a great deal of emphasis on growing and developing tourism. This Government has given tourism the attention and priority it deserves and we have reaped the rewards as a result.</P>
    <P>The Irish tourism industry has a very strong base from which to work. Despite the difficulties it has faced in recent years, from the outbreak of foot and mouth disease, the impact on aviation and tourism as a result of the 11 September 2001 attacks and the SARS outbreak, Irish tourism has managed superbly. As the report outlines, we draw our strength from a substantial and increased customer base, high overall customer satisfaction ratings, competent and experienced staff and the quantity and good quality of accommodation, restaurants, pubs, leisure facilities and visitor attractions. We have also been able to alter the services and products we supply to cater for fluctuating demand. We have been able to adapt to different tourism demands and have reaped the rewards of this flexibility. We have been able to create new markets to meet demand for tourism services as they develop. However, I agree with the statement in the report that we have reached a crossroads. In recent years, the Irish tourism industry has lost a good deal of its competitiveness. It is vital that we correct this as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>While Ireland has never been at the cheaper end of the market, tourists have always enjoyed a feeling that they were getting a product of sufficient quality to justify the expense of holidaying here. However, we can only stretch that justification for high prices so far and it would appear that visitors to Ireland no longer believe they are getting value for money. This is the greatest challenge Irish tourism faces in the coming years. We <Col N="1077" />must do all we can to reverse this situation. Just as there is no better form of marketing than a happy customer and the good word of mouth that he or she generates, there is nothing worse than sending home tourists who complain of the expense of holidaying in Ireland. We do not want that to be a reason for people to avoid coming here.</P>
    <P>The main problem tourists have with prices in Ireland is not in terms of travelling here or the cost or standard of accommodation, but the simple day to day matters that are so vital to the enjoyment of any particular trip. We must accept the fact that the cost of eating out, alcohol, food in shops and a number of other of the daily necessities is too expensive. When we have accepted this, we can set about addressing the problem.</P>
    <P>The major part of the report deals with setting a strategy for Irish tourism for the period 2003 to 2012. It lists a number of clear objectives, the most obvious being to double the overseas visitor spend to &euro;6 billion during the next ten years and to increase visitor numbers from just under 6 million to 10 million. These are clearly challenging targets, but I hope, given the right global conditions, that the tourism industry should be strong enough to be there or thereabouts by the time 2012 arrives. However, these are not the only elements in the strategy. There are a number of other targets set out that will be as, if not more, difficult to achieve. A key aim is becoming more competitive. Not only do we face the prospect of pricing ourselves out of the reach of potential customers, but we must also remember the threat posed by other markets. Other countries are increasing the efforts they are putting into growing their tourist revenues and we will face growing competition as a result. Although the tourism market is also likely to grow, we must address the issue of competition or we will lose out.</P>
    <P>The strategy also includes a vision of the direction tourism should take over the next ten years and outlines the need to understand the forces and factors that shape the industry both for now and for the future; to gain knowledge of the factors that will drive success in the industry; to establish and realise challenging targets that are constantly reassessed; to develop the capacity to adapt quickly so that Ireland is best placed to develop its products and services as the market changes; and to develop a framework that will allow for the formulation of such a strategy and to allow for its implementation throughout all the relevant sectors of the industry, from Government to small local enterprises, while maintaining the clarity and consistency of the objectives throughout.</P>
    <P>If the strategy is to become a reality, the relevant steps need to be taken now. Our actions today will determine the success we enjoy tomorrow. The report contains interesting ideas in this regard as it sets out the implementation of the tourism strategy. With regard to improving the business environment for tourism operators, the <Col N="1078" />report recommends a number of actions that will be of interest to Government. The first relates to the issue of commitment. While the Government has been most committed to the development of tourism, we, as a nation, sometimes take the tourism industry for granted and the Government should lead the way in redressing the balance by making it an issue of public importance.</P>
    <P>Other recommendations relating to competition, inflation, taxation, insurance, infrastructure and so on are contained in this section. I am glad that many of them form part of Government policy or are broadly similar to plans that the Government is implementing. For example, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Bill 2003, which will come before the House tomorrow, should help to address the problem of insurance costs.</P>
    <P>Although there are too many other recommendations to go through in detail, I refer to those relating to the improvement of competitiveness and value for money. If Ireland is to maintain a healthy tourism industry, addressing competitiveness must be our main priority. It is the greatest hurdle we face and the set of recommendations to deal with this problem is interesting. The first recommendation is the tourism industry needs to acknowledge that competitiveness is a problem and that the industry, as a whole, has a responsibility to address it. There is a culture within sectors of the industry where the issue of competitiveness is seen as someone else's problem. A solution cannot be implemented until that attitude is addressed.</P>
    <P>The next recommendation deals with inflation. I am confident the Government will continue to tackle the issue to the best of its ability. However, the following recommendation is vital. The report suggests the prices and products on offer from Ireland's competitors should be studied and this information made widely available. This would be a welcome development and would help to focus the minds of small and medium-sized tourism operators regarding what is on offer to potential customers. It could be a wake up call to a few operators, as they will have to become more competitive if they are to thrive.</P>
    <P>I like the concepts of a new management development capability programme and a programme to improve the standard of customer relations management in the industry. The proposal to encourage management employee partnerships will have a great deal of success. Currently, there is too high a turnover of staff in certain sectors of the tourism industry. If employees are given the opportunity to enjoy the fruits of their efforts by tying their success to that of the company, they are more likely to stay. There should be a significant increase in efficiency and productivity if this proposal is given the attention it deserves.</P>
    <P>We will never compete at the lower end of the market and, therefore, the industry should do all it can to set high standards to our competitive advantage. By providing a stronger role for tour<Col N="1079" />ism industry representative bodies, their hand will be strengthened in dealing with this and other problems facing the industry. I offer my support for the proposals contained in this report and the work done by the Minister and his Department. I can point to my own county to prove how the industry has developed there over the years with the building of the new, massive Heritage Hotel in Portlaoise and the Heritage Golf and Country Club in Killinard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward, to the House. I am surrounded by Kilkenny men and, perhaps, a number of their constituents will be relocated to the Waterford constituency soon.</P>
      <P>The report is excellent and those involved in its compilation must be complimented. It outlines the current position and the actions necessary for the future development of our tourism industry. It is a comprehensive, coherent and challenging report. However, I wonder whether, like many other reports that have been produced in the past, it will be left to gather dust with its many recommendations dependent on the availability of funding. I hope that will not be the case because the report contains many actions which are of paramount importance. We can look forward positively to the development of the industry if a number of them are implemented. We can never be complacent about tourism.</P>
      <P>My colleague referred to competitiveness in terms of Ireland's position a number of years ago compared to its position currently. Competitiveness is the key to the development of the industry. The Minister referred to better value and cost effectiveness. Ireland has beautiful scenery and friendly people but most tourists come to Ireland expecting good value in terms of accommodation, food and drink. Ireland is not as competitive as it was and while this can be attributed to the industry itself, it can also be attributed to Government policy.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy of indirect taxation is mentioned in the report, especially increases in VAT and excise duties. This issue must be examined. The budget will be announced in a few weeks and if there are increases in excise duties, it will mean one of the actions in the report can be discounted. The budget will demonstrate whether the Government is serious about tackling the actions proposed in the report. Government policy has resulted in additional costs to tourism operators. The issue of rates has also been mentioned. The Government must think seriously about these issues in the context of the development of the tourism industry because they go hand in hand and I hope that point will be taken on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must also be ensured that employees in the industry do their work to the highest international standards. A great deal of work is being done and hotels are to be complimented in this regard. Many non-nationals work in the industry. <Col N="1080" />They are excellent people with a tremendous work ethic and they are also friendly.</P>
    <P>Those who contested the Seanad election will attest to the appalling signage on our roads. This issue must be tackled. The Minister referred to tourists driving around Ireland. One cannot get from A to B if one depends on the current signs. I hope that matter will be dealt with as expeditiously as possible. It is particularly important for visitors to this country, who rely on the signage, only to find conflicting directions from different signs. We need to get our act together in that regard.</P>
    <P>The report highlights the need for co-ordinated and integrated action to influence the Irish tourism industry. That is the key requirement. I commend the report. I hope all the actions enunciated in it will be acted upon by Government, rather than being left to gather dust. As I said, the first test of that will be in the forthcoming budget when we will see how seriously the Government will react to the actions outlined in this excellent and comprehensive report. I compliment everybody associated with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu" hpid="Labhrás Ó Murchú Labhrás Ó Murchú">
      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit &ndash; perhaps I should say &ldquo;Céad míle fáilte&rdquo;, as we are discussing tourism. I warmly welcome the report of the review group, particularly the subtitle, &ldquo;An agenda for action&rdquo;, which is very appropriate. The last thing we need is another report to join a plethora of earlier reports already in a <i>cul-de-sac</i>. However, this one is exceptionally impressive, very honest and open, giving an up-to-date view of the position of the industry and the views of our customers.</P>
      <P>As the report rightly points out, our core appeal as a tourist destination is characterised by people, pace and place. We have benefited particularly well from those ingredients. In both the State and private sectors of the industry, we are fortunate that we made hay while the sun shone and built a very good foundation. It is good for a small country to be in a position to boast of an annual growth rate of 7% in tourism when the global rate was only about 4.3%. That is very much in our favour. Due to that strong foundation, it was possible for us to withstand some of the great challenges which came our way, such as the SARS epidemic, the foot and mouth disease crisis, international uncertainties and so on. Even though the prophets of doom suggested that 2003 would be a disastrous year, the initial figures from the regions clearly show it was not a disaster. We stood the test of time particularly well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, the report is honest and open. Perhaps we also have to be rather more honest in terms of revisiting the core appeal of people, pace and place. I find from my own travels abroad, particularly among the Irish overseas community, that there is a growing sense of embarrassment for them when they return to Ireland. Our returning emigrants are, after all, a major part of our tourism industry. Very often, the embarrass<Col N="1081" />ment to which I refer does not relate to infrastructure, which has made huge strides forward. The funds we obtained from Europe have been used very well. However, areas such as anti-social behaviour, as highlighted in an infamous &ndash; or famous &ndash;&ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme, are causing very serious worries, not just for Irish people returning but also for tourists in general. Their perception of Ireland previously did not embrace that anti-social concept. Perhaps that is a warning that we should focus rather more on that which is natural to us and has proved to be one of our big attractions.</P>
    <P>We should be particularly careful with regard to artificial contrivance. For example, in the case of Temple Bar, while the focus is right, the stories emanating from it are not always the most edifying. Restrictions had to be brought in to prevent some of what was happening there. Some visitors came there in the belief that such activities were intended to be part of Temple Bar, whereas, in fact, the intention was to show our strengths as a tourist destination. That is why I believe we should be very careful of artificial contrivance and, instead, focus on building up that which is natural to us.</P>
    <P>Taking an overview of tourism figures, one finds that Dublin and the south-west have done particularly well, while other areas, including that of the Minister of State, Deputy McDaid, are not, perhaps, doing so well. The Shannon and other areas are in the same position, and that needs to be examined more closely. Perhaps, to some extent as a result of over-organisation and development, we are actually killing the goose that lays the golden eggs.</P>
    <P>I return to the concept of pace. When people come to Ireland to enjoy what they believe to be distinctively Irish &ndash; people, place and pace &ndash; but find themselves stuck in a traffic jam for two hours, it is not only their bad experience, it is also reflected in the perception they take away with them. An impression that conditions here are worse than in New York, Chicago, Berlin or wherever is very bad for us.</P>
    <P>I suggest, as I presume is inherent in the reference in this report to less satisfactory grades in some parts of the country, that we have to consider the whole issue of decentralisation as a much more urgent concept. The more we centralise business and amenities in Dublin, the more we are contributing to over-saturation. We should tackle this in a radical way. Tourism does not stand alone &ndash; it is also related to all other infrastructural development. The Dublin-centred approach must be reviewed.</P>
    <P>People would be surprised if I did not make some reference to that which makes us distinctively culturally different. We have strong cultural and artistic assets in Ireland. I recall the findings of a major survey to the effect that the principal areas of participation and enjoyment for our overseas visitors included traditional music as one of the top six, as well as high-class evening entertainment. Our built heritage was at the very top <Col N="1082" />of the list. It is noteworthy that three of the top six preferences related to our artistic, heritage and cultural assets. The fleadh ceoil in Clonmel attracted 250,000 people and generated almost &euro;30 million for the region, a proportion of which went back into the coffers of the State. This morning, I heard a radio interview in which the horse racing industry highlighted its contribution to the economy. Having regard to the contribution of the fleadh ceoil as just one event, one can imagine the total contribution of all the other cultural and artistic events throughout the country. I repeat my main point that we must be very careful about artificial contrivance, bearing in mind always that our great asset is that which is, very often, exclusive to ourselves and not available in other countries.</P>
    <P>The report also identifies the major contribution of domestic tourism to our national coffers. That is very often under-estimated. The more attractive and accessible we make our home market, the more of our tourism expenditure will remain at home, rather than going abroad to other destinations. I have often felt that a small injection of patriotism at times of challenge would not go astray. We could appeal to people in that regard. I will refer to just two statistics: 55% of tourist respondents considered we were rather pricey but, on the other hand, 90% said that Ireland, as a holiday destination, not only met but actually exceeded their expectations. If one sets the 55% against the 90%, I suggest we will have to revisit the analysis. Quality can cost money. We are right to have a focus on competitiveness, but we must be particularly careful that we do not diminish the quality in the process. If more than 90% of visitors said Ireland met or exceeded their expectations as a holiday destination, that is particularly important.</P>
    <P>We must realise that tourism is multifaceted. Every tourist to this country does not travel independently. One must take account of the package holidays, where coaches bring in 50 to 55 people. These tours are predestined &ndash; I will not go into a new theological area of predestination &ndash; but they are not necessarily categorised as having a specialised interest. There are also individual tourists, who often have a greater pre-awareness of what to expect when they visit, and Irish people who return here. All those visitors are part of the tourism statistics. I do not say this in any derogatory sense, but we should not let whiz-kids get a grip on the industry and say we must focus on a particular area without taking account of the breakdown of tourists into those categories.</P>
    <P>Fewer Irish people are going into the tourism industry. We all know from the front of a premises, whether it be a hotel, a pub or a restaurant, that fewer Irish people are providing a service at the coalface of the industry. That is not taking from the quality of those coming here or the cultural diversity they provide. However, we should be honest and acknowledge the importance of what the report states about people, place and <Col N="1083" />pace. Visitors to this country expect to find something distinctively Irish, such as Irish humour and the Irish attitude. If one thing gets under my skin it is the &ldquo;yes madam&rdquo; and &ldquo;no madam&rdquo; attitude that is part of the training of service providers in tourism, which is not typically Irish. There was a good deal to be said for the natural flow of communication. I cringe when I hear &ldquo;yes sir&rdquo;, &ldquo;yes madam&rdquo; and &ldquo;no madam&rdquo;. One hears that in other countries, but people in the industry do not have to be copycats. Those who provide training in the industry should tell people to be natural and to use what is natural to them. They have attributes of their own which people in no other country have. If we over-commercialise and over-stereotype ourselves as an international aspect of tourism, we will lose out.</P>
    <P>The report is excellent, but we also need to read between the lines. We must bring our personal experience to bear to add the extra piece to the fabric of the development of tourism. If we stick with the subtext of an agenda for action, bearing in mind what the report states about people, place and pace, and focus on that, we will not go too far wrong. I have no time for the prophets of doom. This industry has been the jewel in the crown of our progress and development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan2" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and also the report before us. It clearly identifies a co-ordinated approach by all stakeholders. It outlines an ambitious programme for the next ten years with the number of tourists expected to increase from 6 million to 10 million, resulting in an expenditure in investment of &euro;6 million. That will bring many challenges.</P>
      <P>It has been mentioned by speakers that the value for money criterion is important. I congratulate those involved in the tourism industry, especially those targeting different markets and operating under different circumstances, who have tried to give value for money over the past 12 months. It is essential that effort should be continued into the future.</P>
      <P>Many references were made to the Irish welcome, which is not something that should be taken for granted. It is great when information is given to tourists locally, which causes them to visit tourism spots they may not have visited had they not heard about them by word of mouth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We face the challenge of providing the necessary infrastructure for tourism under the national development plan on an equal basis throughout the country. Coming from the midwest, the Limerick-Shannon area, and given that tourist numbers are due to increase greatly, it is important that tourists are given the opportunity to visit the west. The Minister said that tourism stays have become shorter and more programmed. It only stands to reason that all tourists cannot come into Dublin; they must be given a choice. There are many fine scenic spots throughout the country and Senator Ó Murchú mentioned Irish culture. It is essential tourists are given the opportunity <Col N="1084" />to visit the tourist destinations in rural areas and enjoy the scenery and Irish culture.</P>
    <P>The marketing issue was raised. I congratulate the Government on spending vast amounts of money on developing tourism centres throughout the country over the past ten years. It is essential that the necessary funding is provided for the marketing of the industry. I am glad the Minister of State mentioned that there will be a 3.5% increase in such funding next year. It is essential we market the programmes that will be funded under the national development plan and by Europe.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to litter. I congratulate the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the vast amount of money that has been spent on the Better Ireland Awards and the Tidy Towns awards. Those programmes are carried out voluntarily by committees throughout the country. We should appreciate the effort they have made in making the country attractive for tourists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>This report has been published at an opportune time. This is the end of the last major drive to develop the industry and double the number of tourists to this country. The first signs of an international recovery are emerging. It is important we have in place a framework, a policy document and objective as to how we can maximise the benefit to Ireland from any upturn in economic activity internationally that will take place over the next number of years. In this context, the report is important. One criticism I have is that it is too Dublin orientated and centred. The task force did not pay sufficient attention to the issues affecting the west, an area that in the past attracted most visitors to Ireland. I am sure the Minister of State is fully aware of the importance of tourism to Donegal. I am equally aware of the importance of tourism to County Clare, to the midwest generally and to the south west.</P>
      <P>The task force recommended that the US bilateral agreement should be renegotiated. It seems the focus is to renegotiate it in a way that would attract more business into Dublin. It has not been spelt out how any renegotiation would ensure that we will continue to have the same level of transatlantic business into the midwest and into Shannon as we had in the past. It seems the renegotiation being spoken about would be detrimental to Shannon with fewer fights and tourists from the United States coming into that airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This report is important at this time, when there are indications that we are losing our edge in the marketplace, especially in the French and German markets. This trend is reflected in the report and on the ground in that the number of tourists, especially Germans, has fallen. That probably has something to do with the economic situation in Germany, but there are indications of an apparent upturn in economic activity there. Given that, it is important that we should concentrate more fully on attracting back the German tourists who used to visit here, especially those <Col N="1085" />who spent time on our canals and waterways, where there has been major developmental work.</P>
    <P>I compliment Waterways Ireland on developing the link between the River Erne and the River Shannon and the overall development of the canal network. This network is to the forefront of international amenities, but it is not fully promoted and marketed. I have not studied this report in great detail, but it strikes me there are specific areas that need special attention. The excellent resource we have in inland waterways is not fully promoted or marketed.</P>
    <P>Our inland fisheries are an international resource, yet I see little about promoting them in this taskforce report. I also see very little by way of investment in inland fisheries. They are the jewel in the crown of Ireland's tourism and marketing programme. To some degree, mainly due to local issues, the contribution inland fisheries can make to the tourism industry has been sidelined. We must invest in the development and the conservation management of salmon, sea and brown trout fisheries to ensure we remain the premier destination for angling tourists, particularly from the UK. Sea and inland fisheries are a valuable resource that require investment, yet they are not receiving it.</P>
    <P>There are issues in other Departments that affect the tourism industry, particularly in the marine industry. The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources must provide further investment for the development of marine leisure facilities, particularly marinas and related activities on the waterways. We now have a network of excellent marinas, particularly in the south west region at Kilrush, Fenit and Limerick. At the same time, some marinas are having difficulties with access and funding is not available to assist them.</P>
    <P>At Kilrush, there is an excellent marina facility providing a tourism facility for County Clare. However, access there is restricted due to silting in the river. Up to &euro;150,000 is needed to clear this, but the money is not readily available to marina companies. The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, the development agencies and the marina companies should join in partnership to put funding in place. This can be done through the harbour authorities by providing the necessary funding to enable access to marine leisure facilities and their expansion. These facilities can have a positive impact on the tourism business.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has responsibility for dealing with some environmental issues that can be detrimental to attracting tourists back. There is evidence that once people visit Ireland, they tend to return. However, there has been a fall-off in this, due to environmental issues such as littering and derelict sites.</P>
    <P>Funding is available for urban and town renewal to provide better infrastructure for small towns and villages, remove derelict sites, improve towns' appearances and spend money on cultural <Col N="1086" />activities. I was surprised to learn that &euro;30 million of that fund was unspent in 2002. Tidy towns committees and local communities are crying out for more funding so these works can be carried out. However, &euro;30 million allocated under the scheme was not drawn down last year and the previous year some &euro;15 million was not spent. Up to &euro;45 million that could have been allocated for improvements to towns, villages and even cities was unused and reallocated to other projects.</P>
    <P>Some important heritage sites are now being offered for sale and the State should be in a position to buy them. It is important that the State is involved through the local authorities or other agencies in acquiring some of these important heritage sites that are on the market. In the future, we may not see them as heritage sites but as apartment blocks. Important heritage and historical sites should be examined with a view to placing them under State ownership.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of local involvement in some regions in the development of the tourism industry. There are good examples of local involvement such as the Shannon Development Company that has done an excellent job, despite being at loggerheads with the Clare County Council over the Cliffs of Moher. Moreover, there is a need to re-establish Shannonside. In 1987, in tight economic times, various tourism promotion groups were reorganised. Subsequently, Shannonside, which was involved in the promotion and development of the tourism industry in the mid-west, was abolished. Some employees were put on the board of the Shannon Development Company to continue the work they were doing. It is now necessary for the mid-west region to re-establish the tourism regional body that was there in the past. It did excellent work in communicating with Departments, various organisations and local communities on the issues that were important to the region. In any future reorganisation, issues such as local community involvement in the mid-west region could be tackled with the re-establishment of a body similar to Shannonside.</P>
    <P>There is a great need to provide funding to local authorities to develop coastal and beach areas in coastal communities. There are excellent beaches in all the western counties but they have no access. Money was available through regional funds specifically for local authorities to open up access to beach tourism locations. However, many of our scenic beach locations do not have proper access or signposting. Local authorities must look at this area and provide funding.</P>
    <P>This is a timely and valuable report. It is an indication that the Government is taking this important industry seriously. Unfortunately, much of the Opposition do not take it seriously. It is disappointing to see the Opposition Benches devoid of speakers&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is an industry that provides thousands of jobs and millions of euro in revenue to the State and has many opportunities for the future. It is very disappointing that many Members of this House have no interest in that range of activity.</P>
      <P>The Burren National Park has been established but the ancillary services needed have not been provided. The Minister of State will know how important national parks are from his knowledge of the Glenveagh National Park in Donegal. The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, knows of the importance of the Killarney National Park to the development of tourism in the south west. It is critical that funding be provided soon for the services for the Burren National Park and the development of the Cliffs of Moher. Attractions such as these will be critical to the overall development of tourism in the future. I hope this report will inspire people in the business to make more investments so we can make tourism into a dynamic force for economic development in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh" hpid="Dr. Mansergh Dr. Mansergh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, who had responsibility for tourism in the previous Government, during which time it did very well. This is an important report and tourism is an important sector especially for employment and regional development. If the report had gone back to 1987 it would have shown that tourism numbers doubled between 1987 and 1990. They have doubled again from 1990 to the present. It is very encouraging that this year we appear to have had a 5% increase. Some people in the industry to whom I have spoken are very hopeful for the coming year, partly because the weather was so good in Ireland but was positively oppressive in some southern Mediterranean destinations. I even know a few people who had to come home early because the heat was too much for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The enormous pickup in the British market since the mid-1990s is striking. Dublin in particular has been the beneficiary of this on a year round basis. I cannot help linking that to a degree to the peace process, in that it removed many of the fears and inhibitions that existed up to that time. I am glad tourism is a sector where we are pursuing and implementing an all-Ireland policy. There are not many areas of which this can be said. I am delighted that these days we are not promoting Ireland on any partitionist basis. Of course Northern Ireland has its full share of attractions and beauties although the authorities there are very conscious that their tourism industry is considerably less developed than ours. I am <Col N="1088" />sure we are now giving any help we can in the further development of the tourism industry there through the mechanism of Tourism Ireland.</P>
    <P>The latest inflation figures up to mid-October have been released. These show price increases in restaurants and hotels of 6%, which is nearly double the overall rate of inflation. Alcoholic beverages and tobacco prices increased by 9%. It may be that much of that is attributable to tobacco rather than alcoholic beverages. It is high time those figures were disaggregated so we could see clearly what is happening on each side of the fence. While we need to be conscious of costs, we should not be so self-flagellatory. I have been in other European countries recently and seen their prices. I was asked to speak at an Oxford Union debate and stayed in a hotel for which I myself had to pay. The price was totally outrageous when compared to the service. While we are not unique in this sense, we obviously have to watch carefully where we are going.</P>
    <P>The increase in the number of hotel premises and bedrooms since 1996 is encouraging. The number of hotels has increased from 713 to 858 and the number of rooms has increased in greater proportion. For some reason the number of bed and breakfast establishments seems to have stagnated.</P>
    <P>Tomorrow we shall debate insurance in another context. This is a big problem not just for hotels but for heritage facilities of various kinds, one or two of which have been forced to close. I will make the point tomorrow that while there are many structural problems relating to different sectors of insurance which we should be addressing, the insurance industry awarded itself huge increases from 11 September 2001 onwards, the only possible justification for which was depletion of reserves related to quite different sectors. That industry has not restored the <i>status quo</i> plus consideration of inflation. I hope the Government in focusing on insurance problems does not lose sight of the fact that it applies across the economy.</P>
    <P>The report places considerable emphasis on access transport. Both Ryanair and Aer Lingus have diversified their routes, as have others. I look forward to further diversification on North American routes. I am delighted that at last we again have a direct air link with Canada. In the past month there has been an important European Union proposal to give us help in establishing a direct ferry link to Spain. Not only will this benefit us, but also it will considerably increase the number of people travelling to Ireland from Spain and Portugal. We should take up that offer with open arms and get on with it.</P>
    <P>The initiative of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on regional roads was mentioned on the Order of Business this morning. Some of these regional roads are in tourist areas and are very important. We have not always paid sufficient attention to upgrading them where this can be done in an environmentally acceptable fashion. I share the <Col N="1089" />concern that in whatever reform and restructuring of airports that is to take place, Shannon's importance as a transatlantic gateway in particular must be maintained.</P>
    <P>Upgrading the rail network, which is heavily used by visitors in the summer months, is of course important. Last week I inspected the rail bridge at Cahir, which is still being dismantled before being reconstructed. I hope that line can be restored in time for next summer. A fixed link to Dublin Airport, whether metro or heavy rail, is vital.</P>
    <P>In his contribution the Leas-Chathaoirleach made the point that many people from outside the country work in the industry. It is important they are familiarised with Irish traditions of hospitality when they start work. Most of them are very friendly, of course, as has been said.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Estimates I am glad there are no cutbacks in tourism. There has always been a degree of fine tuning as regards the post-budget Book of Estimates. If, for example, coming into the new year it is decided an extra &euro;1 million or &euro;2 million is needed for marketing, that is normally provided.</P>
    <P>There has been an enormous amount of political controversy about planning. Planning in sensitive tourist areas is an issue. There are two opposite extremes, neither of which I subscribe to. There is the An Taisce block on all development outside villages and towns. There is also the view that all restrictions should be removed, as espoused by some of the Irish rural development organisations. That is going too far, particularly in sensitive areas, from a tourism point of view. There was mention of coastal areas and headlands. It is a great pity that places such as the Old Head of Kinsale were blocked off by a private golf club. We ought to ensure, in legislation and planning, that access is maintained to areas like that.</P>
    <P>Arts, sport, development and so on are highly relevant to the development of tourism. The Acting Chairman, Senator Ó Murchú, makes a fine contribution through the Brú Ború facility and indeed the activities of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann countrywide.</P>
    <P>I have three quick points to make. I would like those in charge of heritage to look at the European recommendation about doing something to restore the fine Athassel Abbey. From a tourism industry viewpoint the excise duty on wine is totally out of kilter. The VAT is much the same in many European countries, but we have to pay penal taxes on wine and that is contributing to costs. My final point is that we should not forget the importance of home tourism. All of us enjoy travelling abroad, but we can at least spend part of our holidays in Ireland. There are lovely parts and none of us should be ashamed to be tourists in our own country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming the Minister of State to the House, I would emphasise that we have seen huge changes in tourism over a number <Col N="1090" />of years. Ten years ago many people, including trade unionists, looked at tourism as a part-time industry with part-time jobs that were not real and could not be developed. This is thankfully beginning to change, but not quickly enough. Many places are taking a new look at tourism. The Minister of State's part of the country was not interested in tourism 20 years ago because it had factories and full employment, unlike other areas. When it lost those it suddenly came late into the tourism industry. There are a couple of places where the impact of tourism may be seen, either coming or going. Tramore experienced the opposite and is now coming back again. The same is true of Ballybunion where tourism was in recession and is coming back, and Bundoran. It is important to create stability because of the impact tourism has on such places.</P>
      <P>I would like to make a number of fundamental points. Picking up appropriately on what Senator Mansergh dealt with, there is the costs differential between Ireland and continental Europe. We all talk about France, Spain or Portugal where we had a meal for two and it only cost two shillings or whatever. Why does it cost so much here?</P>
      <P>There are various things to be looked at, but we can do something about it. I have looked closely at this. I have gone into restaurants and cafés in various countries and studied the differences. I ask the Minister of State to get someone to take this on board. All one has to do is go through the process of opening a restaurant in Ireland and compare it to opening one in other countries, in terms of the requirements. One should have a look at the regulations which we have in place to set up a restaurant and which are shocking. The regulations are totally irrational, one reason for which is because they were put together at the behest of the so-called hospitality industry, which used to be called the vintners, to stop restaurants selling alcohol and to stop restaurants from developing. The most extraordinary conditions must be fulfilled before one can set up a restaurant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, I recently looked at a small coffee shop or sandwich bar that had opened in Ireland. I wished the proprietor well and wanted to go through the planning process with him. He told me about it and the difficulties he had. These were practical difficulties, that in general we agree with, and in fairness he said he had had reasonable experience with the planning authorities in the particular county, which was outside Dublin. However, he showed me a small kitchen area. He had expected to have extra space, but this was taken up by a staff toilet. I pointed out that there was another toilet for invalid accessibility beside it, which should have been adequate for the needs of the sandwich bar, but he said that was for customers. He had only two or three people working there, yet he was required under the legislation to have two separate toilets in a small space that would seat only ten people, one for staff and one for customers. He had to install those toilets or he would not have got planning <Col N="1091" />permission. It is not the local planning authorities that require that, but the legislation passed by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I could give example after example of things like this that put up the cost of people opening enterprises. First, they must have all these things in place, so they have to pay rent for months while they are doing this. It costs more, so more money has to be got back and the customer has to pay for it, ultimately.</P>
    <P>Another issue is the question of the cottage industry. Talk to anyone who has been to Provence and they tell you about the wonderful vegetables. One goes to a town and there is a market with gorgeous shiny apples, oranges, tomatoes, cucumbers etc. One could shave oneself with the shine off those vegetables. I have taken photographs of these and brought them back home. The reality is the stuff we think is gorgeous in the south of France would not be allowed onto the Dublin market because it does not fit into the sorting arrangements required by the EU which we implement, but which France ignores. One can buy a couple of kilos of tomatoes and they will be big and small. In Ireland they all have to be same size because that is the requirement. Every place one goes to in continental Europe, particularly in France, will have the regional products of the area. Some restaurants base their fare purely on the regional products. Here it is difficult to do that because people are prohibited from producing such regional products because of the strict health and safety regulations. I am not opposed to strict health and safety regulations. However, for somebody to produce even something as simple as sandwiches to sell and present in local shops, they must meet the same requirements as someone producing thousands or millions of pounds worth of a similar product in the course of a month. We need to look at the small local or cottage industries and relax rules so they can do their business.</P>
    <P>I completely agree with Senator Mansergh's point about the excise duty. We talk about the price of wine here and on the Continent. There is no longer a case for having such a high excise duty on wine. It is making it difficult to attract people into restaurants.</P>
    <P>This is something we should examine. I welcome my fellow Kerryman, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, to the House. The question of excise duty on wine makes the Minister's life more difficult. It does not need to be as high as it is and we should reduce it.</P>
    <P>It is an achievable aim for Ireland to become the food capital of Europe. Our food, chefs and restaurateurs are superb. We can make ourselves a magnet for the foodies of Europe. This can be the place to which people come for the best food. However, we need to have our own food. Where would somebody go to lunch in Dublin to taste Irish lobster? That is a $64 question. There are a couple of places where one can get it, but there <Col N="1092" />should be a place on every street. It cannot be got here for a variety of reasons that we need to examine, although one can get it in other places, such as Dingle.</P>
    <P>The last time I was in France I looked at the availability of Irish produce in supermarkets. Two weeks ago I was in a Mammoth supermarket in France. All the fish there was Irish. There was seafood produce from Kilmore Quay, for example. The produce there was cheaper than I can buy it in Ireland. I bought Irish scallops more cheaply in a French supermarket than I can buy them in Ireland. In France, full size scallops, as opposed to queen scallops, were available for just less than &euro;1 each. They cost more in supermarkets here. We should examine why this is the case.</P>
    <P>I also looked at the cost of Irish lamb in the same supermarket. In France, it costs &euro;12 or &euro;13 per kilo. Irish supermarkets sell it for anything up to &euro;18, although the price has come down somewhat in recent times. In Kerry, lamb is called mutton after 1 October, although there are different views in the rest of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I know. This is another thing one does not find in Ireland. I guarantee one could search every butcher shop in this town and not find a bit of mutton. Nobody remembers what it is anymore.</P>
      <P>We can all talk about the big issues, but I want to concentrate on simple, practical things. There are some things that we are not doing that we could and need to do. In fairness, successive Governments have tried to incorporate infrastructural development in Finance Bills to build hotels, of which there is a shortage in Ireland. There is no hotel in Belmullet and I do not know if there is one on the River Nore, to pick just two areas from which colleagues that are present in the House come. These are beautiful areas. The sweep of the River Nore and the surrounding area is gorgeous but how many people have seen it? How many people can afford to spend time walking around the gardens at Woodstock, counting the trees and looking at the alleys of various trees from different parts of Europe? These are beautiful places, but they are not attracting people.</P>
      <P>My colleague from County Clare, Senator Daly, spoke earlier in the debate. People talk about the beauty of west Clare, of which we are all aware, but why do we not develop that area? Is there a village in Ireland as beautiful as Mountshannon or a place as beautiful as Lough Derg? Is there a sweep of the river or the road as nice as that from Killaloe to the far side of Nenagh, the high road over the lake? These are beautiful places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>County Roscommon is coming down with beauty, between Strokestown House, the Douglas Hyde centre, the Lough Key forest park and the <Col N="1093" />beautiful lakes. The same is true of Leitrim. One could go through each county in turn and find the same. There is a great case for picking out the secondary tourist target areas which are different from the area that both the Minister and I come from in Kerry. There is a strong case for developing such areas.</P>

      <P>I have so little time I do not know where to start. Two important issues which the report does not address were raised by previous speakers. The fishing industry was referred to by Senator Daly while Senator O'Toole spoke about cottage industries. The Minister should take on board that the inland fishing industry is an important one that requires additional funding. He should examine this area in tandem with cottage industries which have been completely put out of business. Many people come here for brown bread, the baking of which is a dying art and should be preserved. Local produce is promoted in other countries.</P>
      <P>I welcome the report and wish the Minister well in implementing its many findings. There is, however, an over emphasis on Dublin in the report. Several references are made to Dublin Airport but I did not notice any reference to another airport other than Shannon. The metro link to Dublin Airport also comes up, as does a national stadium, a national conference centre and the completion of the M50. If all these projects are to be completed, little funding will be left for regional development.</P>
      <P>People who come here for fishing do not have to come to Dublin; they can fly into other airports, as Senator Daly pointed out. The Minister needs to examine the issues raised by Senator Daly and Senator O'Toole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly pleased to note the excellent contributions of Members of the House to this important debate. The tourism industry is of immense importance. It generates &euro;3 billion in foreign revenue and &euro;1.3 billion in domestic revenue, making a total of &euro;4.3 billion per annum. It contributes &euro;2.2 billion to the economy every year and this amount continues to increase. Over the past decade, investment by the public and private sector in the tourism product has exceeded &euro;4 billion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we have reached a crossroads, I deemed it opportune to ask the tourism review group to <Col N="1094" />look at how we should chart the way forward. In that context, I am particularly disappointed that one of the largest Opposition parties in the State, the Labour Party, should choose to ignore a debate of this significance. It is especially disappointing in view of the importance of the industry to the daily lives of so many people. Some 140,000 people work in the industry, which makes it all the more extraordinary that the Labour Party should ignore the debate.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contributions on what is the most important and authoritative document on tourism policy and performance in well over a decade. I commend them on the depth and range of their interventions. As I mentioned at the outset, I am aware that all those with a keen interest in the tourism industry eagerly anticipated New Horizons for Irish Tourism: An Agenda for Action. Many who felt that the sector was not fully appreciated for its valuable contribution to national economic development will welcome the views expressed. This may be best illustrated by the absence of the Labour Party from the debate. From the statements in the House today and from recent exchanges in the Dáil, it is clear that tourism is particularly valued at local and regional level. This is not surprising given the number of people actively involved in and benefiting from the sector throughout the country. As the report states, tourism has arguably been the most successful sector of Irish-owned enterprise since the foundation of the State. To put the total revenue of &euro;4 billion from overseas visitors into perspective, the sum is equivalent to more than 50% of the total value of exports by Irish owned manufacturers and more than twice the value of exports by Irish-owned, internationally traded services. Tourism is Ireland's largest indigenous, internationally traded industry.</P>
    <P>The report of the tourism policy review group highlights the challenges facing all involved in tourism in the decade ahead. It sets out a strategic approach which tells us the way to get to the new horizon. I am convinced the full potential of the industry can be realised if there is a shared understanding and partnership among key decision makers in the public and private sectors. To achieve this potential, there must be a concerted drive to tackle a number of underlying issues, including competitiveness and value for money, access, transport, human resource development, marketing and product innovation and development. All of these issues were raised in one way or another during this debate.</P>
    <P>It is generally acknowledged that after a decade of continuous growth, the last three years have been very challenging for the tourism industry. We have seen much evidence of the industry's resilience, not least in the innovative methods used to target the domestic and British markets when holiday makers from further afield chose to stay closer to home. It is encouraging to see that in terms of market share, Ireland is performing <Col N="1095" />better than the European norm. The forecast is for continued growth.</P>
    <P>Many of the concerns referred to by Senators reflect the issues which have been outlined in Fáilte Ireland's annual visitor attitude surveys. They have also been raised by the industry itself over the last few difficult years. I have mentioned before that everyone has his or her story about the high cost of eating and drinking out, the price of food in shops and the cost of living generally. Our visitors are no different and the report of the review group quotes clear facts in this regard. Ireland's competitive position relative to other European tourism destinations is under threat and must be addressed coherently across the board.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the steps which have been taken by my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to address what had seemed to be an ever escalating rise in the cost of insurance. I also welcome Fáilte Ireland's recent and practical initiatives. As I indicated earlier, my next step is to establish a small, high level group to implement the initial two year plan which the review group recommended. I hope to take this step shortly.</P>
    <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for affording me the opportunity to address the House. In particular, I express my gratitude to the Leader, Senator O'Rourke, for arranging this very important debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this matter. It is helpful to begin by placing the matter of embryonic stem cell research within the context of the overall EU framework programme for research and development. The Union organises the bulk of its research and development activity under the ambit of multi-annual framework programmes. The current programme, FP6, as the title suggests, is the sixth such programme and runs from 2003 to the end of 2006. The programme supports collaborative research involving industry, third level institutions and dedicated research organisations. Its fundamental aim is to enhance knowledge, understanding and innovation in Europe in order to raise living standards.</P>
      <P>Over time, the framework programmes have expanded the scope of their activity. The initial focus was on information technology, whereas the current programme includes themes on genomics and biotechnology for health, information society technologies, nanotechnologies and nanosciences, food quality and safety and sustainable development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The framework programmes are an important source of support for research and development <Col N="1096" />in Ireland, supplementing our substantial national effort to become a knowledge and innovation driven society. Irish researchers secured &euro;115 million in funding from the previous programme. To date, under FP6, which only commenced last January, we have secured in excess of &euro;40 million. As the programme expands its scope of activities, it is inevitable that policy issues will emerge which require debate. The proposal to provide for embryonic stem cell research is one such issue.</P>
    <P>The common position on the sixth framework programme was agreed at Council in December 2001 and formally adopted on 27 June 2002, following a co-decision procedure with the European Parliament. That decision established the overall funding for the programme at over &euro;16 billion and the allocations for the specific themes within the programme. This included an allocation of &euro;2.255 billion for the theme relating to life sciences, genomics and biotechnology for health. The latter includes stem cell research involving adult and embryonic cells.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, the Council was required to formally adopt the specific programmes to allow the European Commission to activate the relevant calls for proposals in each area. This was achieved by Council decision on 30 September 2002. As part of that process, a number of member states, including Ireland, expressed concern at the lack of clear guidelines and safeguards to govern the conduct of the research work on embryonic stem cells.</P>
    <P>As a result of this, the Council agreed to a Commission proposal to impose a moratorium until 31 December 2003 on the conduct of such research under the programme pending the development of detailed guidelines and safeguards. However, certain activities are explicitly excluded from the overall framework programme in their entirety. These are research activities aiming at human cloning for reproductive purposes, research activity intended to modify the genetic heritage of human beings and research activities intended to create human embryos solely for the purpose of research or for the purpose of stem cell procurement.</P>
    <P>The research on embryonic stem cells is confined to those cells derived from embryos resulting from <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation treatment designed to induce pregnancy and no longer required for that purpose. On foot of the establishment of the moratorium, which expires at the end of this year, the Commission held an inter-institutional seminar to tease out the guidelines. It subsequently presented its proposal in on 9 July 2003. The proposal is for a Council decision to amend the research programme. It proposes to establish a detailed set of implementing provisions concerning any research activities involving human embryos and human embryonic stem cells.</P>
    <P>Embryonic stem cell research is already provided for in the EU framework programme. Financial resources have been provided for it within <Col N="1097" />the overall allocation for genomics and biotechnology for health since the decision of December 2001. What is missing are guidelines and safeguards and this is precisely and only what the Commission's proposal now provides.</P>
    <P>The key elements and implications of the guidelines are that the proposals are based on the principle of ethical subsidiarity. In this context, this means that the European Union will not support or fund research in a member state where such research is not legal or deemed ethical. All proposals for research will be subject to ethical review both at local and EU level. The EU will only support research on supernumerary embryos derived from IVF and donated before 27 June 2002. The effect of this cut off date is that there must be no incentive to produce new embryos as a result of the programme. In addition, the creation of embryos specifically for research purposes is prohibited. This prohibition is in line with the Oviedo convention.</P>
    <P>There is a requirement to demonstrate that the research cannot be done using adult stem cell lines. This is an important point which I would particularly bring to the attention of the House. First, it means there is no incentive to use embryonic cells rather than adult cells and it means researchers must thoroughly examine the potential of using adult cells, for which there is also funding available under the programme. No financial gain for donors is permitted. This is in line with related ethical considerations in the area, for example, of organ donations for transplantation purposes.</P>
    <P>Researchers will be required to make stem cell lines derived available to other researchers. This requirement has the potential to reduce the number of embryos used to derive stem cell lines. It also puts the research firmly into the public domain. The European Commission is to fund a European registry of stem cell lines. This again underscores the putting of the research and the results deriving from it into the public domain. Finally, the Commission undertakes to produce a report in 2005 on the research and its outcomes. This report will underpin the formulation of future policy in this area. It will also provide valuable help in informing the debate about the relative potential of embryonic and adult stem cells.</P>
    <P>I stress to the House that the essence of this proposal is to provide guidelines and safeguards on the conduct of embryonic stem cell research and is supported by the EU framework programme in those countries where the research is legal and ethical. Ireland does not consider it appropriate to oppose the Commission proposal as currently drafted on the basis that it does not allow for the EU funding of any research activity in Ireland which would not satisfy Irish ethical or legal requirements and in so far as other EU member states carrying out such research, Ireland would prefer that it be done under regulation, with proper safeguards in place rather than a free for all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1098" />We want to ensure, and support the idea, that research in the area be conducted under the strictest of guidelines. In that context, I bring to the attention of the House the uncertain and unsatisfactory situation which will arise if the guidelines are not adopted. If the Council votes against the proposals, it is still open to the Commission to activate the research once the moratorium comes to an end. In other words, if the Council votes &ldquo;No&rdquo;, there is a strong risk this research will go ahead anyway without any guidelines, or with more liberal guidelines, but certainly without guidelines we would be able to influence. There is a serious concern that a potentially unregulated scenario could open up if this were to happen. That is why we believe there is a clear and strong case for putting in place the stringent guidelines and safeguards which are at the core of the Commission's proposal.</P>
    <P>It must be acknowledged that this is an ethically and scientifically complex area. In terms of the science, there is divided opinion on the relative merits of researching adult stem cells versus embryonic stem cells and on the potential of the two kinds of cells to yield therapies. I draw the attention of the House to a viewpoint expressed by the Catholic University of Louvain on the issue of stem cell research. I apologise for the length of the quotation.</P>
    <P>The benefit of stem cells is considerable. Although preliminary and no doubt extensive research is still essential, the hope is that this research will lead to major advances in treatment in several fields of medicine, in particular in the treatment of various degenerative diseases.</P>
    <P>This research raises ethical issues hitherto unseen. Some of the research will involve the use of stem cells from embryos: this raises the question of respect for the human embryo, which from the very beginning of its existence is more than just biological material. Given the suffering on the part of so many incurable people today, research is also an ethical duty.</P>
    <P>The Catholic University of Louvain therefore recognises that it has a two-fold duty to take the initiative, but also to exercise precaution. We wish to place the ethical issues ahead of economic and scientific considerations, which themselves only have any meaning if human dignity is preserved.</P>
    <P>We would also point out that any use of the human embryo must be accompanied by binding ethical and scientific guidelines: firstly, there must be a democratic debate involving the whole of society, and then transparent inspection and decision-making mechanisms must be defined.</P>
    <P>It is clear that all those involved in the research are enthusiastic about its potential. The point of debate in the scientific community is about how that potential can be realised. The ethical and legal issues involved relate not just to stem cell <Col N="1099" />research, but to the entire area of assisted human reproduction.</P>
    <P>IVF treatment is practised in Ireland, as it is in many countries. As my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, remarked:</P>
    <P>Major advances have taken place in recent years in the capacity of medical science to intervene in the process of human reproduction. Techniques such as in-vitro fertilisation, the freezing and storage of sperm and artificial insemination by donor are available in Ireland and have enabled many couples to conceive children despite impaired fertility.</P>
    <P>As a result of current medical practice in this area, surplus embryos arise. In Ireland these embryos can be frozen, where after a period of some three to five years they will cease to be viable. Alternatively, they may be reinserted in the donor to be subsequently excreted. In certain other countries, the legal and ethical regime allows for the donation of such embryos for research. This approach was described, in the paper already referred to, by the Catholic University of Louvain in the following terms:</P>
    <P>When the parents have fulfilled their plan, rather than authorising the simple destruction of their embryos the parents could, in a spirit of ethical solidarity, donate their embryos for the removal of stem cells to be used in research or to care for other individuals.</P>
    <P>It has become clear over the past number of years that this is a complex, legal and ethical issue. It is precisely for this reason that the expert Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction, chaired by Professor Dervilla Donnelly, has been established. She recently outlined the role and work of the commission to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business during its scrutiny of this matter. The terms of reference of the commission are to prepare a report on the possible approaches to the regulation of all aspects of assisted human reproduction and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into account in determining public policy in this area. The commission is due to report in the near future and I am sure that its findings will play a valuable role in informing the development of our national policy in this area.</P>
    <P>In the latter regard, it is important to draw the distinction between national and European policy. There has been a tendency in some quarters to address the European Commission proposal as if it were legislating for embryonic stem cell research in Ireland when it is, transparently, doing precisely the opposite. It is, as I have stressed, providing for stringent guidelines and safeguards to underpin concerted European research only in those member states where it is ethical and deemed legal, and then only when the researchers in question have explored all possible alternatives to their planned approach to the research.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1100" />I ask the House to recall that what is involved here is the establishment of clear guidelines and safeguards to govern research at European level in member states where it is legal and deemed ethical. It explicitly respects the positions of those member states, like Ireland, whose legal and ethical regime forbids such research.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Tánaiste to the House and thank her for outlining her views. While I do not necessarily share them, I thank her for expressing them. I am glad that she seems interested in a full democratic debate because indications so far have been otherwise and I hope ethical considerations will take precedence over monetary or economic ones.</P>
      <P>There are important ethical, constitutional, legal and moral issues involved in this matter. We should have much more information and consideration before proceeding further. Will the Tánaiste inform us when we will have the report of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction or did she say we can expect to have it shortly? Will she inform us whether the Government is considering the publication of a Green Paper on this important issue, which would take account of the views of the bioethics committee and others? Surely the Government would not enter into any international commitments in this area without consulting Dáil Éireann and the Seanad in advance.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, three joint committees have already had some discussion on the subject, in particular the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business which considered the matter at its meeting on 5 November, as a result of a referral for scrutiny. The committee heard representatives of the Department and the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction to assist it in its consideration of the proposal. The committee on bioethics informed the joint committee that it did not consider that it could be of assistance to it on that particular occasion. Representatives of the Department made oral presentations and the committee members raised a number of issues with them. Following further deliberation, the joint committee agreed that the proposal should be opposed with a view to it being rejected at Council.</P>
      <P>The Sub-committee on European Scrutiny has drawn the attention of both Houses to a number of matters as a result of its examination of the proposal. It makes the point that the sub-committee received no advance notice of the proposal and noted that it had not been scrutinised by the Oireachtas. It understands that a number of member states raised concerns at the Council meeting in Brussels on 29 September and that if they were to vote against the proposed measures on 27 November, their votes would constitute a blocking minority. Perhaps the Tánaiste might like to comment on that aspect. I understand that Austria, Germany, Italy and Portugal are opposed to the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1101" />The sub-committee noted all of the implications and strongly believed that they should receive appropriate consideration by both Houses before any decision is made by the Council of Ministers. The sub-committee also recommended that this measure, which will allow for the establishment of implementing provisions, including a code of conduct for research activities involving human embryos and human embryonic stem cells, should be opposed by Ireland at the Council of Ministers until the Oireachtas has completed the scrutiny process and dealt with all relevant concerns.</P>
    <P>The sub-committee points out that the usual procedure for legislative measures under Pillar 1 is by regulation or directive. The procedure being used here is a proposal for a decision under Article 166 of the treaty. Draft regulations and draft directives must come to the sub-committee for scrutiny within four weeks of being received from the EU Commission. As this is not a draft regulation or draft directive it was not submitted. This runs counter to the spirit of the EU Scrutiny Act 2002. I am sure many Members share my concern that this important issue deserves much more consideration.</P>
    <P>The Constitution lays down that human dignity is inviolable. It must be respected and protected. As Eamonn O'Dwyer, Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, wrote in <i>The Irish Times</i> a few days ago: &ldquo;If human dignity is inviolable, as the Constitution states it is, then surely the human embryo is entitled to respect and protection.&rdquo; He wrote that there are two compelling arguments against the use of human embryonic stem cells for therapeutic purposes. First, he said that obtaining such cells necessarily involves the death of the embryo. Can this be morally right? The answer has to be an emphatic &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>He also said the Constitution guarantees in its laws to defend and vindicate unborn human life, without specifying where that human life originated. If this is so, is there not a constitutional constraint on our Government in providing funding for embryonic human stem cell research, wherever such research may be conducted?</P>
    <P>Second, he pointed out that there is increasing scientific evidence that adult stem cells may be as effective as embryonic stem cells, without having the same ethical implications. Apparently, it is a fact that the extreme versatility of embryonic stem cells makes them unpredictable and they cannot be relied on to develop as intended. Adult stem cells, on the other hand, which are further along the developmental chain, are believed to reduce that risk. Again, in <i>The Irish Times</i> a few days ago, Fr. Kevin Doran wrote:</P>
    <P>Adult stem cells can be harvested without causing harm or loss of life. Provided proper consent is obtained and the stem cells are used for the purpose of developing treatments there is no ethical problem about the use of adult stem cells and funding should be directed to this area of research. The harvesting of stem cells from embryos always results in the <Col N="1102" />destruction of the embryo. If it were only a haphazard cluster of cells, there would be no problem, but an embryo, although it is small and cannot smile yet, is a distinct individual human being in the process of rapid organised development.</P>
    <P>The deliberate destruction of innocent human life is fundamentally wrong and even the prospect of wonderful new cures does nothing to change that fact. In the same article, Fr. Doran pointed out that researchers argue it is acceptable to destroy embryos as long as it is done in a good cause and that they might as well &ldquo;give some meaning&rdquo; to their lives. However, as he pointed out, &ldquo;to be used as raw material for the pharmaceutical industry is not what gives meaning to the existence of the human embryo&rdquo;. We know that all humans die and embryos are no different and, again, as Fr. Doran pointed out, &ldquo;the moral evil is associated not with the fact that embryos die, but with the fact that somebody decides to kill them&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is huge concern among the churches, as I am sure the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is aware, although I was not aware of the position of the centre at Louvain which she quoted. Scientists are also hugely concerned about this issue. Some of them take one view, but most of them appear to be opposed to this development. There has not been any vote in the Oireachtas, particularly in the Dáil, and this matter should not be rushed.</P>
    <P>An EU legislative scrutiny Act was passed last year by both Houses to reinforce the powers of the Houses to ensure legislation coming before the Council of Ministers is scrutinised. Such scrutiny has led to the rejection of this proposal, but, as we all know, even that scrutiny came about by accident. It is wrong to proceed with this decision at the Council of Ministers. As I said, this area is a minefield which needs to be negotiated with great care. We should be extremely careful about committing Ireland's resources in such a precarious manner.</P>
    <P>How does the Tánaiste and the Government see a vote in favour of the funding of this research as not totally at odds with the spirit of our Constitution, which specifically recognises the right to life of the unborn? Surely now is the time for the Government to take a principled stand on this issue and give moral leadership. What about the principle of collective Cabinet decision making? Will the Tánaiste's vote on behalf of Ireland at the Council of Ministers on 27 November be her own or, as would be considered more correct, will it be subject to the approval of the Cabinet? Nothing should be done which would impair our constitutional position. I again call for a Green Paper on the issue and a full debate in both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the House to explain this very complex area which is causing great debate and concern among many <Col N="1103" />people. The Tánaiste has kindly agreed to respond to some of the questions that will be put by Members at the end of the debate at the request of the Leader of the House and I thank her. It is rather unusual for a Minister in her position, who is not in the health dimension, to be in this position on this issue. It appears to be an issue that should be dealt with by the Department of Health and Children and not the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. However, I am a former Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and I dealt with many issues under the Single European Act. I appreciated that many items came to the Department at certain times and decisions on them had to be made very quickly.</P>
      <P>Discussions took place at the Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, of which I am a member, but I was not able to attend on the day. The Tánaiste must be concerned with the recommendations of that committee, but she is not tied by a recommendation of that committee on this issue. I welcome the Tánaiste's very detailed assessment and I do not intend to go into all the details of this matter as serious ethical issues have been raised. The Tánaiste will, I presume, represent the views of the Cabinet and the decision reached on 27 November will be one agreed by the Government. The Tánaiste, as the deputy leader of the Government, will be aware of the views of the Cabinet on this particular issue. She is also aware that there was a discussion in the European Parliament and I understand the Fianna Fáil group voted against funding this research. I am subject to clarification on this as the vote took place very recently. I am not sure of the detail, but my colleagues might be.</P>
      <P>We are in a particular difficulty as far as supporting the research in Europe is concerned. It would not take place here because it is unconstitutional to carry out such research. Would it require a referendum for the Government to agree to fund this research abroad if Irish taxpayers' money was being used to fund embryo and cellular research in any part of Europe? Our Constitution clearly states that the State is opposed to abortion in all its forms and any support for any form of research on the embryo could be seen as being in conflict with the Constitution. Has the Attorney General given the Tánaiste a guideline on this or a clear, legal interpretation of the Constitution? Irrespective of the possible benefits of embryonic stem cell research, the question of the right to life of the unborn is very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statements have been made very actively by one MEP, Dana Rosemary Scallon, on this issue. She has very strong views, but her intervention in the last pro-life referendum was unhelpful and contributed to its eventual defeat. The Government supported it and went to a great deal of effort to bring that referendum to the people. It was very fair and was supported by all the churches, but, irrespective of her involvement in <Col N="1104" />the stem cell research debate, her intervention in that regard was very unhelpful. I am not stating that she single-handedly defeated the referendum, but her intervention confused the electorate.</P>
    <P>I read the details on cloning and stem cell research which were submitted to the House of Lords Select Committee on Stem Cell Research. I am sure members of the Government and the Tánaiste have also read this material. I also read a detailed document from the European Commission entitled Stem Cells: Therapies for the Future. I am, therefore, aware that the various issues of concern to the Irish people and to Members are being carefully considered.</P>
    <P>I have tremendous confidence in the Tánaiste. I know she is concerned about this issue and is taking note of the views being expressed by Members of the House. I presume she will also have the opportunity to speak on the matter in the Lower House. She would be in a stronger position, from her point of view and that of the Government, if a vote was taken in the Lower House on this issue because it would allow her to proceed in respect of the decision that must be made. It is easy to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; and, in the circumstances, I would be inclined to do so.</P>
    <P>On 29 October 2003, representatives of the Irish Bishops' Conference met the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, to discuss several issues including EU proposals to fund embryonic stem cell research. The bishops representing the conference at the meeting were Cardinal Desmond Connell, Archbishop of Dublin, Dr. Joseph Duffy, Bishop of Clogher, and Dr. Patrick Walsh, Bishop of Down and Connor. On 6 November, Bishop Joseph Duffy wrote to the Taoiseach on behalf of the Irish Bishops' Conference delegation and stated:</P>
    <P>As we pointed out during our meeting with you, research into adult stem cells is ethically acceptable and legal in all member states of the EU, and has made most promising progress in recent years. Indeed adult stem cells have been used for many years in connection with bone marrow transplants. We asked the Government to take a lead in advocating that the EU should give significant research funding to adult stem-cell research.</P>
    <P>The conference has, therefore, given a green light to adult stem cell research. I am not sure whether the latter can be separated from embryonic stem cell research, but they are two completely different areas.</P>
    <P>The Government must bear in mind the views of the bishops in respect of this matter. The letter to which I refer also states: &ldquo;We welcome the desire which you expressed to prevent research on human embryos and embryonic stem cells here in Ireland, where it would be illegal as well as unethical.&rdquo; That is a clear and definite statement that such research should, under no circumstances, be carried out in this jurisdiction. The letter further states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1105" />We also note your stated desire to safeguard the protection of human embryos at European level. As of now, however, the public impression is that the Irish Government is neutral on this matter, and the Irish delegation is understood to have made it clear on several occasions that it would not oppose the Commission proposal allowing for EU funding of destructive embryo research.</P>
    <P>It is at this point that emotive language enters the debate because what we are talking about is the destruction of an embryo. Whether such an embryo is viable is a serious ethical question, as is that relating to whether it would be destroyed or become obsolete during research. Where then should the intervention be made? In my opinion, the direct intervention in stem cell research in respect of a viable embryo runs contrary to the spirit of the Constitution, which is pro-life. The cells in question have the right to develop and grow into a human being.</P>
    <P>One can refer to the benefits of research of this nature in terms of the serious complaints by which many people are affected. Such views were put forward recently on &ldquo;The Marian Finucane Show&rdquo; to which the Tánaiste was a contributor. Some emotive telephone calls were received during which people referred to individuals with particular diseases who allegedly would be helped by the outcome of detailed stem cell research on embryos. Irrespective of this, however, we must bear in mind the rights of the unborn.</P>
    <P>Where do we go from here? If we give Europe the green light to proceed with embryonic stem cell research, what will be the next step? What will be the position <i>vis-à-vis </i>cloning, which would be the ultimate development of stem cell research? Research into cloning is being carried out in various parts of the world, whether under government approval or otherwise. Cloning has already taken place in respect of animals and some people believe that research into human cloning is ongoing at present. The latter would have extremely serious repercussions.</P>
    <P>If the Tánaiste could have the vote on this matter deferred, it would give people an opportunity to study the issues involved and allow a comprehensive debate on them to take place throughout the country. A referendum on this matter could be divisive. If the Government was to put forward a referendum, it would have to allow people to decide on the issues rather than giving a directive in respect of them. I would not campaign in favour of approving embryonic stem cell research in Europe in such a referendum.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste has a broader remit and is obliged to consider the overall picture in respect of research in Ireland and the benefits of research in Europe to Irish industry, etc. I respect her views and I will also respect whatever decision she will make following careful consideration of this matter, on which she is receiving extremely good advice from top officials.</P>
    <P>The key issue is that, unfortunately, many lives have been lost as a result of abortion. The Amer<Col N="1106" />icans have taken some action in terms of rowing back on abortion. Ireland is one of the few countries to state, on many occasions, that it will not permit abortions to be carried out in its jurisdiction. In that context, I would feel more comfortable if the Tánaiste would consider not supporting the proposal at European Union level. This would give us an opportunity to engage in further debate. If she makes a decision now, it will tie the hands of Members. As the Tánaiste stated, research in this area will proceed, irrespective of the decision made by the Government. In my view we would be showing consistency on behalf of the Irish people if we were to vote against this proposal when it arises at the Council of Ministers. If the Tánaiste votes against it, she will have our support and respect. She has strong ethical views which I respect.</P>
    <P>I hope we will have an opportunity to debate this matter in more detail during the coming year, particularly if the Tánaiste can have the decision deferred. The making of such a decision is premature because the Irish people have not had an opportunity to discuss the ethical issues involved. The Constitution is particularly firm in respect of research in this area. Regardless of the benefits that could accrue, embryonic stem cell research on viable embryos is unethical. In the circumstances, on moral and ethical grounds, I request the Tánaiste to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; when the proposal comes before the Council of Ministers at the end of the month.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Having sought a debate on this important topic, I thank the Leader for organising it. I also thank the Tánaiste for coming to the House to discuss this matter and for the clarity of her contribution.</P>
      <P>I wish to begin with a question, which no other Member may pose. The aim of the directive is to introduce guidelines and restrictions on embryonic stem cell research. A moratorium has been put on such research in Europe until the end of the year. If the directive is not passed, can research take place in Europe, as in America, without restrictions? It is extremely important that this question should be addressed. Senator Leyden referred to cloning. A Council of Europe directive, known as the Oviedo convention, has been in place for two years but Ireland has not signed it. Why not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Difficult considerations must be taken into account in all areas of medical research and treatment and this is particularly so in the area of stem cell research and treatment, given that the European directive on funding for science is under consideration. There is little controversy regarding the use of adult stem cells, which are harvested from the adult who will be treated with them or another person, or the use of umbilical cord blood. However, for various reasons, a number of religions do not believe blood transfusions should be taken or given and they object to the use of stem cells from bone marrow or cord <Col N="1107" />blood. Their ethical views must also be taken into account.</P>
    <P>The primary ethical problem relates to the use of embryonic stem cells. Under the directive, these are cells created prior to 1 June 2002 only for infertility purposes, which are described as supernumerary embryos. These embryos have not been created specifically for research. The Oviedo convention condemns this but Ireland has not signed it. This is difficult to follow. It has long been agreed it is unethical to produce embryos for research but, when a couple decides to undergo treatment for infertility, it may be necessary for medical reasons to fertilise the woman's egg with the man's sperm outside the man in a little glass dish. This is known as <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation. Each fertilised egg develops into a ball of cells called a blastocyst. Approximately three were placed in the woman's womb in the past, as this was considered to be the best way to produce one or two children. However, advances in technology mean that only one or two blastocysts must be inserted. The remaining fertilised eggs are frozen in many countries to avoid the hazards of multiple children which may develop for both the mother and children.</P>
    <P>Since retrieving eggs from the mother is a complex process and not without dangers, the fertilised eggs which are not inserted in the womb are kept in case the initial implantation fails and the couple decides to try for a child again or if they decide to have more children following a successful implantation. The eggs which are frozen and may not be used for implantation are at the centre of the debate. They comprise a specific group, as they were created for medical reasons before June 2002.</P>
    <P>If couples decide not to have more children, the blastocysts can be used as supernumerary embryos provided they give their consent, no money changes hands and, above all, the research is considered ethically suitable. This is unconstitutional in Ireland and it contravenes Medical Council guidelines. There is no legislation in this area, although I tried to introduce a Private Members' Bill on this issue more than four years ago because regulation is important.</P>
    <P>We have an ethical responsibility for embryonic fertilised eggs and we also have a similar responsibility for people who have a serious illness and who may be helped or cured through the use of embryonic stem cells. The European Organisation for Rare Diseases has made us well aware of the concerns we should have for people such as their members, young and old, who develop degenerative conditions, some with a genetic basis.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, I attended a meeting on stem cell research on 15 and 16 September 2003, which was organised by the UK Medical Research Council, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council and the Department of Trade and Industry. I was amazed <Col N="1108" />at the progress that had been made in a few years in the use of adult, foetal and embryonic stem cells in the treatment of many conditions, a number of which are serious. Since that meeting, I have read as much as possible on the subject.</P>
    <P>The advances made in the use of adult stem cells could not have been projected five years ago but the difficulties in using them should not be minimised and progress in the field may have to match similar progress in embryonic stem cell research. For example, adult stem cells do not exist together similar to embryonic cells. They are scattered all over an organ and they can be difficult to collect for use in a practical manner. Stem cells are in good supply, for example, in the brain but they are difficult to collect because the best ones are to be found in a part of the brain known as the <i>substansia nigra.</i> This is located deep in the brain and I am at a loss as to how they can be taken from a living adult. They can be harvested from the brains of the recently deceased but these cells die rapidly due to a lack of oxygen. While they are useful when harvested from the living brain, there are difficulties when they are harvested from the recently deceased in a similar manner to the harvesting of vital organs that give hope to transplant patients. This issue must be addressed.</P>
    <P>Adult stem cells are more flexible than was believed but they are still multipotent. In other words, they try to go down the stream that one wishes them to go down. If they are myoblasts in the heart, they want to become heart cells. Similarly, if they are hepatocytes in the liver, they want to become liver cells. I witnessed terrific work where such cells could be transmitted down the portal vein into the pancreas of a diabetes patient and they began to produce insulin. This could not have happened five years ago but progress in ongoing in this field. It is important that it should not be looked on as too simple because it is not. More progress will be reported in ten years.</P>
    <P>I have also read documents such as COM 2003/390, which is the final proposal for a Council decision on embryo research, dated 16 October 2003, and the report of the committee on culture, science and education of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, dated 11 September 2003. Considering that progress in adult and embryonic stem cell research varies from week to week, I support the position paper put forward by the Government to the Council research group on 8 September 2003. It states:</P>
    <P>Ireland is not opposing the Commission proposal to amend the Specific Programme to provide new guidelines to apply specifically to Community funding of research activities involving the procurement of stem cells from human embryos on the basis that the proposal does not allow for the funding of any research activity in Ireland which would not satisfy Irish ethical or legal requirements; Framework Programme activity will be strictly limited to research on embryos produced by medically-<Col N="1109" />assisted <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation in order to induce pregnancy and that will not be used anymore for such purpose (supernumerary embryos); clear and comprehensive guidelines and conditions governing research on human embryos and human embryonic stem cells are being established; a scientific evaluation and ethical review will be required before any proposal for research activity under FP6 in this area is permitted.</P>
    <P>That is very important. We should be represented on that committee which is to decide what will be allowed at European level in terms of research. The paper concludes: &ldquo;In view of the foregoing, Ireland does not consider it appropriate to object to such research activity being carried out in member states where it is both legal and ethical&rdquo;. I was very pleased to see that, not only would countries have to look at their own ethical guidelines with regard to the use of these cells, but there would also be a central authority in Europe on which, as I said, we should be represented. In that way, we could review the criteria, which must be strictly and carefully controlled, even after review in the countries where this type of research is legal and ethical. I believe our views are well worthwhile.</P>
    <P>We need to take public control of everything to do with stem cell research, more especially in the case of embryonic stem cells. I regard the situation in America with horror. There are bio-banks with cell lines which are sold commercially, which is utterly deplorable. As I have stated previously, I do not believe we should support within Europe the privatisation of the patenting of the human genome. We should take control of these issues, which should be public issues and not privately supported. I am concerned that if we do not support this directive &ndash; I look forward to the Tánaiste's reply to this debate &ndash; we may have an unrestricted situation, as is in America and which I find absolutely deplorable.</P>
    <P>The principle of proportionality applies, of course, to the use of this research. The methods must be reasonable and acceptable and there must not be a more acceptable alternative. We may find that progress on adult stem cells will result in a future situation where we will not need to use embryonic stem cells. However, at the moment, we need them because they are truly potent and we have an ethical duty to people with degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and the neuro-muscular diseases of children. I was interested to note a statement by the secretary of the Irish Bishops' commission on bio-ethics, Fr. Kevin Doran, who has been quoted already. Addressing the issue of pharmaceutical companies in this country, he said: &ldquo;How do we feel about the development of treatments based on embryonic stem cell research in other countries, which treatments will be produced here?&rdquo; We have placed a great deal of emphasis on the fact that we are promoting biotechnology in Ireland. I ask Senators to address that also.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1110" />We must also address the issue as to whether we would consider it unethical to allow treatments, using embryonic stem cells, which were found to be useful in other countries to be used on patients in this country. Will we say also that we find that deplorable and that such treatments cannot be used here? It is important that we take account of those most serious considerations. It is fine to ban things which are not of very practical use at present, but there are issues to be considered further down the line.</P>
    <P>In the Seanad Chamber, all of us respect each other's opinions and we speak in good faith. While we may have different views, all of us have respect for human life. Whereas I would not consider the human blastocyte, at this stage, to be a human being, it has the potential to be a human being and, therefore, has to be given the greatest respect and dignity. We should also remember that we are not the only people in Europe who have ethical concerns in this regard. This issue is being addressed with great consideration throughout the European Union. I do not envy the Tánaiste in the decisions she has to make in this area. My concern is that we may arrive at a situation which is totally deregulated, as in the United States of America.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Tánaiste to the House and commend her on the clarity and content of her address. In debates of this nature in the House over several years, to my recollection, we have always been careful to conduct them in a dispassionate and compassionate way. We are very fortunate in having the benefit of the advice of colleagues such as Senator Henry, who has the necessary technical competence and scientific knowledge to guide the debate.</P>
      <P>In the wider context, I welcome the EU Sixth Framework Programme on research and acknowledge its value. From an Irish perspective, it is most important that adequate research be undertaken in all areas, in terms of our competitiveness in an international market. I am conscious of the fact that what we are now considering is just a very tiny fraction of the number of scientific research projects submitted for consideration under this programme. That is not to diminish in any way the critical importance of that very small number of projects and the attendant technical, legal and ethical questions which surround them. Those are huge questions and I would not wish to underestimate their significance or sensitivity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having been a member of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, which considered the abortion issue, I believe it was to the credit of Members of both Houses that those hugely difficult issues were dealt with in such a dispassionate and compassionate way. I particularly applaud the work of Deputy Brian Lenihan as chairman of that committee, which guides my views on this particular issue. It would be most unfortunate that these issues should be politicised. They have to be dealt with on an ethical, legal and technical <Col N="1111" />basis and they involve very difficult questions. It would be quite outrageous to politicise an issue of this nature for purely naked political reasons. I hope that will not occur and, on the basis of my past experience, I am confident it will not.</P>
    <P>We need to focus on what we are actually being asked to do. The matter which will go before the Competitiveness Council on 27 November is quite narrow. It involves voting on guidelines &ndash; not the funding &ndash; which will regulate the way in which EU-funded research will be conducted in the other member states. I endorse very strongly Senator Henry's comments with regard to the need for regulation. We have sufficient experience from the overall scientific area, quite apart from these difficult issues, to know that if science is not regulated, the genie can get out of the bottle. There are totally unscrupulous and unethical people in science, as elsewhere, and unless there are rules and regulations to govern them, we are liable to go down a very slippery slope.</P>
    <P>Another confusion which seems to apply to this issue is that, somehow, we are being asked to conduct stem cell research in this country. That is not the case. We are being asked to consider whether other countries which have the necessary legal and ethical framework should be allowed to do this. That is a separate issue.</P>
    <P>The European Union has been careful over its history to keep out of our ethical dilemmas. In other words, we regulate for ourselves how these critical, ethical issues should be dealt with. In this instance, the Medical Council would deal with this matter. However, we want to turn that on its head and instruct the European Union as to how it should universally apply a proposal to all the member states but we would say, with equal or even more force, that this proposal should not apply to Ireland. This is a two way street, and we cannot have it both ways. It is an important matter.</P>
    <P>It must be emphasised that we are dealing with a very narrow area of activity. People have been almost suggesting that embryos at will are going to be used for this purpose. As Senator Henry and the Minister explained, it is much narrower than that. This is to do with the embryos that are left over from <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation that were created before a particular date and only those are under consideration. There seems to be a suggestion that this matter may wind up as a referendum issue. I cannot see how that could possibly be the case. It might wind up being a referendum issue if we decided to introduce stem cell research. That might be the case but even that is tenuous. How can the matter be a referendum issue if what we are talking about is an activity in other countries and not one here? I do not understand the logic of that argument. I do not believe the Commission has ever forced on member states proposals they would find unacceptable ethically or culturally. That is not what the European Union is about. If such research ever takes <Col N="1112" />place here, it will be entirely of our volition. This country will decide that and the Medical Council would probably regulate it.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry raised an important issue regarding the activities of the pharmaceutical companies. It seems to be the case that provided this research happens somewhere else, we are happy with it. It was almost the same in the case of the abortion debate in that provided we exported the problem, it was one about which we did not have to worry. Senator Henry raised an important matter, that if stem cell research results in drugs being manufactured or sold here by the pharmaceutical companies, that presents an ethical question. That will have to be examined at some stage.</P>
    <P>The Commission proposal deals with a precise research topic, the derivation of stem cells from supernumerary embryos with no parental project. They are frozen as a result of <i>in vitro </i>fertilisation treatment and donated by the parents for research. It is critical to point out that nobody can benefit financially from such activity. The proposal does not aim to create human embryos for the purpose of stem cell procurement including the means of somatic cell nuclear transfer, commonly referred to therapeutic cloning. The creation of human embryos for research is explicitly excluded from the scope of the framework programme funding. The EU will not fund human embryonic research, stem cell research, where it is forbidden by a member state. That applies to us. Human embryonic stem cells can only be derived from supernumerary embryos that are donated for research by parents and that were created, as Senator Henry said, before 27 June 2002, the date of the adoption of the framework programme. These embryos are destined to be destroyed at some point in time.</P>
    <P>Potential research project partners applying for EU funding must seek ethical advice at national or local level in member states where the research will take place, even in countries where obtaining such ethical advice is not mandatory. Research will be funded only when it is demonstrated that it meets particularly important research objectives. Research will be EU funded only where there is no adequate alternative available. In particular, it must be demonstrated that one cannot use existing embryonic or adult stem cell lines. Supernumerary embryos will be used only if informed consent has been given by the donor. Embryo donors will not be permitted to make a financial gain. Data and privacy protection of donors must be guaranteed. Traceability of stem cells will be required and research consortia will be required to engage in making available new human embryonic stem cells to other researchers.</P>
    <P>The nub of the matter is that it is infinitely preferable that this matter be governed by guidelines, that they would be properly drawn up and properly applied. I support the Minister's statement that Ireland does not think it appropriate to oppose the Commission proposal, as currently <Col N="1113" />drafted. She gave the basis for doing that and I support that point of view.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the findings of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction, chaired by Professor Donnelly, which will assist this debate. The most germane and critical point was the final one made by the Minister. She asked the House to recall that what is involved here is the establishment of clear guidelines on safeguards to govern research at European level and in member states where it is legal and deemed ethical. What is proposed explicitly respects the positions of those member states whose legal and ethical regime forbids such research, a category into which we fall.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I thank the Leader for organising this debate which we have frequently sought in recent times. I welcome that we can finally debate this issue in advance of a vote that will be taken in Brussels at the end of this month. I also thank the Minister for giving us so much of her time this afternoon and in recent times.</P>
      <P>The rapid advance of biochemistry in recent years has opened up previously unimaginable opportunities for medicine. These opportunities present real opportunities for research and may possibly yield particular results. However, such advances in biochemistry also present society with a major dilemma. It boils down to one huge ethical question, namely whether this is right or wrong. That question can only be answered by ourselves. When people research this matter, it is one on which they will have to decide for themselves. This debate and scientific advances forces us to redefine and re-explore the limits of proper scientific research. That is not something I say lightly. There are many diverse views on this area, but the issue boils down to what one is happy with when one asks oneself the ethical question or whether such research it is right or wrong, although it is not easy to weigh up the pros and cons of such a complex, diverse topic as embryonic stem cell research.</P>
      <P>Stem cells have the ability to develop into virtually any cell in the body and may have the potential to treat medical conditions such as diabetes and degenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and motor neurone disease. This type of research offers people who suffer from these illnesses real hope that it may assist them at some stage in dealing with the effects of such degenerative diseases. In the case of a person who has damaged his or her spinal cord, such research may help him or her to become fully functional again one day. Irrespective of on what side of the argument one stands, such an opportunity cannot be denied to such people. One must consider the merits of giving a person real hope to make a recovery from an illness as devastating as those I mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The stem cells retain the ability to become many or all of the different cell types in the body and they play a critical role in repairing organs <Col N="1114" />and body tissues throughout life. When we sought this debate I knew very little about the subject but I researched and debated it over the weekend and read many good articles setting out the views for an against it. I recently read about Christopher Reeve, the Hollywood actor, who suffered a nasty fall eight years ago. He has set up a wonderful foundation that supports research in paraplegia and for those who suffer from severed, broken or damaged spinal tissue. He has made remarkable improvements in his condition and has committed himself to walk again before a certain age. It is remarkable when one reads how determined and hopeful he is. The established research foundation is worth millions of dollars per annum. There are a number of leading scientists involved who pool financially from this resource and conduct research for people like Christopher Reeve. However, it brings us back to the ethical question.</P>
    <P>The technicalities of the Minister's trip to Brussels at the end of November are simple. The EU announced its research budget of approximately &euro;16 billion. There was huge controversy when it was discovered under one section of the fund that money would be allocated for embryonic stem cell research. Consequently, a moratorium was put in place. I understand at the Brussels meeting there will be expressions of opinion but no vote on the issue. Ultimately, the decision will be taken by the Council of Ministers. This may lead to more liberal actions with the budget, with less regulations and fewer guidelines as opposed to what may happen when the initial vote is taken.</P>
    <P>This issue is not about the creation or handling of human embryos. As Senator Henry stated, it is already done through IVF. I concur with Senator Dardis that it is very interesting to hear the views of a professional who is involved in this area, such as Senator Henry. She touched on many topics in great detail. However, I will only gloss over them, as I do not claim to be an expert in this field.</P>
    <P>It is normal to produce supernumerary embryos for IVF treatment to ensure they can be used if something goes wrong in the treatment. It must be remembered that the embryo research the EU wants to fund is using EU taxpayers' money. The research also intends to use the supernumerary embryos.</P>
    <P>There are many facets to this debate, including the question as to when life begins. It can be either at the moment of conception or sometime later. The traditional Catholic Church viewpoint is that it begins at the moment of conception. If that is one's stand, then one must contend that an embryo represents human life and merits protection. People in favour of stem cell research will argue that life does not begin until some time later and this, therefore, allows the contention that research is good and should go ahead. Some people who seek to block this research argue that it destroys life. These statements on this complex and detailed issue are too short and simplistic. It is also too simplistic to arrive at a simple conclusion based on a small number of words.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1115" />Embryonic stem cell research is illegal in many EU member states. Senator Hanafin successfully proposed a motion at the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business that prevented a consensus emerging that would allow funding for this research to go ahead. I am convinced it is an ethical question we must all ask and answer. I come down on the side of those who oppose this research for ethical considerations. However, when one discovers that through this research real hope is offered to someone who is suffering, it brings home an ethical conundrum and brings the moral dilemma back to oneself. No matter what point of view somebody has, not just in this House but in every other national parliament in the EU, &ndash; the debate needs to be sensitive, balanced and rational. No matter what the case, we must respect each other's viewpoints. I thank the Minister for addressing the House and I wish her well in Brussels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. This is not a debate on the benefits of stem cell research or how we should proceed with it, rather it is concerned with whether we should proceed with funding embryonic stem cell research. The proposal on embryonic stem cell research, COM 2003/390, recently came before the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business. It was rejected by Members from both Houses, who represent the two largest political parties, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. I believe that a large number of the Independent Members also support us.</P>
      <P>There are those of us who accept that the human embryo is the start of life and the smallest member of the human family. Everything that is done thereafter is predicated by that. Questions were raised during this debate as to how we regulate this area. However, if one believes, as I do, that the human embryo is the smallest member of the human family, one cannot agree to research in this area, whether it is regulated or not. Both are unacceptable.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the Catholic University of Louvain. However, it does not express the viewpoint of the Roman Catholic Church. The only reason it is called the &ldquo;Catholic University&rdquo; is because in the 15th century that was how universities were named. The Irish Roman Catholic bishops reflected the views of the Pope in stating that embryonic stem cell research is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>There is a democratic deficit in the European Union. During the Nice Treaty referendum we were clear in our demand for a more accountable and democratic EU. At the time, the Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>.&nbsp;most fundamentally the European Union can only work with the basic political will of each member state, its Government and its people. I and my party believe that the best way to ensure that the Union remains fully democratic and is perceived to be so by the <Col N="1116" />Irish people is to debate honestly and openly the European level policies that affect us in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Constitution will not be found to be in favour of the funding proposal. Neither is the Irish Medical Council or the Oireachtas joint committee. The majority of Members in this House are also not in favour. We live in a representative democracy. Clearly, the will of the people is not to support funding anywhere for embryonic stem cell research. I ask the Minister to take this on board and to remember her own words on the need for more democracy and accountability from the EU. We must reflect the viewpoints of the Irish people on this matter.</P>
    <P>At what stage did the Government make a decision? Did this come before Cabinet for it to make a decision? The Fianna Fáil parliamentary party has expressed its views clearly both here and in Europe.</P>
    <P>When we talk about stem cell research, we must bear in mind that there are two classes of human stem cells: adult stem cells and embryonic stem cells. Though research on each has the same end in view, the ethical evaluation of each is radically different.</P>
    <P>There is nothing controversial about adult stem cell research. Stem cells, with the potential to repair vital organs, exist in bone marrow, body fat and umbilical cord blood. They also exist in chimera and mosaicism, which exist in many individuals, but this is a new area that is being researched. Cures have been effected by using such stem cells &ndash; bone marrow transplants have been done for years &ndash; and they have been found to be far more pluripotent than originally considered. The results &ndash; not just the research &ndash; from Australia show that the adult stem cells produce the results.</P>
    <P>An open letter to the Australian Parliament, entitled: &ldquo;No scientific imperative for destructive research on human embryos&rdquo; and co-signed by various professors, including the head of the Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Michael Good, and head of the Children's Medical Research Institute, Peter Rowe, advised that, by contrast:</P>
    <P>Research on stem cells derived from adult and placental tissues, which has seen great advances in the last three years, is quite compelling in its clinical promise, and does not involve the destruction of nascent human life.</P>
    <P>Scientifically for serious technical reasons of tumour formation and immune rejection, trials with embryo stem cells are highly unlikely to proceed in humans while adult stem cells are already making dramatic advances in human trials even in Australia. These advances are happening in the areas of spinal injury at the PA Hospital in Brisbane, and heart disease at the John Hunter Institute in Newcastle. In the months ahead advances are expected in Parkinson's disease at the Peter McCallum Institute in Melbourne.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1117" />In Australia there have been cases of children having been cured of &ldquo;bubble boy&rdquo; immune deficiency. In California there have been cases of corneal blindness having been repaired. We have also seen the stabilising of advanced multiple sclerosis and lupus, and there are dozens of other clinical applications.</P>
    <P>The controversial source of stem cells is human embryos. Everybody in this Chamber was a human embryo at one time. Extracting stem cells from a human embryo kills him or her. The embryo is no larger than a full stop but is a complete human being fully programmed to grow and mature. For the embryo to develop nothing further is added only time and nourishment and the embryo's genetic programme determines what kind of baby and adult will eventually emerge. Nourishment is part of that process. A three-day old embryo requires nourishment and care, as does a three-day old, three-week old, three-month old baby or a three-year old child.</P>
    <P>To deliberately end an identifiable human life is crossing the Rubicon and is a bridge too far. Extravagant claims have been made for embryonic stem cell research but very little achievement has come from it and most admit that adult stem cell research shows much promise. Even if it did show more promise than it does, carrying out this type of research is very wrong. It is destructive experimentation on human beings, like the programme discovered in the United States where researchers left poor people with syphilis untreated so they could monitor the ravages of the disease. I assume researchers justified the gross inhumanity to the sufferers of syphilis by arguments along the lines that the possible good the new knowledge brought would help cure many others &ndash; arguments those whom they left to die untreated would hardly appreciate. This is the key point for people like me. We believe the embryo is a human person albeit a tiny person.</P>
    <P>When people depart from an ethic that respects human life, they postulate other ethical propositions to indicate their principles. The ethical guidelines of the EU Commission last July agreed that embryos could be killed for research but piously stipulated that they would only be embryos leftover from IVF. It stated it was opposed to cloning and parental permission would have to be sought. It also claimed it was justified under the article on freedom of research in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. This would have justified the American researchers on syphilis previously mentioned. In the light of all our laws, our Constitution and the views of both Houses of the Oireachtas it is surprising that we would support any research as specified under COM 390/2003. It was a shock that Ireland indicated support for such unethical guidelines.</P>
    <P>In argument, much play is made of the fact that what is being killed are embryos left over from IVF, at the start anyhow. The Italian National Bioethics Commission said firmly that embryos are human beings and there is a moral duty to protect them regardless of how they were pro<Col N="1118" />created. Francesco D'Agostino, president of the commission, also added: &ldquo;the other reason is of the pragmatic order; if permission were given for the use of spare embryos, there would be a risk of endorsing a fraud, namely the creation of embryos for their reproductive use, but, in fact destined for research.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The accumulation of embryos from IVF, as practised in some countries, leads to an accumulation of large numbers of frozen embryos and eventually to their deaths. Countries like Germany and Italy only fertilise what they will implant in the womb. This respects human life. Professor John Bonner and Professor Martin Clynes have stated publicly that IVF can be carried out without loss of life and it is the irresponsibility of some IVF clinics that led to these &ldquo;surpluses&rdquo; in the first place. However, all that is a different problem from what we are now addressing.</P>
    <P>The proposal to fund embryonic stem cell research is an area into which the EU should never have entered. All member states are being asked to pay for it and quite a number have laws against it in their own countries. The European Parliament Committee on Legal Affairs passed a resolution making the moratorium on embryonic stem cell research permanent and stipulating that no research forbidden in any member state should be supported by EU funding, but that nations should be free to carry out research using their own funds. This was a fair proposal of freedom of conscience, not coercing any nation to fund something to which it objected.</P>
    <P>At the moment, the EU is promoting a constitution, giving it a new and wider range of powers, of which many are wary. At each Irish referendum in the past where the subject came up, people were assured that the EU had no competence or interest in abortion and no wish to have any such competence. What do such assurances mean if in a similar and not unrelated area such as embryonic stem cell research, the EU is willing to coerce its members into accepting and funding an equally divisive proposition?</P>
    <P>Since summer 2002, the proposal for the European Union to fund destructive embryo research polarised the 15 member states. At present, Germany, Italy, Austria and Portugal are opposed and Ireland's votes would give a blocking minority. I ask the Tánaiste to reflect the views of the Irish people as expressed by their representatives and form part of such a blocking minority. Ireland is the only country with a constitutional amendment specifically protecting the unborn and should be in the forefront on this issue with the other four countries. If this proposal goes through, because of Ireland's failure to oppose it, it will be a disgrace.</P>
    <P>In their letter to the Taoiseach the Catholic bishops stated:</P>
    <P>Finally, we wish to emphasise the crucial significance of the position, which will be taken by Ireland at the EU, in view of the fact that the Constitution of Ireland is known to afford <Col N="1119" />protection to human life from its beginnings. Commissioner Busquin, at a meeting with the Joint Bioethics Committee of the Bishops' Conferences of England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland, on 2 October 2003, has already suggested that, as the Irish Government appears willing to support the Commission proposal, it is difficult to see why other countries which offer less constitutional protection to the unborn should have any difficulty with it.</P>
    <P>No mandate for what is proposed exists either from the Oireachtas or from the Cabinet. This is simply not democratic. The Constitution approved by the Irish people indicates disapproval. So far, any reasons I have heard for supporting the proposal have been illogical, especially for those of us who accept the embryo is a human that needs protection. I hope that good sense will prevail and that Ireland will oppose this disgraceful measure regardless of what any other country does.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Tánaiste to the Seanad. This proposal on embryonic stem cell research did not come to the Oireachtas for scrutiny in the usual way. It was discussed at the Sub-committee on European Scrutiny and was sent to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business for scrutiny. Both of these committees recommended rejection of the proposal. Will the Tánaiste explain why she intends to proceed in the fashion proposed, going against the wishes of these two committees, and why this proposal has not been brought before the Oireachtas for full discussion and debate with a decision arising from that so she could proceed on the basis of a decision of Government and Parliament? Scientific opinion shows it is not necessary to use embryos for this type of research. Human adult stem cell research is quite sufficient, while maybe not as scientifically useful as embryonic stem cell research. We can make great progress with human stem cell research and as time goes on we know that further progress is being made. There is no evidence that research on human embryos is necessary. As the Tánaiste knows, human embryo research is not permitted by Medical Council guidelines, but for some reason it is reviewing its guidelines behind closed doors. While the Tánaiste has stated such research will not be permitted in Ireland, we will co-fund it if other EU member states decide to go ahead. The point was made by a number of Senators today that if this decision is approved the research will not take place in Ireland. That is not good enough for many of us. We do not want our money funding this type of research in other EU countries. That point is being missed by a number of Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Linacre Centre in the UK has made a detailed case against human embryo research to the House of Lords. I have the points it has made to hand, based on recognition of the embryo as a human ethical subject. I will not go into all of that <Col N="1120" />because it is very detailed. The Catholic Church is absolutely opposed to embryonic research. Like Senator Hanafin I would tell the Tánaiste that to quote the Catholic University of Louvain on this issue is like a smokescreen, making it seem as if it is the Catholic Church that is stating what she has said. Even if we did accept what the Catholic University of Louvain has said, the Tánaiste attributed to it the following:</P>
    <P>We would also point out that any use of the human embryo must be accompanied by binding ethical and scientific guidelines. Firstly, there must be a democratic debate involving the whole of society and then transparent inspection and decision making mechanisms must be defined.</P>
    <P>I believe we have not had this democratic debate. While we welcome the fact that we are having it in the Seanad today, it should have taken place before now and before the Tánaiste had made up her mind.</P>
    <P>The Government appointed commission on assisted reproduction has not reported, after two and a half years. However, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment claims the Department of Health and Children has advised that the role it is taking is all right. I have to ask the Tánaiste on what basis the Department of Health and Children can so advise. This whole process is a minefield, with constitutional, legal, moral, ethical and administrative questions to be answered. At the very least there should be a Green Paper before any decision is made. It appears likely that Germany, Austria, Portugal and Italy will form a blocking minority at the Council of Ministers. This gives time for the Government to reform its approach and consult the Oireachtas. My basic point is that this should have been done from the start.</P>
    <P>The Medical Council guidelines in Ireland prohibit this type of research, although it must be noted it is meeting now in private to reconsider the guidelines, which has to ring alarm bells in all of us. Why has the Legislature not received the report of the commission on assisted reproduction? Why is there not a Green Paper? While in general welcoming the allocation of &euro;16 billion for EU research activities for 2003-06, especially as regards information society technologies, food quality and safety, sustainable development, global change and ecosystems, some of the proposals awaiting decision by the Council of Ministers give rise to serious concern. If this proposal were agreed, all EU states would fund research on supernumerary embryos. These are embryos which were intended for implantation, but are no longer required for that purpose. This raises constitutional, legal, ethical, moral, administrative and other issues. Once again I ask the Tánaiste why this matter has not been laid before the Dáil and fully discussed.</P>
    <P>Why is it that despite the European Union (Scrutiny) Act 2002 this proposal was not submitted for scrutiny by the Oireachtas in the normal <Col N="1121" />way, but was only discovered by the Sub-committee on European Scrutiny and was sent to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business to be examined in greater detail? Such scrutiny as this has resulted in recommendations that the Government not support proposals for an EU decision. Furthermore, the Tánaiste makes the case that if this is now blocked, it may return to a regulatory committee and the voting system may have changed next time it is considered. The reality is four EU countries, Italy, Austria, Portugal and Germany, are likely to block this in any event.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">

    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry" hpid="Ms Terry Ms Terry">
      <NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
      <P>Department officials said at the Sub-committee on European Scrutiny hearing that Ireland had indicated it would not oppose the Commission's proposals as currently drafted &ndash; having discussed the matter with the Department of Health and Children and other relevant Departments &ndash; because the funding of any research activity in Ireland which would not satisfy Irish ethical or legal requirements was not anticipated. However, if the Medical Council changes its rules, currently under review, this could satisfy Irish ethical requirements, as apart from the Constitution there is no legislation governing this area. Furthermore the Department of Health and Children, which has been consulted by the Tánaiste's Department, has a commission on assisted reproduction, which has not reported. How can that Department make up its mind on this issue without such an important report?</P>
      <P>In point 6 of the document submitted to the Sub-committee on European Scrutiny it is stated: &ldquo;Ireland has indicated that it considers it inappropriate to object to such research being carried out in member states, were it deemed to be both legal and ethical.&rdquo; However, that is not the point. We are not asked to object to such research taking place in other member states. That is a matter for those member states. This proposal concerns all EU states for the funding of such research and for allowing it in Ireland if the Medical Council changes its guidelines.</P>
      <P>Scientists here could carry out such research without any change to Medical Council guidelines as these only apply to medical doctors. The European Union (Scrutiny) Act 2002 was passed last year by the Oireachtas to reinforce the powers of the Houses so that legislation coming before the Council of Ministers could be duly scrutinised. Such scrutiny has rejected this proposal, but even that scrutiny came about by accident. I hope the Tánaiste will listen carefully to all the comments made by Senators and take them into consideration when making her decision at the end of the month.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister to the House. This is a subject of enormous sensi<Col N="1122" />tivity and I am struck by the way in which Senators on both sides of the debate expressed their views with moderation, compassion and respect for the views of those who differ from them.</P>
      <P>I, too, was surprised when this matter went for consideration to the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business. I would not have thought it a place where people interested in ethical issues are wont to congregate, although they probably had wonderful insights on other aspects of the matter.</P>
      <P>Two parallel debates appear to be going on and we run the risk of confusing them. The first is, if the Minister should support the proposal for research funding at the Council of Ministers. The more fundamental and widespread debate concerns what should happen in future here in regard to research, in general, and to embryonic stem cell research in particular. I speak as a former lay member of a medical school ethical research committee. There are differences of opinion on these matters with which people wrestle.</P>
      <P>On the first issue, as to whether the research funding should be passed, less than 1% of this research budget will be spent on this particular form of research. If we were not net recipients of European funds, Ireland would theoretically contribute 1% or 1.5%. It would be disproportionate for us to try to prevent this research taking place. I was encouraged by reading the Minister's address to the House about the way in which the ethical guidelines on this matter have been framed. It is a considerable advance and reinforces the point made by Senator Terry &ndash; whether inadvertently or not &ndash; that the lack of guidelines and ethical regulations leaves it as almost a free-for-all. Important safeguards have been established in the banning of cloning and the production of embryos simply for the sake of research, which effectively bans interference with the genetic make-up of a child. It would be a great pity to lose these provisions which may happen if the measure does not go through in this form. We will lose the advantage if we say this kind of research can go on in other countries as long as it does not affect us in Ireland.</P>
      <P>On the wider point, I am grateful for the most informative address to the House made by Senator Henry, from which I learned a great deal. This is an area that cannot be viewed in black and white. I respect the position of those who say that life begins at conception. I would not be as derogatory of the Catholic University of Louvain as some other Senators. It is not simply a flag of convenience, it is a recognised centre for Catholic-oriented thought. It is not, however, the voice of the Catholic Church. Historically the voice of the church has not always been dogmatic on these issues. I can go back to Aquinas if anybody wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The production of life is a process. It is a question of when it starts, when it becomes inevitable, when, for example, ensoulment takes place. I regard the embryo in this case as potential life. <Col N="1123" />Life does not become possible without implantation. There is a continuum from the egg and the sperm at conception to implantation and development. At what point does this process become irreversible? It would be easy to say, &ldquo; yes, there it is, bang&rdquo;. The more people begin to understand the complexities of these issues, the more difficult it is to make that an absolutely fundamentalist position. I use the word &ldquo;fundamentalist&rdquo; in a non-derogatory sense.</P>
    <P>The quoted article from the Catholic University of Louvain went on to discuss the need for an ethical balance in these matters. It would be wrong for this country to say that it can be done elsewhere but if it works we will take the benefits of it and advance it. It is a question of balance. It is an ethical consideration to give life, but it is also an ethical consideration to improve the quality of life for other people. I do not see a widespread industry developing in embryonic stem cell research. I see the main burden of stem cell research as being on adult stem cells. It would be unwise to close the door. What we are talking about is the possibility of transforming life for people who have been condemned to a slow death, which is also the taking of life.</P>
    <P>Any of us who have seen a friend or relative suffer from MS for 20 or 30 years or from Alzheimer's disease or any similar disease would say it is not an unreasonable ethical trade-off to use embryos, which in five years time would die anyway and which are often flushed down the drain. I like to think of it in terms of organ donation. Embryos belongs to the parents concerned. It is not unreasonable, if it is the wish of parents, to donate embryos just as they would donate the organs of their nearest and dearest to restore to life somebody else who has been deprived of life.</P>
    <P>This is the debate we must have in the longer term and it should be carried on throughout the country. It is a debate which the Oireachtas should have, but it is not necessary in order to enable the Government to support the present proposal for research. I encourage the Minister to do so. I also thank her for the compassion with which she presented the case and for her obvious concern for the ethical issues raised.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I strongly support what she is doing, which seems to be a modest step which should not concern or worry anybody who is interested or involved in human rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A certain amount of politicking is going on here. I am sorry at the lamentable performance of the Fine Gael Party on this issue. The reading of statements by Fr. Doran into the record by some party spokespersons, in regard to the <Col N="1124" />embryo being a distinct human individual, was done without conviction and solely for political purposes. This is a great pity. The Fine Gael Party will never recover its political standing until it gets a bit of genuine idealism.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has very wisely recorded the fact that certain activities are already excluded. That should reassure people. There is already a ban on cloning and on the production of embryos specifically for research purposes. We are dealing here with entities which already exist. If they are not used, they will be destroyed anyway. In the balance with that one must place the capacity to create cures for some of the most terrible and debilitating diseases. I heard people speak about this on the radio during the week. A woman spoke of looking after her husband with great love and devotion for many years and of seeing him suffer. If there is a possibility through this research of ameliorating his situation, how can anybody stand against it with theoretical arguments when the material exists and will be destroyed anyway?</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal about Catholicism. The House should note the Protestant proverb &ldquo;waste not, want not&rdquo;. It is blasphemous to turn against this opportunity to better human life by discharging embryos down the drain to keep our consciences clear. It is horrendous to hear that we are, on the other hand, happy to use the results of experiments already conducted. I assure the House that if any of those who spoke against this today were suffering from a painful disease and a cure or ameliorating procedure emerged from stem cell research, he or she would accept it.</P>
    <P>I deprecate in linguistic terms the attempt to assert that the embryo is a full human being. At the same time, Senator Hanafin very honestly said that it is the size of a full stop. It has no central nervous system and no consciousness. I cannot believe it is appropriate to describe it as a full human being. I have never seen anybody attempt to take one to a pantomime or the zoo or to secure voting rights for it. The argument is absolutely ludicrous and should be regarded as such.</P>
    <P>I compliment Senator Henry with whom I do not always see eye to eye. She made a remarkably important speech this afternoon in which she calmly, clearly and scientifically demonstrated the hollowness behind many of the statements which have been made on this issue. Senator Henry rebutted the contention that it is easy to harvest adult stem cells when she demonstrated clearly the difficulty involved, particularly when it comes to the deep areas of the brain. I thought we had got beyond the kind of nonsense we heard during this debate. Despite our obsession with the rights of the embryo, we have not signed the Orviedo convention. Why did Members fail to clamour about that point? The convention is concerned with the real issues of cloning and the production of embryos specifically and only for research purposes. I am against such practices as that is the ethical stance to adopt.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1125" />An attempt was made to trash and denigrate the Catholic University of Louvain as not being fully Catholic. It is a distinguished university with a very long pedigree for which this country should be very grateful. In the 18th century, a relative of mine was sent to the university to train as a Roman Catholic priest during the penal period. He became a Roman Catholic bishop. That is the kind of thing Louvain did for this country.</P>
    <P>It is very important that we sustain the Minister in this matter. She has made it clear that we are against cloning and the production of embryos specifically for research purposes. We seek ethical guidelines and we ask only for this position to be supported. I strongly support the Minister. A good day's work has been done. Nobody who later reads the speech Senator Henry made this afternoon could possibly make an accusation of intemperate language or illogicality against her. Despite claims to the contrary, her contribution was a model of logic. I have yet to find the same logic on the other side. I am happy to yield the floor to my colleague, Senator O'Toole.</P>

Anyone who was listening would have realised that my comments referred only to any misrepresentation of the word &ldquo;Catholic&rdquo; in the university's name. Nothing else was meant. No reference was made to the work of the university and there was no attempt to take anything from it. I set out to indicate clearly that the university's position did not correspond to what is perceived to be the view of the Catholic Church.</P>

      <P>I fully and completely support the position of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the views she expressed earlier. She outlined the only reasonable, sensible and sustainable position one can adopt. In a sense, we are getting an easy ride in that we are able to adopt this approach. It would be wrong to try to impose whatever particular values we hold on everybody else. Our role is to protect ourselves and to safeguard our constitutional provisions which we have a right to ensure are expressed properly. The Minister's proposals are perfectly in keeping with these constraints. Her position will find support among the majority of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier in the debate I heard a speaker use the words &ldquo;referendum&rdquo;, &ldquo;pro-life&rdquo;, &ldquo;abortion&rdquo;, &ldquo;viable&rdquo; and &ldquo;embryo&rdquo; all in one paragraph. I sensed we were moving back to the future and I could feel a cold sweat breaking out on my palms. Things were being re-opened which I thought had been processed, dealt with and assimilated in a particular way. We do not need to address these matters again. In this debate there is an element of failure to recognise that it is a reality of medi<Col N="1126" />cal science that this research will go ahead. It would be wrong on a variety of levels for us to oppose research which is not damaging anybody and has the potential to make huge improvements to the quality of life of suffering people or to ameliorate their conditions.</P>
    <P>I listened closely to Senator Henry's statement about the production of embryos. Her point was absolutely clear and it concerned the issue which bothered me in reviewing the little I have read about this debate. I do not claim to have full knowledge, but there is a complete and distinct difference between producing embryos for stem cell research and using embryos which have already been created for the purpose of <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation. If we accept that <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation can take place, we must accept that we have embryos which have been created for that purpose to spare. They will not be used which forces us to ask whether to do something useful with them or to dump them. No matter which position one takes morally, psychologically, ethically or philosophically, the latter cannot be viewed as a good choice. I do not mean to suggest that this complex argument can be boiled down to that one issue, but it is a decision which has to be made. Nobody can argue that any decision other the one proposed by Senator Henry can be appropriate.</P>
    <P>We have a huge amount to learn about the direction we must take. I read very closely a recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i> by a priest who is the secretary of one of the hierarchy's ethical groups. While I did not agree with his conclusions, I could see that he was trying to provide an honest assessment of the issue. He was also unclear about many issues. He underlined his conclusion as to where we should all be headed, but it did not follow logically from the points he made. He made the same point Senator Henry made earlier that we do not know enough about the stem cells from the embryo to use them properly and in a directed fashion. It is a point with which all Members are familiar. We know that cells from certain organs can be used more specifically. Above all else, we have seen the impact and the advances which have been made by medical researchers over the last five to six years.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong and irresponsible of us to stand in the way of such improvements in the next five or six years in the lives of people suffering from Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and other forms of atrophy. The emotive argument is that we should do something because people are suffering. However, if we stand back from the issue, we can make a decision which can improve the quality of the lives of people suffering under the weight of such diseases and people who may be watching a loved one withering away through some form of atrophy. Therefore, we have no choice. It would be wrong and unjustifiable and the Minister would not be able to live with herself if she were to take a decision other than that <Col N="1127" />which is proposed. She would be turning her back on her responsibility as an elected public representative to do her best for all people. People who make the case for the less well-off in society abide by it as a guiding principle. There are guiding principles in this case and no one needs to bury those principles in order to make progress.</P>
    <P>We are looking at stem cell research through which we can treat the dying organs of people and help them re-grow and reform. This could apply to people who have problems with their kidneys, liver or heart. The extent is unknown, but much can be done. On the other hand, we are clear that we are opposed to the deliberate production of embryos for research purposes and the cloning of human beings, which is a good thing. The Minister has made the best of all possible decisions and I applaud and support it.</P>

      <P>As one who requested this debate, I welcome the Minister to the House. I heard her contribution on &ldquo;The Marian Finucane Show&rdquo; which, as I said that morning in the House, was honest, transparent and generous in her acceptance of the many ethical issues which have still not been resolved. It was a good presentation. The debate in this House is a benefit to democracy because there are two parties in Government which can express different views and are allowed to do so. I hope we will see that happening more often. I am sorry I am at variance with the Minister because, of all the politicians, she is one I regard exceptionally highly, both for her leadership and courage. I know she will not mind if we vary on different views because that is what debate is about.</P>
      <P>It is a pity the debate took so long to be held, for which I do not blame the Minister. Today, we have roamed over such issues as science, law, philosophy, ethics and theology. The House of Lords select committee on stem cell research found those same issues exceptionally testing. I do not believe this issue belongs to any gender or age group or to intellectuals or professionals. Rather, it belongs to the whole human family. That is why that human family, particularly on the island of Ireland, has the opportunity of expressing its views. To date, people have not had that opportunity because of the manner in which this issue is being brought forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not an issue of funding or guidelines. Rather, it is fundamentally an issue of human life and no human life is more insignificant than another. Therefore, that must be the premise upon which we have this debate because the moment that concept is breached, as we have seen in world history, we open ourselves to all excesses. For instance, in the case of slavery the whites genuinely believed they were doing something good to build up their economy by using coloured people as slaves. They tried to convince those same people that it was to their benefit because they were not intellectually capable of looking after their own interests. Such excesses <Col N="1128" />occur when one breaches the inviolable concept of all human life being equal.</P>
    <P>I do not like to refer to a Senator's remarks after he or she has left the Chamber, but Senator O'Toole will appreciate why I must refer to his comments. One must make a decision in regard to a viable embryo as to whether or not it is human life. If it is not human life, a different debate ensues. However, if it is human life, I suggest Senator O'Toole is on dangerous ground because he is suggesting we can use one form of life, irrespective of what stage it is at, in order to enhance the life of someone else. There is no name for that other than medical human cannibalism. In a short period of time and with few reports available other than those of the House of Lords select committee, we are debating this matter when we should be dealing with a Green Paper or reports from our own committees or one set up specifically for the purpose. However, we have no option other than to deal with the House of Lords report.</P>
    <P>The difficulty with this debate in regard to theology is that the Minister rightly says that the statement attributed to the Catholic University of Louvain is only a viewpoint. I am not sure whether that statement was expressed in a periodical or if it is a corporate opinion from the university, since that is not stated. It is more than likely an editorial in a publication but the status is not given. On the other hand, what the bishops told the Taoiseach was in a corporate sense. Therefore, if we are discussing theology, I am inclined to give the weight of balance to what the bishops said to the Taoiseach as against a viewpoint which came from a university in Louvain, Catholic or otherwise.</P>
    <P>The moment theology is open to expediency and ethics are not regarded as sacrosanct, one will no longer be able to decide what are ethics. As a counter argument to a remark from this side of the House, a Senator stated that we would not allow embryonic stem cell research in Ireland because we have not yet decided whether it is ethical or not but that it was no reason to prevent it happening in another part of the world. This is a case where ethics are being subjected to expediency. No one has the right, on behalf of the people, to use ethics in this manner. I am not personalising this in terms of the Minister, rather I refer to it in a general sense.</P>
    <P>There is an unresolved issue in regard to the Constitution, in the context of which we have been guided by the Medical Council. I am surprised at how muted the media has been in support of Ireland taking a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; stance on this issue, since it is normally to the fore on such issues. One of the reasons for that is that they are not in a position to reflect what people want because the opportunity has not been given to people to indicate their view.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with assumptions and my assumption is that this country is largely pro-life. I said previously during discussions on human reproduction &ndash; Senator Dardis made the same <Col N="1129" />point &ndash; that debates in this Chamber have been calm and respectful and we have been allowed to put forward different points of view. I, therefore, accept that everybody participating in this debate is pro-life. I believe, however, that the view coming from the electorate is that it would not wish to sacrifice any human life at any stage of development for any purpose, for the good of society or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I was surprised by Senator O'Toole's contribution and thought he was somewhat emotive on this issue. Most of his contribution was devoted to the question of the possible good effects that might arise. The report of a select committee of the House of Lords clearly cautioned against raising people's hopes in that regard. The main research done on Parkinson's disease, both embryonic stem cell research and adult stem cell research, has shown that the most positive results have come from adult stem cell research. People may disagree with that, but this is the information I have. If this is the case, we should not raise people's hopes, which would cloud the issue. The House of Lords select committee said there was no indication that this therapy would ensue.</P>
    <P>The basic issue concerns the view of the people on the sanctity of human life at every stage of development, whether embryonic or at old age. From an ethical point of view, the people do not want us to support anything that runs counter to that view in Ireland or any part of the world. We should bear in mind that four other major countries will possibly disagree with the proposal.</P>
    <P>I was not being patronising when I said the Tánaiste was a politician for whom I have the highest regard. I hope she will listen carefully to the views being expressed here because there is no political expediency involved nor disrespect for any other person's point of view. We must all speak from within ourselves and with our own conscience.</P>

      <P>There seems to be some confusion about the two issues involved here. The first issue concerns regulation and legislation and this is something we should discuss. In this regard I welcome the Tánaiste and ask her to use her office to bring in some legislation in this area. If it is not correct at first we can amend it, but please let us have some regulation. The second issue concerns stem cell research and we would not be debating this if there was not a vote on the issue in the European Union shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Stem cells are highly versatile cells in the human organism capable of both reproducing themselves and of developing to produce the more specialised cells out of which human tissue and organs are formed. At the current stage of scientific research, this offers the possibility of the injection of stem cells to repair damaged tissue, muscle, nerves or bone. Among the conditions which are potentially treatable are heart disease, Alzheimer's disease or strokes. For many years leukaemia has been successfully treated by the <Col N="1130" />replacement of bone marrow, again an excellent source of stem cells.</P>
    <P>Embryonic stem cells are harvested from human embryos while all other stem cells are referred to as adult stem cells. These can be harvested from a variety of sources, including bone marrow, cord blood, placenta and liver. Some researchers argue that because embryonic stem cells are more versatile, they have greater potential for medical use than adult stem cells, which, although they are still versatile, have already begun to develop. In recent years researchers have come to realise that there are many more sources of adult stem cells in the human organism than had previously been recognised. As a result, the potential for obtaining an adult stem cell suited to a particular need is much greater than previously thought.</P>
    <P>Another issue which must be faced is that the extreme versatility of embryonic stem cells also makes them less predictable. They cannot always be relied upon to develop as intended and there is a risk of bone developing where muscle is required, or vice versa. The careful selection of adult stem cells which are further along the developmental chain would seem to reduce that risk. Adult stem cells can be harvested without causing harm or loss of life. Provided proper consent is obtained and the stem cells are used for the purpose of developing treatments, there is no ethical problem about their use. Funding should be directed at this area of research.</P>
    <P>The harvesting of stem cells from embryos always results in the destruction of the embryo and this is the nub of the matter. If embryos were only a haphazard cluster of cells, there would be no problem. However, an embryo, although it is small and cannot smile yet or talk, is a distinct individual human being in the process of rapid organised development. Modern research in genetics and in reproductive technology helps to demonstrate that this is true. We now know that a human embryo can live and develop apart from its mother. We know too that a human embryo is genetically distinct from its parents and that all the genetic information required for its development is already present at the single cell stage.</P>
    <P>Researchers argue that it is acceptable to destroy embryos as long as it is done in a good cause and the parents give consent. The deliberate destruction of innocent human life is fundamentally wrong and even the prospect of wonderful new cures does nothing to change that fact. It has been suggested that there would be no ethical problem if the research was limited to so-called spare embryos. The Tánaiste calls them supernumerary embryos. These are generally the by-product of <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation which are kept in frozen storage. It is said that these embryos will be disposed of anyway, once their shelf-life is over. I heard somebody from the Tánaiste's Department say that the embryos supposed to be used for experimentation would be destroyed at the end of the year anyway. I put it to the Tánaiste that many old people will die by the end <Col N="1131" />of the year. Will we experiment on them too because they are from the other end of the spectrum? That argument does not hold water.</P>
    <P>To be used as raw material for the pharmaceutical industry is not what gives meaning to the existence of a human embryo. That meaning is inherent in the act of creation and we choose either to respect it or not. All human beings eventually die and embryos are no different. The moral evil is associated not with the fact that embryos die, but with the fact that somebody decides to kill them. No advances in the treatment of disease justify the deliberate destruction of embryos irrespective of the benefits involved or whether other sources of stem cells are equally useful. We cannot cross the principle that a good end does not justify evil means. I believe embryonic stem cells should not be used for research.</P>
    <P>The EU Council of Ministers will vote on the sixth framework programme, which is a good programme, at the end of this month. I want to ensure that the Irish delegation votes against the funding of research on embryos and embryonic stem cells. It speaks volumes that this issue is being discussed at the European Union under the headings of trade and competitiveness. Whether by accident or design, this implies that human embryos are commodities or consumer goods. Two years ago Ireland could have joined Italy, Germany and Austria to ensure that embryonic stem cell research was excluded from the programme, but it made no effort to do so. Now, the Government seems to take the view that as long as destructive embryonic research is not happening here, Ireland will not stand in the way of it happening elsewhere in Europe.</P>
    <P>This attitude is totally at odds with the spirit of the Constitution which specifically recognises the right to life of the unborn. It leaves the door open for the Irish pharmaceutical industry to benefit from the destruction of embryos, as long as that destruction takes place elsewhere. Successive Governments have told us that we have a significant voice in Europe so let us take a principled stand on this matter. There is an issue of participation relevant to the fact that it is not proposed to allow embryonic stem cell research in Ireland. This has a specific meaning in ethics. We will be materially participating in unethical research on human embryos if we either contribute to the funding of the research or propose to benefit directly from its results, for example, by using the information gained in our pharmaceutical industry. We will also be formally participating in unethical research on human embryos if we vote in such a way as to allow this research to take place. We must either accept that our vote has some relevance or, alternatively, that it has no relevance. If it has no relevance, then we must question the relevance of our membership of the European Union.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis said that we have no right to foist our views on other members. That is true on most issues, but this is not about VAT on gas. It <Col N="1132" />is about the sanctity of human life. I will quote a few lines from a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> a few days ago:</P>
    <P>If Ireland supports this sort of research, we will have crossed a threshold into the abuse of basic human rights under the guise of technological innovation which will lead down a very dangerous road for society. If this Government takes this path it will bear a very heavy responsibility, and it has no mandate from the Irish people to do so.</P>
    <P>That was written by Martin Clynes, Professor of Biotechnology at Dublin City University.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment should be aware that when I drove in here this morning I stopped at every red light because to go through them might have endangered human life and killed somebody or myself. We have laws in this country where if somebody kills somebody else they are incarcerated for long periods of time. We have prohibitions in the Constitution against the destruction of unborn life, except in certain circumstances, and nearly all of our laws are predicated on respect for human life and the sanctity of human life.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has a great responsibility thrust upon her, albeit in a context of collective Cabinet responsibility, although at times that seems a little dodgy. It seems in this respect the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is being given the power to do an awful thing in a week's time. Knowing her and respecting her, I am asking her not to go down the road of destruction and death. She should go down the road of life and hope and stand up and be a moral leader, not just for Ireland, but for Europe. People will respect her forever if she takes that stance.</P>

      <P>Have we learnt anything from the 1980s? It seems not if people cannot get up and make their position without finding it denigrated because it does not find favour with another person. I heard Senator Coghlan's remarks today and whether one agrees with Senator Coghlan or anyone else, anyone in this House has a right to make those points. People should bear that in mind.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole's comments that we have to learn from past debates, particularly the debates that have bedevilled this country on the abortion issue for the past 25 years. They generated a lot of heat but I am not sure we have learned anything from them as a people. We did not focus on what is really important, which is the woman in all of these cases. I have changed my view on the abortion issue at least twice during my adult life so far, and I might even change it twice again. People are open to change and once one takes a fundamental, principled position on this issue, one is tied to it for one's life. That is not the way most people carry on. Most people change their view because of their own experience.</P>

      <P>Once we make these tablets of stone it is very difficult to move from them. The same should not be applied to this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I resent all the political parties in this country suggesting that every member of a political party can have the same view on matters of conscience, which they do in effect. We have no tradition of free votes and no tradition whereby, independently, one can make up one's own mind on the floor of the House on matters like this. These are not matters of party political policy but matters of deep conviction for all of the colleagues who have spoken. We have got to grow up as a society and political class. We should allow free votes on issues such as this. I know it happens in other parliaments and we should learn from that. The <Col N="1134" />idea that a political party can take up this particular issue is just nonsensical as many members of a party could disagree with a party view.</P>
    <P>I have read the European Union (Scrutiny) Act 2002 since the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment's remarks at 2 p.m. It seems she has a difficulty in supporting this proposal on 27 November as it explicitly states in section 2(2) of the European Union (Scrutiny) Act 2002, that &ldquo;the Minister shall have regard to any recommendation made to him or her from time to time by either or both Houses of the Oireachtas or by a committee of either or both Houses of the Oireachtas in relation to a proposed measure.&rdquo; There are two stipulations where she does not have to regard such a proposal, one is if the time limit makes it impossible for her to consult with either or both Houses of the Oireachtas or a committee, or if the information is confidential. On both of these counts that is not the case as the information has been in the public domain and we have had an adequate length of time to deliberate on the matter. The difficulty for the Government in supporting this measure on 27 November is that it is illegal. There is no legal standing to take that position where the express view, whether one agrees with it or not, of the committee on two separate occasions has been in the other direction. The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment should refer to that in her closing remarks as it is a central point. What is the point in having a legislative basis for scrutinising proposals like this if the Government will not then take into consideration the committee's decision? It is an important issue that the Tánaiste should resolve when she comes to make her concluding remarks.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste said that if the Council votes against the proposals it is still open to the Commission to activate the research once the moratorium comes to an end. In other words, if the Council votes no, there is a strong risk this research will go ahead anyway without any guidelines. Most people who support the European Union would have to ask how it is possible that a proposal voted down under QMV by the Council of Ministers, can be reactivated by the Commission and brought to a full decision when the framework upon which we make our decisions in the European Union has said the opposite. The Tánaiste should refer to that again. If the Governments of Europe have taken the view that they are not going ahead with the funding at this stage, although they may go ahead with funding at some point in the future, how can the Commission then violate that by reactivating that proposal?</P>
    <P>I welcome this debate, but we need to have it broadened to the country in general. At this stage it is premature to advance the proposals the Government is making, which is why I am cautious at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a difficult and complex issue. When I work out the pros and cons I will come to a position at the end. I must declare an interest in that I have a daughter who is engaged in stem cell research, or has been, albeit of the animal variety. It is wrong to think that there are no ethical problems involved with that. My daughter is at the University of Wales at present and, if anything, the animal rights ethical issues are more live there than are some of those we are discussing. I had a good conversation with my daughter but I also found Fr. Kevin Doran's article useful. They seemed to largely agree about the benefits of adult stem cell research.</P>
      <P>Even in purely secular terms, the benefits of embryonic stem cell research are not proven. There are many ethical doubts about this type of research, which is at the frontiers. The position of the Catholic Church on this issue is clear and, all other things being equal, there is no doubt that the majority of people in this country would follow that view. The Minister referred to the Catholic University of Louvain. Universities do not normally adopt collective positions on academic and ethical issues. I presume she was referring to some member of staff of the university who has taken the initiative. It would be fairly unusual for a university to adopt a collective position on matters of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1136" />Opposition in respect of this matter is clearly based on the view of the Catholic Church that an embryo, from the moment of conception, is human life. In 1982, I was involved in trying to achieve some consensus between the churches on a pro-life amendment to the Constitution and I am aware that a faultline exists in this regard. Other churches would not necessarily take the view that human life begins at the moment of conception. The point has been made that last year we put forward, with the Catholic Church, a proposal which states that life commences at implantation. I am extremely uncomfortable about issues of this nature which play on the confessional divide. It is clear that the vast majority of people in this country are of the Catholic faith or were raised in the Catholic tradition and many of them feel passionately that the embryo is human life. That view would not be held as strongly outside the Catholic Church and, therefore, there might be a more pragmatic view of this proposal in existence. As already stated, even in secular terms, this is borderline.</P>
    <P>A dilemma obviously exists in terms of what we should do about European funding for research in this area. Similar dilemmas exist in other areas. For example, we have agreed to the funding of a great deal of nuclear research despite the fact that the vast majority of Irish people are fundamentally opposed to nuclear energy and nuclear power stations. I accept the point, however, that, for all its emotiveness, the issue of nuclear power does not carry the same moral charge.</P>
    <P>There is the added problem that we will shortly be assuming the EU Presidency, under which it will be our job to try to bring people together. There is &ndash; I accept that this would be irrelevant if one took the strong moral view expressed by many of my colleagues &ndash; the question of pharmaceutical biotechnology research and whether we are completely consistent in how we approach it.</P>
    <P>The role of either House of the Oireachtas is to hold the Government to account, probe views, etc. However, I am not convinced that we can necessarily second-guess everything. The Minister is listening to the debate and I presume that before coming to a final decision on the matter she will be obliged to discuss it with her colleagues in Government. I am here to support the Government and, when the various issues involved and considerations put forward have been carefully considered, I will support the final decision it takes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am more confused than ever about this issue. My views were clear this morning when I decided to do some reading on it. This is such a complex issue that the more one analyses it, the more one cannot reach a decision. That is the problem. The debate is extremely detailed. On one hand, we are being told about the benefits of stem cell research, while, on the other, arguments are being put forward about the difference between adult stem cell research and embry<Col N="1137" />onic stem cell research and whether such research destroys life. Once the latter question, to which I do not know the answer, is asked, I have a difficulty.</P>
      <P>Has enough investigation been carried out into adult stem cell research? I am aware that the debate in this area is ongoing and that there is perhaps more potential for such research than has been adverted to. Will the Minister indicate whether research into adult stem cells be pursued further at this point? Is it necessary to go down the road of embryonic stem cell research?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan2" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Mansergh for sharing time. I attended the meeting of the committee which discussed the funding of EU embryo research. I agree with the views expressed by Senators Hanafin and Ó Murchú. If we are serious about protecting the Constitution, we have a duty and a unique opportunity on this occasion to make a clear statement at EU level. Views were expressed on this matter as long ago as December 2001 at EU Council level. In that context, Ireland referred to Article 43.3 of the Constitution, concerning the right to life of the unborn, and stated that no such research will be carried out here. At a time when the EU is drawing up a new constitution, it is difficult to see how this can be implemented at European level if we do not respect our Constitution.</P>
      <P>I implore the Minister to take into consideration the views of the majority of Members of both Houses in making her decision. I would be surprised if any Government took a decision which ran contrary to the Constitution.</P>

      <P>I wish to place on record that I am chairperson of the Medical Council's ethics committee. In that context, Senator Terry correctly quoted the council's guideline in this area. She also stated that the council is meeting in private to review the guidelines and its position. That is partly true. As chair of the Medical Council's ethics committee, I have set up a sub-committee to review the ethical code that governs doctors and consultants. The guideline on stem cells is part of the review, as are the guidelines on consent, advertising and so on. The Medical Council, therefore, is not meeting in private.</P>
      <P>I felt more comfortable viewing the debate from my office. Unfortunately, my brother in law is seriously ill and suffers from Parkinson's disease. Stem cell research is an emotive issue and, as with all such issues, deep rooted feelings run high. There are things worse than death and I would love people to witness the life my sister leads together with her lovely husband and the terrible burden they must bear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A school of thought exists among the medical profession that adult stem cells are as beneficial <Col N="1138" />as embryonic stem cells but, scarily, there is another school of thought, according to which the result of embryonic stem cells research have been horrifying, with people who have terrible, debilitating illnesses being turned into monsters.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well because she will be in a difficult position. However, when she weighs up the pros and cons, she will do what is right for the Government and the country. Like Senator Mansergh, I will fully support the Minister and the Government, whatever conclusion is reached.</P>

All scientific developments have been accompanied by many negative voices throughout history but, at the end of the day, they lead to a happier life for us all. IVF treatment was rejected by the Catholic Church originally but it has been accepted as the norm in a short time. The Pope spoke out against contraception in <i>Humanae Vitae</i> in 1968. It was illegal in Ireland then, but it is legal today. I respect the view and sincerity of every Member who contributed but I have confidence the Minister will progress this issue while taking all legal and ethical aspects into consideration. She stated: &ldquo;It does not allow for the EU funding of any research activity in Ireland which would not satisfy Irish ethical or legal requirements.&rdquo; That is important. If Members or the public do not want research conducted in Ireland, that must be accepted. However, I have confidence in the Minister and the Government that they will make the correct decision for the future development of mankind. I will support them.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for attending. She did not display tardiness because she wanted to be present. She said she would forego her appointments this afternoon and respond to the points raised. Few politicians would have been as frank, open and generous with their time as the Minister.</P>
      <P>The debate has been fascinating. Senator Henry elucidated on a number of points using plain language that we could all understand. Every Member spoke with passion and from the heart. We are faced with major dilemmas but, as Senators Brian Hayes and White said, there has not been a period when our hearts and minds have failed to develop on such issues. One does not grow up with a fixed position on points A, B or C. Issues such as contraception and divorce have led us to change our minds. We have not done so wilfully but through our experience of issues within our own lives and within society.</P>
      <P>The debate has only begun. The House has been manifestly a voice for those who did not have one on this issue and it shows the House has great use when such a topic can be freely debated. I respect the views of everyone who has contributed and I express my appreciation to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Members who contributed to this worthwhile and <Col N="1139" />thoughtful debate. They expressed different points of view honestly and sincerely. I did not unilaterally adopt a position on behalf of Ireland. When this issue arose, I consulted the Minister for Health and Children in the first instance. The question was raised regarding whether this issue is more appropriate to the Department of Health and Children. However, the research budget is under the remit of the competitiveness Council and during the life of the previous Government, my colleague, Deputy Treacy, dealt with the research agenda. Following the general election, I took on the research agenda, which comes under the remit of the competitiveness council.</P>
      <P>Economics, trade and business do not come before ethical, health and quality of life issues. As somebody who likes to see the country progress, I am depressed by much of the so-called progress we have witnessed in recent years. Recently in Limerick my former colleague, Des O'Malley, asked how is it the Limerick of <i>Angela's Ashes</i> had virtually no crime while the Limerick of the Celtic tiger has so much crime. That says a great deal. Much has happened in Ireland and the European Union that I wish did not happen and I would love to turn the clock back. I refer to the spirit of volunteerism and being good neighbours. People lead busy lives and, for example, they are stuck in traffic every day. That has changed the way people operate and, therefore, all progress is not necessarily good. I would be the first to articulate that, notwithstanding my political philosophy.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael is making an issue of the process and procedure. The procedure outlined by Senators Brian Hayes, Terry and Coghlan applies to regulations under Article 161. This is not such a proposal and there is no requirement to refer it for scrutiny. If there was, I would be first person to do so. I enjoy debate and I want to engage in debate about this and other issues. I have attended more meetings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business than any of my predecessors. I am in politics because I genuinely want to debate ideas and issues. Politics is about ideas, perspectives and issues. I also believe that any Government Minister, let alone a leader of a political party, who does not listen and engage with people on this and other issues would be very foolish indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue has been around since the summer of 2002. The vote which is to take place is not about funding. I am being asked not to vote for funding, but it is already EU policy that there will be funding, although there is a moratorium on its use until the end of this year. If we do not have guidelines and regulations by 1 January &ndash; this relates to Senator Hayes's question &ndash; the matter will go to a committee of which we are members. We are also members of the ethical committee. If the committee does not agree to a funding proposal from the Commission, the matter goes to the EU Council. At that level, it can be blocked by a blocking majority. Since at least ten coun<Col N="1140" />tries are in favour of this proposal, there is no question of there being a blocking majority. Accordingly, the research will proceed without any guidelines.</P>
    <P>There is also an issue that some countries which are anxious to carry out this research may well decide to take legal action against the Commission on the basis that although it is EU law, having been duly agreed by the EU, they are being prevented from applying for research as no programme has been opened up. There are real issues and dangers involved, of which I would like people to be aware. That is the reason, when I consulted with the Minister for Health and Children, the Taoiseach and other members of the Government, we said Ireland should vote to have strict guidelines and safeguards in this area, rather than what is broadly described as a free-for-all, about which Senator Henry spoke so well, as in the United States.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to have the private sector, in Ireland or any other European country, operating what are described as bio-banks. Would we not be appalled if, in the case of organ donation, one had to go to a company to buy a kidney or a heart? That could well happen in this area if we do not have controls and guidelines. This is a question of public research being in the public domain and available for public benefit. Currently, as I understand it, the research takes place in the private sector. Some countries, such as Italy which is voting against the Commission guidelines, allow it in the private sector for imported embryos, which may come from aborted foetuses if animal and adult cells cannot supply the requirements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>It also applies in Germany.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. There are huge issues involved. From my experience in this Parliament over 26 years, these debates are always painful, difficult and emotive. In our most recent abortion referendum, the question of when life begins was a major issue, including the question of implantation, which caused a great deal of concern. Since I am neither a scientist, a doctor nor a lawyer, I am not in a position to say what the legal implications of all this may be. However, I understand there has been no judicial guidance on the subject of embryos outside the womb. Accordingly, I do not believe that I, or anybody else, can state the legal or constitutional position of an embryo outside the womb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to reiterate, once again, what we are discussing. We are speaking of embryos which are created for IVF. I understand that eight or 12 eggs are fertilised and, according to Senator Henry, two are inserted &ndash; I had understood the number to be three. The rest are frozen. If the two succeed and a child is born, the couple may decide to try again, using two further embryos. Perhaps, at the end of the process, there are four, six, eight or whatever number left. Under the Commission proposal, it would be a matter for <Col N="1141" />those donors to decide whether to leave the embryo in its frozen state which, I understand, will no longer be viable after three to five years and, therefore, cannot be used for human life. In any event, it cannot become a human being unless it is implanted into the womb of a woman.</P>
    <P>The question then arises as to whether, in certain circumstances, one should use an embryo for research into Parkinson's, Crohn's or other diseases. I am greatly taken by Senator Feeney's remarks. Without being personal, in any sense, some of us may have loved ones who are very ill. If we believe that those who cannot speak as a result of a stroke, are unable to walk or cannot look after themselves could be cured, I ask each Member to consider what he or she might do in those circumstances. It is a very grey area; it is not black and white, as Senator Hayes said.</P>
    <P>The question for discussion and decision is with regard to the guidelines under which it can happen. The donor couple can decide to make the embryo available for research under strict conditions, for example, that no money will be paid and that the embryo can only be used if adult cells cannot be used &ndash; it would have to be proven, in very strict circumstances, that adult or animal cells could not be used for these purposes. It would apply only in those circumstances. I believe, in all the circumstances, that it is better to have guidelines.</P>
    <P>Since I came into the Chamber, I have received a note to the effect that the European Parliament has voted by approximately 300 to 200 in favour of a much more liberal approach &ndash; it does not want a cut-off date of June 2002 or any cut-off date. The significance of the cut-off date is that one cannot create embryos for this purpose. There are huge issues involved and they will not be easy to resolve. I consider the Commission proposal rather conservative, but it is a step in the right direction, in that it gives guidelines and safeguards. I do not believe it falls into what might be described as the liberal category at all. Presumably, that is the reason the European Parliament did not consider it good enough.</P>
    <P>Clearly, these are matters for Government, at the end of the day. I will attend a meeting next week, as I did two weeks ago, at which there will be 30 or 40 items on the agenda. I am not, by any means, equating this particular matter with any other issue &ndash; it comes into a completely different category and, accordingly, one consults with other Government colleagues who are involved in many of these issues at European level, including the Minister for Health and Children, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. That process will continue. This is not a decision for Mary Harney alone. While there may be a theory that I take decisions on my own, I have no intention of exercising power which I do not have. I do not wish to have anybody under any illusion that I have committed Ireland to something for which it is not prepared to sign up. Unfortunately, however, the position we are adopting is being misunderstood. People think we <Col N="1142" />are engaged in voting Irish money for this research in other countries. That is not the case. What we are setting out to do is to put controls, guidelines and parameters on how this money can be spent. I honestly believe that is very reasonable in all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Catholic University of Louvain, in response to Senator Hanafin and others, if I created the impression that I was quoting it as an authority of the Catholic Church, I apologise for that. That was certainly not my intention. I simply quoted what was said there to explain the difficult ethical complexities which arise in this whole area, which I believe it spelled out extremely well. I have not got the precise source within the relevant faculty, but I have no doubt that reference can be readily obtained after this debate.</P>
    <P>With regard to pharmaceutical companies, knowledge knows no boundaries. If a pharmaceutical or bio-pharm company in Ireland becomes aware of research emerging in the United States, China or India, I cannot declare in this House that they will not use it. I do not know how one can stop knowledge from being transferred. In the modern world, knowledge transfer is the order of the day. The fact that something is researched in one place does not limit its use to that particular place &ndash; that could not be the case. We are speaking of multinational, global companies. If they carry out research within the company in a particular country, can they confine the resulting products of that knowledge to being developed in that country? I do not believe they can. These are difficult and unclear areas.</P>
    <P>I have received a great deal of correspondence, as Members may know, in connection with this matter from both sides of the argument. Some women have written in very traumatic terms about IVF treatment in Ireland. One woman told me she did not become pregnant but, four years later, the embryo was inserted into her body, outside her womb and she excreted it. I can say that she found that an extremely emotionally traumatic experience, as it is.</P>
    <P>With regard to Irish Medical Council guidelines or whatever approach we take in Ireland, I hope that, when the Commission reports, we can have the type of debate which has been called for. I also hope we can have legislation in this whole area. To a large extent, as I understand it, we are operating only under Medical Council practice rather than guidelines. We do not have any laws in this area and I am not suggesting they will be easy to frame. However, I am certain we will hear a great deal more in this regard. We, in Ireland, need to decide for ourselves, on the basis of the facts and expert information as it becomes available. There is a lack of agreement among the experts, whether in the area of medicine, science or law. One of the wonderful features of experts is that they can take differing points of view while being equally convincing sometimes. I find this a particular feature in relation to law. The Personal Injuries Assessment Board Bill will be before this <Col N="1143" />House tomorrow. Some lawyers will argue very strongly that it will not work. Equally, there will be some who will say how well something will work. That is what is wonderful about the professions and the reason we need them.</P>
    <P>If we are to have legislation or guidelines, we need to make our decision ourselves. What is wonderful about the EU in this area &ndash; it is a point Ireland has always strongly maintained and sold to our people &ndash; is that in regard to ethical matters, there must be ethical subsidiarity. Do Members of this House want to wake up one day and be told that they have to have X or Y in Ireland? They do not. Although we pool our sovereignty in many areas, we retain autonomy on the issues that matter deeply to us. That is the way it should always be.</P>
    <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach and the Leader of the House, in particular, for asking me to come to the House for a debate on this matter. She said the House wanted it and I said I would attend. I thank all the Members who participated in the debate and those who are in ongoing discussions with me on this matter. Even now, as a result of a European Parliament vote, there may be uncertainties as to what exactly the Commission will do. I believe it will stick with its original proposal but it will be accused of ignoring the democratic Parliament. As Members can appreciate, there are no easy answers in this area. I want Members to know that Ireland will vote for, if a vote is called, guidelines, safeguards and regulations and not for such research being carried out in the free for all environment that occurs in other places with all the dangers attached to it.</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann, noting that as a consequence of the Estimates for 2004</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;Back to Education Allowance is all but abolished at third level</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;Conditions for the Rent Supplement are to be severely curtailed and restricted</P>

      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;Earnings threshold for Disability and Unemployment Benefit will go up and</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;Duration for Unemployment Benefit payments will be reduced,</P>
      <P>condemns this assault on the living standards and educational opportunities of the most disadvantaged in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, to the House. The Book of Estimates characterises an ugly prevalence in terms of governance here since last year. I believe strongly, as many people do, not least the organisations which represent the worst off in <Col N="1144" />society, that the Book of Estimates, as presented by the Government, demonstrates disregard for those who are less well off in our society. This highlights what is becoming a well believed statement, that if one does not belong to the golden circle or if one is not part of the K Club or part of the circle of those who live around it, one is not even worthy of merit in the form of support from this Administration.</P>
    <P>When the spate of public sector cutbacks was initiated, it was predicted that their impact would be remarkably negative on those who are less well off. It is those people who will suffer at the hands of the apostles of fiscal rectitude. We do not need to name the main apostle in terms of that category but he is ably supported, unfortunately, by many more around the Cabinet table. The person who was Minister for Social Welfare in 1992 introduced a number of cuts that were called the dirty dozen, which lived up to their name. However, just as we have witnessed massive advances in technology and in many other areas in western society in recent years, we have also witnessed, unfortunately, a bigger, more cruel type of monster emerging from the shadows of the dirty dozen. We can christen that monster, the &ldquo;savage 16&rdquo; because what we saw last week was nothing short of barbaric and savage.</P>
    <P>I will go through the savage 16 cuts. Social welfare recipients must be on welfare for 15 months rather than six months to qualify for the back to education allowance at third level. Lone parents will be refused the transitional half rate social welfare payment to ease the break from welfare when they take up employment and earn in excess of &euro;293 per week. Recipients of supplementary welfare allowance or rent or mortgage supplement must pay at least &euro;13 instead &euro;12 towards their accommodation before qualifying for these allowances. Supplementary welfare allowance will not be paid any longer to a household where one member is in full employment. If one of a couple is working, both will be excluded from rent allowance or mortgage supplement.</P>
    <P>Health boards can now refuse rent supplement to someone who is not already renting for six months unless that person is homeless or where there are other compelling reasons. Rent allowance claimants will be referred to the local authority for assessment of housing need in a more systematic manner rather than applying to the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Having regard to these cuts, it is appropriate that when that Department was renamed, the word &ldquo;community&rdquo; was removed. Rent allowance will no longer be paid to people who refuse an offer of a local authority house or who leave such housing without reasonable cause. A supplement given to recipients of supplementary welfare allowance who have been supported by the Money Advice and Budgeting Service in brokering a deal with creditors it to be discontinued.</P>
    <P>The crèche supplement which assists in covering the cost of emergency child care is to be abolished. The diet supplement, which is paid to <Col N="1145" />people with special dietary needs, such as coeliacs, is to be phased out over a number of years. The entitlement to the half rate child dependant allowance in respect of unemployment benefit and disability benefit claims will be discontinued where the claimant's spouse or partner has a gross weekly income in excess of &euro;300. The current weekly earnings permitted to claim the reduced rates of disability and unemployment benefit has been increased from &euro;88.80 to &euro;150. The entitlement of new claimants to the half rate payment of disability and unemployment benefit where the recipient is already in receipt of widow's or widower's pension or the one parent family payment will be discontinued. The maximum duration of unemployment benefit will be reduced from 390 days to 312 days where a person has less than 260 PRSI contributions paid since first entering employment. The number of paid PRSI contributions required for qualification for disability, unemployment and health and safety benefit has been increased from 39 since first entering insurance to 52. The 16th cut is an increase in the period where claims for unemployment benefit and disability benefit are linked to a previous claim from 13 to 26 weeks.</P>
    <P>One does not have to study these cutbacks in any great detail to know they are savage. It amounts to a massive retrograde step by the Government. There has been some deliberation as to whether one of them amounts to a cutback, but it does.</P>
    <P>I have great difficulty with the language used to justify some of these measures, particularly the term &ldquo;disincentive to employment&rdquo;. No one decides to give up a job. People lose their jobs when their place of work shuts down. Given the way the economy is going, people have no choice if they are out of work. There is no disincentive to employment. It is unfortunate and regrettable, but one cannot blame those who have lost their jobs.</P>
    <P>A 2% increase in the capital gains tax to 22% would result in no cutback on rent allowance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>A 2% increase in the capital gains tax would negate the need for such a cutback. The current weekly earning threshold for the purpose of payment of reduced rates of disability is being increased from &euro;88.88 to &euro;150. The threshold has not been updated since 1993. This represents a serious disincentive to employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part-time workers who lose employment or take sick leave get half-rate unemployment or disability benefit, respectively. Deciding whether someone is full-time or part-time depends on average weekly earnings in the previous tax year. The current threshold between full and part-time <Col N="1146" />is drawn at an average earning of &euro;88 per week. This is set to rise to &euro;150 per week. Up to now someone whose average income in the last tax year was, say, &euro;130 per week, was entitled to full rate unemployment benefit when they lost their job or full rate disability benefit when they were sick. They will now be only entitled to half the benefit rate, at &euro;62.40 per week.</P>
    <P>A major consequence of the Estimates will be to drive more lone parents and their families into poverty. Recent research from the ESRI shows that homemakers and lone parents are the largest single group living in poverty. A plethora of reports, many of them Government ones, argue that the best route out of poverty is through acquiring skills and getting work. However, in a short-term saving of money, a massive roadblock has been placed across the escape routes available to these families, with the result that their long-term welfare reliance is reinforced. These cuts will lead to a growth in child poverty as they prevent people from having a better quality of life.</P>
    <P>During last year's general election, the daily press contained launches by various Ministers of their programmes. Candidates threw themselves at Ministers as they announced measures to copperfasten economic growth in many areas. However, the shelf life of the manifestos of the Government parties was as short as the length of time it took for the Dáil to sit after the general election. Their promises and commitments have been broken one by one. The general election of May 2002 was bought and the people were fooled and conned.</P>
    <P>The contemptuous arrogance of the Government since then has been remarkable. There is documentary proof from the Department of Finance that the manifestos amounted to nothing more than a tissue of lies. Given the cutbacks in the public sector and the savage 16 cuts announced in the Book of Estimates, we do not need lectures by the Government, yet despite this, it has embarked on a sustained campaign to tell people that its record is not as I have outlined.</P>
    <P>The Government will only be serious about fulfilling its commitments and promises in the general election manifestos when it reaches the last month of its five year term of office. By then, our friend from County Kildare, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, will have bankrupted the country. There will be job losses and hospitals will be ready to close down. God knows what will happen.</P>
    <P>Collective Cabinet responsibility has been thrown out the window. When attempts are made to rectify it with a half-baked apology and a commitment made by the Taoiseach to howls of laughter in the Lower House, another Senator and Deputy pour cold water on the Hanly report. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, decided that his pastime and hobbyhorse at Punchestown was worthy of &euro;15 million of taxpayers' money. While the two Ministers concerned are well known visitors&mdash;</P>

Nor are they entitled to breach clear Cabinet guidelines and procedures on how they expend money. It typifies the arrogance and contemptuous attitude of the Government.</P>
      <P>We are now worse off than we have ever been. We have an arch-conservative Government which is content to operate within a golden circle. Those not in its remit are on the margins. The rule is, if one is not in the golden circle one is not worthy of merit. That will be the lasting legacy of the Government.</P>
      <P>I look forward to next year when the people get their first opportunity to cast judgment on these savage 16 cutbacks. The Taoiseach and Minister for Finance and those who are party to administering a secret manifesto involving the shut down of public services and the bankrupting of the country have the arrogance to tell us that what we heard last year was not what we were told. The Minister for Finance said then that no cutbacks were planned, secretly or otherwise. I ask the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, to tell the House where in the manifestos were these savage 16 cutbacks mentioned. Where did they indicate that, within a short period after the general elections, there would be cutbacks in allowances on which people depended, such as the back to education allowance, the lone parents allowance and rent supplements?</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. If anything has demonstrated the philosophy of the Government, it is the Book of Estimates published last week. It demonstrates that the Progressive Democrats' agenda is running the Government and that it has lost touch with the people it claims to represent. This is particularly apt when the Fianna Fáil Party always claims to be the party of the people. It also demonstrates that the Government has a total disregard for the poor and vulnerable in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Minister for being open and honest about its stance. The philosophy is that people should not be poor, unemployed, a single parent or in need of housing. The clear philosophy of the Government is that these people are not to be supported; they are on their own and the Government is not there for them. This is not the philosophy of the wider community, which is why people will see this for what it is. People have been very taken aback by these Estimates and the savagery towards people who are vulnerable in our community. The attitude underlying these Estimates demonstrating the current philosophy of the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive <Col N="1148" />Democrats led Government is: &ldquo;You are on your own and we do not care about you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In her press release and on the radio last week, the Minister spoke at length about how the social welfare system now represents such a disincentive to employment. In other words the IBEC agenda is clearly running the Government. This is the agenda which states social welfare supports are somehow preventing people from working, as if people would choose to be on social welfare rather than be at work.</P>
    <P>The Minister should come down to the midlands where for the past six years there has been a haemorrhage of jobs, which have not been replaced, and talk to people about a disincentive to employment. She should talk to those who lost their jobs recently following the closure of the Tubex plant outside Nenagh. Very few of these people have managed to get another job despite their best efforts because there are no jobs. The Government is claiming it is not its fault but the fault of those people.</P>
    <P>In the past our social welfare philosophy has recognised that some people need a cushion and need to be supported. I may be wrong, but I still believe we live in a country where we want to support people who need support, such as single parents and those with disabilities. However, the philosophy behind these cuts is quite the opposite.</P>
    <P>It must be some time since the Minister sat in a clinic&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was last Saturday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and listened to people who need supplementary welfare allowance. The people whom I meet and who need supplementary welfare allowance are very vulnerable. They are not people who are ripping off the system. They do not want to ask for it but are in need of support. Clearly the Minister and her Government colleagues do not see it this way.</P>
      <P>The notion that if one partner in a couple is in full-time employment both are excluded from claiming rent or mortgage supplement suggests that one income is enough to support a household. However, the Minister should consider some of the low incomes people are now earning. Even in the public service people are earning very low incomes and are expected to live in an increasingly expensive society made more expensive by the stealth taxes that are being piled on every day to such an extent that the Society of St. Vincent de Paul says its new clients are finding it increasingly difficult to keep body and soul together despite being earners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people I meet who are on rent supplement need that supplement. I meet many single parents in particular who find themselves caught by the fact that if they work they cannot claim rent allowance, but if they give up rent allowance they cannot survive and cannot pay rent. When this is viewed against the background of a mounting housing crisis, it is possible to see the full extent <Col N="1149" />of the savagery of this cut. The Minister stated that the purpose of the rent supplement like other social welfare programmes is to meet income maintenance needs and not long-term housing needs. While this may be true, rent allowance and rent supplement have become necessary elements of people's housing needs and more so in recent years when, as a result of the Government's mismanagement of housing, fewer people can afford to buy a house and have to rent at a time when rents are increasing. People on low incomes, particularly single parents, in need of rent allowance are the ones being hit.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that for the most part health boards decide whether an applicant for rent supplement is in need of accommodation without reference to the local authority. In my local authority in north Tipperary this has not been the case for a number of years. The rent allowance is linked to the application for local authority housing. To my knowledge those who apply for rent allowance must be on the housing list. Senator McCarthy has confirmed the same is true in west Cork. It is clearly the case that people will not get the allowance without being an accepted applicant for housing.</P>
    <P>This cut will further institutionalise those in need of housing and create an even bigger problem. As has been stated by the housing organisations, it will certainly generate more homelessness. The Government is blithely happy to do this. This is yet another indication of how cut-off the Government is. It will take three weeks at most before Government backbenchers get the message and start bleating about this. They will appear whinging on the plinth as if it has nothing to do with them. However, the public know and are waiting in the long grass for the Government.</P>

      <P>Do we now want to go back to borrowing all the money so that we can give it away? That is not the type of country we want and the people did not elect this party to Government to do that. Social welfare expenditure in 2003 is almost double the level it was when the Labour Party and Fine Gael were last in Government. This unprecedented level of payment is all the more outstanding when we consider that the level of unemployment has been cut by more than half since Fianna Fáil took office. The figures announced in the Estimates this year, as in every other year, do not include social welfare rate increases that are announced on budget day. However, when it is considered that &euro;10.6 billion is being set aside for social welfare after a reduction in unemployment rates from 10.3% in 1997 to 4.4% currently, we can see that there has been a real increase in the provision of social welfare. What should we do? Should we just keep spending? I have heard the cries about value for money or that the Government has wasted all the money that was gained in a growing economy with which, allegedly, it had nothing to do. This should be said to pensioners who got an increase. The average increase for pensioners since Fianna Fáil came into Government has been over &euro;9 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the other House today, the figure of £1.83 was mentioned as the increase given to pensioners by the former Minister, Proinsias de Rossa, MEP. I do not recollect that particular time of Government but is £1.83 something to be proud of as an increase for pensioners? We have given an average increase of over &euro;9 per annum. In the programme for Government, which is what <Col N="1151" />we are working under, we promised to increase&mdash;</P>

      <P>Child benefit is the most significant and universally acknowledged tax free measure directed at relieving child poverty. When Fianna Fáil came into Government, child benefit was &euro;38.09 per child and &euro;49.52 for the third and subsequent children. This year, before the announcement of the increases on budget day, the rate is &euro;125.60 for the first and second child and &euro;157.30 for the third and subsequent children. That is paid from the beginning of the year. Announcements are not made in December with the payments being made in September. It comes through at the beginning of the following year.</P>

      <P>These increases mean that in the period Fianna Fáil has been in office rates of child benefit have more than trebled. This benefit is paid to every family in the country. It is the fairest and most direct means of ensuring that we alleviate child poverty. There is no cut in that area.</P>
      <P>Let us look at some of the things we propose to do and the criticisms levelled against us. We cannot continue to spend as if there was no tomorrow. We must look at how we spend. It is prudent to refocus our attitude towards spending to ensure the money we pay out goes to the people who need it most. People talk about the back to work education allowance. I know for a fact that some people give up jobs and go on to the live register for a period of six to nine months prior to applying for the back to work education allowance for third level education. That is a fact. By increasing it to 15 months, we will ensure that the people who&mdash;</P>

      <P>My script was not supplied by anybody. I am stating a fact regarding this particular issue. If we see people going back to education after 15 months of unemployment through the back to education allowance, it will be a better focus of the scheme. It will allow other people to have money to which they are more entitled. It is being raised from six months to 15 months in respect of third level, not second level, and I do not have a difficulty with it.</P>
      <P>One of the difficulties with rent allowance is that the people who benefit most are not those who receive the allowance and get housing and accommodation, but the landlords who sometimes get in excess of &euro;800,000 or &euro;900,000 per annum from the State for the provision of private rented accommodation. These include landlords who provide substandard accommodation to the most vulnerable in our society and it is time the whole system was reviewed.</P>
      <P>I accept Senator O'Meara's point that we will see over the next couple of weeks the impact it will have on the community. We must be clear about how we implement that decision. If there is a need for review to ensure the homeless, disabled people and those most in need get that allowance under the discretion the Minister is continuing to allow at health board level, that must take place.</P>
      <P>Social welfare payments must be put in context. There is an increase in the social welfare spend. The Book of Estimates involves &euro;40 billion of funding and some &euro;10.6 billion will be spent on social welfare. That is what we need to focus on and it is time to evaluate the schemes to make sure the money we are continuing to provides goes to where it is most needed, which is to look after, as Fianna Fáil has always done, the people most in need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy O'Malley, and I look forward to hearing him try to defend the indefensible. The 16 cuts involved sound worse when they are read out compared to when one reads about them. In normal circumstances, there would be uproar if there were two or three such cuts. Obviously, by announcing all 16 together, the Minister wants to take the flak at the beginning. The Minister for Finance's statement prior to the election that there would be no cutbacks, hidden or otherwise, rings hollow in the context of the 16 cuts we are discussing. That is what the public will have in mind when they vote next year and, hopefully, in the next general election. They will be reminded of the Minister's statement. There were no cutbacks as regards the Punchestown development in the Minister's constituency. When those involved applied for &euro;6.5 million, they were given it and they got another &euro;6.5 million and more while sports clubs and communities all over the country applied for grants from the national lottery and had to wait for 50% or 60% grants for their projects. However, the centre in Punches<Col N="1153" />town received 100% financing and it is in this context that we must discuss the cuts.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Society of St. Vincent de Paul described the proposed cuts as mean, petty and extremely discouraging. The organisation works on the ground with poor people, week in and week out. The spokesman also stated that the number of requests for help in the last year has increased dramatically. This is the Ireland of 2003 where fiscal rectitude is taking precedence over long-term social planning, which is on what the Government should be focused. These are not adjustments or reform of the social welfare system, as some Government spokespersons might like us to believe. They are savage cuts that will affect people who are trying to exist on meagre resources. They will hurt the most vulnerable sections of the community and, make no mistake, they are already hurting. One might say these cuts involve only a few euro, but for a single person on &euro;124.80 per week or a married couple on &euro;207 per week, every euro counts. The best financial planner would find it difficult to manage to provide for his or her family on such a low income. These cuts, when taken in conjunction with the wide array of stealth taxes, indicate that the poor and disadvantaged have suffered a great deal, mainly due to the policies of the Government.</P>
      <P>I heard a Government spokesperson say recently that stealth or indirect taxes are the way forward, that they are a fairer system. It is not a fairer system because the poor must pay the same as the rich. The ESB's prices have increased by 13%, bus fares have increased by 9% and local authority charges have increased by more than 10%. VAT increases have added to the price of newspapers, fuel, hairdressers and food and drink. The poor must also pay these increases, which is the reason I said earlier that every euro counts. Cutting a few euro here and there from people on social welfare and low incomes can be devastating.</P>
      <P>I will deal with some of the cuts that have been announced. I find it extraordinary that the supplement to the Money Advice and Budgeting Service has been discontinued. This is a critical level of assistance provided by community welfare officers to people who have fallen into debt and are in need of support. The MABS does a tremendous job in planning and rescheduling debts and the supplement was an important part of that system. The result of this cut will be to drive people back into the hands of unscrupulous moneylenders. These people are in dire circumstances and will be left with empty pockets and increasing debts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The diet supplement is also to be discontinued which will have severe repercussions on those who previously benefited from the scheme. Significant extra costs are involved for special foods for coeliacs and persons with diabetes and so on. A person with an income of &euro;124 receives a supplement ranging between &euro;7 and &euro;18 for a single person and between &euro;12 and &euro;23 for a married couple. The withdrawal of the supplement will <Col N="1154" />cause severe hardship to many people. The Minister may say that community welfare officers can deal with hardship cases but this is transferring the blame and decision-making back into the hands of community welfare officers who are already grossly overworked.</P>
    <P>As stated in the motion, the back to education allowance has been all but abolished. Combined with the cuts in vocational education committees for crèche facilities for people on VTOS, Youthreach and senior Traveller programmes, this is a major deterrent for single-parent families to educate themselves. This, in turn, makes their children more vulnerable to poverty and social alienation.</P>
    <P>The conditions for rent allowance are severely restricted. The six month rule before an applicant qualifies for rent allowance will create major problems and will result in more people becoming homeless. The Government does not have any social housing plan to cater for the tens of thousands of people on local authority housing lists. The restricted provisions for rent allowance will force many more people onto this list and put even greater pressure on local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Government is bereft of ideas when it has to resort to punishing the weakest sections of society with these savage cutbacks when, at the same time, generous tax concessions are in place for people who can take a hit without batting an eyelid. This assault on the living standards and educational opportunities of the most disadvantaged in society must be condemned. The pious platitude that the Government is committed to tackling disadvantage can be viewed in the context of the litany of broken promises we witness on a daily basis. With my party, I fully support the motion before the House.</P>

This year the total budget for the Department of Social and Family Affairs is over &euro;10.6 billion, which does not include the social welfare increases which will be announced in the budget in early December.</P>

I echo the words of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, who said earlier this week that she was pleased to have secured an increase in the social welfare Estimates.

      <P>The impression has been given by the Government side that it is merely the Labour Party which takes offence at these miserable, wretched and unutterably mean cuts. It is not. It is this entire side of the House plus <i>The Irish Times</i> which in an editorial on Saturday outlined its position under the headline &ldquo;Aiming the cuts at the weakest&rdquo; as follows:</P>
      <P>The Estimates for 2004 make grim reading for anyone with a social conscience. The coalition Government is presiding over an outrageous assault on the living standards of the most vulnerable and impoverished sections of our society, as an alternative to higher income tax or more extensive borrowing.</P>
      <P>Those unfortunate people who saw the fruits of the so-called Celtic tiger pass them by will be forced into even greater poverty.</P>
      <P>The <i>Irish Examiner</i> published the headline &ldquo;McCreevy's plans to hit the vulnerable&rdquo;. As has already been quoted by a colleague on this side, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, which should certainly be seen as politically neutral, has said these cuts are wretched and will cause misery for many.</P>
      <P>The amounts involved are comparatively small. That is certain in light of the fact that Senator Mansergh told the House with gay abandon this morning that &euro;310 million was negligible and a mere bagatelle. If the Government feels like that, it should put the money back into the pockets of the poor from whom they filched it. Punchestown has been invoked, but this issue is greater than that. A large proportion of the 100 wealthiest individuals in this country pay no income tax at all because they have good accountants. We should forget Punchestown and look at the fact that bloodstock breeders pay no tax on stud fees which often run to tens of millions of euro. Despite this, the Government is taking away assistance in drugs, hospitals and back to education schemes. The Government is hitting the people who already cannot afford to have a decent life and are trying to do something with the help of social benefits. Of course, scroungers should be got rid of, but their number is pathetically small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem with the back to education scheme was that it was too successful. People were glad to take it up and glad to receive an <Col N="1159" />education. They did so in such numbers that the Department could not cope. In response, the time for which one has to be out of work has been raised from six to 18 months. How mean can one get? I am surprised anyone on the Government benches would attempt to justify it. If they seek a comparison, they should look at post-Thatcher Britain where a similar voluntary scheme, the work based learning for adults scheme, is in operation. Its provisions are virtually the same as ours. The criteria to obtain a place are that one must be aged at least 25, not on another government funded training programme and continuously unemployed for 26 weeks or more. In this country, the Government proposes to extend the period of unemployment to 18 months despite the fact that we are always priding ourselves on our wonderful education system. Education is said to be the key to success. It is, but we intend to keep it for ourselves and to further disbar people from accessing it.</P>
    <P>This is not to say the scheme was a great administrative success. I have a document which states that 18 prospective candidates of the Galway Youth Federation's young mothers in education project were recently told that there was a four month delay in handling their applications for the back to education allowance administered by the Department of Social and Family Affairs. These candidates were simultaneously given 21 days by the Western Health Board to produce their back to education allowance approvals. What kind of way is this to treat vulnerable people? The people involved are the most vulnerable one could imagine.</P>
    <P>Can Senator Cox stand over the removal of the crèche supplement? I have heard her speak about the need for crèches. I listened to what she said about those matters even though I am a mere man with no children. Unless things advance considerably in science through stem cell research, I am unlikely to have any. The support has now been taken away from the people who really need it. The meanest measure of all is the removal of dietary supplement assistance from people who suffer from various diseases and allergies including coeliac disease, diabetes and gluten allergies. The small amounts of money which would make it possible for them to enjoy a reasonable life are being taken away. Support is being taken away from people who are suffering from illnesses in terms of which there is no faking. It is a crude, miserable and wretched policy.</P>
    <P>The increase in the drugs assistance threshold from &euro;70 to &euro;78 is really mean. If one is admitted to hospital, one must pay an extra &euro;45 per night for the first ten nights. That is a great deal of money to someone on social welfare. It is really intolerable. This is meanness because these people are defenceless and these measures will not even produce a significant amount of money. It looks like a kind of sadism and it will backfire on the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party has done us a service in tabling this motion, which I support. My immediate reaction was this was probably another motion in support of high spending without provision for accountability or costing. However, I am convinced by the arguments that it supports low or targeted spending on vulnerable people, with which Senators on this side of the House agree. This is not a catch-all motion to spend a great deal of money and give everyone what they want, which one might expect from the Opposition sometimes. Rather, this is about a small amount of money making a large number of people's lives tolerable and we should consider and support it.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris touched on something which is personal to me when he referred to accident and emergency provisions. It appears there is no justification for cutting back on health services to poor people. I have to confess to ignorance in this regard but, for personal reasons, I have been visiting hospitals and have been involved with invalids and their rights. I was unaware of the extraordinary position that the richest people appear to get the largest benefits. I do not understand this. This is a free-for-all where people, regardless of their incomes, get free health services and pay nothing for sophisticated equipment which the poor cannot afford. I cannot understand why rich people are not asked to contribute to these services. The Eastern Health Board seems to provide extravagant and good health facilities for people who can afford to pay some money towards it. Why is this not happening? I though we were living in some sort of egalitarian regime, particularly in regard to the health service. However, this is not the case.</P>
      <P>With a small redistribution of just &euro;58 million and probably no hurt to anyone we could probably solve this problem by asking richer people to pay some contribution towards services for which they pay nothing at all. Perhaps the Minister of State and his colleagues would think about that. It would make no difference to the wealthy but an enormous difference to the people about whom we are talking.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Norris for raising the issue of stallion fees. It is ironic this motion has been tabled against the background of invidious cuts and at a time when a major court case is being taken by Mr. Alex Ferguson against Mr. John Magnier. What are they fighting about?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the unacceptable face of capitalism since I guess that sum could pay for all these cuts. It is patently unjust. They can afford to go to court about money which they do not need by employing extremely expensive lawyers <Col N="1161" />while people are suffering serious hardship. This points to the fact that such perfectly legal tax loopholes are socially unacceptable. As long as people with disabilities and health problems are made to suffer, we cannot continue to pursue this policy and claim to be an equitable or fair society.</P>
      <P>I will be the first to support cuts in income tax because that is the way in which wealth is created in order that more money can be distributed to the people who deserve it. However, we cannot continue to give extraordinary privileges to a few people while other people are suffering such extraordinary disadvantage.</P>
      <P>I agreed with everything Senator Norris said, apart from when he read from <i>The Irish Times</i>. A few days before the newspaper preached so eloquently about the most weak and vulnerable in society, <i>The Irish Times </i>was itself exposed as having paid the most extraordinary amounts of money to people under the guise of being a charitable trust. The Government is playing almost exactly the same game and the Opposition may have done so in the past. It is glaring hypocrisy that the newspaper could issue such an editorial on a Saturday, when one finds the same week that the top executives and directors are being paid huge sums of money &ndash; in some cases to ensure they do no work at all. They are not being overworked at the same time.</P>

The guardians of these high ethics are the guardians of the vulnerable. Politicians should point out these sorts of things and I thank the Labour Party for doing so with this motion.</P>

While the arguments may be interesting political fodder, they do nothing for reasoned and enlightened debate in regard to how we manage our economy.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party presided over probably the biggest dereliction of any Government in the history of this State and one would need to travel far to find a government which emulated the level of irresponsibility of Dr. Garret FitzGerald's Government from 1982 to 1987. Fine Gael would proffer the excuse that its attachment to the Labour Party forced him into a position whereby the Government had to take unwise economic decisions.</P>

      <P>One of the saddest legacies of that era was the number of young people forced to emigrate as a consequence of that gross mismanagement. I have said before that there should be some provision whereby when politicians of whatever hue make decisions for blatant perceived political advantage to the absolute disadvantage of the people, they should be brought to account and should not be allowed to serve in any future Administration or in either House.</P>

      <P>Through prudent fiscal and economic management we have now reached a situation undreamt of 20 years ago, and certainly undreamt of by the founding fathers of the State, where average income and GDP are well above the EU average and greater than that of our neighbour, who colonised the country for 700 years. That is a fantastic achievement and it <Col N="1163" />would be an unforgivable sin if it was squandered through mismanagement.</P>
      <P>In looking at the moneys which have been spent, it is worth highlighting some issues. This year the Minister is presiding over a budget in excess of &euro;40 billion. This is a significant increase on any previous budget and is up 5% on last year's budget. Two-thirds of that budget is targeted at areas of need, including health, education and social welfare. In 2000 we spent &euro;6.7 billion on social welfare. This will increase to &euro;10.65 billion next year and that is before the application of any increases which will emerge on budget day. That sum is well in excess of what was available previously. These increases must be viewed against a background of significantly high unemployment in 1997 of 10.5%, now reduced to 4.4%. As a result, there is buoyancy in the figures which allows the additional moneys to be targeted elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Some people referred to old age pensioners. Fianna Fáil came into power in 1997 after the first ever Labour Party Minister for Finance of the previous Administration had succeeded in giving a derisory increase of about &euro;2 to old age pensioners. The Government is now committed to increasing the old age pension to &euro;200 per week. Since 1997, child benefit has increased by 230%, from &euro;38 per month to &euro;125 per month.</P>
      <P>During the last election I called to the house of an old lady in a Labour Party heartland. She told me that one of the Opposition candidates came to her confidently expecting her vote. She told him or her &ndash; I understand it was either Deputy Howlin or Ms Avril Doyle MEP &ndash; apologetically that she had a free television licence, free travel and her old age pension was in excess of &euro;100 per week.</P>

    <P>I had intended dealing with individual items but as the Chair will not give me any injury time for the heckling that has taken place I will not. There is an onus on any good Minister to review areas of expenditure on particular items. Undoubtedly, there will be some tweaking of these and further targeting to ensure that those most in need benefit. This Administration has <Col N="1164" />been tremendously successful in doing that. When I see the Opposition quoting <i>The Irish Times</i> as a paragon of either republican or socialist thinking, I must smile as it means that the argument is already well won.</P>
    <P>The significant increases needed in the areas of health, education and social welfare are a priority for the Government, as evidenced by expenditure to date and by the projections for the future. Senator Norris commented that the Government protects wealthy people. That is totally debunked when one looks at the record of the former Labour Party Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn. A number of schemes during his time as Minister sheltered high income earners from paying the right proportion of tax. Those schemes are coming to an end in 2004 through the work of the same Minister against whom Senator Norris has made other accusations.</P>
    <P>I regret not being in the Labour Party because if I was we could have our own printing machines and could produce money without having to go to the taxpayers. Unfortunately, the Labour Party can expound that philosophy because of its leader and its background.</P>

Senator Walsh would be proud of some of them but I do not believe he would be too proud of the logo I could attach to the party this evening &ndash;&ldquo;the feel and fall party, FF&rdquo;.

      <P>Fianna Fáil always pretended that it looked after the youth of our country. That pretence is now seen as a lie on the part of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. The crèche supplement for child care has been discontinued. This is a severe attack on working class mothers and poorer children in our society. It is a shame and a disgrace that this is being done by the two parties that pretended they always looked after the least well-off in society. They have now let them down in a very big way.</P>
      <P>The Government is suggesting that disability and unemployment benefits will be done away with entirely. Local authorities throughout the country are cash starved. Funding for disabled persons and essential repairs grants ran out in most local authorities last September. There is no special aid for elderly people in the budgets of the health boards. My health board has been forced to cut essential services in some of the hospitals in the region. However, the Midland Health Board is not the only one facing these difficulties; others are also feeling the effects of the cutbacks. Senator Jim Walsh is not listening to the people and that was evident in his contribution earlier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is evident that he is not listening to the people because charitable organisations and others described the Government cutbacks in the Book of Estimates as mean, lousy, cheap and miserable. Stealth taxes have been brought in by the Government, including higher rates and rents and several other charges. People are protesting on the streets of our capital on a daily basis about unfair charges introduced by the Government. There has been a significant cutback in the number of medical cards, even though the Government parties made many promises in that regard in the run up to the last general election. This is putting a huge strain on the health service because the Government introduced policies for <Col N="1166" />which it did not budget. This is evident in the Book of Estimates.</P>
      <P>In last year's budget, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, slashed every area of social welfare and abolished the first-time buyer's grant. In the run up to the last general election &ndash; Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats need to be reminded &ndash; he said there would be no cutbacks, hidden or otherwise. This was the lie of the decade when we saw the Books of Estimates for 2003 and 2004. Lies buy votes, but they do not give young people houses and elderly people services.</P>

      <P>Spending is up by &euro;6.5 billion since 1997, when Deputy Ruairí Quinn and the boys left office. They need to ask how high health is on our priority list.

      <P>The level of resources which are allocated under the Abridged Estimate of 2004 to social welfare is a significant part of overall total Government spending and demonstrates this Government's continuing commitment to protecting the position of people who are less well off in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the Abridged Estimates announced by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, my Department has received its highest allocation ever, which will bring social welfare spending in 2004 to a total of &euro;10.65 billion. This shows an increase of &euro;355.5 million on 2003. Compared to 2001 the total amount committed has risen by &euro;2.8 billion or 36%. I stress, however, that the <Col N="1170" />Abridged Estimates do not include any additional expenditure which will be announced in the forthcoming December budget.</P>
    <P>Social welfare expenditure this year is almost double the level set by Labour and Fine Gael when last in Government. This unprecedented level of investment is all the more outstanding when it is considered that the level of unemployment has been cut by over half since Fianna Fáil took office.</P>
    <P>When one considers that &euro;10.65 billion is being spent on social welfare after a reduction in unemployment rates from 10.3% in 1997 to 4.4% today, we can see that there has been a significant improvement in real terms in the level of social welfare provision. I am pleased to have secured an increase in the social welfare Estimate for the coming year even before account is taken of budgetary increases. This underlines this Government's commitment to the elderly, our children, those less well off, those who are sick, unable or incapable of caring for themselves and those who find themselves unemployed.</P>
    <P>The Government is profoundly aware of the fact that many sectors of our society still need substantial assistance if they are to benefit from the major improvements in our economy and society in recent years. In Government, we have implemented the largest series of social welfare and child benefit increases in the history of this country. Because of our prudent management of the finances, and in turn the constant review and updating of social welfare schemes in line with my duty of care to ensure that limited resources are spent on those most in need next year, there will be record spending on health, education and social welfare. In fact, two thirds of total Government spending next year will go on these three areas of social spending. Never before has so much money been allocated to these three areas and never before has a Government put such an emphasis on the social agenda. Furthermore, this Government has made significant commitments under Sustaining Progress on the lowest rates of social welfare as well as commitments to pensioners and carers.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has indicated the economic and financial circumstances in which decisions on the Estimates were made. He has pointed out that the decisions made by Government in framing the 2004 Estimates are directed towards ensuring that we create the conditions necessary for our economy to be strongly positioned to benefit from the expected international upturn, to maintain and create employment and to increase the share of wealth in the country. Accordingly, the 2004 Estimates have been framed to stay within the overall spending guidelines agreed by the Government. This has had some impact on areas of social welfare spending where some spending pressures have arisen such as a substantial increase in claimants for child benefit payments, increased utility prices on the free schemes and an increase of almost 10% in the number of people claiming rent supplement <Col N="1171" />payments. The number in receipt of rent supplement has increased to 60,000 people and the scheme now costs almost &euro;330 million per year. It is important that we act now to ensure these pressures are addressed so as to ensure we can secure prosperity for all into the future.</P>
    <P>We are not, however, seeking growth for its own sake. It is important that spending on social inclusion addresses the needs of those who are least likely to benefit from economic growth. Significant commitments have been made in these areas and we will seek to progress them in the context of the budget.</P>
    <P>An estimated 970,000 people on average are expected to claim weekly social welfare payments next year and almost 1.5 million people, including dependants, will benefit from these payments. Compared to 1997, when this Government came into office, total social welfare expenditure will have almost doubled. During the same period, unemployment has dramatically declined to 4.4%. This has enabled substantial improvements to be made, not alone in the rates of social welfare payments but also in the conditions for entitlement to these services.</P>
    <P>The spending pressures I identified earlier have emphasised the requirement that my Department ensures prudent management of the social welfare budget with a view to making sure the resources are best focused at the areas of greatest need. In two areas of social welfare spending we made commitments to our older people and to our children. All of our budgets have been characterised by pension measures designed to improve the position of older people in our society. Year on year, we have increased the pension. Today our record points to a duty of care.</P>
    <P>With Fianna Fáil in Government, the rate of old age pension increased by 59%. Under the rainbow Government increases of less than 10% were granted and we can all remember the derisory £1.80 pension increase given to pensioners during its term of office.</P>
    <P>In our period of office we have more than trebled the rates of child benefit. One can remember the commitment of the rainbow coalition to our children. When we came into office we made children a priority, increasing the then paltry rate of &euro;38.09 a month for the first child to &euro;125.60.</P>
    <P>Over the course of the past year, a number of spending items have been reviewed and areas of potential savings identified to ensure sound management of public funds. I stress that the savings which have been found are being recycled back into the total allocation provided to my Department as a result of the budget and the Estimates processes to ensure I am in a position to care for those less well off, disadvantaged, ill or unemployed by providing pensions, unemployment assistance and other social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>I have announced a number of measures to ensure social welfare spending is best targeted at those in greatest need. For the most part, the <Col N="1172" />measures will not affect existing claimants but will be introduced for new claimants from various starting points in 2004. Furthermore, many of the measures impact only on those households where there are already earnings from employment or where there is another social welfare payment.</P>
    <P>The substance of the Opposition motion focuses on a number of the measures I announced last week. To take the motion on face value one might think the total amount of resources committed to social welfare has fallen. As I have noted, even before allowance is made for budgetary increases, this is far from the case. Instead I have received an increased allocation of &euro;355.5 million.</P>
    <P>The motion seems to imply that no scheme within the social welfare programme should be reviewed to see if it still meets the purpose for which it was established. All of the measures which were announced can be justified on their own terms. Circumstances change and Government objectives are updated and modernised. Cut-off points for the purpose of calculation of benefit, which were set at one time, need to be updated.</P>
    <P>I will deal first with the change to the back to education allowance. The qualifying period for the BTEA will be increased from six months to 15 months in respect of the third level option The original period was set at a time when unemployment was considerably higher. Since then, unemployment has fallen dramatically. Furthermore, the Government has introduced the employment action plan which offers job placement or other supports for those who find it difficult to be placed in employment. Until now, with an intervention point for both second and third level at six months, the measure was not particularly well targeted at labour market disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The policy measure which was announced now focuses available resources at those in greatest need for an intervention to prevent them from drifting into long-term unemployment and does not affect existing recipients of BTEA. This measure still allows people to avail of the second level option after six months in receipt of a payment. This effectively recognises the more urgent need for an intervention in the case of people who have not completed secondary education.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, payment of a weekly or monthly supplement may be made in respect of rent to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation needs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. There are currently 59,367 rent supplements in payment. Expenditure this year is expected to be over &euro;330 million, an increase of approximately &euro;76 million, or 30%, on the &euro;254 million spent in 2002.</P>
    <P>In this context, a number of measures in respect of the SWA rent supplement scheme will be implemented. These include: an increase in the rate of the minimum contribution to be made by the recipient, from &euro;12 to &euro;13 per week, in order <Col N="1173" />to maintain the rate of the minimum contribution at approximately 10% of the basic personal rate of SWA; in future, if one member of a couple is in full-time employment, both will be excluded from claiming rent-mortgage supplement, a measure which will give effect to the original intention that SWA should not be paid in cases where there is full-time employment in a household; and health boards will be given the power to refuse rent supplement in cases where the applicant has not already been renting for a period of six months, with provisions for exceptions to the homeless, people who are at risk of becoming homeless and other vulnerable individuals.</P>
    <P>The purpose of SWA rent supplement, like other social welfare programmes, is to meet income maintenance needs, not long-term housing needs. This measure is needed to refocus the scheme on income maintenance such as existing tenants who become unemployed and can no longer afford to pay their rent. For the most part, health boards decide whether an applicant for the rent supplement is in need of accommodation without reference to the local authority. In future, claimants for rent supplement will be referred to the local authority for an assessment of housing need in a more systematic manner. This measure will lead to an increased role for local authorities in this area. In addition, ways of improving the service given to people with long-term housing needs are currently under discussion with local authorities. Furthermore, rent supplement will no longer be paid to people who refuse offers of local authority accommodation or to those who leave such accommodation without reasonable cause.</P>
    <P>Particular care will be taken to ensure that the interests of vulnerable groups, such as the homeless, the elderly and people with disabilities, are fully protected in the course of implementing the various SWA measures. Health boards will retain the discretion to make exceptions in individual cases. I emphasise that people who have particular problems and difficulties will be cared for and that no one will be made homeless because of these measures.</P>

      <P>I announced the discontinuation of a supplement within the SWA scheme which was specially designated as a crèche sup<Col N="1174" />plement. The reason for this is that, as a result of State expenditure on crèche care and the tripling of child benefit payments since 1997, the need for the crèche supplement has been considerably reduced. In any event, this supplement was not applied uniformly across the various health boards and, in some cases, was being paid on a basis not originally intended when it was established. Claimants who have short-term need for crèche care as a result of family or personal circumstances will be accommodated through SWA exceptional needs payments, thereby ensuring that the original purpose of the crèche supplement is protected within the SWA system.</P>
      <P>I also announced a number of measures that are being taken which will remove anomalies or better target resources paid from the social insurance fund, particularly those affecting short-term benefits such as unemployment and disability benefits. Changes in items such as the number of contributions required for access to benefits and pensions are a normal feature of social insurance systems. It should be noted that the Social Welfare Act 1997, introduced by the then Minister, Proinsias De Rossa, made provision for increasing the number of paid contributions required in the years ahead for entitlement to old age and retirement pensions. In addition, it makes considerable sense to take action to change the conditions underlying some schemes so as to deal with any anomalies or inefficiencies at an early stage. Some of the measures which were identified in the original motion fall into this category and I will now outline them.</P>
      <P>The social welfare system seeks to provide income support in circumstances where persons cannot secure an income because of various contingencies such as illness or disability. While the flat rate payment structure does not seek to replace all income lost, it does, in general, try to avoid a situation where the payment is higher than the income that it is supposed to replace. When part-time workers were brought into the social insurance system in the early 1990s, it was necessary to introduce a number of reduced or graduated payment rates which would more closely relate the amount paid with the earnings that were lost.</P>
      <P>Over time, with the increase in the main payment rates, the amount paid in DB and UB are now considerably in excess of the earnings to which they relate. In effect, the current thresholds have not been updated since 1993 and, consequently, represent a serious disincentive to employment. This makes no sense and, as a result, the current weekly earnings threshold for the purposes of payment of reduced rates of DB and UB are being increased from &euro;88.88 to &euro;150.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The maximum duration of unemployment benefit will be reduced from 390 days to 312 days where a person has less than 260 PRSI contributions paid since first entering employment. This measure recognises a longer, sustained employment record by more favourable treatment in terms of subsequent entitlements. Fur<Col N="1175" />thermore, it brings the contribution condition in line with that of DB in respect of an entitlement to a benefit extending over 12 months. This measure provides for a sound balance between the need for adequate protection against unemployment and protection of the position of the social insurance fund.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the circumstances around which the forthcoming budget will be drawn up are significantly less promising than those of earlier years. However, the Government has committed itself to ensuring that social progress continues to be made side by side with economic progress. It is ploughing enormous resources into supporting, caring for and nurturing those less well off, those unemployed, the sick, older people and our children.</P>

      <P>This week I attended the launch, by the Minister for Health and Children, of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency's strategy. The first five recommendations of the strategy are totally ignored and denigrated by the various actions that are being taken in the Book of Estimates. A considerable amount of money has been given to the Crisis Pregnancy Agency in order to reduce the level of crisis pregnancies. The first of the five recommendations, in response to a question on how the strategy will reduce the number of women with crisis pregnancies who opt for abortion, states that the agency will work to provide better supports for lone parents. This will certainly not be included in the proposals brought forward by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second recommendation is &ldquo;to inform policy makers and key decision makers about critical issues.&rdquo; The agency has given us a booklet and, therefore, I presume we are expected to read it so that we will implement what it considers the <Col N="1176" />best policies. The third aim is &ldquo;to work with our partners to improve the availability of low cost child care&rdquo; but the crèche allowance has been abolished. The fourth aim is &ldquo;to work with our partners to improve income supports for lone parents.&rdquo; This has been severely affected by many of the measures introduced by the Minister. The final aim is &ldquo;to work with our partners to make it easier for lone parents to stay in education, training and employment&rdquo;, yet the back to education allowance has been decimated.</P>
    <P>I have been a great supporter of the allowance because many lone parents are poorly educated. For example, 10% have a third level education, 18% have a higher secondary education, 25% have a lower secondary education and 47% have only a primary education. The back to education allowance for secondary level has been abolished and it has been severely depleted for those wishing to attend third level colleges. However, the scheme has been a major success because the only way to remove people from the poverty trap is to enable them to attain a better education so that they can subsequently take up employment. This cutback will have a significant impact, unfortunately, on the number of women who may decide to have abortions.</P>
    <P>The supplementary welfare allowance and rent supplement will be reduced. One must rent an apartment outside one's home for six months prior to consideration for the rent supplement. However, pregnancies can occur unexpectedly and people may be thrown out of the family home. How are they supposed to rent? The community welfare officer will exercise discretion but one agency will work against the other on this issue. I sometimes wonder whether there is co-ordination and co-operation between the various agencies producing reports and implementing policy. This is not the first time I have complained about this. Last week I referred to the recommendations made by Maureen Gaffney on social capital.</P>
    <P>The crèche allowance will be abolished. How will women who wish to return to the education system or to the workplace manage, given the cost of child care is a serious problem? I could go on about various issues. The Minister will have read the strategic summary published by the Crisis Pregnancy Agency but its first set of recommendations has been totally ignored. I find the situation appalling.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire. Bhí díospóireacht shuimiúil againn agus gabhaim buíochas do gach éinne ar achan taobh den Teach a ghlac páirt inti.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government Members made much of the total budget dedicated to social welfare because it amounts to &euro;10 billion, which is a great deal of money. The social welfare budget has increased substantially during the economic boom. However, it is not difficult to turn that argument on its head because it begs us to ask why it is necessary to make cuts amounting to only &euro;58 <Col N="1177" />million, if we take the Department's Estimate seriously. Despite the availability of a significant budget to the Department, it institutes small, petty but, nonetheless, painful cuts, which will save only &euro;58 million, because it was instructed to do so by the Department of Finance. The Department of Finance sent a letter to the Department of Social and Family Affairs in June or July pointing out that cuts must be made totalling &euro;100 million, for example, and a few months later the Department responded saying it had found &euro;58 million in cutbacks and asked the Department of Finance if it would accept that. The Minister for Finance then begrudgingly said &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These cuts have not stood up in this debate or previously. There is no need for them, as they account for little in terms of the national finances, but they are painful and difficult for those on the receiving end. Those who depend on the dietary allowance, rent supplement or other supplementary welfare provisions will feel the cutbacks badly but this is tiddlywinks to the Department for Finance. There is a serious onus on the Minister for Finance to come into both Houses and stand up the necessity for these cutbacks.</P>
    <P>The cutback in rent allowance, for which one can only qualify after six months, has correctly attracted most attention. This means people who are forced to leave the family home because of family or marital breakdown, overcrowding or a crisis pregnancy are no longer entitled to rent allowance as of right. The Minister may say the Department is not a housing agency and that the total number of people claiming rent allowance at 59,000 is too high because it was never intended to be widely used. Perhaps the Department is not a housing agency but, as the Minister pointed out in her contribution, the allowance was introduced to assist people who did not have an alternative and who needed the supplement to remain in rented accommodation. The bottom line is there is no alternative for a significant number of people. Those people, who are being told by the Minister that she will no longer look after them, do not have an alternative. Some will become homeless but more will remain in accommodation which is wholly inappropriate and unsuitable. They will reside in overcrowded accommodation with their parents or they will end up trespassing on the goodwill of others.</P>
    <P>The BTWA cutback is minor and will not result in much of a saving. However, it ignores the current state of the labour market. Significant changes have taken place in recent years and the Minister has pointed to a number. Ireland does not have the reservoir of well educated people it had four or five years ago whom multinationals want to employ. Everybody needs to be encouraged to continue in third level education or, if <Col N="1178" />they are unemployed, to re-enter third level education so they can take up jobs and the State can continue to attract foreign direct investment, which has been essential to its economic growth in recent years. There is no good or logical reason the cutback proposed by the Minister should be implemented. She referred to &ldquo;retargeting at second level.&rdquo; The incentive exists to take up second level education. There is no retargeting involved as she is making it more difficult to receive an allowance to take up third level education. There is no justification for this in current circumstances as little money will be saved and it does not make sense.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry referred to lone parents. All surveys conducted on poverty in Ireland point out conclusively that lone parents are the most likely to fall into the poverty trap. The agreed approach of all parties in recent years has been to encourage lone parents who want to take up employment. While the effect of the cutbacks overall is marginal, lone parents will be discouraged from entering the workplace. The crèche allowance will have an effect on certain people, as it enables people who need to take up employment quickly to do so.</P>
    <P>The measures proposed by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment regarding community employment will undoubtedly have a severe effect on lone parents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no cutback in numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>However, there will be changes in eligibility which will primarily affect lone parents. The Minister has repeated serious commitments made by the Government to increase the old age pension to &euro;200 per week and the lowest rate of social welfare to &euro;180 per week in a few years. Her predecessor made no tangible progress last year in that regard.</P>
      <P>It will be interesting to see whether some progress will be made in the forthcoming budget. We will keep a close watch for announcements by the Minister and her colleagues within the next few weeks. Increases in social welfare benefits and allowances which simply cover the rate of inflation do not go anywhere near meeting the targets which the Minister has so happily repeated in the House this evening.</P>
      <P>I am pleased with the support our motion has received on this side of the House. Senators on the other side must, in their hearts, be asking, &ldquo;why is our Government doing that when we do not need to do it?&rdquo; The bottom line is that the so-called need for the present cuts has not been justified, either in this debate or elsewhere, because it cannot and will not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, <Col N="1181" />for coming to the House. The need to retain and maximise the use of Loughan House, Blacklion, County Cavan, as a prison and place of detention is of the utmost importance. Loughan House is situated in Blacklion, County Cavan, on the borders of Counties Cavan, Fermanagh and Leitrim. This area has suffered mass emigration, depopulation and was badly affected by the troubles in Northern Ireland. In view of this, I seek clarification from the Minister on the future of Loughan House.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated last week that if the Prison Officers Association does not accept his proposals to reduce the prison officers' overtime bill, he will press ahead with his own plans. Under these plans, two prisons, Loughan House, County Cavan, and Shelton Abbey, County Wicklow, will be run by an outside agency. This has caused alarm in west County Cavan and surrounding counties due to the perceived threat to Loughan House Prison.</P>
      <P>Loughan House is a small prison with accommodation for 85 inmates. It is the most cost effective prison in the country. The approximate cost of maintaining a prisoner amounts to &euro;63,000 per annum, which contrasts with a cost of &euro;207,000 per prisoner at Portlaoise Prison. Why is one of the most effective prisons in the country in terms of cost as well as training now under threat? It does not make economic or social sense.</P>
      <P>A large number of families in the area depend on Loughan House Prison. They contribute greatly to the community as the majority of the prison staff live locally. This community is not in a position to lose more people. From speaking to staff and their families, I know that they are fully committed to the community. Many have been there for over 20 years. If these proposals are implemented, they, and their families, will be forced to move to other parts of the country. The desire of the staff and their families is to stay in west County Cavan. The staff are committed to the prison and to their local community. They want to see Loughan House remain as a prison and detention centre and retain its current status. It would be a catastrophe for the small local community if these officers were forced to move to other prisons. Local schools, churches, sports and community groups would find themselves with great facilities but no people to utilise them.</P>
      <P>Loughan House Prison has an education centre under the auspices of County Cavan Vocational Education Committee where a dedicated, highly-skilled staff give of themselves positively to their pupils, the inmates. Many of those who have availed of the education services have achieved FETAC and ECDL awards, despite having little or no education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the current proposals, staff will not lose their jobs, but would be transferred to other prisons. For Members from Dublin, this may seem like no big deal. For example, a prison officer transferred from Arbour Hill to Mountjoy Prison would not have to move house, let alone from one community to another. However, in County <Col N="1182" />Cavan, prison officers would be moved to Castlerea, County Roscommon, or further. A move to Castlerea Prison would entail a 140 mile round trip for prison officers who have settled with their families in the area around Blacklion.</P>
    <P>At a time when we are putting record amounts of money into communities to build sports facilities, etc. it would be crazy to even consider such a proposal. Rural communities, especially those along the Border, need to be built up. Transferring prison officers and their families from these communities would be another nail in the coffin for rural towns and villages. I have visited Loughan House on a number of occasions with my colleague Deputy Brendan Smith and local councillor Eddie Feeley. The upgrading of facilities in the past decade has greatly improved the prison. It is my hope and that of the people of west Cavan that Loughan House will remain a place of detention.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will get time in the very near future to visit the prison and see the good work that goes on there. I again thank the Minister for coming to the House to take this Adjournment matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. M. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue raised by Senator Wilson is extremely important and I am grateful to him for giving me the opportunity to address this House on it.</P>
      <P>One way or another, Loughan House will continue to provide facilities equivalent to those provided for prisoners today. Whereas Senator Wilson has quite properly said that nobody will lose their job, he is worried about the implications of transferring some prison officers to other institutions. If this comes to pass, other people in the locality will be employed to keep Loughan House going. It will continue to be an institution providing equivalent facilities to those provided at the moment while it is part of the Irish Prison Service.</P>
      <P>I have no desire to take the running of Loughan House or Shelton Abbey out of the control of the Irish Prison Service or to close or mothball any prison. I am very well aware of the good work being done at Loughan House and the other three institutions mentioned in the Government decision of 11 November. I want that good work to go on and to be enhanced in the coming years by making available funds for education, vocational training and offending behaviour programmes which is currently going to feed prison overtime payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome and appreciate all the positive contributions of Members of both Houses in recent days in recognising the positive work being done by staff at Loughan House, Shelton Abbey, Fort Mitchel and the Curragh. I share their appreciation of the considerable efforts of individual staff members of these institutions. However, at the same time I can no longer hold back the change process required to deliver a more efficient and cost effective prison service at a time <Col N="1183" />when there is increased pressure on taxpayers, the economy and the public purse.</P>
    <P>My preference is for an agreed way forward which is beneficial to both management and staff. The proposal put forward by management not only included fully operational prison service institutions at Fort Mitchel, the Curragh and Loughan House, but included a prison service-run centralised escort corps.</P>
    <P>The annualised bonus proposal put by the Irish Prison Service to the Prison Officers Association presents an opportunity for staff to move from a culture of working as many hours as possible to a system where the emphasis would be on working less hours and working smartly for guaranteed and consistent levels of income, which by any standard in the public sector would be extremely attractive. Under the management proposal, a typical basic grade prison officer with ten years service would earn approximately &euro;54,000 per annum and an officer in this rank with 13 years service would earn approximately &euro;58,000 per annum, excluding the increases due under the terms of Sustaining Progress and benchmarking. These figures also exclude the sum on offer to officers of &euro;12,250 spread over the next three years as this is a non-recurring payment.</P>
    <P>There is still a window of opportunity for the POA to come back to the negotiating table and adopt a more realistic approach to the discussions with a view to reaching a mutually acceptable solution. However, time is fast running out and if the Prison Officers Association is unwilling to agree reasonable terms for the operation of prisons on an economically sustainable basis before 1 January I will have no option but to proceed with the decisions approved by Government. The responsibility for the choice, which must be made, rests entirely with the association.</P>
    <P>There is a context within which the Government decision of 11 November on the future of the prison service was made. The discussions, which have taken place between the Prison Officers Association and the Irish Prison Service for more than two years and prior to that for more than five years, have been the subject of numerous questions in the Dáil and I have consistently given very comprehensive information about the progress or lack of it in those discussions.</P>
    <P>The present impasse in the discussions with the POA has been reached despite the best efforts of the management negotiation team and the assistance of two eminent facilitators, Mr. Billy Attley and Mr. Joe McGovern. It was the intractable nature of that impasse that led me to seek Government approval for the decisive measures announced last week in order to control the escalating cost of the prison service.</P>
    <P>The Prison Officers Association has presented a set of counter-proposals, which is very far removed from reality. It completely ignores the key issue which has been at the heart of the discussions to date, namely the elimination of over<Col N="1184" />time working. It also ignores the concept of annualised hours, which curiously both sides had already agreed was the best way forward. Essentially the POA proposal is a claim for an increase in pay in return for co-operation with selected elements of the management proposal. The POA knows, as does every other public service trade union, that an increase in pay is simply not on under the terms of Sustaining Progress and benchmarking, and cannot be negotiated by me.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the POA submission are, by and large, taken from the management proposal and could, if taken in isolation, be introduced in line with the modernisation and efficiency commitments of Sustaining Progress. They were included in the management package in the context of an overall change programme. It could be legitimately argued that some have been bought and paid for in previous national agreements.</P>
    <P>The decisions taken by the Government in relation to the future of the prison service have not been taken lightly. Failing agreement with the POA they will be implemented from 1 January because the Irish Prison Service cannot continue to spend public money to feed an overtime culture, which has gone virtually out of control and is sustaining outdated and inefficient work practices.</P>
    <P>The Prison Officers Association must choose between delivering an agreement on a package of efficient work practices in all our prisons and places of detention, including Loughan House, or implementation of the measures agreed by Government, which would include the running of Loughan House by a body other than the Irish Prison Service. Prison staff have it in their power to save these institutions. However, they must make a choice and return to negotiations on the basis of the approach developed in consultation with their representatives over recent years. No one should underestimate the Government's determination that this matter must be addressed urgently because from next year the money simply will not be available. The end has come for the existing overtime culture.</P>
    <P>A window of opportunity still exists for the POA to come back to the negotiating table. In that regard I will be meeting with the POA tomorrow afternoon to discuss a possible restart of negotiations on the basis of the official side's proposals.</P>

    <P>Fenor national school in County Waterford is awaiting sanction for a resource and learning support room to be built. Planning permission and all the relevant documentation, plans, drawings etc. are in place and the project went out to tender on 19 September 2002. A verbal commitment was given by the Department that the new room would be built, commencing December 2002. <Col N="1185" />This obviously has not happened and the board of management cannot understand why this small project was not even on the schools building programme for 2003.</P>
    <P>When the learning support and resource teachers are in the school at the same time, children have to be taught on the corridor. The learning support room they are using is a small storeroom measuring 8 ft. by 4.5 ft., which is totally inadequate. This leads to another problem in that they have no storeroom to use, no principal's office, no parents' room etc. However, their main priority is a new learning support and resources room. A number of small pilot project were announced last year for jobs like this and I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure that sanction is given for a similar project so that the children of this school get fair play and are treated in a proper manner. It is an excellent school and there is a strong community spirit in Fenor.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Senator has given me the opportunity to outline to the House on behalf of the Department of Education and Science the current position regarding the provision of a learning-resource room at Fenor national school, County Waterford. The 2003 capital programme was published earlier this year and full details on individual projects are available on the Department's website.</P>
      <P>The programme is designed to give the maximum amount of information to managers, boards of management, principals, parents and students. The criteria used for selecting projects was also published for the first time. This year's building programme amounts to &euro;342.9 million, four times the amount allocated in 1997. The 2003 programme will deliver over 140 large-scale projects at primary and post-primary level. In addition, over 400 schools will benefit in some way from the capital programme, while all primary schools benefit directly from the devolved grants scheme for minor works.</P>
      <P>Fenor national school currently has accommodation available in the form of a general purpose room, which can be used for resource-learning support purposes, but given current financial commitments, the Department of Education and Science was unable to provide temporary or permanent accommodation there in 2003. The Minister for Education and Science intends to publish details of the 2004 school building programme by early January at the latest. The programme will clarify the progress planned for projects such as Fenor national school during 2004. I again thank the Senator for the opportunity to outline to the House the current position on the proposed project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. On 1 October 2003, the Western Health Board decided to discontinue and close the residential drug addiction and alcoholic centre associated with St. Brigid's Hospital in Ballin<Col N="1186" />asloe. This service was established as far back as 1982. Since then it has served the wider catchment area of the eastern portion of the Western Health Board, in east Galway and adjoining areas. The health board's decision came as a severe blow to the many people who had worked there and built up the service as well as to the patients who had benefited enormously over the years and who had been rehabilitated through the centre's professionalism. Given that St. Brigid's Hospital is currently being replaced and is expected to be sold, probably in the near future, I ask that the Department provide funding from the resources made available following the sale of the hospital and its adjoining property to construct a purpose-built unit adjacent to or within the complex of Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe. This will provide a continuation of services.</P>
      <P>It is unfair that those who are piloting the project and insisting on the closure of the facility at St. Brigid's Hospital have misrepresented the situation. Mistruths have emanated from them with regard to the intake of the in-patient service at the centre. It is not true to say there have been no referrals there for the last couple of months, with the result that there is no need for an in-patient service. That is unfair to those who have worked at the centre. The figures for the period 1 October 2001 to 30 September 2002 show a total intake of 92 people, 58 male and 34 female. Some 70 were first referrals, 46 male and 24 female.</P>
      <P>Some would argue that the best approach is to use a community service on an out-patient basis because of the numbers of counsellors and other support staff that would be available in the community at large, in Portumna, Loughrea, Mountbellew and the surrounding areas as well as in Ballinasloe. However, out-patient care does not always suit everyone who may wish to avail of the professional services on offer. In-patient care is far more appropriate because of the particular background, family circumstances and a range of other social and economic factors that might be pressing on a particular patient. The model at this centre over the years is similar the one currently available in St. John of God's and the Rutland Centre.</P>
      <P>If the service continues to remain closed many people will be forced into private accommodation which they cannot afford. The centre at Ballinasloe was unique in that it catered for people from a wide variety of backgrounds, including those with a high academic achievement as well as the more socially disadvantaged. Many private institutions would not necessarily have such a mix.</P>
      <P>The closure of the facility came as a shock to those who had benefited from the centre and who found they now had to avail of the community service. Many of those who were in-patients have abandoned the service, which is regrettable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important for the Minister of State to refer to the reports. One is a position paper on substance abuse from the east Galway mental health service. It was compiled by professionals working at the coalface who knew not only their patients but how they should be treated. They say there are many and varied reasons why a community <Col N="1187" />treatment programme is not appropriate for some individuals. The literature and the various policy documents are loud in acknowledging this. The report, Planning for the Future, recommends that in addition to a fully developed comprehensive community treatment programme, beds should be provided per sector for in-patient treatment for those suffering from substance abuse. It states: &ldquo;Accordingly, we strongly recommend, as we are only at the embryonic stage of a comprehensive community programme, the continued provision of our existing nine-bedded in-service programme in Ballinasloe.&rdquo; These nine beds are, according to Planning for the Future, a minimum requirement. According to the second guideline of Planning for the Future, the service should have access to two to three beds for clients unable to attend out-patient services or who, perhaps, live long distances away as well as for social reasons.</P>
    <P>The national drugs strategy states that services should be organised on the basis of overseeing the development of comprehensive, residential treatment models incorporating detox, intervention, pre-treatment counselling, motivational work, therapeutic treatment and rehabilitation. All the reports at the disposal of the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, clearly and distinctly outline the need for the retention of this service that was established on a pilot scheme in 1982. Since then, it has been of tremendous benefit to many people. It is important that the Minister of State indicates the provision of funding for the re-establishment of this service on a residential basis in the Portiuncula Hospital complex.

      <P>The Act necessitates the separation of services. It will no longer be possible for patients with alcohol problems to be referred to a psychiatric institution. It is important that alcoholism is recognised as a disease that should be treated in the context of general health rather then psychiatric services. On behalf of those people who have worked in the service for so long, I look forward to hearing the Minister of State indicate his intention to adequately resource and finance a residential service in Ballinasloe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Ulick Burke for raising this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>National policy on the treatment of alcohol abuse stipulates that the emphasis in the management of alcohol related problems should be on community-based intervention rather than on specialist in-patient treatment. Health boards already provide and continue to develop a range of comprehensive community-based support services appropriate to the needs of persons affected by alcohol abuse. These services include family support and community, medical and social services in the management of the problem. Health <Col N="1188" />boards are also considering ways in which services provided by voluntary and-or private facilities might integrate with the health boards' services. A number of boards have made local arrangements to enable access to specialist in-patient treatment in the small number of cases where the need arises.</P>
    <P>The main therapeutic tools in the treatment of alcohol dependence are psychotherapy, counselling, family and marital therapy, either individually or in group settings. As alcohol related problems occur, in many instances, in local and family settings, the community-based response can be direct and early, thereby reducing the associated levels of physical, psychological and social problems. Research supports this model of delivery as being just as effective as in-patient treatment.</P>
    <P>Against this background, the alcohol treatment unit at St. Brigid's Hospital, Ballinasloe, County Galway, officially ceased operation as a residential unit on 1 October 2003. The closure of the alcohol treatment unit has taken place in the context of the Western Health Board's overall development strategy for the modernisation and enhancement of addiction services in the region. The lack of referrals to the residential addiction unit over recent months was also a factor in the decision to reorganise the service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD" hpid="Mr. T. O'Malley Mr. T. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision to cease residential services was taken after widespread consultation with stakeholders through the forum of the east Galway future shape group. This decision represents an improvement in the addiction services of the Western Health Board as there are now 11 addiction counsellors in the east Galway service where heretofore there were three. The expanded service provided is locally based to the people in the following towns and regions: Ballinasloe-Mountbellew, Gort-Portumna, Tuam-Headford and Loughrea-Athenry.</P>
      <P>People who present to locally-based services with addictions are assessed and a variety of treatment options offered. Where it is clinically determined that a person requires residential treatment for his or her alcohol problems, suitable arrangements will be made and funded by the Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the emotion within the community that the closure of the unit has generated. I also understand that there has been some misinformation. I am assured that the Western Health Board&mdash;</P>
