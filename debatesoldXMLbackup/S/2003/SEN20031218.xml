    <P>An Cathaoirleach: I have received notice from Senator Kitt that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to approve funding for improvement works to Brierfield national school, Tuam, County Galway, Roll No. 14294W.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to grant more visas to legitimate language schools, speed up the applications process and to take action on those schools which are abusing the work-study system.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Tuffy of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to give an update regarding the urgent need for a sports hall for Palmerstown community school and the community of Palmerstown. This sports hall was scheduled by the Department of Education and Science to be built by 2001 as part of an initiative involving the Departments of Community and Social Affairs and the Taoiseach, as part of a programme to develop community sports facilities in drugs task force areas. Will the Minister outline the schedule for building the sports hall under the recently announced schools building programme?</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    </P>
    <P>Ms O'Rourke: The Order of Business is No. 1, a motion, without debate, referred to the Joint <Col N="2094" />Committee on Agriculture and Food, which has completed its deliberations, concerning the reduction in the disease levies applied to milk deliveries for processing and cattle slaughtered or exported to facilitate the eradication of TB and brucellosis in cattle. The rates have been reviewed in light of the improving bovine disease situation and, as a consequence, there is to be a reduction in the costs of the scheme; No. 2, a motion, without debate, referred to the Joint Committee on Health and Children, which has completed its deliberations, concerning the amendment of two definitions contained in the risk equalisation scheme provided for under the Health Insurance (Amendment) Acts 2001 and 2003; Nos. 3 to 7, inclusive, motions, without debate, referred to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, which has completed its deliberations, concerning the introduction of biometric identifiers into the uniform format for visas and residence permits for third country nationals. The introduction of such data will enhance the security features on visas and residence permits and will establish a more reliable link between holder, passport and visa; No. 8, the European Arrest Warrant Bill 2003 &ndash; Second Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 1 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 12 minutes, those of all other Senators not to exceed eight minutes, Members may share time and the Minister to be called upon to reply not later than ten minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage; No. 9, Social Welfare Bill 2003 &ndash; all Stages, to be taken at 2 p.m., to conclude not later than 5 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes, and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes; No. 10, motion, without debate, for earlier signature of the Social Welfare Bill 2003 to be taken immediately at the conclusion of No. 9; No. 11, the Appropriation Bill 2003 &ndash; all Stages, to be taken at 5 p.m. and to conclude not later than 7 p.m. with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes and other contributions not to exceed eight minutes; and No. 12, motion for early signature of the Appropriation Bill 2003, to be taken immediately without debate at the conclusion of No. 11. There will be a sos from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. B. Hayes: On No. 9, the Social Welfare Bill 2003, it is a very bad precedent to take all Stages of the Bill today. I understand the time constraints as tomorrow is the last day of the session, but there is usually only one piece of social welfare legislation, or a maximum of two, a year. One debate truncated into a two or three hour period once a session is not a good precedent. I understand the difficulties with the business today and tomorrow, but I would not like the Leader to think that I will accept this on a con<Col N="2095" />stant basis. It is wrong in the long term to take all Stages of this Bill in one fell swoop, and I hope the Leader will consider this for the future.</P>
    <P>Will the Leader agree that there are lessons to be learnt in this jurisdiction in respect of the Ian Huntley murder trial in Britain yesterday on the vetting procedures that need to be put in place for anyone who works with children, be it at school or any other level of society? This case in Britain was publicised throughout the world. The person had been investigated ten times by the authorities in the United Kingdom at various stages over the last seven or eight years for inappropriate behaviour with children. That person was then given a job in a school.</P>
    <P>There are lessons for this State from this saga. We need to have a statutory vetting procedure involving everyone, whether in a professional or administrative capacity, who works with children, and a debate should take place in this House, perhaps early in the new session. In Northern Ireland there is a pre-employment consultancy service which delves into the background of people in an unobtrusive way to discover if they are the most appropriate people to work with children. That debate would be very useful in this House early in the new session as we all have lessons to learn from the appalling tragedy in Soham. The trial in the United Kingdom over the past few weeks has highlighted the inadequacies of the procedures that are in place to vet people who work with children. We have a lot to learn from that and we should not be so po-faced in believing that our procedures are perfect or adequate in this area.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. O'Toole: The issue raised by Senator Brian Hayes was also the issue I wanted to raise. For the information of the House, in my period as general secretary of the INTO, which is an all-island and all-Ireland organisation, we dealt with the vetting of people who worked with children in the northern jurisdiction for many years, and we have asked many times for such a system to be put in place here.</P>
    <P>The issues raised by Senator Hayes are very important. This vetting is done as a matter of course in Northern Ireland. A close family member of mine had to be vetted just three weeks ago, when changing position in the profession of psychology, to ensure that she is an appropriate person to deal with young children in the field of educational psychology. This is just part of what goes on.</P>
    <P>This should not be seen as a knee jerk response, as it is an issue that was raised by me with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform a number of years ago. Some minor moves have been made and there seems to be an openness in Government to this, but something needs to be done. The issue here is that parents and others in the community need reassurance. <Col N="2096" />The debate has gone into all sorts of silly things, such as asking if we can still hug our children. The real issue is what we are doing in an administrative and structured way to introduce proper procedures to ensure we do our best.</P>
    <P>In the case that was referred to there were obvious failures in the system, but it is one failure and people should be aware that there are many successes of which we never hear. I have no doubt that procedures have been successful in saving many children many times over the last number of years in the UK and there is no reason why such procedures should not be introduced here. It does not interfere with human or any other rights and it is something with which we should all be comfortable. I hope the Leader will ensure this is brought forward as it is crucial, although it does not solve everything and does not give complete protection. However, it does give reassurance, a reflection of a caring and understanding community and political leadership. It is a matter which we should progress.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to stádas na Gaelainne. When we entered the European Community, Gaeilge was an official language. Uair éigin between then and now it became a treaty language. Cathain agus conas a tharla sin? Cé bhí i gceannas a thóg an cinneadh sin? I am aware that there was no discussion. I was not even aware of the change that took place, but there was a change. I cannot believe that it was carried out by a political leadership, whomever may have been in Government at that time. I am not hitting any low blows anywhere. There are all sorts of arguments for and against stádas na Gaeilge san Eorap but I note, for instance, that Malta, as a condition for accession to the European Union, has insisted on Maltese being an official language of the European Community, even though it is quite arcane. I am not suggesting that Gaeilge should be an official language but I want to know where and how the change took place.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Ryan: Like everybody, the first thing I want to raise is the issue of the gaps in child protection that were exposed in Britain and that are even larger in this country. It is far too serious an issue to politicise, but I appeal to the Leader to raise this matter with the Government. It is not that we need a debate about it, but we need a change in the law to ensure our children are safe. It is astonishing that one could apply for a job as a caretaker of a school here without any procedure for being vetted. It is only those who deal with children in a professional capacity who are vetted, which leaves significant areas wide open.</P>
    <P>We seem to learn extremely slowly. It is astonishing that the procedures for vetting people who wish to work in this House in the most minor of capacities are more thorough than those which are used to vet people who will be in close contact with children. It is more than high time we had <Col N="2097" />procedures in place, and they should be introduced before we have a repetition of the sort of tragedy that happened in Britain.</P>
    <P>We should have a debate on standards in the new year. There is a story in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> that suggests senior people in Government do not understand that using one's office to make representations to an official in a local authority is really using the proverbial sledgehammer to crack a nut and is not an appropriate use of office. We should have a debate on this to suggest to people who perhaps still do not understand that making representations, when Taoiseach, to junior officials in local authorities is at least perceived to be using heavy-handed tactics.</P>
    <P>I do not want to incur the Cathaoirleach's wrath but I want everybody to understand that my party is not happy with occurrences in this House recently. We were silent yesterday as I have no desire to give second-rate politicians cheap publicity.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: There is a procedure to deal with that.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Ryan: I expect this House to uphold its dignity.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Norris: Hear, hear.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Ryan: The Labour Party will persist with this for as long as is necessary.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: The Chair always endeavours to uphold the dignity of the House. Senators should know the Chair is concerned about the dignity of the House.</P>
    
    <P>Labhrás Ó Murchú: Faoi mar is eol don Teach, d'ardaigh mé an cheist faoi stádas na Gaeilge san Eorap, go mór mhór an stádas oifigiúil. Ó shin, tháinig cuid de Feisirí na hEorpa, agus chuir muid ceist dhíreach ar an bpointe a chuir an Seanadóir O'Toole conas mar a thosaigh an deacracht seo i dtosach. Mhínigh an Feisire Seán Ó Neachtáin dúinn nach raibh an t-iarratas daingean go leor i dtosach le stádas oifigiúil a bhaint amach don nGaeilge. Mhínigh sé chomh maith nach bhfuil le déanamh anois, de réir mar a thuigim, ach iarratas a chur isteach ag an Rialtas agus beidh stádas oifigiúil ar fáil. It seems to be a simple request from the Government for official status. As Senator O'Toole has rightly said, a country like Malta with 350,000 people will receive such status. Importantly, it would also mean considerable employment. There would be up to 200 interpreters and translators provided. This would give status to those in the country able to supply such a service.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. U. Burke: Yesterday a Member requested the Leader to explain the language used in certain items on the agenda. I ask the Leader to request <Col N="2098" />the Minister for Education and Science to explain the language used in his announcement about school projects. There are four categories, of which the first is &ldquo;extremely urgent&rdquo;, which everybody can understand and includes 170 projects listed for some improvement in coming years. This is very welcome news for those on the list as the schools in question are dilapidated and falling down. The second category is &ldquo;very necessary&rdquo;. While we all agree these projects are very necessary, we do not know when they will be in line for improvement. Category three is &ldquo;regarded as necessary&rdquo; while category four is &ldquo;projects that merit support&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister for Education and Science to come here and be open, frank and transparent, to use his own words, about the many other projects of the 600 listed in similar condition. This merits his presence in the House to explain what he means. I certainly welcome the news for the schools that have been given the go-ahead. One of the Adjournment Matters today concerns a school in category three and I do not know how the Minister will explain it.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. M. Hayes: I support the request of Senator Brian Hayes for a debate on the methods of vetting in schools. I was glad to hear Senator O'Toole refer to the system in use in Northern Ireland, in which I immodestly take a certain pride of ownership and authorship. In a previous incarnation I had the job of developing it. It is important that whatever system we have applies to the whole island. At a time when we are encouraging movement of population it would be wrong if a person who was a suspect in one jurisdiction could slip over and be a danger to children in another. Difficulties arise from matters such as the Data Protection Act and the rights of privacy which need to be fully considered. We must also remember, however, that the vast majority of incidents of the abuse of children take place within the family and are not carried out by teachers, social workers or anybody else. There needs to be a sense of proportion.</P>
    <P>Maidir le stádas na Gaeilge san Eorap, tig liom a rá leis na Seanadóirí go mbeidh díospóireacht i bhForum na hEorpa ar an 8 Eanáir. Tá súil agam go dtiocfaidh siad ar an lá sin.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Norris: I join my colleagues in seeking a debate on what arises from the tragic case in Soham. We need to address a number of issues. There are insufficient Garda resources. The office dealing with this kind of procedure is understaffed and claims it cannot deal with it unless it gets additional Garda resources, which the Government should consider. While there was a vetting procedure in Soham, it did not work because Ian Huntley had been convicted of nothing. This House could usefully give consideration to this delicate area. There was a pattern of <Col N="2099" />accusation and dropped charges, which was sinister. However, there was no conviction. This means we must be careful in looking at the civil liberties issue. Perhaps there is case to be made that where there is a consistent pattern of accusation and suspicion, queries may be raised. This was not a case of a convicted person getting through the net. There is a responsibility on the part of those hiring for a sensitive area to make fairly exhaustive inquiries. We ought not overlook the responsibility of employers.</P>
    <P>No. 1 is being taken without debate. While I am sure this issue has been fully discussed at the joint committee, as a hurler on the ditch in agricultural matters, this matter interests me. Over the years very large sums of State money were squandered on bovine TB eradication because there was a kind of collaboration between certain farmers and certain vested interests in the veterinary profession to keep the scheme going as it was the greatest gravy train in the country. I hope these regulations will make it clear that this is over.</P>
    <P>I raised a matter before in which the Leader expressed some interest. In the run-up to 2004 and the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the events in James Joyce's great novel, some months ago I raised some concern about Sweny's Chemist, a location known to Joyceans throughout the world as it was where Leopold Bloom bought his lemon soap. There is a marvellous description of the inside of the shop. I warned that I was concerned about the appearance of the building. It appeared it was being neglected and left open for vandalism. This morning as I passed, I noticed it had gone on fire. This is a great pity and the building looks appalling. A large number of people come from all over the world and this is one of the sites they visit. They will raise questions about how we protect this kind of landmark. The matter should be raised with the appropriate Minister.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: Apropos of the comments of Senator Ulick Burke, some category two school projects will go to tender and construction next year. It is well understood that it is perfectly legitimate for office holders to make constituency representations just as it is equally legitimate for public servants to turn them down. That is perfectly well understood and represents a healthy state of affairs on both sides.</P>
    <P>I hope there will not be a long delay in the publication of the Cory report on the other side of the Irish Sea as that would create distrust. I hope we will see it, if not immediately then early in the new year.</P>
    
    <P>Ms Terry: I join the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Brian Hayes, and others in expressing concern at the fall-out from the Huntley case yesterday in terms of vetting procedures and, partic<Col N="2100" />ularly, the fact that we do not have such procedures here. It is essential to introduce statutory vetting procedures for those looking to work with children in schools, child care or sport. While employers should be vigilant, without legislation people can slip through the net. We should learn the lesson. We could have similar persons getting jobs dealing with children here.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Mooney: I join others in calling for vetting procedures. As Chairman of the County Leitrim child care committee, I have first hand experience of this matter in the employment of staff within the area administered by my committee. Despite the lack of legislation, in my experience there is a very thorough vetting procedure. I would hate to think that the message from this House is that people are not acting responsibly or creating fears that those charged with looking after our children are not in some way vetted. They are. In light of what has been said here this morning and bearing in mind the fact that there is a lack of legislation in this area, one should remember that two police forces in the UK, where strict legislation exists, failed to declare that Ian Huntley was potentially dangerous. I support those who have expressed the view that legislation should be introduced. The Garda is refusing to provide a vetting system. I say this based on my experience.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá mar gheall ar an teanga oifigiúil. Cuirim i gcuimhne do Seanadóirí go raibh díospóireacht ar an ábhar seo sa Fóram Náisiúnta um an Eoraip an bhliain seo caite. Gabhaim comhghairdeas le Caitríona Ní Cheallaigh agus Chomhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge, a chuir an díospóireacht ar an gclár. I am sure Senator Maurice Hayes will recall that we had a debate on this important matter at the National Forum on Europe. I appreciate that we cannot accommodate this issue by having a debate during Government time or on the Adjournment. The Leader should take a personal interest in the matter.</P>
    
    <P>Ms O'Rourke: Yes.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Mooney: This is the time to do it. If we do not do it now, the moment will pass as it passed in 1972 when a scandalous decision was taken, more by omission than commission. We should do this now in the context of enlargement. I wish to put my weight behind the suggestion made earlier that the Leader should take a personal interest in this topic. Perhaps she can tell the House how she is getting on after Christmas.</P>
    
    <P>Ms O'Meara: Early clarification of the position in respect of vetting and the security of our children in schools and other institutions is urgent. I am aware that candidates for community employment schemes who wish to work with certain organisations in the community are required to <Col N="2101" />get Garda clearance. I presume that such clearance would be denied only in the case of a conviction. One has to question the extent to which that is the most suitable vehicle to use in respect of vetting. We should consider who should be involved in vetting and how it should be conducted. It is an important issue, particularly in light of what happened in the UK. We would all feel extremely bad &ndash; it would not be tolerable &ndash; if something similar happened here.</P>
    <P>I ask the Leader to schedule a debate early in the new year on the crisis in the health system. It is clear that there have been no improvements in acute hospitals. I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House to clarify whether he is reconsidering the implementation of the Hanly report. If the report is implemented, the beds crisis will get worse because beds in many hospitals throughout the country will be closed. The report cannot be implemented.</P>
    <P>Finally, a Chathaoirligh, can I personally acknowledge your commitment to maintaining the dignity of this House?</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: Thank you.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Browne: We have heard a great deal about decentralisation recently. The very centralised schools building projects system is based in Tullamore. More autonomy should be given to schools in respect of school buildings. It might hasten projects and be much cheaper in the long run. I welcome the Minister for Education and Science's summer school works initiative, which has given more autonomy to schools. Perhaps we can have a debate on the matter in the new year. Yesterday's announcement of the new building programme, which was made ahead of schedule, will have a devastating effect in County Carlow. It had been proposed to assign autism units to two schools, but this will not happen. I ask the Leader to resume the debate on No. 22 on the Order Paper, statements on autism, which has not been taken in this term. Perhaps the Minister will prioritise the statements in the new year so that we can discuss this important topic.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Fitzgerald: I ask the Leader to call on the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House at an early stage of the new year to discuss the schools building programme. Senator Ulick Burke claimed that there is a lack of clarity in the terminology used in yesterday's announcement. I do not wish to be disrespectful of the Leader's work in a different era, but the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is the first Minister with responsibility for education in the history of the State to go out of his way to&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Browne: He had to do so, after making so many promises on the eve of the election.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2102" /></P>
    <P>Mr. Fitzgerald: I do not wish to be argumentative.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: Certain people are trying to get rid of him.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Fitzgerald: He has gone out of his way to put in place an open, transparent, objective and independent programme for the construction of schools.</P>
    
    <P>Senators: Hear, hear.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. B. Hayes: He is clearing the backlog.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Fitzgerald: I commend the Minister.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. U. Burke: Some people are trying to get rid of him.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Fitzgerald: I assure the Chair that I am not trying to be argumentative. I appeal to the Leader to ensure that the Minister comes to the House to give us all the good news.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. B. Hayes: More letters will be going out shortly.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: Order, please.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Fitzgerald: I assure Senator Ulick Burke and others who are confused that when clarity is brought in here with the overwhelming good news&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: What about the promises before the election?</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Fitzgerald: &mdash;they might be even more confused.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: What about all the letters that went out?</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Fitzgerald: I would like to ask the Leader to address another point which relates to centralisation. Senator Browne spoke about a centralised approach, but I think the Minister's initiative in respect of devolved grants is going in the opposite direction. I commend him for that.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. B. Hayes: This is like <i>Pravda</i>.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Fitzgerald: I would like to join Senators O'Toole and Ó Murchú in urging the Government to ensure that the necessary stand will be taken at this late stage to guarantee official and proper status for the Irish language in Europe.</P>
    
    <P>Ms White: Hear, hear.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Quinn: Over the years, employers have had the great benefit of being able to have potential employees vetted by the Garda Síochána without <Col N="2103" />a charge. When I heard Senator Norris refer to the fact that Garda resources are stretched to the extent that the Garda is unable to provide vetting facilities, it seems to me quite acceptable for it to charge for this service in future. I gather that security companies often give the names of hundreds of people to the Garda to be vetted before they are taken on. I mention this issue because it is now common to charge. Perhaps the Garda can make this a profitable venture and thereby release certain resources. In light of yesterday's events, however, we should be careful to ensure that the vetting of those who will be minding children continues to be available free of charge. The additional funds which may accrue to the Garda may well enable us to afford to vet those who wish to work in child care. It is not uncommon nowadays to charge for services which used to be provided for free. Senator O'Toole mentioned that he was rather surprised to be charged for the new Iarnród Éireann timetable the other day. I was unaware that such a charge had been introduced.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: It is a small charge.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Quinn: Perhaps privatisation has been introduced in another area.</P>
    <P>May I refer to last night's very good debate on competition? I learned today that a league table of county council standards and efficiencies has been produced in Britain. Some 26 British county councils were promoted to a higher standard today, while nine of them were demoted. Those of us who are not involved in local authorities thought that the system might be of interest to Members of the House who are involved in county councils.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Mooney: We will not be involved for much longer.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Quinn: Competition can work very well and there is no reason why a league table of county council efficiencies and services should not work. I recommend it to the House.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. U. Burke: Roscommon County Council would be near the top.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. B. Hayes: There should be a league table of Senators.</P>
    
    <P>Ms O'Rourke: Yes.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Feighan: I would like the Leader to arrange a debate on organ transplants soon, perhaps early in the new year. Ireland is the only EU member state that does not have some form of legislation in this area. It is vital that we introduce such legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2104" /></P>
    <P>Ms O'Rourke: The Leader of the Opposition, Senator Brian Hayes, commented on the length of time being given to the Social Welfare Bill. I agree that it is not right to rush a Bill in this manner. I understand, however, that the Dáil finished its consideration of the Bill last night. It is coming to the House today and the debate has to be arranged in the manner I have outlined to enable social welfare payments to be made in the new year. I regret that we have to proceed in such a manner, but that is how it will be. A motion for earlier signature by the President will also have to be taken.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes also discussed the Huntley case. It was asked whether we would have a statutory vetting procedure here and whether that was necessary. The Senator pointed to the pre-employment consultancy service in the North. We have had a good debate in the House this morning on the issue, and it was raised yesterday in the context of the motion on the appointment of the Ombudsman for Children. The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, asked what had happened to references from people. I do not know.</P>
    <P>I always take great care with references, as I am sure does anyone who gives personal references. I am not suggesting that they are secure, but there used to be a system whereby one gave a signed personal reference in which one wrote about the person and his or her family and their standing in the community. To this day, if I am asked for a reference and think that it is not warranted, I do not give it. I tell the person that I cannot give a reference as I do not know enough about him or her. It is just one part of the tapestry of issues that we will have to address regarding this matter. No one whom I know in public life gives a reference lightly. We should go back to that system, as well as having more stringent vetting services.</P>
    <P>One thinks of those two laughing girls in their red shirts and what awaited them when they went in that door. It is so horrific that it will never leave our minds, particularly because we do not know what happened to them. That occurred despite procedures being in place in the UK, but because there had not been a conviction, persistent sexual misdemeanours over a period of years did not show up. The case has given us all a wake-up call.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole spoke about his membership of a 32-county trade union and said that he had asked repeatedly for the standards in the North regarding vetting to be adopted here. A question was also asked about Irish. Who made the change, and when was it made? I do not know. However, to answer in general terms and take up Senator Mooney's point, I intend to follow through on the matter so that the Seanad puts forward the case for the language as it is hugely <Col N="2105" />important. It is one of those matters in which we can express philosophical differences.</P>
    <P>I imagine that in all the official flurry and fuss of our entering the European Community, the issue was quietly bartered away. We were one of the first small countries to join. I suspect the matter was put to one side. Ireland was told not to cause trouble as we would enter the European Community and have a wonderful time. In some way, Irish was pushed to one side. However, if very small countries such as Latvia, Lithuania and Malta are to have their languages recognised, thereby &ndash; to take up Senator Ó Murchú's point &ndash; providing professional employment to those doing the translating, so should we. I intend to take up the matter as a case raised by this House. I thank all those who raised it.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan also raised the Huntley issue. The vetting procedure is shocking. The Senator said that when people come into this House for what are perceived as menial jobs, they go through a vetting procedure. He also asked for a debate on standards and the appropriate role of those who make representations. While I do not wish to go into the matter in detail, what was done did not seek to interfere or influence. It was done for humanitarian reasons so that a man who could not attend to his business because he was ill could do so when he was well again.</P>
    <P>I have already replied to Senator Ó Murchú on the Gaeilge issue. Senator Ulick Burke wanted the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to come here. He has been extremely open and frank. However, I will ask him. The Senator wants an explanation of the four categories and where they come in. I suggest that as Senator Kitt is to speak on the Adjournment, if the Senators speak nicely to him, the two of them might get in on that case.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: That is a matter for Senator Kitt.</P>
    
    <P>Ms O'Rourke: I am quite sure that Senator Maurice Hayes was involved in that issue in his role as ombudsman. On 18 January 2004, the National Forum on Europe is to have the issue of Irish on the agenda. That will be absolutely excellent and I hope that when we come back, we will have a statement from the Government. I will make the case for Irish to it in writing.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris said that decent Garda resources were required and that in the Huntley case there had been a repeated pattern of accusation. It was very strong, involving underage girls two or three times in one year. The Senator also raised the matter of James Joyce and what has happened to Sweny's chemist, saying that it will be a landmark for people visiting Dublin in 2004. Senator Mansergh said that it was perfectly legitimate to make representations. That is true, and we all do it. He also said that it was perfectly legitimate for people to refuse to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2106" />Regarding the Cory report, I have felt some anguish that we have had a gap in Northern and international debate this term. Although there was a fair amount previously, we have not had any this term. I intend that we will have such a debate. The Taoiseach has said that he would be prepared to come to the House for a debate on Northern Ireland, and we will press for that.</P>
    <P>Senator Terry mentioned the law on vetting. There is evil in the world no matter what one does. I wonder if, terrible though it is, evil does not simply have its way sometimes despite what laws are in force and how parameters and strictures are tightened. Senator Mooney spoke about his own situation in Leitrim concerning the child care committee. The National Forum on Europe will debate Irish. That is very good. Senator O'Meara asked for early clarification on vetting procedures, which is important. She also asked for a debate on the health crisis. I will certainly be glad to ask the Minister to come here in order that we can see whither the Hanly report will lead us.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne raised the autonomy of schools in funding and the issue of autism, which is still a carryover debate on the Order Paper. Senator Fitzgerald is extremely interested in education and spoke about the devolved grant system which will now be implemented. I do not know if there are any Members here who were in the Dáil when I became Minister for Education. However, I started a devolved system of grants. We hardly had any money at all. People would come to us and say that they needed £200,000. I would tell them that they could have £50,000 and build four rooms with it if they wanted. They would go away saying that they did not want that, and I would say that we would offer it to the next school. In that way it became an <i>ad hoc</i> devolved grants system. It was a great success under a marvellous official called George Rowley who was in charge of it at the time. I realise that time is marching on and that there are ever fewer people who remember one in whatever job one was in.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn also raised the vetting of potential employees and Garda involvement, wondering whether they should charge a fee for this service in order to give themselves more resources. I do not know. He also brought up the matter of league tables for county councils. Perhaps we should have a league table for the Seanad <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Dáil. Would that not be nice? I think we would do very well.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. B. Hayes: Once we are sure of the result.</P>
    
    <P>Ms O'Rourke: Senator Feighan mentioned organ transplants and the need for legislation on the matter. The Cathaoirleach said quite correctly that he was concerned and interested in the matter of standards. On behalf of the House, so am I.</P>

      <b></b>
    </P>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Dea): I am pleased to present to this House today the European Arrest Warrant Bill 2003 which gives effect to the provisions of the framework decision on the European arrest warrant and will, when enacted, replace, as and from 1 January 2004, the existing extradition arrangements between Ireland and other member states of the European <Col N="2109" />Union. Before I come to deal with the provisions of the Bill, I wish to set out the background to the adoption of the framework decision on the European arrest warrant, a copy of which is attached as a Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>One of the key objectives of the European Union is the creation of an &ldquo;area of freedom, security and justice&rdquo;. The European Union is built on democratic principles and the rule of law. At its core is the free movement of persons, capital, goods and services. The citizens of the member states have benefited enormously from these freedoms and the opportunities they have created. However, those freedoms and opportunities must be protected from those who would abuse them in order to evade justice. The reforms introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam and the additional impetus given by the 1999 Tampere European Council highlighted the importance of developing within the justice and home affairs area measures that protected the Union and member states against such violations.</P>
    <P>The framework decision on the European arrest warrant owes its origins, in particular, to the Tampere European Council which endorsed the principle of mutual recognition which, in its view, should become the cornerstone of judicial co-operation in both civil and criminal matters within the European Union. It also recognised the need for extradition arrangements that would support and reflect the shared values of member states and that would protect their citizens from the scourge of cross-border crime. The framework decision is, therefore, a practical expression of the desire of member states to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of extradition arrangements in a way that reflects the unique relationships that form the basis of the European Union.</P>
    <P>As mentioned, the framework decision on the European arrest warrant will replace the existing extradition arrangements among the member states of the European Union. The existing arrangements are, in the majority of cases, based on the Council of Europe's 1957 European Convention on Extradition. Although all of the member states are parties to the 1957 convention, the extradition arrangements in place reflect certain variations based on historical and other factors. Such variations can be found in the arrangements in place in the case of the Nordic and Benelux states as well as between Ireland and the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>I will now outline some of the main characteristics of the framework decision and the way it differs from existing arrangements. However, as an overall comment on the framework decision, it is important to bear in mind that it represents a careful balance between, on the one hand, the need for a more efficient system of extradition and surrender of persons who have been convicted or who are being sought for prosecution <Col N="2110" />and, on the other, the provision of safeguards to protect the rights of the individuals concerned. With that in mind, I will first highlight the major new features and will then outline the safeguards that will apply.</P>
    <P>Historically, extradition has been regarded as an aspect of a state's exercise of its sovereignty and, as a result, extradition arrangements entailed a significant role for the Executive arm of the state in question. The framework decision replaces in large measure, the inter-state aspects of extradition by a system of surrender based on the recognition by the judicial authorities of one member state of orders issued by the judicial authorities in another member state for the arrest and surrender of wanted persons. In future, the role of the executive agencies of the state will be to provide administrative and technical support for this inter-court system. This will be done through the central authority in the state. In Ireland, the central authority will be the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and his or her Department. Therefore, the new system can, to a significant extent, be described as an inter-court system.</P>
    <P>Current extradition arrangements have regularly been criticised for being slow, often taking several years to complete. The framework decision addresses these concerns by the introduction of timeframes for the taking of decisions on European arrest warrants. It is proposed that a decision on whether to surrender the person should normally be taken within 60 days of the person's arrest or within a further 30 days where the initial period cannot be met. These timeframes are reflected in the Bill. However, I stress that they are timeframes, not time limits. By that, I mean they are indicative rather than prescriptive because, under the doctrine of separation of powers, for instance, in this State, it would be inappropriate for the Executive or the Oireachtas to seek to limit the exercise of judicial discretion through the imposition of strict time limits when dealing with cases before the courts.</P>
    <P>Traditionally, many states refused to extradite their nationals and considered certain offences as being non-extraditable. The framework decision does not provide for exceptions or exclusions based on, for example, categories of offences or offenders. There are, therefore, no provisions permitting refusal to surrender on the grounds that the person being sought is a national of the executing member state or that the offence falls into a particular category of offences such as revenue or political offences. This is a reasonable approach when we recall that we are dealing in this context with close allies who share our democratic values and respect for the rule of law. Ireland never had difficulty in principle with the extradition of our nationals providing only that the arrangements were reciprocal. We have also, over many years, greatly curtailed the political <Col N="2111" />offence exception and changed our law in 2001 to permit extradition for revenue offences.</P>
    <P>The last, but by no means least, of the major changes I wish to highlight relates to the dual criminality requirement. This is the requirement which provides that a person may be extradited to face prosecution or service of a sentence in another state only where the offences concerned are offences under the laws of the issuing and executing states. The framework decision introduces a significant curtailment of this requirement. Under the arrangements now being introduced by the framework decision and this Bill, surrender may be sought for offences carrying a penalty of 12 months imprisonment or more under the law of the issuing member state provided also that the alleged offence corresponds to an offence under the law of the executing member state. In other words, the dual criminality requirement still applies. However, the framework decision also provides that where the alleged offence comes within any of the 32 categories of major offences listed in Article 2.2 of the framework decision and it is an offence that carries a penalty of three years imprisonment or more under the law of the issuing member state, then the position under the law of the executing member state does not arise for consideration by the executing court. In other words, the dual criminality requirement is dropped in those cases.</P>
    <P>This element of the framework decision presented some difficulty for several member states, including Ireland. It represented a significant departure from current law and practice. However, on examination of the list of offences in Article 2.2 &ndash; generally referred to as the &ldquo;positive list&rdquo;&ndash; one will find that, leaving aside the way they are described, all of them are already regarded as serious offences under our law. Therefore, as they are already serious offences under our law, dropping the dual criminality requirement is not as critical as might appear at first glance.</P>
    <P>I would like at this stage to draw the attention of Senators to the safeguards contained in the Bill. These are designed to protect the rights of the arrested person. Most of them are found in the framework decision and are repeated in the Bill. I will also be drawing attention to the additional safeguards arising from the statement made by Ireland when the framework decision was being adopted.</P>
    <P>Dealing first with the provisions of the framework decision, it sets out general principles on which the safeguard provisions are based. In addition, it contains specific provisions that list mandatory and discretionary grounds upon which requests for surrender can be refused. It also lists guarantees that may be sought before a person is handed over. On the general principles, Recital 12 affirms that the framework decision respects <Col N="2112" />the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union. Article 6 states, <i>inter alia,</i> that, &ldquo;the Union shall respect fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.&rdquo; Article 1.3 of the framework decision also refers to Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union and provides that, &ldquo;the framework decision shall not have the effect of modifying the obligations to respect fundamental rights and fundamental legal principles as enshrined in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union.&rdquo; Recital 12 goes on to state that, &ldquo;nothing in this framework decision may be interpreted as prohibiting refusal to surrender a person for whom a European arrest warrant has been issued when there are reasons to believe, on the basis of objective elements, that the said arrest warrant has been issued for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on the grounds of his or her sex, race, religion, ethnic origin, nationality, language, political opinions or sexual orientation, or that that person's position may be prejudiced for any of those reasons.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Recital 12 adds that the framework decision &ldquo;does not prevent a member state from applying its constitutional rules relating to due process, freedom of association, freedom of the press and freedom of expression in other media.&rdquo; Recital 13 is also important. It states that, &ldquo;no person shall be removed, expelled or extradited to a state where there is a serious risk that he or she would be subjected to the death penalty, torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&rdquo; Section 37 reflects the provisions in Article 1.3 and Recitals 12 and 13.</P>
    <P>On the specific protections and guarantees, Article 3 of the framework decision lists mandatory grounds for the non-execution of European arrest warrants. A person may not be surrendered if he or she has been the subject of an amnesty in respect of the offence in question. A person who has been finally judged and has completed any sentence imposed in a member state or is no longer required to serve it in respect of the offences in question may not be surrendered. A person who cannot be held criminally responsible for the offence in question, by virtue of his or her age, may not be surrendered. Sections 39, 41(1) and 43 reflect these provisions.</P>
    <P>Article 4 of the framework decision lists grounds upon which member states may rely as grounds for non-execution of European arrest warrants. Several of these are included in the Bill. Section 38 implements Article 4.1 and requires that, with the exception of the offences on the positive list, the offences specified in the warrant must correspond to offences under Irish law with a necessary qualification to allow for variations in the designation of certain revenue offences. Section 38, therefore, implements the dual crimi<Col N="2113" />nality requirement for offences other than those covered by the positive list.</P>
    <P>Section 42 implements Articles 4.2 and 4.3 and provides that a person may not be surrendered where he or she is being proceeded against in the state for the same offence or where it has been decided not to proceed or to halt proceedings against the person in the state in respect of the offence on which the warrant is based. Section 40 implements Article 4.4 in prohibiting surrender where a prosecution for the same offence would not be permitted in the state by virtue of lapse of time. Section 41(2) implements Article 4.5 by prohibiting surrender where the person had been finally judged in a non-EU state and had served the sentence imposed, or was no longer required to serve it. Section 44 implements Article 4.7 and prohibits surrender where the offence occurred on the territory of the executing state or outside the territory of the issuing and executing states and the offence is one over which the executing state does not have jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Section 45 provides that where the person had been tried <i>in absentia,</i> surrender may be made subject to guarantees from the issuing state that he or she will have an opportunity of a new trial and being present at that trial.</P>
    <P>Article 11 contains the important provision that a person must be informed of the right to legal representation and interpretation services. A person arrested under either section 13 or section 14 of the Bill must be informed of these entitlements.</P>
    <P>Article 12 provides that a person may be remanded on bail pending a decision on his or her surrender. Sections 13(5) and 14(7) provide accordingly. A person who consents to surrender, as provided for by Article 13 and section 15 of the Bill, may withdraw that consent. In such cases the person is then entitled to a full hearing of the surrender application. Before accepting that the person has consented to his or her surrender, the court must be satisfied that the consent was voluntary and informed.</P>
    <P>Article 14 provides a guarantee that an arrested person has a right to a hearing before being surrendered. This is given effect by sections 15 and 16 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 36 gives effect to Article 26. It ensures that, in the case of persons returned to Ireland, any time served in custody in the executing state pending a decision on the request will be taken into account in any sentence to be served here.</P>
    <P>A person surrendered by Ireland to another member state on foot of a European arrest warrant may not be surrendered or extradited by that member state to either a third member state or a non-EU state without the consent of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Sections 23 and 24 make provisions in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am sure Senators will agree that the safeguards I have just outlined are real and compre<Col N="2114" />hensive. However, before leaving this topic, I draw attention to the statement Ireland made when the framework decision was being adopted. The text is as follows, &ldquo;Ireland shall, in the implementation in domestic legislation of this Framework Decision provide that the European arrest warrant shall only be executed for the purposes of bringing that person to trial or for the purpose of executing a custodial sentence or detention order&rdquo;. The important point to note is that in cases where the person has not yet been convicted, the emphasis is on ensuring he or she is being sought to face trial. This is designed to ensure persons are not surrendered for investigative purposes, with the possibility of prolonged detention before a decision is taken on whether to charge him or her.</P>
    <P>Section 11(3) gives effect to Ireland's statement. It requires that the issuing judicial authority must provide written undertakings that the warrant is for the purpose of the person being charged with and tried for the offence specified. In addition, it requires that there must be written confirmation that the person has been charged and that a decision to bring him or her to trial has been made or, alternatively, that a decision has been taken in the issuing member state to proceed to charge and try the person once he or she has been returned to that member state.</P>
    <P>Still on the question of safeguards, I mention the position in relation to the accession states. As the House will be aware, eight states from central and eastern Europe, as well as Cyprus and Malta, will be joining the European Union with effect from 1 May 2004. They will be expected to implement the framework decision as part of the <i>acquis</i> they will be taking on board as and from that date. However, given the importance and sensitivity of the justice and home affairs issues, a special safeguard clause has been inserted into each of the accession treaties. The clause provides that the Commission should monitor implementation of framework decisions by the new member states. It also provides for remedial actions, including the suspension of the operation of framework decisions by those new member states in certain cases. This measure should allay any concerns about the implementation of measures such as the European arrest warrant in the early years of EU membership by the accession states.</P>
    <P>The new system is designed to be in large measure an inter-court system. Nevertheless, the framework decision permits each member state to nominate a central authority. Its role is to provide administrative and technical assistance. It will also liaise with relevant authorities in other member states in connection with arrangements for the handing over of wanted persons and property. The Bill provides that in Ireland the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and his or her Department will perform the central authority function. An amendment introduced on <Col N="2115" />Committee Stage in the Dáil provides that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform must make a report to each House of the Oireachtas on the operation in the preceding year of Part 2 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The High Court will be the judicial authority with responsibility for the execution of European arrest warrants received by Ireland. Any Irish courts having jurisdiction in criminal matters may issue a European arrest warrant, on application from or on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions, where a person now in another member state is facing charges or is required to serve a sentence in Ireland. In all cases the warrants will be transmitted, inwards and outwards, by the central authority. European arrest warrants may be in their original form or sent by fax or electronically. Electronic transmission may in due course be via the Schengen information system, SIS. Ireland has opted to participate in elements of this convention and arrangements are being made to establish the necessary systems and procedures.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides that following receipt of a European arrest warrant, it will be brought to the High Court for its endorsement. Endorsement of the warrant by the High Court will have the effect of authorising the arrest of the named person. The powers of the Garda to make an arrest in these circumstances are provided by section 25. They include the power to enter premises to effect the arrest and seize goods and property considered to be connected with or the proceeds of the offence specified in the European arrest warrant.</P>
    <P>The possibility of an arrest where the Garda is satisfied, based on information available on the SIS, when the system is up and running, that a European arrest warrant exists but has not yet been received is provided for in section 14. The information on the SIS must indicate that, where the person has not yet been convicted, he or she is to face trial, rather than being sought for investigative purposes. An arrest under section 14 must be based on a reasonable belief that the person will leave the State prior to the European arrest warrant being received here. Where there are no grounds for such a belief, the question of an arrest must await the arrival of the European arrest warrant. In those circumstances the procedures I have outlined for section 13 apply. In cases of arrests under section 14 the European arrest warrant must be produced within seven days of the arrest, otherwise the person must be released.</P>
    <P>A person who has been arrested, whether under section 13 or 14, must be brought before the High Court as soon as possible after his or her arrest. The court may remand the person in custody or on bail and will also fix a date for the full hearing of the application. However, a person <Col N="2116" />has a right to consent to surrender at this or any later stage. Section 15 deals with such cases. In these cases a full hearing will not be required if the court is satisfied that the person has given his or her consent voluntarily and in full knowledge of the consequences. As I indicated, a person who has consented may withdraw that consent. Withdrawal of consent will give rise to the need for a full hearing.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides that the High Court may, after satisfying itself that the person before it is the person named in the European arrest warrant and after hearing the application, make an order for the person's surrender. However, it may do so only where it is satisfied that all the provisions in the Bill are complied with. There is a stay of 15 days before the order takes effect and the person will normally be surrendered within a further ten day period. Upon making the order, the court must remand the person in custody and inform him or her of the provisions of Article 40.4.2º of the Constitution which allow for <i>habeas corpus</i> applications. Section 16(12) also provides for appeals on points of law to the Supreme Court against the High Court's order.</P>
    <P>Section 22 deals with the rule of specialty. This rule provides that a person who has been extradited or surrendered to another state may be proceeded against in that other state in respect only of the offence or offences for which he or she was extradited or surrendered unless the consent of the extraditing country has been previously obtained. This remains the basic position but certain limitations are introduced. The framework decision and the Bill provide that a person may be proceeded against for offences other than those for which he or she was surrendered where such offences attract financial penalties only or where a sentence of imprisonment will not arise. Neither will the rule apply where the person in question consents, either before or after his or her surrender, to being proceeded against for other offences. In both cases the court must satisfy itself that any consent given has been or will be given freely and in awareness of the consequences. As is the case under current extradition rules, specialty will not be applied in cases where the issuing judicial authority requests the central authority in this State to waive the rule and the Minister agrees to do so.</P>
    <P>Sections 23 and 24 provide that a person who has been surrendered on foot of a European arrest warrant may not be surrendered to a third member state or third country, a non-EU state, unless the person gives voluntary and informed consent or unless the Minister in this State agrees to the onward surrender, having regard to the safeguard provisions in Part 3 of the Bill and the framework decision. In cases where the request is for the extradition of the person from the member state to which he or she has been surrendered to a non-EU state the High Court will also be <Col N="2117" />required to give its consent. It may do so only where it is satisfied that the requirements of the Extraction Act 1965 are met.</P>
    <P>Sections 29 and 30 set out the procedures and criteria to be applied when there are several European arrest warrants for the same person but from different member states or where there are European arrest warrants from one or more member states and extradition requests from one or more non-EU states.</P>
    <P>Sections 31 to 36 deal with the arrangements for the issuing of European arrest warrants by Ireland. Section 33 provides that applications may be made to any court having jurisdiction in criminal matters by or on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The courts in question are the District and Circuit Criminal Courts, the Central Criminal Court and the Special Criminal Court. A European arrest warrant may be applied for where a warrant for the arrest of the person has already issued in the State and the person is not in the State. The warrant must be in respect of an offence having a penalty of 12 months' imprisonment or more or, where the person has already been convicted, a sentence of four months or more has to be served. The court that issues the European arrest warrant will be required to indicate whether the warrant is in respect of an offence that comes within the &ldquo;positive list&rdquo;, namely, an offence listed in Article 2.2 of the framework decision that carries a penalty of three years' imprisonment or more under Irish law. The executing judicial authority in the other member state will be obliged to accept that certification and the question of the dual criminality of the offence shall not be considered further. As I indicated, the reverse applies in the case of European arrest warrants that are to be executed in this country.</P>
    <P>I referred to the guarantee in section 36 to the effect that a person who is detained in custody in another member state while the European arrest warrant issued by Ireland is being processed in that other member state shall be entitled to have that period of detention taken into account when determining, following surrender, the period of sentence to be served in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Part 3 of the Bill refers to the safeguards. I do not propose to cover this ground again but it must be emphasised that every application that comes before the High Court will be subject to these safeguards, and no application for a surrender on foot of a European arrest warrant may be granted unless and until those safeguards are satisfied.</P>
    <P>Part 4 contains miscellaneous amendments to our existing extradition law. As Senators will be aware, the Extradition Act 1965 contains the main provisions. It has already been amended on a number of occasions.</P>
    <P>The immediate purpose of the amendments under discussion is to ensure that extradition arrangements with the Isle of Man and the Chan<Col N="2118" />nel Islands can continue to operate. Those territories will not be operating the framework decision on the European arrest warrant and it has been agreed with the UK authorities that extradition arrangements with those territories should, instead, operate on the basis of the European Convention on Extradition 1957.</P>
    <P>The agreement with the United Kingdom on future extradition arrangements with certain UK territories was part of a wider discussion with the UK authorities on arrangements to apply once the European arrest warrant enters into operation on 1 January next. Article 31.2 of the framework decision deals with circumstances where there are bilateral arrangements in force, such as the &ldquo;backing of warrants&rdquo; arrangement we have with the United Kingdom at present. The article states, &ldquo;Member States may continue to apply bilateral or multilateral agreements or arrangements in force when this Framework Decision is adopted in so far as such agreements or arrangements allow the objectives of the Framework Decision to be extended or enlarged and help to simplify or facilitate further the procedures for surrender of persons who are the subject of European arrest warrants&rdquo;. This is the legal test to be applied to any existing arrangements.</P>
    <P>It has been agreed with the UK in respect of the application of these criteria that the existing &ldquo;backing of warrants&rdquo; arrangement does not satisfy the legal test in question and will therefore be replaced from January next with the European arrest warrant.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Extradition Act 1965 provides the legal basis for the &ldquo;backing of warrants&rdquo; arrangement. The Bill now provides for the formal repeal of Part III. The UK legislation on the implementation of the framework decision has also provided for the formal repeal of its legislation on the &ldquo;backing of warrants&rdquo; arrangement, namely, the Backing of Warrants (Republic of Ireland) Act 1965.</P>
    <P>Subsections 47 (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) amend subsections (1A) and (1 B) of section 3 of the 1965 Act, as inserted by the Extradition (European Union Conventions) Act 2001.</P>
    <P>Section 50 amends the procedural requirements in section 10 of the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act 1987 for the laying of orders before each House of the Oireachtas. It is proposed that orders shall take effect 21 days after their being laid before the Houses unless they are annulled. The orders under section 10 of the 1987 Act are for the purpose of extending the provisions of that Act to apply between Ireland and countries that are not parties to the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism. The amendments bring the procedures under section 10 into line with the amendments to section 4 of the 1965 Act, introduced by section 21 of the 2001 Act.</P>
    <P>Let us consider some of the amendments made <Col N="2119" />by the Dáil. A new section 3 was inserted providing for the designation of member states for the purposes of the European arrest warrant by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, thus ensuring Ireland can operate the new systems on a reciprocal basis with those other member states that have enacted the necessary legislation. A new section 9 was inserted, clarifying that the High Court will be executing judicial authority in the State. Under section 12, there is now a provision allowing for the possibility of receiving European arrest warrants in a language other than Irish or English. Under section 15, a person must now be informed by the court at the time of making the surrender order of his or her right to make a complaint under Article 40.4.2º of the Constitution, which provides for <i>habeas corpus</i> arrangements. New sections 17, 18 and 19 were inserted, which deal, respectively, with European arrest warrants that relate to more than one offence, postponement of surrender and conditional surrender. Section 20 now contains subsections dealing with affidavit evidence. A new section 32 is designed to assist Irish courts that are issuing European arrest warrants by enabling offences under Irish law to which Article 2.2 of the framework decision applies &ndash; the so-called &ldquo;positive list&rdquo;&ndash; to be identified in regulations the Minister may make.</P>
    <P>Further amendments to Part 4 of the Bill, amending existing extradition laws, were also accepted in the Dáil. A new section 49 was inserted providing that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, after consultation with the Minster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, will in future make orders under section 8 of the Extradition Act 1965. The previous position was that the Government made such orders. As I stated, a new section was inserted providing for the repeal of Part III of the Extradition Act 1965. This provided for the backing of warrants arrangements we operated with the United Kingdom. This arises since the European arrest warrant replaces all existing extradition arrangements, including the backing of warrants arrangements with the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied this Bill represents a major development in our relations with other member states of the European Union and a major step forward in our extradition arrangements. I hope its significant proposals will meet with the approval of all Senators and I commend it to the House.</P>
    
    <P>Ms Terry: I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his comprehensive speech. I have not much to say on this Bill because I agree with it in principle. However, I will table some amendments for Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Member states of the European Union are growing closer and it is to their benefit that they <Col N="2120" />can work in close co-operation to afford greater protection to us all and to ensure effective prosecution and policing of crime in the Union. The measures in the Bill are a result of the atrocities of 11 September 2001, which made us all realise that no country is an island and that we have something to gain from co-operating with one another.</P>
    <P>The Bill will streamline the extradition process and make it work better. Although the Minister of State has provided many safeguards regarding people's rights, the Human Rights Commission expressed the view to the Minister that the framework decision is based on a flawed presumption of effective and equivalent protections of accused persons' rights between EU member states and that the original scheme of the Bill paid insufficient regard to the protection of human rights. Moreover, it stated that the Bill, in spite of its safeguards, is still likely to diminish constitutional protections regarding extradition. I listened very carefully to the Minister of State's description of all the safeguards provided. However, does he now believe the Human Rights Commission will have no complaint or concern about the protection of human rights?</P>
    <P>I question the way we deal with Bills before a recess, particularly this Bill, which passed through the Dáil last night. I believe officials were working on it late into the night as a result of amendments made in the Dáil. Sufficient time should be allowed to consider a Bill such as this. Why are we dealing with it at this late hour although it was published some time ago? It has been around for some time and many changes have been made to it. If we do not enact this legislation before 1 January 2004 what will be the repercussions for Ireland? Will any other member states not have this enacted by 1 January 2004?</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Kett: I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his presentation on a very important Bill. As a consequence of this Bill we no longer have to go through the formal extradition procedure when trying to bring someone to a criminal prosecution or custodial sentence. Every Member and everyone we represent will remember the outrageous events of 11 September 2001, when we were shocked to the core by how vulnerable we would be to a terrorist attack. Before our very eyes we saw the greatest nation on earth brought to its knees by terrorists and the impact of that was enormous, not least on the poor families of those who died. It also had a significant effect on the world economy, with insurance companies using it as a yardstick by which they increased insurance costs. I have seen this in my own business, where insurance costs have gone from £43,000 to &euro;156,000 in three years. When the circumstances of a commercial enterprise do not change, one wonders why insurance costs should rise like that. We do not know the full economic effects, such as job losses in small companies as a result of such companies <Col N="2121" />being unable to insure themselves. Our tourism industry has also been badly affected, although we hope it is recovering, and pension funds and other investments have also suffered.</P>
    <P>The Bill will bring greater harmonisation and co-operation in our efforts to combat terrorism and obviously all countries will benefit mutually from that. We know terrorist acts are committed by international gangs based in several countries, with those gangs exploiting the logistical benefits of operating in different countries. Those investigating terrorist crimes are hindered by the fact that we do not have a communal law and the current situation differs widely from one member state to another. Most countries do not have specific rules about terrorism, with terrorist acts often punished as offences under ordinary law. One of the key objectives of the EU was the creation of freedom to move and do business and all citizens have benefited from that. However, it has also been used by criminals who have used that freedom to perpetrate terrorist violence and run drugs.</P>
    <P>This is not the first occasion on which we have declared war on these criminals but I am glad the Minister of State said there are protections built into the Bill to address human rights concerns. If individuals are held in custody and extradited under the new system they will get credit advantage as a consequence and there are also other safeguards in the Bill. This shows that while the legislation squeezes these people, it also takes due note of individuals' legal rights.</P>
    <P>That this mechanism can be operated between judicial systems rather than the bureaucracy of State will speed up operations tremendously. The Minister of State referred to extradition cases which have gone on for years and thankfully this framework decision will change all that. The Minister of State mentioned the timeframe of 60 days, with an additional 30 days allowed if needed, and that will give greater confidence and satisfaction to those operating at the coalface. He said this is not a time limit but that those working to catch these terrorists know proceedings will not go on <i>ad nauseum </i>will give them a certain amount of confidence in the system.</P>
    <P>I have always been an advocate of the European Union and I have seen nothing in recent times to change my mind about it. As with our own domestic laws, there are times when some pain is involved but we must take the rough with the smooth and be positive. The Minister of State said certain other countries have signed up to this measure in their domestic laws but some have not. Will we have a situation where some countries seek a watered-down version of this Bill, while other countries do not come on board at all? If so, will we exclude them from our obligations under this legislation? If I were to be negative I could look at our nearest neighbour across the water and wonder about political crimes. There has been a severe lack of co-operation with that jurisdiction in the past and there were high profile miscarriages of justice in the <Col N="2122" />past which I could mention. I hope the Bill copperfastens this situation to prevent any repetition in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said the High Court would operate this system, which is good. What happens in the case of someone appealing a case that the High Court is adjudicating on? Is it possible for them to appeal to the Supreme Court? What kind of timeframe would that involve? It would certainly rule out the 90-day provision. I am sure this will not happen on a widespread basis, but if cases go to the Supreme Court on appeal, will they get priority over the domestic cases which are already there?</P>
    <P>We dealt recently with the Criminal Justice (Joint Investigation Teams) Bill, arising from a framework decision, which provides for the setting up of joint investigation teams for specific purposes and limited periods to tackle criminals across borders. The Criminal Justice (Illicit Traffic by Sea) Bill was another fine Bill and I hope when the gang lords and drug barons operating the system to their benefit see that legislation and the arrangements being set up between states, they will see the error of their ways. That is cloud cuckoo land but they should realise the game is up for them and that we are on their case.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has found a reasonable balance in this legislation. I wish it well in its passage through the Seanad and even though some amendments have been tabled, it will get a fair hearing. I also wish him well in the other House.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. O'Toole: I welcome this legislation and am delighted it has come to the House, even at this late stage. I listened with some amusement to the Minister of State's presentation because I recall that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform showed a lack of enthusiasm for the first proposal when it was mentioned in Europe some years back. I am not sure if he was Minister at the time. He took a strong stand on a number of issues at an early stage of the European discussion and that is as it should be. It gives me a sense of protection to know that Ministers will examine carefully the question of human rights and the levels of discretion which should be maintained and retained by member states. This legislation does that.</P>
    <P>The issues involved here should be addressed in a wider context. That context would include the UN charter on human rights. We should first examine whether this legislation conforms with or offends that charter in any way. We should also check it conforms with the rights to which we are entitled as Europeans and with our constitutional rights. Those three benchmarks or guidelines answer the questions about the legislation and it is from there we should examine the small print.</P>
    <P>It is within the three issues of the UN, the EU treaties and our Constitution that we will find our space. As I understand the legislation, nothing in it causes any offence to any of these three guidelines. The people want to be reassured on that <Col N="2123" />and to know that in the context of the legislation there will be no hiding spaces or corners in Europe in which criminals, gang lords and others can hang out and laugh at the rest of us, as has been happening.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a proposal which I hope can be taken on board. We should convince our colleagues in the United Kingdom to become part of the Schengen agreement which allows free movement of people throughout the European Community, as is supposed to be allowed under the Treaty of Rome and which is the case throughout most of Europe. It knocks one back to arrive at a European airport from Ireland and have to go through the same procedure of entry as if one was from a non-European country. This is as a result of the UK not yet being part of the agreement. It would cause us serious problems to move on this issue without the UK moving with us. On all other issues we should follow our own agenda but I recognise that with the North-South issue and our common visa arrangements, it is important that we do not move without the UK. We must convince it on this matter. Quite a sum of money is spent in places like Dover, effectively to protect us against ourselves as Europeans. We should use that money on our borders to ensure that European policing is completely co-ordinated.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister of State dealt with the issue of the level of co-ordination among European police forces and the free exchange of appropriate information, although the matter has been discussed here previously. There should be support for Interpol at the European level. For example, we spoke this morning about vetting people who work with children. I have seen this matter from all sides. I know of a man who could not get a job in the UK because he could not pass the vetting procedure who got a job in Ireland. I also know of a man who could not get a job in Ireland as a teacher who became a schools' inspector in the UK. We see odd situations because of the lack of a free flow of information. I realise I have gone beyond the issue of the arrest warrants being discussed today. However, one matter leads to the other. We must provide intelligent, appropriate and responsible access to information in order to close access to hiding places.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister speak on a number of occasions recently, and in committee last week, about the question of DNA testing and the retention of results. I concede there is a human rights issue at stake here but there is also a security issue involved. I do not have the answer or solution to this problem and am uncomfortable with the idea of stored information. On the other hand, an enormous amount of personal information is held on file already and this would not add much to it. Part of the problem with the size of the new EU will be that people will be able to take up new identities far too easily, making them <Col N="2124" />difficult to trace and easier for them to escape the long arm of the law.</P>
    <P>This is looking at the issue from a broad general point of view whereas what we are concerned with today are specifics. No right thinking citizen of any European country would be able to live with the thought of a mass murderer or child abuser being able to escape prosecution and the rigours of the law on the basis that they could not be arrested for some &ldquo;technical&rdquo; reason. We must look at the issue before us and realise that we still have decisions to make ourselves within this proposal. We must retain discretion and run our system but we must do it in the context of what is being sought. This proposed legislation is a good balance and I support it.</P>
    
    <P>Ms Tuffy: I thank the Minister of State for his presentation. While this type of legislation is necessary, I would like to raise a number of concerns. I support Senator Terry's concern at the speed with which we are dealing with this legislation. I had to struggle to get information in time for this debate. For example, I could not get access to the Dáil Committee Stage debate. Normally, when legislation comes here for Second Stage debate, I can access it. All I know of the amendments made is what the Minister of State said in his speech.</P>
    <P>There is often good reason for processing legislation speedily and I have been happy to facilitate this and not demur if it is necessary, particularly if the reason for change is only technical. That is not the case now. It is inappropriate to process this legislation so quickly because it deals with people's rights and dealings with the legal system. It could also impact on human or constitutional rights and the right to fair procedure. This type of legislation should be dealt with in a more considered manner.</P>
    <P>There is no reason it could not have been given a more considered hearing. The original Bill was published in July. I know my colleague, Deputy Costello, highlighted that a different version of the Bill, many pages shorter, was published then. However, there was still enough time to have a more considered debate on the legislation. We will not have much time to process amendments through the various stages tomorrow and this is not right for such important legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State outlined how the legislation implements the European framework decision, an issue raised by my colleague in the Dáil on Second Stage. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, has often expressed a protective attitude towards our criminal justice system and a reluctance to go down the road of harmonising our criminal code. During his visit to the House last week, Mr. Brian Crowley, MEP, expressed similar concerns. On the basis of my own experience of Irish law, I also share those concerns, although I am not convinced either way. The approach in the Bill is similar to that of many other Bills dealing with the implementation of the European framework <Col N="2125" />decision &ndash; essentially, such legislation comes to us in the House as a <i>fait accompli.</i>One of the suggestions brought forward by Deputy Costello in the Dáil was that the pre-framework stage should involve much more scrutiny by the Houses of the Oireachtas. I understand from him that his predecessor as Labour Party spokesperson on justice matters was only given a copy of the framework document which gives rise to legislation such as this Bill a very short time before it was debated in this House. A more protective approach is necessary on legislation of this nature arising from EU directives. Deputy Costello has made the point in the other House that this legislation provides for court orders issued in other jurisdictions which may have different criminal justice systems which might not have similar safeguards. As I said, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has expressed those concerns. We should, therefore, take a cautious approach to legislation of this type.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to the issue of dual criminality. I regard it as a major departure that a person could be extradited from this country on the order of another country which had different legislation. There is also an issue of constitutionality. Although there is a provision that the Bill will not override our constitutional processes, there may well be constitutional challenges to it. That is another reason for very careful consideration of it. The Labour Party submitted a number of amendments during its passage through the Dáil. I will bring forward amendments on Committee Stage in this House tomorrow.</P>
    
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Dea): I thank Senators for their very constructive and helpful comments. Senator Terry raised a specific question about the Human Rights Commission, to which Senators Tuffy and O'Toole also referred. The Minister paid close attention to the commission's comments and had them examined in detail during the preparation of the Bill. The Minister and I, as far as possible, having regard to the requirements of the framework decision, have taken the commission's views into account in preparing amendments which have been accepted in the Dáil, especially in dealing with time limits for the surrender of arrested persons. As a result, the High Court will now be required to notify the person to be surrendered of his or her rights to bring a <i>habeas corpus </i>application. This should ensure that where there is an overly long delay in arranging for a person's surrender, the court will be in a position to give him or her an appropriate remedy. The relevant amendment in the Dáil was to take account of the comments of the commission.</P>
    <P>Senators Terry, Kett and others asked what would happen if some member states did not sign up before 1 January 2004 and how many had done so. I am advised that a number will not be in a position to operate the new arrangements on <Col N="2126" />1 January but most of those have indicated that they will be in a position to do so within a very short timeframe.</P>
    <P>While it is not possible to give a definitive opinion at this stage on the effects of non-implementation, the matter is being examined in Ireland and at EU level. It may be the case &ndash; this is my personal view &ndash; that the current arrangements based on the 1957 Council of Europe convention on extradition will continue to apply until the relevant parties to any request are in a position to operate the European arrest warrent. In other words, the new arrangements will operate between member states which have signed up to them while the old arrangements will apply in situations where only one of the member states concerned has signed up.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage in the Dáil a new section 3 was added to the Bill. This will enable Ireland to operate the new procedures on a reciprocal basis but only with those member states which have also implemented them in their national legislation. The member states concerned will be designated in orders to be made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The United Kingdom has already enacted its legislation and will be in a position to operate the framework decision with all other member states which have done likewise. Accordingly, the new arrangements will apply between Ireland and the United Kingdom as soon as Ireland has enacted the legislation.</P>
    <P>The member states which have enacted the legislation are the United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal and Denmark. Those expected to enact it before the 1 January deadline are Belgium, Sweden, Finland and, it is hoped, Ireland. The position of other member states is as follows: The Netherlands has indicated that it will have the legislation in place by the end of January; France and Austria will do so by February; Luxembourg by February or March; Germany by spring 2004 at the latest; Greece during January and Italy by the end of March. That is the current position.</P>
    <P>I share Senator O'Toole's view on the need for co-ordination of information between police services. Europol is an information sharing mechanism while Eurojust facilitates prosecutions between countries. There are ongoing informal meetings between representatives of various police forces throughout Europe with a view to enhancing the arrangements for sharing information between member states.</P>
    <P>I have covered the main points raised. As Senators will be aware, Committee Stage will be taken tomorrow. Either the Minister or I will be here to deal with the amendments which will provide an opportunity to look at the Bill in more detail. I take the point about the time at which the Bill is being introduced. However, I have not got an explanation as to the reason it has been brought forward at the end of the term. Perhaps there were difficulties in preparing certain aspects &ndash; I do not know.</P>
    <P>I regret that Senator Tuffy did not manage to catch sight of the Official Report of the Commit<Col N="2127" />tee Stage debate in the Dáil. That information is rather important, to say the least, for an Opposition spokesperson in the Seanad, particularly when new amendments are being introduced by the Government on Committee Stage. I will certainly pass on the Senator's comments to the Government Chief Whip.</P>
    <P>In thanking both Houses for their co-operative approach, I also sincerely thank my officials from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform who worked long hours late into the night and strove mightily to enable us to reach this position. In view of their hard work, were it not for the fact that we are in the august surroundings of the Seanad, I would invite a round of applause for them but obviously that is not permissible.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    
    <P>Acting Chairman (Dr. Henry): When is it proposed to take Committee Stage? </P>
    
    <P>Mr. Kett: Tomorrow.</P>
    <P>Committee Stage ordered for Friday, 19 December 2003.</P>

    <Title>Social Welfare Bill 2003: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <b></b>
    </P>
    <P>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan): Tá lúcháir orm a bheith ar ais sa Seanad go gcuire mé an Bille seo ós a chomhair.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to introduce the first of two Bills intended to implement the &euro;630 million social welfare package announced in the 2004 budget. This sum represents a &euro;100 million increase on the 2003 package of &euro;530 million and brings the projected level of social welfare expenditure in 2004 to more than &euro;11.26 billion, a 7% increase in the allocation for 2003. This level of expenditure is indicative of the Government's priority to protect the living standards of social welfare recipients at a time when difficult decisions have to be made in managing the public finances. It is a clear demonstration of this Government's commitment to addressing the needs of the elderly, widowed persons, carers, the unemployed and the disadvantaged. It represents year-on-year increases by this Government in social welfare spending. In 2001 the social welfare budget totalled &euro;7.8 billion, but in 2004 it will be in excess of &euro;11.26 billion.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have secured an increase in the social welfare budget this year, which underlines this Government's commitment to those for whom the support of the State is vital. The budget at my disposal means that for every &euro;3 spent by the Government in 2004, almost &euro;1, or one third, <Col N="2128" />will go to social welfare recipients. Increases over the past three years have been directed at improving the rates of payment in line with Government commitments. An estimated 970,000 people are expected to claim weekly social welfare payments next year and almost 1.5 million people, including dependants, or two out of every five people in the State, will benefit from these payments. The increase of &euro;10 in all weekly social welfare payments is ahead of the rate of inflation. It represents increases ranging from 6% to 8%, which in the case of the lowest payments is more than three times the expected rate of inflation of 2.5% next year.</P>
    <P>Since the Government took up office, Ireland has changed dramatically for the better. The number of people at work has increased to almost 1.8 million while the rate of unemployment has fallen dramatically from 10% to below 5%. The number of low paid persons removed from the tax net has increased, and in 2004, 35% of all those on the tax record will pay no tax at all. Social welfare spending has increased from &euro;5.74 billion in 1997 to a projected &euro;11.26 billion in 2004. This is almost double the rate of inflation. Payment rates for both recipients and their families have improved considerably in real terms. Substantial improvements in the conditions for entitlement to a range of social welfare schemes and services have been implemented. New social welfare benefits such as farm assist, carer's benefit, widowed parent grant and respite care grant have been introduced and enhanced.</P>
    <P>These real improvements in social welfare have led to a significant reduction in the consistent poverty measure. According to the ESRI, the overall level of consistent poverty in 1998 was 8.2%. This level has been reduced by over a third to 5.2% in 2001, the latest year for which figures are available. This social welfare package has been assessed in line with the poverty-proofing guidelines set out in the national anti-poverty strategy. I am satisfied that the level of spending at my Department's disposal in 2004 will have a meaningful impact on poverty rates by reducing consistent poverty further. The Government is most anxious to continue to protect and support the weak and vulnerable in society and to safeguard the progress made in building social inclusion.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the 2004 social welfare package are to increase and maintain the value of all rates of payment in real terms with a &euro;10 minimum increase in all weekly social welfare payments. It aims to provide increases to those aged 66 years and over, and in particular, to meet the commitment to increase payments to widowed persons who have attained pension age. The package will continue to address Sustaining Progress and An Agreed Programme for Government commitments to increase the State pension to &euro;200 by 2007. It aims to increase the real value of all qualified adult rates of payment, to ensure they do not fall as a proportion of the associated personal rate and to continue to make progress <Col N="2129" />in our program of increases in the level of child benefit. In this context, I remind Senators that in the 2001 budget, the Government committed to investing an equivalent of almost &euro;2 billion in the child benefit programme. To date, when the full year costs of the 2004 improvements are included, more than &euro;1.775 billion or 89% of that commitment has been achieved.</P>
    <P>I will now outline the main provisions of the Bill. Sections 2 and 3 reaffirm the Government's commitment to pensioners and, together with the Schedules to the Bill, provide for an increase of &euro;10 in the personal rates of old age contributory and non-contributory pension as well as retirement and invalidity pension. This will bring the rate of old age contributory pension to &euro;167.30 per week and the old age non-contributory pension to &euro;154 per week. On the basis of projected annual inflation of 2.5% in 2004, this represents a substantial real increase. Special provision is being made for an increase of &euro;11.50 in the personal rate of widow and widower's contributory pension and deserted wife's benefit for those aged 66 years and over. This fulfils our commitment, announced in budget 2001, to increase the level of these payments to that of the rate of the old age contributory pension.</P>
    <P>This 7.4% increase on current rates represents a real increase for over 62,000 widows and widowers and deserted wives on full rates with proportionate increases for a further 10,600 on reduced rates. There is also an increase of &euro;10 for those in receipt of widow's and widower's non-contributory pension bringing the maximum personal weekly rates for these pensioners to &euro;154 for those aged 66 years and over and &euro;134.80 for those aged under 66. The Government is committed to increasing the level of qualified adult allowance for pensioner spouses in the coming years to the full old age non-contributory pension rate in order to benefit women in the home who do not qualify for the contributory pension in their own right.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides for increases in the social insurance based payments and in respect of qualified adults. The qualified adult payments applicable to old age contributory and retirement pension are increased by &euro;7.70 per week where the qualified adult is aged 66 years or over and &euro;6.70 per week where he or she is aged under 66. The combined increases in personal and qualified adult rates will mean that a couple in receipt of full old age contributory pension will receive a substantial increase of &euro;17.70 per week.</P>
    <P>In the case of invalidity pension, a very significant increase of &euro;16.10 per week is being provided for the qualified adult where he or she is aged 66 years or over, bringing the rate to &euro;129.20 per week. This increase brings the invalidity pension qualified adult rates for those over 66 years into line with those paid for qualified adults of old age contributory and retirement pension. An increase of &euro;7.10 per week is being provided for qualified adults of invalidity pension under 66 years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2130" />In addition to providing for the increases in social assistance payments, section 3 contains the rate increases for qualified adults on such payments. An increase of &euro;6.60 is provided for qualified adults of old age non-contributory pension recipients and those qualified adults aged 66 years or over whose spouses or partners are receiving a blind pension. All other qualified adult rates are, likewise, being increased by &euro;6.60 per week. Proportionate increases will be applied where persons are in receipt of reduced rate qualified adult allowance payments. As a result of these and previous increases, the qualified adult allowance rate for a person over 66 years will rise to over 77% of the old age contributory pension in 2004.</P>
    <P>The Government is also conscious of the needs of other vulnerable groups in society, particularly those who are unemployed, disadvantaged or ill and for those who provide caring support for the elderly and the ill. Accordingly, we are providing for a weekly increase of &euro;10 in the personal rates of those payments. This will bring the standard weekly personal rates of carer's allowance to &euro;139.60 and &euro;134.80 for unemployment benefit and assistance and disability benefit.</P>
    <P>We are also committed to protecting the real value of other social welfare payments such as one-parent family payment, supplementary welfare allowance and farm assist. Over the period from 1997 general social welfare increases have been well ahead of inflation. In the budget we are maintaining the value of these payments ahead of inflation by providing for an increase of &euro;10 or 8% per week in the personal weekly rate.</P>
    <P>The social welfare budget increases included in the Bill will become payable from the first pay day in January 2004. Those receiving short-term payments such as unemployment payments will receive their increases immediately in the first week in January. In addition, some 160,000 customers who receive long-term payments by means of electronic payment through a post office or a bank will receive their increases on the first pay day in January.</P>
    <P>The payable order book is the payment mechanism for 224,000 persons who are, predominantly, recipients of widow's or widower's one-parent family payment, invalidity pension and carer's allowance. The production of new order books will entail a minimal delay. The new books will be issued to all customers in mid-February 2004. These customers will receive a lump sum arrears payment of six weeks in their first payable order of the new book, and the weekly increase will be included in their weekly payable orders thereafter.</P>
    <P>A further 261,000 customers, mainly recipients of old age and retirement pension and disability allowance, who also receive payments via the payable order book will receive their new order books in April. To minimise inconvenience they will, however, receive a special payment in mid-February comprising six weeks arrears of the budget increase and seven weeks advance pay<Col N="2131" />ment. For example, a pensioner couple aged over 66 years will receive a lump sum payment of &euro;230.10 in mid-February. The lump sum will cover the increase for the first pay day in January and include an advance of the increase to the book renewal date in April. Thereafter, the increases will be incorporated into the normal weekly payment.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for an increase of &euro;28 in the weekly income thresholds applied in determining entitlement to family income supplement, expanding the thresholds from &euro;407 in the case of a family with one child to &euro;584 in the case of a family with eight or more children. This will result in a weekly increase of &euro;16.80 with effect from January 2004 for most eligible families. I have also increased the minimum level of FIS payment from &euro;13 to &euro;20 per week to ensure that even those pushing at the edges of the increased thresholds will increase their return from employment.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 and 6 provide for changes in PRSI. The earnings ceiling from employee's social insurance contributions and the income ceiling for the payment of optional contributions is being increased by &euro;1,740 from &euro;40,420 to &euro;42,160 per year with effect from 1 January 2004.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for a &euro;200 increase in the widowed parent's grant, bringing it to &euro;2,700. This increase will be applied with effect from budget day, 1 December 2003.</P>
    <P>I have on previous occasions referred to my commitment to the prudent management of the social welfare budget. My personal objectives include taking the steps necessary to ensure value for money in the provision of income supports and maximising resources to address poverty and disadvantage. One of the mechanisms used to achieve these objectives is the ongoing review of the support schemes administered by my Department. The purpose of such reviews is to ascertain whether individual schemes have attained optimal effectiveness, or require adjustment to afford maximum benefit to social welfare customers. Consequently, the Bill contains a number of additional measures which provide for amendments to certain social welfare schemes and reform of the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the linking period between unemployment benefit and disability benefit claims to be increased from 13 to 26 weeks. The principal advantage of claim linkage for the recipient is that he or she may retain some or all of the entitlements associated with the initial claim, for example, continued entitlement to relevant secondary benefits. This provision will be effective from 19 January 2004.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for an increase from 39 to 52 in the number of paid social insurance contributions required to satisfy the conditions for entitlement to disability benefit, unemployment benefit and health and safety benefit. This is designed to ensure entitlement to such benefits reflects a reasonable degree of attachment to the <Col N="2132" />workforce. This measure which will apply to all new cases with effect from April 2004 will mean that those with fewer than 52 paid contributions from the time of their entry into the workforce will no longer be entitled to these insurance-based benefits. They will, however, be entitled to apply for supplementary welfare allowance or unemployment assistance as appropriate, the maximum rates of which match disability benefit and unemployment benefit payments.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that with effect from 19 January 2004 an increase in respect of a qualified child will not be payable where the income of the spouse or partner of a recipient of unemployment benefit, disability benefit, injury benefit or health and safety benefit exceeds &euro;300 per week. Existing claimants, while they remain in continuous receipt of their benefit payment, or those with spouses or partners earning less than &euro;300 weekly will not be affected by this provision. It is estimated that the majority of claimants affected by this measure will be those whose spouse's or partner's earnings are considerably in excess of &euro;300 per week. This measure will facilitate a refocusing of resources to low-income families.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for a reduction in the maximum duration of unemployment benefit from 390 days, or 15 months, to 312 days, or one year, where the claimant has fewer than 260 or five years' PRSI contributions. This measure acknowledges a sustained connection with the social insurance fund by ensuring a substantial and continuous contribution is reflected in the duration of entitlement to benefit. It also mirrors the qualifying conditions applicable to disability benefit. The section comes into operation for new claims with effect from 19 January 2004.</P>
    <P>The purpose of supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, is to provide a safety net for those unable to provide for their own needs. SWA is not payable to those in full-time employment. This exclusion is set out in social welfare legislation and has been a feature of the scheme since its inception in 1977. In addition to the other qualifying conditions for the scheme, the employment status of the head of the household is a determining factor in establishing entitlement to SWA.</P>
    <P>In future if one of a couple is in full-time employment, both will be excluded from claiming rent or mortgage supplement. This measure gives effect to the original intention that SWA should not be paid in cases where there is full-time employment in the household. Accordingly, section 12 provides that where one of a couple is in full-time employment, SWA rent or mortgage supplement will not be payable. This measure comes into effect from January 2004. It will also facilitate more appropriate decisions and responses in the assessment of accommodation requirements.</P>
    <P>Sections 13 to 15, inclusive, provide for a technical amendment to existing legislation which allows for PRSI, health contribution and national training fund levies to be charged on benefits-in-<Col N="2133" />kind as announced in last year's budget. Over the course of the past year a number of spending items have been reviewed and areas of potential savings identified to ensure sound management of public funds. The savings found have been recycled back into the total allocation to my Department which will spend a record &euro;11.26 billion in 2004. Any changes to SWA schemes will only affect new applicants.</P>
    <P>Rent supplement was never intended to meet a person's long-term housing needs. While the scheme is not a housing programme, in practice over the years it has become such. Rent supplement will continue to be available to those with housing needs whose safety or well-being is at risk such as people with disabilities, the elderly or those experiencing severe social problems. These measures will not affect those who are on local authority waiting lists; those who are homeless, as defined by the local authority under the Housing Act; those who are tenants for six months; or those receiving rent supplement. Full and sympathetic consideration will be given to the needs of people in implementing the new rent arrangements with the involvement of the housing authorities.</P>
    <P>Crèche supplement was designed to provide assistance for parents who, in the absence of such a service, would not otherwise be able to avail of particular supports such as counselling services or addiction treatment programmes. Officials of my Department which provides this short-term payment are in discussions with the health boards and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ensure appropriate long-term measures are put in place to address crèches which rely on this SWA payment. No crèche will close as a result of this measure.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the diet supplement is being restructured to take account of changes in the level of social welfare payments generally. The current basis for calculating the amount of supplement payable in individual cases was put in place in 1996. Since then, costings have not been updated, the assessment of means has not been adjusted and effectively the amounts paid have not changed. Over time the gap the diet supplement was intended to address has narrowed. In future diet supplements will be based on the current cost of special diets, the current income of claimants and the premise that one should not have to pay more than one third of one's income towards food costs. Existing recipients will continue to receive their current payment until there is a change in circumstances which would warrant a review of entitlement.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Bill, the first of two instalments, builds further on the progression of social inclusion measures adopted by the Government in recent years. It safeguards the living standards of those who rely on social welfare income and other supports and prioritises the allocation of resources in favour of those most in need.

      <Col N="2134" /></P>
    <P>Mr. Cummins: I welcome the Minister. Traditionally, Ministers with responsibility for social welfare come to this House after each budget declaring that record increases in the Department are the order of the day. This will always be the case, as there are pay increases, benchmarking and increases in social welfare. I acknowledge that the increases in social welfare payments were well above the rate of inflation, which is welcome. However, I cannot understand the reason the Government decided to cut &euro;58 million in spending on poor and vulnerable people through what is referred to as the &ldquo;savage 16&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister responsible for what was called the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; cuts some years ago has again used his heavy hand to attack people on the margin. He has no problem in looking after the Punchestown set and very wealthy people who could bear the burden better than those targeted with these cuts. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs failed to have them reversed, even when the Minister for Finance announced a windfall of &euro;500 million from capital gains tax before the budget.</P>
    <P>Clearly, financial rectitude is more important than real people who may need a diet supplement, a supplement from the money advice and budgetary service to help them to get out of the clutches of moneylenders and a host of other measures punitive on those in need. The Minister failed the people concerned by not having the cuts reversed. While she used phrases like &ldquo;phasing out of benefits&rdquo;, &ldquo;maximising resources&rdquo;, and &ldquo;adjustments&rdquo;, they all have the same result. The poorest people were targeted and the Minister has no intention of reversing the cuts, despite condemnation by a wide range of organisations representing single parents, the homeless and the poor. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul stated the number of people coming to it for assistance last year had practically doubled</P>
    <P>Despite the Government's stated commitment to plan for combating poverty, removing secondary benefit poverty and unemployment traps, the action taken in the budget falls way short of what was required to achieve these goals. Only two years ago the Minister for Finance gave specific commitments to increases over a three year period. However, he has not delivered. This represents another broken promise added to the litany of broken promises by the Government. I believe Mark Twain referred to &ldquo;lies, damn lies and statistics&rdquo;. If he were here now, he would probably say: &ldquo;promises, promises and Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats promises&rdquo;. We are seeing spin rather than substance.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows, our level of spending <i>per capita</i> on social welfare is one of the lowest in Europe. Rather than giving us meaningless statistics about how much was spent in 1997, she should consider factual information which has seen the level of homelessness increase by 109%, from a total of 2,501 to 5,234 in that period. Local authority housing waiting lists have increased by 80% in that time. There are 50,000 households on <Col N="2135" />local authority waiting lists, affecting over 130,000 people. I have outlined the Government's record and the legacy it will leave behind after a period of unprecedented economic growth. We are talking about real people, not statistics. The Government lacks the vision, purpose and policies to solve the problems of certain unfortunate people.</P>
    <P>I wish to discuss the proposed changes in social insurance contributions. If one has missed a contribution in the relevant tax year, will one be ineligible to claim for unemployment and disability benefits? Rather then needing 39 stamps, one will now be required to have 52 stamps. This major change in the system is grossly unfair. This mean change in the rules will deny people their entitlements. The Minister also proposes to reduce the term of unemployment benefit from 15 months to 12 months. What is the justification for this? People paid into the schemes and will continue to pay into them on the basis of certain benefits being available to them. The Minister mentioned in her speech that the changes will apply from April 2004, but I would like to know the rationale behind decreasing the benefits from 15 months to 12 months. It is another cut, or another example of &ldquo;financial rectitude&rdquo; as some people prefer to say.</P>
    <P>It is hard to believe that the Government has not increased child dependent benefit allowance, which has stood still since 1994. I question the policy of having different rates for different children, given that the Constitution states all children are to be treated equally. This Bill sends out an anti-family message. If a spouse or partner of a claimant for child dependent allowance earns more than &euro;300 per week, the claimant will no longer be entitled to child benefit allowance. This constitutes another attack on the poor because, in effect, it eliminates half of the child dependent allowance payments to families on low incomes. Similarly, it is regrettable that the Government has failed to increase the back to school and clothing and footwear allowances for 2004, especially because the stealth taxes that are introduced almost on a daily basis affect the poor more than most. There have been increases in electricity charges, television licences and hospital charges. Those on the lowest incomes are most affected in this regard.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Minister has proposed changes in the rent supplement provisions. How can she expect someone in receipt of social welfare to be able to find six months' rent? The introduction of such an unreasonable and unworkable restriction is absolutely despicable. The number of homeless persons is already scandalously high, but this provision will drive many more people out of their homes. The Minister will be responsible for such a development if the Government persists with this dreadful change.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, which recently gave the Minister a report on full-time carers in the <Col N="2136" />home. One of the report's main recommendations was that the means test for carer's allowance be abolished. Carers receive little or no recognition for looking after people who are incapable of looking after themselves. Most people ask how much would it cost to abolish the means test, but I wonder how much full-time carers are saving the State. Caring is a labour of love, which takes its toll on the lives of carers over many years. We should consider the saving to the State as a result of the work of carers, rather than the cost of abolishing the means test.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Government colleagues obliged her to engage in a cost-cutting exercise. This must have been hard for her to accept in the weeks before the budget. The cutbacks show where the Government's focus lies. It is certainly not focused on the less well-off in the community. It has missed a unique opportunity to build a fairer and more inclusive society in which everybody can have enough and can be respected. The Minister has missed the opportunity to make people's lives better in many areas. There has been an attack on the poorer sections of the community. It is understandable that the Minister did not refer to the savage cutbacks to any great extent. Is there a better way of spending the increased funds that are available to the Government as a consequence of increased receipts from capital gains tax than to give more money to the poorer sections of the community? The Government should reverse the recent cuts, which will take their place in history with the dirty dozen and the savage 16. That is the legacy the Minister will leave behind.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: That is what the Senator wishes.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: They should be called &ldquo;the shocking 16&rdquo;.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: I have outlined the legacy that will be left behind by a Government which was in office at a time of unprecedented economic growth.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Wilson: I welcome the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, and her officials to the House. I am delighted to support the Social Welfare Bill 2003, which she has brought before the House. The Bill provides for a series of improvements in the social welfare code, which were announced in the budget two weeks ago. The Minister has done a marvellous job by securing an increase in her budget, which will be over &euro;11 billion this year. She has been given an increase of &euro;630 million, or 7%, to spend on a social welfare package. When I was at school, I learned that if there was a percentage increase in a figure, it meant that the initial amount had been added to. I congratulate the Minister.</P>
    <P>The level of social welfare expenditure is indicative of the Government's priority, which is to protect the living standards of social welfare recipients at a time when difficult decisions have <Col N="2137" />to be made about the management of the public finances. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, published another great budget two weeks ago. The Opposition agrees with me.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: We are suffering over here.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: Senator Wilson should keep his eye on the page.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Wilson: The Government has demonstrated, through action rather than words, its commitment to addressing the needs of the elderly, widows and widowers, carers, the unemployed and the disadvantaged. Members on the Opposition benches are still recovering from the knock-out punch delivered by the Minister for Finance, who gave wonderful news to every person, family, townland, parish, village, town and city.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: Is the Senator talking about rural electrification?</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: He took &euro;58 million from the poor.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Wilson: Does the Opposition intend to vote against the &euro;10 minimum increase in all social welfare payments?</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: We will vote against the 16 cutbacks.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: The savage 16.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Wilson: Does it intend to vote against the increase of &euro;11.50 per week for widows and widowers aged 66 and over in receipt of contributory pensions? Does it intend to vote against a &euro;6 or &euro;8 increase in child benefit, effective from April 2004? Does it intend to vote against a &euro;28 increase in family income supplement thresholds and a &euro;100 increase in the respite care grant? What exactly do Fine Gael, the Labour Party and the rest of the crew which straggles the whinging benches of the Oireachtas&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Henry: I have never been called &ldquo;the rest of the crew&rdquo; before.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Wilson: &mdash;find so wrong with increasing the level of payment to widows, widowers and deserted wives to that of the old age contributory pension? That is exactly what the Social Welfare Bill 2003 sets out to do. In monetary terms, it will offer parity of esteem to over 62,000 widows, widowers and deserted wives. I will take no lectures from Senator Cummins or his colleagues in the Opposition who are more concerned with sounding like they care&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: We have not lectured at all.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Wilson: &mdash;for the worst off than doing anything about it. I do not doubt that many of <Col N="2138" />them agree with what we are doing and share in our commitment to supporting those most in need in all sectors of life.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: Where are they?</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: That is the point.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: Order, please.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Wilson: The Minister, instead of running to every available microphone and photographer to highlight what must happen, has chosen to consult widely with her colleagues in the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party who represent every county and parish.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: They have emptied their hearts as usual.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Wilson: She ensured she had a very strong case to put to the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, regarding the allocation for the social welfare budget. She has been very successful.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: He let her down.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Wilson: This is real politics and real action rather than the half-hearted politics of the Opposition. We are a party which delivers to the less well-off in society.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: Promises, promises.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Wilson: Thankfully, the people gave the Government an increased mandate in June 2002 to come back and finish the job started in June 1997&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: Which they regret.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Wilson: &mdash;after the disastrous years of the rainbow coalition. It is no wonder that Senator Cummins does not want us to go back as far as 1997.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: The level of homelessness has increased by 109% since.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: Order, please.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Wilson: Once the people had booted out Deputies Bruton, Spring and De Rossa, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats came in to manage the country. Since then, the less well-off in society&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: Are worse off.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Wilson: &mdash;have benefited. I heard the Minister mention before the budget that it should not be seen in isolation. It is part of a five year programme the Government has set out. In 2007, when the programme for Government is complete, I hope Senator Cummins will be man enough to come and congratulate the Minister on a job well done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2139" /></P>
    <P>Mr. Cummins: She has reneged already on the issue of child benefit.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Wilson: A Deputy from County Mayo, whom I cannot name&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: Yes.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Wilson: &mdash;has consistently been shouting for the Minister to apologise. She should be complimented on securing the largest ever social welfare budget in the history of the State.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: Any Minister responsible for social welfare can say that.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Wilson: Surely the Senator and his colleagues are not saying the Minister should apologise for giving over the figure of &euro;1 billion in child benefit. As I pointed out, when I was at school, which was not that long ago, an increase meant just that.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: If an increase is an increase, what is a cut?</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Wilson: To listen to the Senator, and in anticipation of what Senator McCarthy is going to say, one would almost think that payments had been reduced.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: Senator Wilson to continue without interruption.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Wilson: Perhaps, instead of Irish classes, there should be maths classes for Senator Cummins and his colleagues.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: The sum of &euro;58 million is just that.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Wilson: The Social Welfare Bill 2003 contains several minor technical amendments to the legislation governing the application of PRSI, health contributions, the national training fund levy and benefits-in-kind. I point out to the Opposition that this budget, worth over &euro;11 billion altogether, is the biggest in the history of the State.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: It is a disappointment.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Wilson: Deputy Coughlan who has been in her job for only a short time is already the best Minister for Social Welfare this State has ever had.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: They dropped her in it and did not dig her out.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: How many scripts are there?</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: Senator Wilson to continue without interruption.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2140" /></P>
    <P>Mr. Wilson: I have a point of information. We have to write our own scripts in our party. We do not have spin doctors.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: They have more spin doctors than us.</P>
    <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: Order, please.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Wilson: The sum of &euro;58 million has not been cut from the budget. It has been redirected, and it was &euro;55 million. I have been corrected by the Minister. Senator Cummins mentioned Mark Twain.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: The Senator is inviting interruption.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: Please do not invite interruption. Senator Wilson hesitated as if he were looking.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Wilson: I was trying to gather my thoughts and hold back the laughter. Mark Twain was mentioned by Senator Cummins who wondered what he would write about now if he were here, suggesting that it might be cutbacks upon cutbacks.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: The pension rate.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: Fianna Fáil promises.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Wilson: He might like to concentrate on the Fine Gael Party &ndash; the few who are left &ndash; and write the up-to-date version of &ldquo;A Family at War&rdquo;. We could call it &ldquo;A Family Still at War&rdquo;.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: Rumours of our demise have been greatly exaggerated.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Wilson: Senator Cummins mentioned homelessness. Under the Government, a sum of &euro;1.9 billion has been allocated for housing.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: I suppose they will have an 80% increase.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: Senator Cummins has already made his contribution, and I do not think he was interrupted even once.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: The Senator is inviting it.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: Let Senator Wilson continue on the Social Welfare Bill 2003.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: Will we have injury time?</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: No.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Wilson: I congratulate the Minister on her excellent Bill and budget. I am proud to stand here to support them and wish her well for the <Col N="2141" />future. In anticipation of Senator McCarthy's comments, I will try not to laugh.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Henry: I have never been called a member of &ldquo;the rest of the crew&rdquo; before. I am not speaking on their behalf but Senator Wilson will be pleased to know that we have recovered from the knock-out punch of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. He is extraordinarily fortunate to have the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, to send here today. I have the greatest respect for her and know that she will do the very best she can for all those under her care. We welcome all of the improvements in social welfare payments and so forth. However, there must be aspects of the Social Welfare Bill 2003 with which she is disappointed. I will certainly not ask her to enumerate them. I know that she has tried her best to shield people in areas where they have been removed from social welfare allowances or assistance.</P>
    <P>It would be very sad in this day and age &ndash; though a report today states our competitiveness appears to have gone badly compared with the rest of the European Union &ndash; if we were unable to improve the situation regarding social welfare allowances. I am even older than Senator Wilson who was only recently at school. I campaigned not that long ago for optical and dental benefits for the wives of insured workers. It was about 20 years ago when such matters were staggering. There have been great improvements since. I welcome the ones made in the budget but we have come from a very low base. It is great to see the improvements in the country which have allowed for this. I take seriously the warning about our apparent lack of competitiveness. I am sure the Government will do everything in its power to rectify matters.</P>
    <P>I recently attended a meeting of the International Medical Parliamentarians Organisation in Bangkok which was addressed by an economist from the Philippines. He referred to the Asian tiger and how the economies in the Far East changed so much approximately 15 years ago. He stated that the latter had resulted from a change in the fertility rate among women in the Far East. Women in that part of the world began to have smaller families and were able to go out to work as a result. Perhaps someone will compile a thesis on the change in the fertility rate among Irish women between 1970 and 1990, when it nearly halved. Not long after 1990, the Celtic tiger arrived. I know the Minister will take particular account of the contribution women have made to the great improvements we have enjoyed in the past ten years.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the disallowance of rent allowances for the first six months after people rent flats. The Minister, who has spoken at our meetings, is aware that I am president of Cherish. Knowing her concerns about this area, I am sure she has read the Crisis Pregnancy Agency's recommendations. One of the most important recommendations is that we should ensure that <Col N="2142" />people in crisis pregnancy situations &ndash; even in this day and age such people are still being thrown out of their homes &ndash; would not resort to abortion due to a lack of accommodation. A crisis pregnancy cannot be planned. It is a contradiction in terms to state otherwise. An important part of Cherish's strategy is to be in a position to inform people that they will be able to get into accommodation and that they will be paid an allowance. The Minister stated that she would consider the position of those who are experiencing severe social problems. However, I am concerned that many young women who become pregnant will think that the safety net has been removed and resort to having abortions in England. I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter to see if she can rectify the position. We are spending a great deal of money on the Crisis Pregnancy Agency and we state that we are committed to reducing the abortion rate in this country. However, that rate will not be reduced by failing to provide accommodation.</P>
    <P>Some people seem to believe that women get pregnant in order to get houses. During the recent debate on homelessness, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, admitted that the vast majority of people on the housing list are single. He did not specify whether these individuals have children but they are not doing well in their objectives if they are still on housing lists. I have been contacted by very angry individuals who informed me that because they are single mothers people seem to think that they obtain accommodation very easily. However, this is not the case.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about crèche allowances. I was one of those who welcomed individualisation with open arms because I paid heavy tax. Until the advent of individualisation, I paid tax at the top rate for all of my married life. A girl must think of herself occasionally, so I was delighted when individualisation was introduced. However, it is disappointing that neither child care nor care of the elderly is allowable for tax relief. If an initiative were taken in this area, it would offset the fact that there is no social welfare allowance for crèches. I spend a great deal of time trying to encourage single mothers to try to obtain employment because regardless of how generous are the social welfare benefits they receive, they will do much better if they obtain decent jobs and can manage to make their way in society. I ask the Minister to reconsider the position in this area.</P>
    <P>I am also disappointed about the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> medical cards. I am aware that the number of people over 70 who would not be means tested for medical cards, and who applied for and received them, was hugely over-estimated. We are now faced with the iniquitous situation where doctors are paid a higher rate in respect of richer people over 70 than for their poorer counterparts, who may require more of their care. There are a number of strange anomalies in this area and I would be grateful if the Minister would give consideration to them. People with very modest <Col N="2143" />incomes cannot obtain medical cards and everyone knows that being poor is not good for one's health.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made improvements in respect of the disabled. However, I again bring to her attention the review in respect of disabled drivers and passengers. I first raised this matter in July 1999. I was informed at that stage that a review was under way. After four and a half years I thought it reasonable to inquire again about the position, particularly as some people who had bought cars at the time had asked me whether anything could be done for them. The allowances for disabled drivers and passengers, which relate to VAT, motor taxation, etc., are very worthwhile. Some people who are well deserving of assistance &ndash; this is recognised by those who decide who should receive help &ndash; are not in a position to receive it due to the outdated restrictions that are in place. This matter has been under consideration for four and a half years. When I contacted the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I was informed that the report is being reviewed.</P>
    
    <P>Mary Coughlan: The Department of Finance.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Henry: The review could go on and on. A man who is thinking of changing cars contacted me in the autumn to ask if I thought there would be any improvement in the position. I ask the Minister to look into this matter.</P>
    <P>The number of children still considered to be living in poverty is disappointing. I was surprised to hear a Member on the Government benches recently refer to the NGOs who look after these children. I thought these organisations were called charities. It is important to remember the number of people in this country who will rely on our excellent charities, which deserve our support, this Christmas. I was saddened when I heard a woman on radio earlier this week state that the only new clothes her children had received in the course of the year were their school uniforms. I know the Minister does not want such situations to continue to obtain.</P>
    <P>The Minister will receive great support from the rest of the crew in her further negotiations with the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. We have not been floored by the knockout punch. I am sure the Minister made great efforts in her earlier negotiations with the Minister for Finance. I am particularly concerned about single mothers and the fact that we are investing a great deal of money in the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, the recommendations of which are not being taken on board as a result of what is happening with the social welfare system.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: I wish to acknowledge the important role Senator Henry played in securing optical and dental benefits for spouses. That was a real social improvement at the time. I was a member of the tax strategy group and I recall <Col N="2144" />that, year after year, we wrestled with the question of disabled drivers. It is not easy to deal with this matter and if the scheme could be targeted properly, improvements would be easily made.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Henry: Exactly.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: The difficulty is how to target the scheme in order that we do not spend vastly greater sums than intended.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister and congratulate her on an excellent social welfare package. Unlike most of my colleagues, I do not come from a traditional Fianna Fáil background. One of the reasons I belong to the party is that it is socially progressive, in delivery even more than in oratory. If people doubt this, they may wish to cast their minds back a few years. I will not go back as far as 1995. During the budget debate, Senator Ryan castigated me for again reminding people of the 2.5% increase in social welfare and the £1.80 increase for old age pensioners. I will not revisit the 1995 budget&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: Boohoo.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: &mdash;I will instead concentrate on the budget that was introduced in 1996.</P>
    <P>I will do this to remind people of how things were and to put some of the criticism into context. Let me quote from the 1996 Budget Statement of Deputy Ruairí Quinn who was Minister for Finance at the time. He stated: &ldquo;In addition to these employment related measures, I am providing for a 3% increase in all personal social welfare weekly payments and adult dependant allowances from mid-June 1996.&rdquo; Regarding child benefit, he stated: &ldquo;On this occasion, I am providing for an increase of £2 per month in these rates with effect from September next.&rdquo; That brought the rate to £29.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: That is meaningless in 2003.</P>
    <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: It is a revolution, perhaps, in meaningless rights. It is not meaningless.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: It is utterly meaningless.</P>
    
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: Senator Mansergh, without interruption.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: The Minister went on to state: &ldquo;The total cost of the social welfare package [in 1996] which I have outlined today will be £80 million this year&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: Bingo.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: &mdash;and £161 million in a full year.&rdquo; The problem is &ndash; I refer not just to Members in this House but also to people who write columns &ndash; that there has been much social<Col N="2145" />ist rhetoric and very little socialist delivery during the last two periods in which the Labour Party was in Government.</P>
    <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: I am a fair-minded person. I pay due respect to the memory of Frank Cluskey who was in office during the 1970s. However, there has been precious little delivered yet. Frankly, the &ldquo;right-wing ogre and ideologue&rdquo;, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: Fianna Fáil ideology is rampant with it. We had to clear up the rubbish Fianna Fáil left behind on too many occasions. The Government must clear it up itself now.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: &mdash;has beaten the rainbow coalition hands down in terms of social provision in budget after budget.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: The Senator should listen to CORI and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. What he is saying is rubbish.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: The Senator can listen to all the rhetoric he likes, but the delivery is made.</P>
    <P>It is a ridiculous position &ndash; it was a position never adopted by either a Fine Gael or Labour Party Minister for Finance &ndash; that one could never make any changes in the social welfare system. One had to stick strictly to the status quo. While one could add to it, one could never alter or subtract from it. I am glad to hear from the Minister, if I understand her correctly, that no existing claimant will be affected by the changes. Any Minister, even in relatively prosperous times, has a right to retarget resources.</P>
    <P>The idea of social welfare spending as a percentage of GDP and GNP is an old chestnut. I do not hold by it. The question is, what are the real resources <i>vis-à-vis</i> people in need? If there are only 4% to 5% on the live register, the Minister does not need the resources necessary when there were 11% to 15% on the live register. Nonetheless, social welfare spending has increased very considerably in spite of this. That has been a product of the economic policies of the Government.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the recent ESRI review which tends to be popularised and distorted. I do not doubt the continuing existence of poverty. Even 1% in poverty represents far too many people. However, it is a gross distortion of the report to represent it as stating poverty increased from 1994 to 1997 to 2000 to 2001. There is a difference between relative and consistent poverty. Compared to 16 years ago the numbers under the various lines have been cut by about four fifths. The number below the 40% line was 5% in 1994 and 1% in 2001. The number below the 50% line in 1994 was 17.4% and 2.4% in 2001. The number below the 60% line is reduced from 30% to 6%. We have made progress. Many get annoyed and frustrated when people not merely <Col N="2146" />deny that social progress is being made but actually allege we have been galloping backwards. I ask people to read the reports properly, not just pull out&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Mr. U. Burke: Tell that to the recipients.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: I accept that relative poverty and increases in relative inequality must be taken into account. That is bound to occur at periods of high growth. One needs to take corrective measures. However, the question is whether people at the bottom end of the scale want concrete improvements in the standard of living&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Mr. U. Burke: Imaginary ones.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: &mdash;or whether they are merely interested in their relative position. There is no question but that they want real improvements. There are probably times &ndash; I would like to explore this in more detail in another place on another occasion &ndash; when absolute or consistent poverty is reducing while relative income inequality is increasing.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. U. Burke: Tell that to the person who is poor.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: However, crude oversimplification should be avoided. While immense social progress has been made, I would be the first to acknowledge that much more needs to be made. The Minister is doing her best to continue along the path of greater social inclusion. Much has been done and, of course, there is more to do.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: I welcome the Minister. There is one issue on which she deserves to be congratulated, that is, her nomination this morning as the best Minister of 2003.</P>
    
    <P>Mary Coughlan: That will do me some good in Donegal.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: It is worthy of note. It was in a national newspaper. Given her professional background, parliamentary experience and reputation, I believe &ndash; it is a measure of the generally held opinion of her &ndash; that the Minister is a caring and committed politician. In a Government with Deputy McCreevy as Minister for Finance, it is not easy for a Minister to always get what he or she wants. They can make requests and demands. I can only imagine the Minister's difficulties in trying to amass the budget for her Department.</P>
    <P>The increases are welcome, although there are points with which I fundamentally disagree. The problem is the right-wing axis which has characterised the Government over the past seven budgets.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: That is a figment of the Senator's imagination.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2147" /></P>
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: CORI's analysis of the budget was that the Government had missed seven unique opportunities to address the rich-poor gap in society, one of the widest in Europe.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: They got &euro;6 million all the same.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: This is not merely a political point being made by me. It is the analysis of CORI, an organisation committed to this area. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul is telling us the same. It had frightening statistics. The number who seek assistance from it has doubled in a 12 month period. That is a shocking indictment of any Government. Between publication of the Estimates and the budget, the Taoiseach was dismissive of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul's figures for the number of children living in the poverty trap. That in itself reflects a certain attitude. Dismissing the statistics provided by an organisation which does such an amount of work is indicative of a right-wing axis which is composed of the Ministers, Deputies Harney and McCreevy. It is deplorable.</P>
    <P>To address the point my colleague made regarding social provision, there is none. Senators may study what documents they want but I will save them the time. There is nothing in the budget which assists those on low incomes. The most vulnerable people have been consistently hit by this Government. How can that be reconciled with the election in 2002? We all recall the daily press briefings, the most notable made by the Minister stating that no cutbacks were planned, secretly or otherwise. That is not the case as we have seen in the past 18 months.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. U. Burke: Senator Mansergh was not in the House that day.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: A short time after the formation of this Government, memos were sent to Departments asking Secretaries General to cut expenditure. This was in blatant contradiction of the briefings in which commitments were given to the public that no cutbacks were being planned.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: The Senator does not remember real cutbacks.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: What has happened? In 1992, the then Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy McCreevy, who went on to a bigger and better Department, introduced what became known as the dirty dozen social welfare cuts. The savage 16 cuts now being introduced have replaced the dirty dozen cuts which took some beating. These cuts will be forever associated with this Government and this year. One cannot justifiably argue that this Government is taking care of those on lower incomes as it is not, rather it is hitting out at them.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: Of course they are.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2148" /></P>
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: They are hitting at those who suffer most, those who need assistance most and those who depend on this State for whatever reason. I am sure such people do not like having to depend on the State. However, when they turn to this Government for assistance the door is shut in their faces.</P>
    <P>One could also hold the view, when this Government is so public in its castigation of those on lower incomes in terms of the cruel and vicious manner in which the savage 16 cuts are being introduced, that a golden circle exists in this country. Those of us not in that circle are not in the club. We need not look far from this city for multi-millionaires who do not pay tax on their earnings. It is inequitable, unfair and unacceptable.</P>
    <P>It is an absolute disgrace that this Government aims cutbacks at the Department of Social and Family Affairs which deals with those on low incomes and single parents when trying to save money by pulling back savings from different Departments.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: That Department is receiving &euro;630 million&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: What this Government has done to those on low incomes is deplorable. The people who support these cuts&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: They are the millionaires.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: This Government, which supports the cuts, has rolled out a cynical election ploy called decentralisation. They are going to decentralise jobs to Macroom where the Taoiseach and the Tanáiste, flanked by Fianna Fáil candidates stood in front of an empty unit and announced 350 new jobs for the area.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. U. Burke: All smiling.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: Two years following that announcement, not one new job has been created.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: Not one job has been created.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. U. Burke: And it is not likely any will be created.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: The Government then has the contemptuous arrogance to roll-out decentralisation and to expect people in that area to throw rosebuds in front of Fianna Fáil Deputies. That is despicable and unacceptable. We are all pro-decentralisation but in this case it is ill-thought out, lacks consultation, has no clear costings and was only devised by Deputy McCreevy to disguise his boring, unimaginative budget.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: The spatial strategy has gone out the window.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Wilson: It was a knock-out punch.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2149" /></P>
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: There has been much talk since then about decentralisation. The budget was boring and unimaginative and was mostly about stealth taxes. The people are now expected to believe decentralisation will go ahead. This proposal is being introduced six months before local elections. How cynical is that? This is the fifth time such a scheme has been announced in as many years and twice in election years. People know the promise of those jobs is married to the next general election.</P>
    <P>If the school of mathematics in Leinster House, as proposed by Senator Wilson, were to teach us anything surely it would teach that those mathematics are not convenient. That campaign was orchestrated. It was initiated by the author of the dirty dozen, the man responsible for the savage 16 cuts now being introduced. These decisions were made by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, the Ebenezer Scrooge of Irish politics.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: He is not a Scrooge towards social welfare recipients.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: The Minister for Finance does not consider it worthwhile to take care of the worst off in our society. It is disgraceful that Members of this Government, who support these cuts, will be knocking on doors next June.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Wilson: They will be proud to do so.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, compares well with Deputy Quinn any day.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: The general increases fall short of the amount needed to meet commitments to income adequacy as set out in the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion. While Senator Mansergh made some valid points on poverty, he missed the most important one, namely, that relative poverty has increased in recent years. An increase of one percentage point is too much.</P>
    <P>The way to tackle child poverty is through education and child benefit. Commitments on child benefit have not yet been reached. We know it is a five year plan and that this Government will most likely be in office for the full term. If the Government leaves meeting any more of its commitments until its last year in office, it will spend the final 12 months in Departments trying to meet them. That would be a crime. Imagine the electorate in Donegal not seeing their local representative because, like her Cabinet colleagues, she will be spending all her time trying to roll-out a five year plan in one year.</P>
    
    <P>Mary Coughlan: I am there every weekend.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: It is not helpful for the Taoiseach to make statements which directly contradict statistics as provided by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. It is a shocking indictment and a reflection of the attitude of right wing politics <Col N="2150" />in this country. We must acknowledge that Ireland is one of the most right wing countries in Europe. It makes a mockery of the political system for a right wing party to complain about left wing politicians.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: The Labour Party is moving in that direction.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: I suggest that the next time our colleague is so hard up for something to read he might resort to the <i>Beano</i> or the <i>Dandy</i> which are representative of cloud cuckoo land.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Wilson: The Labour Party manifesto.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: Senator Wilson's outlandish statements are unhelpful and are a reflection of right wing ideology. The right wing axis of this Government is ably supported by the apostle of fiscal rectitude, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, the Kildare stud. Surely all democratic political parties have a system which ensures one is aware of people's requirements through attending one's clinics and by listening to those who elect them. It is surreal that some of my colleagues to my right&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: Appropriately.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: I often think we are a bit to the Senator's left.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: &mdash;have a clear campaign against right wing ideology. That manifested itself in the latest budget. I look forward to other Stages when we can exchange points on view on the Bill. The total savings in the Department of Social and Family Affairs will be &euro;58 million.</P>
    
    <P>Mary Coughlan: It is &euro;55 million.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: Surely there are other methods of raising much needed finance. I do not have a list of solutions in my pocket to rectify the situation. We have one of the most unfair tax regimes in Europe.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: The EU Commission said that low income groups are treated better here than in any other European country.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: That is absolute rubbish. They boast of having low tax regimes. The current budget introduces many stealth taxes.</P>
    <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
    
    <P>An Leas-Chathaoirleach: Senator McCarthy, without interruption, please.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: The Minister for Finance is introducing stealth taxes which affect the worst off in society and is boasting about having a low tax regime. How can he expect anybody to believe our tax system is the fairest in Europe?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2151" /></P>
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: At least the PAYE person is not crucified as he or she was in previous years.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: There is not a week that goes by that something is not increased.</P>
    
    <P>An Leas-Chathaoirleach: Senator McCarthy, without interruption, please.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: Does my learned colleague make pre-budget submissions&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Mr. U. Burke: He does not understand.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: &mdash;or does he accept the Minister for Finance's right wing ideology? Surely the Senator's conscience might lead him to think the Minister has gone too far on this occasion. The Government should look at the broader picture and seek other methods of raising finance. It should not attack the worst off in society such as single parents, pensioners and homeless people, which is precisely what it is doing.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the savage 16, which will come to occupy the same place as the dirty dozen and the author of one is responsible for the other, namely the Minister for Finance. Most of the cuts have been signed off at this stage. To qualify for the third-level back to education allowance, social welfare recipients must now be on welfare for 15 months rather than six months. This is particularly cruel and nasty. Cutting this allowance is not indicative of a Government that wants to tackle poverty. Experts have told us that poverty can be tackled through education. This was a valuable scheme that was taken up by many people, giving them a standard of education that allowed them to better themselves, enter the workforce and have dignity and a better quality of life. This concept is so far divorced from the political reality in the Department of Finance and its head honcho that the allowance has to be cut.</P>
    <P>The dietary supplement was an important payment to people that required it. Surely such a scheme should not be cut back because it had a good take-up. The good take-up demonstrates the requirement for this payment. Instead of promoting the service, the Government has cut it back.</P>
    <P>The Minister is adamant that no crèches will close. We intend to nail this myth.</P>
    
    <P>Mary Coughlan: The Senator does not know what he is talking about.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: We would be interested if the Minister will share her pearl, or pebble, of knowledge on this issue.</P>
    
    <P>Mary Coughlan: The rock is on its way.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: I look forward to debating this with the Minister.</P>
    <P>Perhaps our learned colleague might read <i>Das Kapital </i>the next time he is hard up for something to read. If he did this, he might really understand <Col N="2152" />what left wing politics and socialism represents. The savage 16 certainly does not represent it. When the Senator is canvassing with candidates for the local elections&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: The Labour Party is not strong in Tipperary.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: &mdash;his slogan will not be &ldquo;guaranteed Irish&rdquo; but rather, &ldquo;committed to the savage 16&rdquo;. It represents a right wing ideology that would make the Minister for Finance proud. The Tánaiste also prides herself on being on the extreme right of the Irish political spectrum. The Government must be really proud of its representative in Tipperary South.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: Fianna Fáil has been to the left of the Labour Party for the past 20 years. What about the minimum wage?</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Scanlon: I welcome the Minister. I also welcome the opportunity to speak on the improvements in social welfare contained in the budget. The social welfare improvements in this year's budget will cost &euro;630 million in a full year, a massive increase of &euro;100 million on last year. I do not know where the Senator heard about cutbacks.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: I will give a Senator a copy of the savage 16.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Scanlon: The &euro;630 million figure for this year stands in stark comparison to the &euro;273 million increase in the rainbow Government's last budget in 1997.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Browne: Is the Senator talking about the present or the past?</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: History will see the rainbow Government as the good Government it was.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Scanlon: Social welfare expenditure in 2004 will be almost two and a half times the level set by Labour and Fine Gael when last in Government. Furthermore, as a result of changes made in budget 2002, all social welfare weekly increases are paid with effect from 1 January. As a result, increases for those dependent on social welfare are payable more than five months earlier than when Fine Gael and Labour were last in Government. These facts must be appreciated and we should commend something when it is being done correctly.</P>
    <P>For every &euro;3 that will be spent by the Government in 2004, almost &euro;1 will go to social welfare recipients. An estimated 970,000 people are expected to claim weekly social welfare payments next year and almost 1.5 million people, including dependants &ndash; two out of every five people in the State &ndash; will benefit from them. The increase of &euro;10 in all weekly social welfare payments is well ahead of the rate of inflation. It represents an increase ranging from 6% to 8%. In the case of <Col N="2153" />the lowest payments, this is more than three times the expected rate of inflation of 2.5% in 2004.</P>
    <P>The number of people at work has increased to almost 1.8 million and the rate of unemployment has fallen dramatically from 10% to 4.3%.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: The number of jobs has also fallen dramatically.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Wilson: There has been an increase in jobs.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. U. Burke: The Senator must be referring to the promised figure.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: The Senator is quoting from the election manifesto, a fundamentally flawed document.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Browne: The IDA has revealed that 12,000 jobs have been lost and only 9,000 have been created.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Scanlon: Social welfare spending has increased from &euro;5.74 billion in 1997 to a projected &euro;11.26 billion in 2004 &ndash; almost double and well in excess of the rate of inflation. Payment rates for both recipients and their families have been considerably improved in real terms. Substantial improvements in the conditions for entitlement to a range of social welfare schemes and services have been implemented. New social welfare benefits, such as farm assist, carer's benefit, widowed parent grant and respite care grant, have been introduced and enhanced.</P>
    <P>The budget increased the personal rate of disability and unemployment benefit by &euro;10 to &euro;134.80. In its last budget, the rainbow Government increased this by a mere &euro;3.81. The respite care grant will be increased to &euro;835 per annum from June 2004. Any improvements that can be made in this area are to be welcomed. The widowed parent grant was increased to &euro;2,700 from budget day.</P>
    <P>According to the ESRI, the overall level of consistent poverty in 1998 was 8.2%. This level has been reduced by over a third to 5.2% in 2001, the latest year for which figures are available. I am a member of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in my local community. It is a fantastic organisation and has done much good work. It has been my experience that poverty in a household is accompanied by an underlying problem of either alcohol or drug abuse.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: The Senator should tell the Taoiseach to believe what the Society of St. Vincent de Paul says.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Scanlon: It is an excellent organisation and has done a lot of good work. I have years of experience in the organisation and have seen the problems that exist. There is always an underlying problem, usually alcohol, in poverty stricken households that require help from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.</P>
    <P>No Government has increased children's allow<Col N="2154" />ance as much as this one. A recent television programme interviewed parents and asked them about their young teenage children. Even though it was a school day, the children were running wild. Those children are supposed to be in school until they are 16 years old. Children must stay in school if they are to have any chance of having a good life. If there was a connection between children attending school and the payment of children's allowance to parents, would it make a difference? We should examine this because it is wrong that children are not in school. Whatever opportunities they will have in life will be afforded to them through education. It just might make a difference.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister and her officials well and everybody a happy Christmas.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Browne: I was not planning to speak on this Bill today but when I heard Senators Wilson and Mansergh, I decided I would have to introduce common sense to the debate.</P>
    
    <P>Mary Coughlan: The Senator cannot contain himself.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Browne: I was at a wedding recently in Senator Wilson's home county of Cavan and spoke to a gentleman who works in France. I asked him what he thought of France and whether he was thinking of returning to Ireland, to which he replied that he had bought an apartment situated one hour from Paris for £100,000 and that there was an excellent transport system in the area. He joined the local soccer team and had to do a medical examination&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Wilson: They do not play soccer in Cavan.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Browne: The medical examination cost him &euro;20 but he was able to reclaim &euro;15 of this sum immediately&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Wilson: That is the reason they are nearly bankrupt.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Browne: &mdash;and write off the remaining &euro;5 against tax. This is indicative of a really decent PRSI system that affords real benefits.</P>
    <P>I was intrigued by the debate between Senators McCarthy and Mansergh about right-wing and left-wing politics. We give both styles of politics a bad name in Ireland because we do not have either. We have an <i>à la carte</i> approach and choose some policies from both. Consider the increases in children's allowance, for example. They may not be as significant as those promised before the last general election but they are increases nevertheless. However, some children are still being taught in substandard schools, some are affected by very poor infrastructure in terms of broadband communications and transport while others are forced to sleep in substandard accommodation every night. Therefore, the Government is providing children's allowance but ignoring other <Col N="2155" />factors. It is not very good at painting the overall picture.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Poverty&rdquo; is a very interesting word. I was a member of a delegation which visited Lesotho in Africa last week on a trip organised by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt. There is no doubt that there is genuine poverty in Lesotho. Poverty in Ireland is of a different nature, such that we can nearly predict how children of seven or eight years will end up. I rang the office of the Minister for Education and Science recently and was intrigued to discover that an ex-student of mine worked there. He used to attend a certain school in Dublin where I taught. We discussed how other ex-pupils were getting on and, unfortunately, I was able to predict fairly accurately what they were doing with their lives, even though I had not met them for seven or eight years. According to the governor of Mountjoy Prison, Mr. Lonergan, a high percentage of people from certain areas in Dublin end up in jail while those from other parts do not.</P>
    <P>This is not just an urban problem. Great strides have been made in recognising that it also affects rural areas but huge challenges still remain. In some respects, rural poverty is worse than urban poverty. In Carlow there is a new bus service that serves many remote rural areas. At times we forget people might not have access to cars, other forms of transport and communications facilities.</P>
    <P>We should be targeting resources where they are needed most. Those responsible for social welfare have made a few major mistakes lately. One was giving medical cards to those over 70 years. This sounded lovely and everyone welcomed it but nobody had thought it through as it was discovered that there were many more over 70 years than was originally envisaged. Furthermore, it is ridiculous to think that millionaires such as Michael Smurfit who are over 70 years are entitled to medical cards. A man who attended one of my clinics recently told me his daughter had an over-sized kidney and that he was having seizures, yet he has been refused a medical card. All of us involved in politics, irrespective of whether we are on the right or left, are involved to make life better for people but one questions this when one encounters such cases.</P>
    <P>Consider the way the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has handled immigration. It has forced immigrants to avail of social welfare, although, in many instances, they do not want to do so. Most immigrants are economic migrants rather than asylum seekers and want to earn money and have a better quality of life. Instead, they are stopped from doing so. If I was Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I would issue a temporary work visa to such people immediately which would allow them to work and play a positive part in the economy while their applications were being processed. This is not how the current system works and it causes huge resentment among the public, particularly the working classes, who sometimes believe people <Col N="2156" />from other countries are receiving all of the benefits. We have all had conversations with constituents which began with the line, &ldquo;I am not being racist, but . . . , &ldquo; and ended in a tirade of abuse. We hear stories about refugees getting cars and houses but this is not the case.</P>
    <P>As I stated, we should be targeting resources where they are needed. Not every 70 year old needs a medical card. They may have millions in their bank accounts or may not have medical conditions that warrant their being issued with a medical card. We must also accept that 70 years is no longer considered to be a great age.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts revealed that the Office of Public Works had bought premises throughout the country for asylum seekers. These premises have been empty for months, if not years, and considerable sums are spent on security alone. They have never been used for asylum seekers, yet when we seek money for projects in the areas we represent, we are told there is no money available. It is a question of targeting resources where they are needed most.</P>
    <P>I referred to a man living in France who was making PRSI contributions and did not object to doing so. He had received real benefits as a result. When I started teaching in 1995, I believe I was among the first to pay the full rate of PRSI for which I received benefits in terms of dental and medical care. Before 1995, graduates were paying PRSI but not at the full rate and were getting nothing in return. They were receiving no dental or optical care. The Minister should examine this. People have no objection to making PRSI contributions if they receive real benefits, to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>Senator Mansergh was certainly very passionate about poverty and relative poverty. However, I am getting tired of hearing criticisms of the rainbow Government a year and a half after the general election. It is time to move on. In 1995 and 1997 it was far easier to afford to buy a house. At least people had some chance of doing so unlike today. Most of us considered buying a second property in Dublin when we became Members of the Seanad but I found it amusing to see the price of property in the property pages. I would hate to be a member of a young family trying to buy a property in Dublin because it would cost at least &euro;300,000. The Government has made a bags of the housing sector and is forcing families to move further and further from their extended families. They are being forced out into the suburbs. This will create further social problems.</P>
    <P>I taught in both Dublin and Carlow and discovered that although there were the same problems in both areas, they were less pronounced in Carlow because the students had a family network in the area. In Dublin, when there was family breakdown, poverty and no extended family to look after those affected, the problems were more serious.</P>
    <P>Senator Scanlon mentioned education for schools. The Government's record in this area is atrocious. It took the power away from the Garda <Col N="2157" />and created education and welfare officers without funding them properly. There was a dispute in Dublin which may now be resolved but for about a year there were no education welfare officers working, which meant children were mitching from school.</P>
    <P>The Minister may be better qualified to deal with the next matter, because as far as I know I have no offspring.</P>
    
    <P>Mary Coughlan: We hope.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Browne: I am told that if one has four children one gets a certain rate for the first child and increased rates for the second, third and fourth. When the first child turns 16 or 18 the second child goes on to the first child rate. Just because one child turns 16 does not mean one suddenly has one child less and mothers have asked me why they are discriminated against. They still have the first child, even though he or she is over 16 and does not count for children's allowance, but the second child moves up to the first child position. Does the Minister understand my point?</P>
    
    <P>Mary Coughlan: Yes.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Browne: The parents get a reduced amount in children's allowance. They are already at a loss on one child and then they are at a further loss as their other children change bracket.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: The Senator will have to start soon.</P>
    
    <P>Ms Feeney: I welcome the Minister, who seems to be spending as much time here as some Senators. That shows the kind of Minister she is. She gives us a lot of time which we appreciate. It is an honour for us who have taken part in today's debate with her, as we know her as a caring and compassionate Minister.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. U. Burke: If she was giving out more.</P>
    
    <P>Ms Feeney: This is because she is a young wife and mother. I was not due to speak but I heard Senator Browne on the monitor in my office. He said he wanted to put some sense into the debate and I was so incensed that I decided to contribute.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: And make the debate sensible.</P>
    
    <P>Ms Feeney: I do not know about that.</P>
    <P>I heard Senator Browne talk about the French medical and social welfare systems. Senator Browne should get real and compare like with like. He and I know what one has to pay for that in France and other European countries. It is much more than we pay here.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. U. Burke: We are catching up fast.</P>
    
    <P>Ms Feeney: Under this Government and its predecessor social welfare payments have out<Col N="2158" />paced inflation to a significant degree. All our European partners are on record as saying they would love to be in our position.</P>
    <P>I speak with some authority on child benefit. As a mother I do very well out of child benefit, for which I thank the Minister. I have four children.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: Well done.</P>
    
    <P>Ms Feeney: I am delighted and I do not feel at all discriminated against if my first, second, third or fourth child move on at age 16, when one reapplies for child benefit. I do not feel incensed or hard done by when they reach 16, as I continue to claim for them until they are 18 provided they are in training or in full-time employment.</P>
    <P>Anyone would be proud of this Bill. It provides for an increase of &euro;28 in the weekly income of a household and expands the threshold from &euro;407 in the case of a family with one child to &euro;584 in the case of a family with eight or more children. The improvement in the minimum level of family income support is up from &euro;13 to &euro;20 per week, another integral aspect of a welfare programme which is committed to ensuring those on the brink or getting into difficulties are well looked after.</P>
    <P>Recent improvements in child benefit are complemented by the provision of an additional &euro;1 million for the school meals scheme, which again focuses on children who are disadvantaged or who have special needs. At roughly this time yesterday we were discussing the Ombudsman for Children, and these initiatives, which are working in tandem, provide for children who are victimised or whose families are under pressure.</P>
    <P>On completion of this project we will see Government investment in this scheme raised by an additional &euro;1.27 billion. This represents a considerable change from when the Opposition was in Government in 1997 and child benefit was &euro;38.09 for the first and second children, and &euro;49.52 for the third and subsequent children.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: Here we go again, for the fourth time.</P>
    
    <P>Ms Feeney: No wonder the Senator is muttering when he is ashamed of where he is coming from. Now we see&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: We are counting.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. U. Burke: That is the fourth time.</P>
    
    <P>An Leas-Chathaoirleach: Senator Feeney without interruption.</P>
    
    <P>Ms Feeney: There is no need to point fingers.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: We are just counting.</P>
    
    <P>Ms Feeney: As I told the Senator previously, if Members opposite listened to us they would not be half as vexed with us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2159" /></P>
    <P>Mr. Cummins: That is four times already.</P>
    
    <P>Ms Feeney: I will repeat it though I might sound a little boring.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: That is five times.</P>
    
    <P>Ms Feeney: We have set the supplement at &euro;131.60 to &euro;165.30, respectively, from next April. I do not know anyone who would be unhappy with that. I am delighted with the increase and I do not know anybody who is not. This massive investment will bring child benefit expenditure to &euro;1.75 billion in 2004. As I said, I am delighted with this wonderful Bill and the Minister's compassionate, caring personality comes across in it. It comes from someone who is a mother and knows about running a family herself. I am delighted to support the Bill and I do so in the knowledge that once again Fianna Fáil is helping the youngest and most vulnerable in society. I say to the knockers to go and enjoy Christmas.</P>
    <P>Nobody is listening to those seeking to belittle us in Government, not even the electorate.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: CORI and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul are listening.</P>
    
    <P>An Leas-Chathaoirleach: Senator Feeney without interruption.</P>
    
    <P>Ms Feeney: The Opposition hates to be reminded of what we say in Fianna Fáil: a lot done, more to do.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: Everyone is done at this stage.</P>
    
    <P>Ms Feeney: We are still on target and we are still on line. It was said to Fine Gael yesterday that it has RIP over the door. Fine Gael would want to cop on and take the hint.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: Rumours of our demise have been greatly exaggerated, as I said previously.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. U. Burke: I welcome the Minister to the House. I realise that if she had access to funding she probably would have introduced a different Bill. Opposition Members would then not have to highlight the reality facing so many people in poverty in both urban and rural areas.</P>
    <P>Senator Feeney spoke about the wonderful increases in child benefit. Does she realise the increase amounts to 20 cent a day? What does that mean in reality to a household in poverty?</P>
    
    <P>Ms Feeney: It is 20 cent more than the Senator's party ever gave.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. U. Burke: Such a family must pay for clothes, food, ESB bills, gas bills, television licence and insurance and tax for a car. I tolerated listening to Senators Mansergh, Feeney and others, who are not in need, but for a reliable assessment of the budget one must turn to CORI or the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. Senator <Col N="2160" />Scanlon said he was a member of that society, and I acknowledge the great work that organisation does, but is he influenced in any way by the recent statement by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul that it has never experienced such need or so many people looking for direct finance, food vouchers or other forms of aid? We accept the underlying factors as stated by the Minister but we must face the reality of poverty and try to address it. That need has not been matched by the budget.</P>
    <P>I realise the Minister cannot extricate herself from her straitjacket. She is limited and restricted no matter how willing she is to change things and fulfil the promises made before the election. When I see a scramble by Senators to go back and quote statistics from 1997, it is a sure indication of their vulnerability and the reality of today's situation. It is a damning indictment of the failure of this Government to acknowledge the poor. The gap between the rich and poor has widened substantially &ndash; by &euro;249 &ndash; during the seven years of this Government and will grow further if the Government sustains it proportionately until 2007. This illustrates the myth of the promises given in past agreements as to what the Government will have achieved by 2007. We have had this experience time and again in every area.</P>
    <P>Within the next three weeks, before we return to this House, we expect another major issue to arise. Many people have to visit the doctor's surgery over Christmas because someone in their family is ill but many of them have no medical card because they fall outside the new guidelines. In the run up to the election, 200,000 extra medical cards were promised. Will the Minister cushion these people and provide medical cards to those in need? Chief executive officers have discretion to provide for special needs at local level but no funding is being made available by the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to provide a special need category medical card.</P>
    <P>Last year's guidelines on medical cards were insignificant and increases in the gross wage were very small. A single person living at home on an income of &euro;123 per week is not entitled to a medical card. Do the Minister and Members on the other side of the House call that progress or an advance on the situation we had in 1997? Let them look at the numbers who had medical cards then relative to today's numbers. We can talk about relative poverty but there are greater numbers of people in need today than ever, whatever the reason.</P>
    <P>We talk about the word inclusion but each of the 16 savage cutbacks goes some part of the road towards excluding greater numbers of those who need support. I have referred before to the situation regarding child benefit. If we examine the cutbacks one after the other, we come to the issue of rent supplement. I believe the Minister was forced into a situation where she had to make cut after cut. She was to hit every supplement.</P>
    <P>Focus Ireland put it best and its comments put <Col N="2161" />beyond contradiction the impact of the rent supplement measure introduced to accrue savings. Focus Ireland maintains that the Government has used the opportunity of the Book of Estimates to introduce a number of hard-hitting changes in social welfare that will affect those most in need in our society. It states that the most alarming of these changes are to housing income support under the SWA rent supplement scheme which could force thousands of people to become homeless. That is the reality. It points out that currently 60,000 people rely on SWA rent supplement to keep a roof over their heads. It states that overall the cost of the scheme has risen to &euro;330 million in 2003 but the Government has now decided that rent supplement is only to meet income maintenance needs and not long-term housing needs.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister allow this to continue and drive thousands more people out on to the streets to live in cardboard boxes &ndash; something we can witness any night on our streets? I am delighted to see the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Treacy, in the ministerial chair. If he can sit into his car to drive to Ballinasloe and ignore the reality on the streets of this city and many other cities and towns in this country, the callousness of the Government towards the need of the people is beyond doubt. The Minister of State too will have fallen into the callous disregard of people in need here.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Kitt: I welcome this Bill. Senator Ulick Burke spoke about cutbacks but as there has been an improvement of &euro;100 million since last year, I fail to see how he can use the term &ldquo;cutbacks&rdquo;.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. U. Burke: There have been 16 savage cuts.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Kitt: The total figure for social welfare improvements is &euro;630 million this year. When the rainbow Government was in power the total spend for a year was &euro;273 million. There has been a big change in the amount provided.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: One would expect that over seven years.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Kitt: Senator Ulick Burke mentioned poverty. We can all argue about the relative figures on poverty. The best judge is the ESRI which has clearly stated that consistent poverty fell from 15.1% in 1994 to 5.2% in 2001. In addition, consistent poverty among children has been reduced from 17% in 1997 to 6.5% in 2001. That is independent data which is informed by the development of the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion. These figures were submitted to the EU earlier this year. The data is verified, we can stand over it and I am glad the Minister mentioned it.</P>
    <P>There has been some criticism of the budget. Fr. Seán Healy of CORI mentioned a number of measures which should be taken and I agree with many of them. If we had enough money, we <Col N="2162" />would like to tackle every issue. We have a number of years to go yet in Government. Fr. Healy welcomed the significant increase in the respite care grant. A new rural social scheme is being introduced under the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. Farmers on farm assist will be eligible to participate in that scheme.</P>
    <P>There has also been an additional allocation for carers under one of our most important schemes. In cases where there are two pensioners in a household there is an increasing tendency for one of them to apply for carer's allowance, principally because he or she is doing the work of a carer and will get greater benefit from the allowance. That is very welcome. I greatly welcome the increase in the allowance, particularly the respite grant. I commend the Minister on what she has done in that regard. The improvement for old age pensioners, with the increases for widows and widowers, has been very positive.</P>
    <P>In the short time available to me I wish to refer to some services of the Department which are often taken for granted, particularly in the community resource area. In addition to grants for toddlers' groups and women's groups, there are now grants for men's groups also. There are several schemes in operation. I compliment the Minister on implementing and advancing them. Last Monday a new resource centre was opened in Ballygar in my constituency by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Treacy. He said, on behalf of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, that there was additional funding available, particularly for the Family Support Agency. I received a letter of thanks in recent days for my contribution towards securing funding for the centre. I have been informed that money has been sent to it to cover the shortfall in rent, legal and accountancy fees and the cost of the alarm system.</P>
    <P>The funding provided by the Family Support Agency for resource centres is very important. There has been an issue in connection with the salary levels of staff at such centres. There appears to be a difference in the level of payment, although I am not familiar with the details. Perhaps the Department will investigate the reason salaries are not at the same level for all those working in the centres.</P>
    <P>I was greatly impressed by the range of information available at the new centre in Ballygar. In the words of the director of the Family Support Agency, information empowers people. That type of empowerment, especially for women's groups and those living in disadvantaged areas, has been of great benefit, enabling those concerned to take a greater part in community activities.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the issue of medical cards is somewhat outside the scope of this debate. However, in response to Senator Ulick Burke, medical cards are issued on the basis of guidelines &ndash; there are no hard and fast rules laid down. Issues involving <Col N="2163" />illness and financial circumstances should be looked at. A medical card provides access to many other benefits. Perhaps the Minister or one of her ministerial colleagues will consider the issues involved.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has brought this Bill to the Seanad. It has been greatly welcomed throughout the country, with particular reference to child benefit which will increase by &euro;6 or &euro;8, depending on the number of children in a family, as from next April. Provision for child care has been increased substantially over the period of office of the Government.</P>
    <P>In complimenting the Minister I ask her to look again at the back-to-education scheme, in which there have been changes. On a previous occasion in the House I drew her attention to difficulties people might have in returning to education. While the matter has nothing to do with the budget, I raise it as a general issue, in terms of making this move as easy as possible. While some schemes may be subject to abuses, I have had no indication of any significant abuse of the back-to-education scheme, to which the reaction has been strongly positive. It has enabled people to progress through the education system and secure employment through schemes such as the rural social scheme and the various FÁS programmes.</P>
    <P>One of the measures of the Government's success has been the substantial increase in employment in recent years. I hope the Minister will continue her success in securing extra funds for social welfare schemes such as the additional &euro;100 million for improvements this year.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Mooney: I am honoured to have the opportunity for the first time in recent years to speak on the annual Social Welfare Bill. An innovative and visionary architecture has been applied to this Bill by our Minister. I use the term &ldquo;our Minister&rdquo; in a collective sense on the basis of the proximity of my county, Leitrim, and the Minister's area of south Donegal. I am reminded of a well known ballad sung by Bridie Gallagher some years ago entitled &ldquo;The Girl from Donegal&rdquo;. I hope the Minister will be remembered in song at some future time as well as in story.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: One hopes the words will not be written by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Mooney: Although I have introduced a note of levity to the proceedings, there is a very serious underlying edge&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: Perhaps the Senator will mention the Minister on his radio programme.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Mooney: I will be happy to play a request for her at any time.</P>
    <P>Other colleagues, on all sides of the House, <Col N="2164" />have dwelt on the broad thrust of the Bill and its specific impacts, as perceived in the course of their work as public representatives. I wish to focus specifically on the funds made available for carer's allowance and the respite care grant which has been increased by &euro;100. It may be said no amount of money is adequate in that regard. At the risk of using a cliché, I refer to the words of Our Lord in biblical times that the poor will always be with us. Far be it from me to go down the clerical road but I presume the intended meaning is that, despite the best efforts and most noble aspirations of any Administration, there will always be people who will fall through the net.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: That is certainly happening now.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Mooney: One attempts to address the poverty situation as one moves on. In that regard, I find it quite amazing to note the somewhat illogical stance taken on the so-called cutbacks of &euro;58 million. I know that people have to score political points. No doubt, if the Minister was on the Opposition side of the House, she would have to look through the detail of this social welfare Bill to find something one could latch onto in terms of criticism as has been done in this case.</P>
    <P>The Minister has very clearly spelled out how her decisions will impact on the vulnerable and less well-off sectors. To quote a legal term, &ldquo;The devil is in the detail&rdquo;. One will find that the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in society are still being looked after and their concerns addressed. While I understand the Minister has a long menu of replies to the debate so far, perhaps it might be helpful to indicate &ndash; in net terms, if possible &ndash; what the actual cutback will be. On the face of it, the figure of &euro;58 million, from an overall budget of &euro;11.4 billion, seems very small. Nevertheless, it has created more dissent and controversy than if the Minister had not received an extra &euro;100 million and had cut &euro;200 million or &euro;300 million, or a higher percentage.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: The Minister should explain it to those who will be affected.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Mooney: Perhaps the Minister will specify, in net terms, the actual impact. It is important that she and those of us who believe what she has done this year is for the benefit of people who are economically and socially excluded should have this matter clarified. We should make the case that when one looks at the detail, the impact will be minimal. To be brutally frank about reforms in the social welfare code, every Minister in every Administration has looked at ways of maximising the amount given to social welfare recipients and ensuring an efficient system. The one area in Government in which there must be constant monitoring of the State's money is social welfare expenditure. That accountability rests <Col N="2165" />ultimately with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs. Human nature, being what it is, will encourage people to bypass the system or take advantage of it. It happens in law, with tax experts and throughout the fields of human endeavour. People will always try to get more than they are entitled to or attempt to bypass the regulations to keep money in their pocket. Why should it be different for social welfare where the human condition is at its most vulnerable? People put a value on small amounts of money and will attempt to manipulate the system. It is incumbent on the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to ensure that the money is spent wisely&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: We are not talking about manipulating the system.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Mooney: The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, has already spelled it out, but it is important that she continues to do so.</P>
    <P>The message should go out from this House that this is one of the largest Votes that has been given to the Department of Social and Family Affairs in the history of the State. It has come at a time when we have been told to tighten our belts due to the worldwide economic downturn and when the big spending Departments' budgets get hit. I know the then Minister for Social Welfare in the rainbow Government must be bored out of his mind hearing this again, but he had the opportunity to do something real, imaginative and positive for the social welfare code. However, look at his record and the amount of money he gave in his last year.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: He had to clean up the mess left by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Mooney: Here was a man who spent all his life fighting for the underprivileged and the socially disadvantaged.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: He still does.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Mooney: Yes, and I have great admiration for him. However, in a purely narrow political context, he was given the top job where the buck stopped with him. In his discussions with the then Minister for Finance, it was down to him where spending would be prioritised that year. One only has to look at his record and contrast it with that of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan. She came into her job, after watching and observing the political scene as a backbencher, with a vision of what she wanted but also the political nous&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: More like a noose from the Minister for Finance.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: He landed her in it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2166" /></P>
    <P>Mr. Mooney: &mdash;to know what to do and where the most vulnerable in society needed action.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will return next year with a more significant increase in the respite care and carer's allowance. It is difficult to be objective on this issue and I will confess to being subjective. I am aware of a family in my area in which there are two severely disabled children. Those are their only children and I understand the difficulty facing that family in trying to raise these two pre-teen children. Can Members imagine being hit not once but twice by the same severe condition? I am not suggesting they are crying about their position. However, people such as these who are among the most vulnerable in our society need to be nourished, protected and encouraged in whatever way the State can with the means available.</P>
    <P>While I fully understand that the increase in the carer's allowance is approximately &euro;100, this is an area where the Minister for Social and Family Affairs can make her mark. We have had several debates on this issue in the Fianna Fáil Party through the years. I am on the side of those who argue it should not be means-tested. I understand this creates enormous difficulties in the Department. However, when one considers the number of people involved, what they experience and what they have to give up &ndash; in some cases women give up the flower of their youth &ndash; to look after people in unfortunate conditions, the State has an obligation to be generous, not penny-pinching. A means-test in this area with certain generous qualifying conditions should be applied.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social and Family Affairs should be rightly proud of this Bill. She has fought within and outside the party for it. At a time when there was belt-tightening and when the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, was perhaps not at his most generous, she significantly improved the budget to her Department. She also discharged her responsibility to ensure that public money was spent properly. I applaud the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and wish her well.</P>
    
    <P>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan): Gabhaim buíochas do na Seanadóirí uilig a ghlac páirt sa díospóireacht seo. B'fhéidir go raibh muid ag dul amú ón ábhar fána raibh muid in ainm is a bheith a labhairt. Sin ráite, tá seo fite fuaite le daoine le míchumas. A number of issues were raised on Second Stage by Senators on both sides of the House and I appreciate that time was against us. It is best that we stand back from philosophies, whether we are right, left or centre, because it does not serve any purpose but only aggravates Members on all sides of the House. Pontificating is a waste of our failing reserves of energy on the last week of the House sitting.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion on the <Col N="2167" />removal of the means-test for the carer's allowance, the cost of which is &euro;180 million this year. The Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs has carried out an extensive analysis of this and a number of practical recommendations have been forwarded to my Department. Following a number of discussions, I have indicated to the committee's chairman that the Department will look specifically at a number of these proposals. It is incumbent on us to evaluate matters, particularly when we examine the issue of the means test.</P>
    <P>Many Members spoke about giving medical cards to those in the over-70 age group and claimed it was a misdirected use of resources. That argument can be made for the removal of the carer's allowance from people able to support others in a caring capacity or to purchase care. It is often asked why they should be allowed to access resources which were difficult to obtain. On the basis of an overall evaluation of caring, long-term care and subvention, we will have to look at those issues.</P>
    <P>The Government promised to progress in this regard and this has been achieved this year. Up to 1,700 new applicants will come into carer's allowance and 2,100 persons, already in receipt of the allowance, will get an increase. The respite care grant has been more than beneficial and supportive to people acting in a caring capacity. We will never be able to pay people sufficiently to provide care. Payment is only a token towards the emotional strain that caring can cause. Care provision can be fulfilling but as we must prepare to pay for care. Senator Browne spoke about the French model for care which my Department will examine it when considering the ring-fencing PRSI contributions for long-term care. The Mercer report, which I published alongside the report on home subvention with the Minister for Health and Children, will undergo a consultation process in my Department at the beginning of next year. A working party will be set up to evaluate the best way of proceeding on the issue of caring. The harsh reality is that over the next 20 years we will have an ageing population which means we will not be adequately prepared to support the elderly and the disabled unless and until we have a long-term care strategy. I have asked the committee to evaluate the report &ndash; Senators may have the opportunity do so also in due course &ndash; and make recommendations on the best way forward.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, we must look at income support methodology. How this will be done is a matter we must decide as a nation, not necessarily based on our political perspectives. It will be pursued and will provide great challenges for us but what is good about it is that we are not in the same position as many of our colleagues in the European Union who have great difficulties with pension provision. While we talk about cuts, I am <Col N="2168" />glad I am not the German Chancellor or German Minister for Social Welfare, neither of whom has the resources to pay pensions. We do not want to go down that road. Pension provision is a matter on which we must grasp the nettle, which is what we have been doing in recent years. Thankfully we have been afforded the opportunity to prepare for the necessity of additional pension costs.</P>
    <P>Caring is a very emotive issue which touches all of us as public representatives, one which I will be fully pursuing during my sojourn as Minister for Social and Family Affairs. I appreciate that people have seen improvements. It is not that long ago when there was no carer's allowance, carer's benefit and respite care. We have seen and will continue to see progress, although there are a lot of concerns about the age profile of carers, many of whom are over the age of 65 years. There are also questions about position suitability and second payments. I know from all of the debates held in the recent past that the issue of carers has been to the fore.</P>
    <P>I have had a protracted discussion over the last two to three weeks in the Lower House and the select committee on the issue of child benefit and the promises made. If one looks at the figures for the target set ourselves in government, one will see that in 1997 we provided &euro;500 million for child benefit. The present target is &euro;2 billion. In 2004 we will spend a sum of &euro;1,750 million. This leaves us with a figure of approximately &euro;250 million. It is a target that can be and will be realised. While for some the timeframe is disappointing, I will not apologise for what has been achieved through child benefit &ndash; a child poverty and child care initiative &ndash; the only universal payment that takes away from the pull and drag discussions on the question of women in the home and at work. It is an excellent support. It is our intention to progress and reach the &euro;2 billion investment shortly.</P>
    <P>We will not have time later to analyse, line by line, the supplementary welfare allowance changes. All Members of the House, the largest portion of whom were county councillors, realise that rent supplement was not designed as a housing initiative but as an emergency initiative in the 1970s to support single men. It has now progressed and been expanded in recent years to the extent that over 50,000 people are now receiving it. Over &euro;350 million has been made available out of a total of &euro;530 million in the SWA budget.</P>
    <P>Rent supplement is not serving clients for a number of reasons, foremost among them being it is an emergency measure for those who have had a change of circumstances. Those on the housing list and receiving rent supplement do not have equal opportunities to move to long-term housing as they are perceived as being adequately supported in the housing market. They find themselves in a trap. They are doing their utmost to stay in good quality accommodation but cannot <Col N="2169" />be supported by the county council, which is wrong. There is no universality of implementation of the scheme. We discussed this matter during the debate on the Estimates when it was indicated that in County Tipperary one had to be on the housing list or assessed by the housing officer in order to receive rent supplement, which is not the case in many other counties. I have indicated that applicants must be assessed to be eligible.</P>
    <P>Those in receipt of rent supplement will not be affected. Those over the age of 65 years, whether renting for six months; in receipt of disability allowance, invalidity pension or blind pension, regardless of the six month provision; determined as being homeless under the NAPS definition of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government; on a housing list, regardless of whether they have been renting for six months, will not be affected.</P>
    <P>I am sorry Senator Henry is not here to hear what I have to say about emergency circumstances in cases where there are particular social problems, perhaps involving a psychiatric condition, an alcohol related problem or a crisis pregnancy. There is and always will be flexibility in the regulations for those who find themselves in trouble, regardless of the six months provision. We will be taking the opportunity of informing community welfare officers about the implementation of these changes in the regulations and reiterating a number of concerns raised in this House, the Lower House and by a number of organisations which I met yesterday.</P>
    <P>The only real change in the diet supplement relates to the methodology by which eligibility is considered. Anyone in receipt of the supplement will not be affected. There has never been a change in the methodology used. The cost of keeping to a particular diet has not been considered since 1996, nor have the increases in social welfare payments but only the methodology is being changed. People will still be entitled to a supplement if they need it.</P>
    <P>It is important to clarify what crèche supplement is. It is an emergency measure. It is not a supplement paid to the crèche but rather to a woman who is but not always a parent and who has particular circumstances that warrant the child being in a crèche. She may, for example, be in recovery or have to go to hospital. In Dublin some 90% of crèches are being supported by the Department of Health and Children. The SWA budget is used to top it up. I have said, however, that this is not the way forward. We have negotiated with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Health and Children to find a better, long-term solution for a number of the crèches in the city. In an emergency parents will get an exceptional needs payment to support them. There cannot be inequity within the system. In three health board <Col N="2170" />areas only one person was receiving the supplement. Up to recently most Members of this and the Lower House had never heard of it.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: We always knew it was available.</P>
    
    <P>Mary Coughlan: It is important that we highlight the facts on the floor of the House. It is not a supplement paid to the crèche; it has been designed to provide emergency support for a parent in particular circumstances where it is best that the child is cared for in a crèche. We have targets set under NAPS and under the programme for Government. They are well within our reach over the next three years. The additional &euro;630 million that has been provided to my Department will have a significant positive bearing on those who are in receipt of social welfare benefits. These are not done in isolation from the many other supports provided by my Department, for example the school meals scheme, and the &euro;20 million that is provided to the Family Support Agency to give families support in counselling and in family resource centres. All of these in addition to the income increases give more support to those who are less well off.</P>
    <P>I agree with one thing that was said, namely, while I have not been a Minister for very long, if I am not entitled to review and change policies, there is not much point in me being here.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: Hear, hear.</P>
    
    <P>Mary Coughlan: My duty is twofold. I must support the less well off and we may disagree on how to go about this. I also have a duty to make the best use of the resources available to me. I must do both in parallel and this is my intention. I also intend to look at the overall social welfare package. The huge funding provided in social welfare ten or 15 years ago was aimed at those who were unemployed because we had so much unemployment. We now have low unemployment and significant expansions of many schemes. It is unfair to claim the supports are not real as they are real supports and increases. While people may not agree, I believe it is preferable for a person or family to have a better basic payment than to be reliant on many of the little additions to which they become attached and which can change. In the case of a diet supplement, is it not preferable to have a better purchasing power within the basic payment than to rely on a small additional payment of 5, 10 or 30 cent?</P>
    <P>We must consider this and new directions within social policy. We must also be entitled to review, restructure and ensure value for money while at the same time supporting the less well off.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Mooney: The &euro;58 million has disappeared.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2171" /></P>
    <P>Mr. Cummins: The Senator should talk to the people who were in receipt of that money.</P>

    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTIONS.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <b></b>
    </P>
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;2.&ndash;The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the implications of abolishing the means test for carer's allowance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister touched on this matter in her Second Stage contribution. The carer's allowance formed a significant policy plank in the last general election and is a hugely emotive issue. Many people are providing an invaluable service to those who are not fortunate enough to be able to cater for themselves. This can be viewed in two ways. Some &euro;180 million is a considerable amount of money. However, I do not know how much money carers are saving the State. They play an invaluable role and, in the words of a former Taoiseach, are doing the State some service. This is a hugely important feature of the compassionate and caring side of many people.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately many people are forced into having to care for others. The means test will exclude many people who could do with the allowance. They are saving the State money and may not be very well off themselves. This was included along with a number of other measures in the report submitted to the Department by the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs. The Minister said this was discussed and considered at length. The capital gains tax rate was reduced some years ago from 40% to 20%. While we can talk about the rich and poor all night, there are ways of raising the appropriate finance to take this measure.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: I support the amendment. I referred to this matter during my Second Stage contribution. The value carers give to the State is immeasurable. As the Minister stated it is not possible to measure the cost of people caring for <Col N="2172" />the elderly and those not capable of looking after themselves. The amount of &euro;180 million is significant. This was the number one priority in the report from the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs. If we are serious about it, the Government should examine ways to raise the &euro;180 million necessary to look after those who have not received recognition over the years. Next year, instead of taking &euro;58 million from the Department of Social and Family Affairs, as the Minister for Finance did this year, perhaps he could divert &euro;180 million so that we could abolish the means test next year. While the Minister for Social and Family Affairs will need to do considerable work to convince the Minister for Finance, I am sure she is quite capable of doing so.</P>
    
    <P>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan): I thank the Senators for their great support. I look forward to their accompanying me to the Department of Finance when we negotiate the budget next year. We have deliberated on this matter on a number of occasions. The &euro;180 million would support an additional 20,000 carers. There is an eligibility criterion not only on means but also on providing full-time care and attention. As other carers would be providing fewer hours than set down by my Department, this only affects 20,000 people. While I do not have the exact figures, if we were to abolish this as well as the other eligibility criterion, it would cost a considerable amount of money.</P>
    <P>The disregards will be very beneficial. Some &euro;46 million was provided in 1997 and &euro;165 million this year, which represents a considerable increase in carer's allowance and benefit. We will return to this matter. It will be taken into consideration under the long-term care issue. The Senators are correct in saying that institutional care is much more expensive. A recent survey indicated that those who were being cared for preferred to be at home. While there are other considerations for those who are unable to stay at home, in the main people like to stay at home and have some freedom.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney will be aware of the pilot home subvention scheme in my health board area, which has been excellent and gives people considerable freedom. It not only necessitates an income support but also needs a service provision. Service provision is often better in rural areas than in urban areas because of active care for the aged groups and others who provide sheltered housing, meals on wheels two or three times a week, and little parties. They facilitate chiropodists, hairdressers etc. to come to the local day hospital or health centre. This is the type of framework which is reflective of Irish life. I do not want to see us becoming so European that we disregard our own people. However, there are changes in lifestyles and there are people living in Dublin without any family. People are left at <Col N="2173" />home when their families are much further away and we must also consider these realities.</P>
    <P>The issues of caring and long-term care must be considered in conjunction with service provision, which will be an all-encompassing issue in the next few years. I will progress further a number of the recommendations of the report produced by the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs. We will be able to deal with some simple recommendations, relating to matters such as the provision of information, within a few months. The other issues, which are not just income-based, will be equated to service provision. I appreciate that this amendment, which calls on the Minister to lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the implications of abolishing the means test, is merely a means of facilitating discussion on the matter. The reports are in place and we are keen to deal with their implementation, hopefully in the next year. I look forward to hearing the personal views of Senators, the joint committee and many organisations during the period of consultation on the provision of long-term care. Despite our goodwill, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: I thank the Minister for her comments. Before I withdraw the amendment, I wish to impress on the Minister the importance of producing a report on the abolition of the means test for carer's allowance. We have a duty of care in respect of carers who did not benefit from the boom years. I urge the Minister to take action on this front. I know she will do her best and I appreciate her endeavours.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: I move amendment No. 2:</P>
    <P>In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;2.&ndash;The Minister shall, as soon as may be, after the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report contrasting the benefits under the Social Welfare Code, when this Bill is enacted with&ndash;</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>)&nbsp;National Anti-Poverty Strategy,</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>)&nbsp;National Children's Strategy,</P>
    <P>(<i>c</i>)&nbsp;Health Strategy,</P>
    <P>(<i>d</i>)&nbsp;Sustaining Progress, and</P>
    <P>the Government Programme.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This self-explanatory amendment was also tabled by my party colleague on Committee Stage in the other House. I ask the Minister to comment on it.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Mooney: Perhaps the Minister would like to comment on the recent ESRI report on the reduction of poverty in real terms, to which she referred in her speech, in the context of the national anti-poverty strategy. What steps does she propose to take to continue the downward <Col N="2174" />movement in this area? Will the methodology be changed to accommodate the new economic environment in which we live? Those who were deemed to be poor or living below the poverty line 20 years ago would not be designated as such under the present criteria. Are the figures being massaged? Are we really attacking this? Are we making a success of our economic management in terms of the further reduction and, hopefully, elimination of poverty, notwithstanding what I said earlier about the Lord?</P>
    
    <P>Mary Coughlan: We all agree with the Senator's philosophy on the elimination of poverty. The national anti-poverty strategy sets out a number of objectives. It is hoped to reduce to 2% and ideally to eliminate consistent poverty, to build an inclusive society and to develop social capital, particularly for disadvantaged communities. When we discuss this issue from a social welfare perspective, we normally seek to achieve a rate of &euro;150 per week in 2002 terms for the lowest rates of social welfare, to be met by 2007. The Government strategy also seeks to eliminate long-term unemployment as soon as circumstances permit, but in any event not later than 2007, to halve the proportion of pupils with serious literacy difficulties by 2006 and to reduce the gap in premature mortality between the lowest and highest socio-economic groups by at least 10%.</P>
    <P>The national anti-poverty strategy is an integrated one. When one speaks of the achievement of the NAPS targets from a social welfare perspective, one is talking mainly about the lowest social welfare income supports. We have tried to progress towards that target in recent years and this year has seen some very progressive achievements to that end. It is my view that we will have to spend &euro;11 or &euro;12 in the next few years to reach a rate of &euro;150 per week by 2007. That is well within our reach. Although we have had to work in changed economic circumstances, we have made a considerable contribution to the achievement of that target in 2007. The last time I checked we were still in 2003, so we still have some time to achieve the targets by 2007.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: Last year was a busy one for the Government.</P>
    
    <P>Mary Coughlan: Every year is a busy year. We are tired of telling people how great we are.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: The Government did five years' work in one year.</P>
    
    <P>Mary Coughlan: The targets are reflected in the programme for Government and the partnership agreements. It is my view that we will reach the important targets unless there is an economic disaster, which I do not foresee. It is often better to set high targets so that the mind is focused on their achievement. I certainly feel that the targets in all parts of the national anti-poverty strategy, <Col N="2175" />including the social welfare elements, will be met. The social inclusion office in my Department, which is driving the achievement of the targets, works very well with a number of other Departments to keep these issues high on the agenda and to ensure that the targets are met.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: I move amendment No. 3:</P>
    <P>In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;2.&ndash;The Minister shall, as soon as may be, after the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the appropriateness of the basket currently used to determine the C.P.I. to social welfare recipients; the desirability of preparing, on at least an annual basis, of a separate index based on a basket of items appropriate to such recipients and the cost of preparing such an annual index.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We believe that this amendment should be examined in order that the relevance of the consumer price index to social welfare recipients can be ascertained. Perhaps the Minister or her officials can consider this suggestion after the Bill has been passed.</P>
    
    <P>Mary Coughlan: We have had many discussions on the methodology of setting targets and determining the appropriateness of the CPI basket. The number of items assessed as part of the CPI process is frightening. My Department does not have the wherewithal to provide a different type of indicator. We feel that the CPI is the best means of progression and we want to proceed with it because it is the best overall way of examining the purchasing power of a household. This has been reflected in the inflation rate that has been set. When one examines the increases of 6% and 8% in real terms in social welfare baseline payments, it is obvious that increases are well ahead of inflation. The increases enjoyed by some people are three times more than inflation, in terms of the purchasing power they had last year. One is often criticised because the real increases may be clawed back, but I have to say they are not clawed back. That they are real increases is especially evident when one considers there was an inflation rate of 2.5%, on average, last year. I do not doubt that the increases are being set well within the reach of those who receive social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to change the method of compiling the consumer price index. It is the best way forward because it gives an all-encompassing view of a number of items of necessity. I am not in a position to agree to this amendment. There would be concerns in the Department if I were to seek the establishment of a new way of comparing prices. I said to the Fine Gael spokesman in the other House that I look forward to the day <Col N="2176" />when I will go shopping with him. We will see what kind of value for money we will get in our basket.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Browne: Does the Minister refer to Deputy Ring?</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Wilson: The Minister would be a brave woman to go shopping with that fellow.</P>
    
    <P>Mary Coughlan: After we have finished, Deputy Ring and I might have different perspectives about what we consider the necessities of life. I am certainly not in a position to change the methodology by which we determine the consumer price index. I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Mooney: Does the Department take a hands-on approach to dealing with social welfare recipients, particularly families, by helping them to manage their weekly budget and prioritise necessities, as the Minister has said? The only reason I raise this is that I am constantly taken aback, particularly by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul at this time of year, which constantly refers to the fact that the number of people who seem simply unable to cope with the daily needs of life, such as feeding their children or getting them footwear, is growing rather than falling. We all grew up &ndash; I certainly did &ndash; getting meat perhaps only once every two weeks. In rural Ireland, the budget was managed. I know that the answer is a simple &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, but is this an area to which the Minister attaches particular importance?</P>
    
    <P>Mary Coughlan: The Department supports the money advice and budgetary service, MABS. Millions more have been provided for it. There are now 61 centres in the country. The last one to be opened was in my own town in Donegal, so one cannot say I showed favouritism to my own county. I had to wait until last. That excellent service is free, confidential and independent. It also has several protocols, for example, with the credit unions. It works with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Citizens Advice Bureaux, my own Department, local authorities, and voluntary and community organisations.</P>
    <P>Of all organisations, it has certainly been exemplary. It looks after people who find themselves in debt. We had a very fine project in County Mayo last year which I attended with some schoolchildren. With the MABS adviser, they learned exactly what the Senator is talking about, namely, how to budget effectively. I have considered giving some funding this year towards expanding and integrating this with the Department of Education and Science as part of citizenship education. It is often very easy to knock the Department until one finds out how much it does and the great amount of effort and time invested by many members of staff on an individual and group basis in supporting people and helping them in basic and second-chance education, part <Col N="2177" />of which is basic literacy and budgeting. All those very time-consuming and progressive initiatives are available throughout the country.</P>
    <P>It may be that it is only when one comes into this job that one appreciates how much work is being done by the Department with other community organisations and the vocational education committees. Budgeting is part of many of the courses provided. MABS is examining its expansion within the education service. That will be very fruitful. The pilot project conducted in Mayo was absolutely excellent and we were very proud of what the children were able to achieve in a very realistic way. Determining the priorities of life is an issue. Often, as Senator Scanlon has said regarding the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, it is social difficulties that reduce one's purchasing power when it comes to necessities. The free and independent MABS service has done excellent work in supporting people who find themselves in budgetary difficulties.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: I move amendment No. 4:</P>
    <P>In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;2.&ndash;The Minister shall, as soon as may be, after the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the desirability of index linking all payments under the Acts each year in line with inflation.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Tabling this amendment does not, of course, preclude any Minister from granting increases above and beyond index-linking payments. There are a fair number of areas which did not see any increases this year and have not seen increases, as outlined, since 1994 in some instances. I ask for a report to be published on the desirability of automatically index-linking the payments under the Acts.</P>
    
    <P>Mary Coughlan: The Senator has answered his own question. If we had automatically index-linked payments over the last few years, we would have had less available. That is quite paradoxical, given that we are all jumping up and down on both sides of the House on this matter. However, we would be worse off if we had payments indexed automatically. I appreciate the Senator said that there would be flexibility for the Minister to act.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Cummins: It would cater for the payments that have not been increased.</P>
    
    <P>Mary Coughlan: This year everyone received &euro;10 extra support. The qualified adult allowance was increased. There was a specific increase for those on invalidity pensions and for widows and widowers over 66 who find themselves in an anomalous situation. If this were tied to the CPI, <Col N="2178" />I would be increasing payments by 2.5% rather than 6% to 8%.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: I do not think there has been a single occasion since 1987, at least under Fianna Fáil Governments, where the increases have not been at least at the rate of inflation; they are usually much more. The Senator is referring to the specific point of the child dependant allowance. A study was conducted during the time of the rainbow coalition under the auspices of Deputy De Rossa as Minister for Social Welfare. People were bothered about poverty traps, and there was a strong recommendation by the interdepartmental committee that one should increase child benefit and maintain child dependant allowance. It was a quite conscious social policy decision taken by the rainbow coalition Government and continued since. We ought to be aware of that.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Sections 2 to 7, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 8.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 8 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    
    <P>Acting Chairman: Senator McCarthy has indicated his opposition to this section.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: I did so for obvious reasons. I would welcome the Minister's comments in this regard.</P>
    
    <P>Mary Coughlan: Does that mean the Senator does not understand the section?</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: It means the Minister does not have the answer ready.</P>
    
    <P>Mary Coughlan: A key component of the administration of the benefits system and its practical operation is the concept of continuity in a claim and the notion of linked claims. Consequently, where a person makes an unemployment benefit or disability benefit claim within 13 weeks of the end of a previous claim, both claims may be linked, fully in the case of unemployment benefit and partially in the case of disability benefit. The principal advantage of claim linking for the recipient is that he or she may maintain some or all of the entitlements established during the course of the first claim, for example, the retention of entitlements or payment at a higher rate rather than disallowance or lower rates because of a new benefit year applying to the second claim for unemployment benefit only or payment of secondary benefits, such as smokeless fuel allowance, from the start of the second claim. We will be utterly confused now.</P>
    <P>Overall, extending the period during which two claims may link will, by increasing the number of linked claims, cause the entitlement to be exhaus<Col N="2179" />ted earlier, thereby reducing the overall number of weeks of payment. The effect will be partially offset by the retention of entitlements which would not have applied without the extended linking period. In a changing labour market and the consequent change in work patterns to, for instance, short-term temporary employment, it is considered appropriate that the short-term social welfare schemes should adapt accordingly.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: Perhaps the Minister might repeat that.</P>
    
    <P>Acting Chairman: Under the Standing Orders of the House, one may not be repetitive.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 to 16, inclusive, agreed to.</P>

    <P>Bill reported without amendment and received for final consideration.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Moylan: I wish to express our thanks to the Minister on introducing the Bill. Someone commented earlier that she is in a straitjacket. It would be a brave Minister for Finance or any other Minister who would be able to put Deputy Mary Coughlan in a straitjacket.</P>
    <P>People have stated that consideration must be given to the matter of rent supplements. I have been of the view for some time that the system of rent supplements is nothing short of an ATM for landlords and the Minister is correct to tackle the problems that exist in this area. I compliment her on her work to date.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Wilson: I thank the Minister for coming before the House and for remaining here for the duration of the debate. Senator McCarthy referred to decentralisation on a number of occasions. It would be my desire, I hope the Taoiseach is listening, that in a few short months this great Minister for Social and Family Affairs might be moved to the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources which is due to be transferred, in its entirety, to Cavan town.</P>
    
    <P>Acting Chairman: Is that in addition to her current responsibilities?</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Wilson: The Minister has performed admirably in the Department of Social and Family Affairs. I am sure she will be able to deal with Cavan.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2180" /></P>
    <P>Mr. Cummins: I thank the Minister for providing explanations in respect of many of the sections in the Bill. I was delighted that she did not repeat the explanation she provided on section 8. I thank her for remaining in the Chamber for the entire debate.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: I thank the Minister for her attendance in the Chamber. She has been generous recently with her time&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Mooney: And her money.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: &mdash;as opposed to her Department's budget. I imagine the position she occupies is quite difficult. I would not like to be obliged to seek funding for such a complex Department from the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. That, in itself, deserves recognition.</P>
    
    <P>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan): I am delighted to have been able to come before the House to take the debate on the Bill. I thank Senators on all sides for their forbearance and contributions. There will, of course, be another social welfare Bill in the new year. I am glad that so many people sympathise with me, but I do not know why they do so. I have the largest spending Department in the Government, with a budget of over &euro;11.2 billion.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. B. Hayes: Eaten bread is soon forgotten.</P>
    
    <P>Mary Coughlan: Christmas is coming and so is the Cathaoirleach. I thank him and the members of the staff for their support over the year. I wish them and Senators the compliments of the season.</P>
    
    <P>Ms O'Rourke: I wish the Minister the compliments of the season.</P>
    
    <P>Mary Coughlan: I also take this opportunity to thank my staff. One does not appreciate these people until one comes to rely on them. They worked tirelessly in recent weeks in preparing for the budget, in supporting the legislative measures attached thereto and in ensuring that people will receive their payments on time on 1 January.</P>

    <P Just="Center">
      <b></b>
    </P>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon): I welcome this opportunity to address the Seanad on the Appropriation Bill 2003, the main purpose of which is to give statutory effect to the departmental Estimates for supply services, both current and capital, including all Supplementary Estimates approved by the Dáil since the last Appropriation Act. Apart from the main provisions dealing with the Estimates, the Bill also includes a technical provision to allow for deferment of the end-year deadline for the financial resolutions passed on budget night. As in previous years, the Seanad is also being asked to approve an early signature motion to facilitate a request to the President to sign the Bill earlier than would normally be the case.</P>
    <P>The Bill appropriates to the various services listed in the Schedule for the year ending 31 December 2003 the net sum of &euro;31,040,999,000. This amount comprises the original net Estimates of &euro;30,79,1512,000 approved by the Dáil prior to the summer recess and net Supplementary Estimates of &euro;249,487,000 recently approved by the Dáil. The Bill also seeks approval for the use of departmental receipts amounting to &euro;2,625,126,000 as appropriations-in-aid of the services listed in the Schedule.</P>
    <P>As indicated by the Minister for Finance in the debate on the 2003 Estimates, the strategy underpinning the Estimates was to bring our spending increases more into line with the rate of growth in tax revenue. The only other alternatives would have been higher taxation or higher borrowing. While following an approach of prudent management of the public finances, the Government also sought to provide substantial funding in 2003 for <Col N="2182" />the priority areas of health, social welfare, education and transport infrastructure.</P>
    <P>As already stated, the Estimates and Supplementary Estimates included in the Schedule to the Appropriation Bill have already been approved by the Dáil. The Bill seeks to give formal legal effect to these. I will now briefly outline some of the detail of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 1 gives statutory effect to the departmental Estimates for the supply services, including all Supplementary Estimates, approved by the Dáil since the last Appropriation Act. Subsection (1) of this section appropriates the total net provision of &euro;31 billion to the various supply services for Departments and offices as listed in the Schedule. In addition, subsection (2) provides for the application of a total amount of over &euro;2.6 billion in departmental receipts as appropriations-in-aid of the grants for the supply services of those Departments and offices.</P>
    <P>The Dáil approved the original 2003 net Estimates for departmental spending which totalled &euro;30.8 billion prior to the summer recess. Since then, it has approved 12 Supplementary Estimates for various Departments totalling nearly &euro;250 million. This extra amount brings the net total grant for spending on supply services in 2003 to over &euro;31 billion. Allowing for appropriations-in-aid of over &euro;2.6 billion, Departments and Offices were allocated nearly &euro;34 billion to fund gross spending on services and programmes. This is before account is taken of non-Exchequer spending from the social insurance fund and the national training fund of a further &euro;4.9 billion. In total, therefore, nearly &euro;39 billion was provided for investment in programmes and services in 2003.</P>
    <P>As stated, nearly &euro;250 million was approved in supplementary funding in 2003. I will now outline briefly the main factors which have given rise to the additional expenditure and the requirement for the Supplementary Estimates this year. The amounts are as follows: Department of Social and Family Affairs, &euro;85 million; Department of Education and Science, &euro;65.7 million; Department of Health and Children, &euro;62.5 million; increases in remuneration and pensions, &euro;36 million; and small or token Supplementary Estimates across a range of other Votes, &euro;300,000.</P>
    <P>The additional spending requirement for the Department of Social and Family Affairs in 2003 is &euro;85 million. This arises mainly from additional costs of supplementary welfare allowances, mainly rent supplement, child benefit, free schemes, carer's allowance, disability allowances and the cost of the Christmas bonus at 100%.</P>
    <P>A Supplementary Estimate was sought by the Department of Education and Science in order to provide additional funding of &euro;12 million for third level higher education grants and to meet an expected shortfall on receipts from the European Social Fund &ndash; ESF. The Supplementary Esti<Col N="2183" />mate allowed for a significant shortfall on ESF receipts of &euro;53.7 million, whereas the expected shortfall on the Education and Science Vote is some &euro;18 million. In order to be prudent &ndash; because ESF receipts are received very late in the year &ndash; the Supplementary Estimate has allowed for the eventuality that there is a bigger shortfall than is actually expected.</P>
    <P>The net additional spending requirement in 2003 for the Department of Health and Children is &euro;62.5 million which is significantly less than 1% of the overall budget for the health services. Of the total Supplementary Estimate required, the bulk is in respect of pay awards and agreements delivered through recognised processes and additional spending on the demand-led general medical scheme. The pay awards were to meet the costs of the parallel benchmarking process and the settlement of the public health doctors' dispute. Additional spending on the GMS of &euro;60 million was also allowed for in the Supplementary Estimate. This a demand-led scheme provided under specific statutory entitlement. It should be noted that the extra costs arising in these areas were partially offset by savings in other programmes or surplus appropriations-in-aid. This reduced the net additional amount sought from the Exchequer to &euro;62.5 million.</P>
    <P>No provision was included in the revised Estimates published last February for the costs of settling an equality case with the CPSU grades as the negotiations were ongoing at that stage. A separate Vote for increases in remuneration and pensions has now been introduced from which the costs arising in the various Offices and Departments are being paid. This means that separate Supplementary Estimates are not required on the individual Votes concerned. The provision for the settlement, including employer's PRSI costs, is &euro;36 million.</P>
    <P>A number of small or token Supplementary Estimates were also approved across a range of Votes. Small Supplementary Estimates &ndash; less than &euro;300,000 &ndash; were sought for the Civil Service Commission and the Office of the Ombudsman in order to allow additional appropriations-in-aid to be spent and fund some additional accommodation and pension costs arising.</P>
    <P>Three token Supplementary Estimates were sought for the Justice group of Votes to fund additional costs in certain areas which were fully offset by other savings or additional appropriations-in-aid. Token Supplementary Estimates were sought by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General to allow that Office spend additional appropriations-in-aid. The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs took a Supplementary Estimate in order to provide additional money for the Western Investment Fund, a grant-in-aid subhead, while the <Col N="2184" />Office of Public Works took a Supplementary Estimate for technical reasons.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimates do not convey the full story in relation to expenditure on services provided by Departments in 2003. It is anticipated that the additional pressures reflected in the Supplementary Estimates of nearly &euro;250 million will be offset by savings elsewhere across the Votes. This means that the supplementary funding approved is consistent with the forecast outturn included in the recently published White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure.</P>
    <P>It is expected that there will be a net excess on voted spending on services of &euro;115 million, less than one half of 1% of the revised Estimates provision. The year-on-year increase in net voted spending is expected to be 7.1% which is in line with the target set when the revised Estimates were published last February. The actual end of year outturn will be published as part of the end of year Exchequer statement on 5 January.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with section 2 of the Bill. Article 17.1.2º of the Constitution requires that the Financial Resolutions of each year must be enacted into law by the end of that year but also allows for the end of year deadline to be deferred if an Act to that effect is passed before the end of that year, in this case, before 31 December 2003. This section makes provision for this deferment to be invoked. The inclusion of this provision in the Appropriation Bill will maintain the normal statutory deadlines for passing budget measures into law, that is, 84 days for completion of Second Stage and four months for enactment of the Finance Bill. Identical provisions have been included since the 1997 Appropriation Act.</P>
    <P>The Seanad is also being asked to approve an early signature motion in order that the President may be requested to sign the Bill earlier than the fifth day after it is presented to her. The Seanad's approval for such a motion is sought each year in order to ensure the necessary legislative authority is in place for the final end of year issues from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to review briefly the improved arrangements for the control and management of public expenditure agreed by the Government and introduced this year. Members of this House may recall the debate on the matter last February. The measures introduced included: the publication of the 2003 spending profiles last January; the preparation of monthly spending reports for Government by the Minister for Finance; the preparation of bi-monthly reports for Government by the Ministers of the four largest current spending Departments &ndash; Education and Science, Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and Social and Family Affairs; and arrangements for more proactive management of spending by Ministers and their Departments.</P>
    <P>The publication of the monthly spending pro<Col N="2185" />files for each ministerial Vote group was a new initiative which facilitated a more informed and transparent assessment of emerging spending trends over the year as a whole. The monthly reporting by the Minister of Finance to Government, together with the bi-monthly reporting of the four largest spending Departments, over the course of the year ensured any emerging issues were identified early. It also facilitated timely action, where necessary, by the relevant Ministers.</P>
    <P>The management measures introduced to facilitate expenditure control within Departments included: more effective management of spending on demand-led schemes; better risk assessment and contingency planning to cater for unforeseen pressures; and the more timely provision of the end of month spending returns to the Department of Finance. More effective management of their budgets by Departments and Offices was also facilitated by allowing them to retain savings generated from efficiency measures, the disposal of surplus property or extra income generated by them. These efficiency savings were used to fund high priority programmes within their area of spending. The new arrangements have worked well. They have helped to secure better management of resources in the delivery of public services within overall budgetary targets. They have also improved the accountability of Departments in their public spending.</P>
    <P>The announcement in the 2004 budget of the introduction of five year rolling multi-annual capital envelopes for public investment will build on recent improvements in public expenditure management. This initiative will assist Departments and their agencies to better plan and manage their capital programmes. Together with the planned introduction of revised capital appraisal guidelines and proposed new arrangements for public sector construction contracts and related services, they will deliver better value for money. The 2003 public capital programme included more project level information. These presentational improvements will be further improved in the 2004 publication in the light of the project-programme level reporting arrangements which it is proposed to put in place as part of the new capital envelopes system.</P>
    <P>The level of funding provided by the Government in 2003 &ndash; nearly &euro;39 billion for gross spending on services &ndash; builds on the significant investments made since 1997 and consolidates the significant economic and social progress made since. The strategy underpinning the 2003 Estimates of matching increases in public spending to revenue increases has been continued into 2004. This sound approach to the management of the public finances will ensure we are well positioned to take advantage of the expected upturn in the international economy. The Government's commitment to improved management of the public <Col N="2186" />finances is not just about the control of public spending, it also involves significant improvements to the management arrangements which are designed to secure better value for money and greater accountability.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. J. Phelan: I welcome the Minister of State to the House and note he did not mention decentralisation during his contribution on this Bill. I am glad he is politically unscathed given what has occurred during the past couple of weeks. The Minister's contribution was laden with figures as one would expect on an Appropriation Bill.</P>
    <P>A number of people have commented in the past couple of weeks on the Minister for Finance's newfound commitment to fiscal rectitude, an issue on which I have strong views. The Minister for Finance has purported during his political career to being a believer in the idea of fiscal rectitude. However, he has not put that into practice during the past couple of years. He has tightened the belt somewhat this year and that is reflected in the fact that the amount provided for in the Appropriation Bill this year is less than last year.</P>
    <P>The House has just completed its debate on the Social Welfare Bill, during which the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, attended. The Minister of State referred to the Department of Social and Family Affairs throughout his speech. As it is the highest spending Department, it merits some discussion. He did not, however, refer to the 16 savage cuts being made by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan.</P>
    <P>I was taken aback by some of the comments Senators made earlier. One Senator quoted from the Bible &ndash; I have not read it &ndash; saying it states &ldquo;the poor will always be with us&rdquo;. That is a very condescending remark particularly at this time of the year. Many of the remarks made in this House on social welfare have been very condescending. It is easy for us to say the 16 cuts made were readjustments that needed to be made. Of course schemes implemented by the Department of Social and Family Affairs should be continually reviewed. Anyone who suggests that the cuts in food allowances and other schemes are not significant is not living in the real world. If the Government pursues that policy then, as Senator Mooney said, the poor will always be with us. Perhaps that will be the Government's catchphrase in the next general election. The Government adopted the catchphrase of &ldquo;a lot done, more to do&rdquo; before the last election and, it certainly has a lot more to do.</P>
    <P>The Appropriations Bill, budget and Estimates do not go far along the road towards carrying out much of the work needing to be done. Members referred earlier to increases in child benefit. While there have been significant improvements <Col N="2187" />in that area during the past couple of years, it is fair to say that a number of years ago, the Minister for Finance promised much greater increases than he delivered in this budget. In effect, people are again not getting what they were promised but that is nothing new.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State did not refer to the Department of Agriculture and Food. I have continually asked, in this House and elsewhere, about funding for Teagasc. We are told that the budget this year for Teagasc will be similar to that provided last year. That sounds all right but it is not when one considers &euro;17 million was cut from that budget last year. Lack of funding will pose tremendous problems for advisory centres around the country, many of which are at risk of closure. Some have already closed and the death sentence hangs over others. Lack of funding will not help to resolve that situation positively for those centres.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred a number of times to the Department of Health and Children, the second biggest spending Department. It must be acknowledged that overall funding for that Department has been increased this year. However, there has been a corresponding reduction in the level of service provided on the ground. The manner in which the health service is currently being managed makes one feel we are throwing good money after bad. There is no commitment, as clearly shown by the Minister for Defence, to any reform of the health service. We can continue to pour money into it but the service we receive might not be that for which we all hope. There is no reform agenda for the health service. It is not a wise move, from the taxpayers' point of view, to continue to increase funding in that area. There must be radical change in the way the service is provided.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State did not refer to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in his contribution. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, provided a once-off increase in local government funding specifically designed to deal with benchmarking. The local authority in Kilkenny as, in other areas, will have to pay &euro;2 million annually to implement benchmarking. While we appreciate the once-off increase in local authority funding this year, from where will local authorities get that money next year and in subsequent years? The Minister has placed an albatross round the neck of every local authority. The idea of development levies has emerged during the past couple of months; they have been agreed in some areas and are pending in others. It is highly inappropriate that those trying to get on the property ladder should have to bear the brunt of funding local authorities into the future. Again, this Government has not considered reform of the mechanism for funding of <Col N="2188" />local authorities. They seem to hop from one crisis to the next with no direction in the manner in which they are run.</P>
    <P>Every so often the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, introduces what we are told is reforming legislation to deal with local authorities. In effect, more powers are taken from councillors and given to county managers, Departments and Ministers. It is fair to say that local government also needs a shake-up. No evidence of such reform has emerged during the past couple of months.</P>
    <P>No reference has been made tonight to the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party taking part in a mock battle on community employment schemes. One of the kites recently flown is the rural social scheme announced in the budget. It appears from the funding given that there are only 2,500 places in that scheme which means it will not meet demand. I welcome the scheme while not knowing what is involved. More places must be provided if it is to be taken seriously. It is unusual to express relief that community employment schemes have not been cut further. There have been dramatic reductions during the past couple of years in the number of people participating in community employment schemes.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Parlon: And in the number of people unemployed.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. J. Phelan: The Government cannot pat itself on the back when it has cut 10,000 places on such schemes during recent years. I have serious problems with this Bill. We are in the position in which we find ourselves today as a result of the mismanagement of public finances during the past number of years. While we are not in crisis, if decisions had been taken a number of years ago, we would not be in the position in which we now find ourselves.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: I welcome the Minister and remind the previous speaker that Ireland's finances are among the best managed in Europe. We have the second lowest public debt and have had minimal borrowings, even during the downturn. I am confident that the outturn this year will be positive.</P>
    <P>Benchmarking was mentioned. Among many others, former colleagues in the Department of Finance well deserve their award. The public finances were put on the correct trajectory in 1987 and have been kept on it since. While concerns were expressed in 2001 and 2002 when expenditure seemed to be growing at an alarming rate, it was well reined in during 2003. Both the IMF and the OECD believe the extra spending in 2001 that coincided with the downturn actually helped the economy achieve a soft landing. The public finances have been prudently managed. The outturn is within a small allowable margin. <Col N="2189" />If anything, revenues are likely to be better than expected.</P>
    <P>We can look forward to next year with a considerable degree of hope and optimism. It looks as though the economy has turned the corner and the downturn has been well managed. There has been a minimal rise in unemployment while employment has continued to rise, albeit at a slower rate. While parties often talk about cutbacks, they have been minimal. There are a certain number of cutbacks, or trimmings, every year. When one thinks of the large cutbacks in the 1970s and 1980s, the recent cuts have been minimal which can be attributed to good management of the economy. We have relatively little to complain about if we are hugely exercised by gross savings of &euro;58 million in the context of the additional &euro;630 million spent on social welfare.</P>
    <P>As regards community employment schemes, the concerns of Fianna Fáil backbenchers, of which I am one, were wildly misunderstood. Leaked expert reports seemed to suggest that the scheme should be either drastically reduced or removed altogether. However, community employment will be maintained at this year's level for the next 12 months while a rural social scheme has also been introduced. Community employment schemes will continue to make an important contribution.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State did not mention decentralisation, an enormously important and radical measure that is going to reduce near intolerable pressures on the capital city and help spread development and growth. While individuals may be opposed to it, I do not believe any party is. Senator Phelan will be glad to know that the chairman of the Fine Gael parliamentary party claimed credit for decentralisation to my home town.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. J. Phelan: Hayes country.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: He said he did not give the Government any credit for decentralisation.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. J. Phelan: My party favours decentralisation.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: The signs are that we will have a significant increase in inward investment next year. Tourism picked up by about 5% this year. People involved in the industry have told me the brilliant weather we enjoyed this year will encourage many to return.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State will probably agree that agriculture had a better year. There is general agreement that the budget was good for the sector.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Parlon: It was welcomed by the farming organisations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2190" /></P>
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: Up to a few years ago people were right to say they were not seeing the fruits of investment. However, we are now beginning to see them with better roads and rail services. We continue to forge ahead and the outlook is positive.</P>
    <P>The school building programme was announced yesterday. It will be possible to do more in the coming year as yesterday's announcement did not take account of the extra &euro;30 million allocated in the budget. It is always good to err on the side of caution. While I am not criticising it, the 5% increase in revenue projected in the budget is conservative. It will be greater than this and generate the resources we need to tackle the many social and infrastructural problems we face.</P>
    <P>While I do not want to return to the debate on the Social Welfare Bill, the record of this and the previous Government on social welfare is remarkably good. Members have spoken about claimants being cut off from schemes. No existing claimant will be cut off; it will affect those who might make a claim on this basis in the future.</P>
    <P>The Presidency of the European Union will present challenges for the Government in the coming six months. I hope it will be possible for the Taoiseach to bring his negotiating skills to bear and get agreement on the constitution that will allow us to more forward. I see dangers in allowing the ratification process to linger too long.</P>
    <P>We also want to see progress in Northern Ireland where certain parties have never had the degree of responsibility they now have. They have a great opportunity to show what they can do to contribute constructively and it would not surprise me if some of them confounded expectations.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. M. Hayes: I welcome the Minister of State and express my appreciation for the Minister for Finance's stewardship of the economy and the way he has conducted the business of the State during his period in office. I say this to put in context my remarks, which might be regarded as critical.</P>
    <P>I have two main points to make, one about the paper clip and sealing wax end of the public administration continuum and another about a more serious matter. Will the Minister of State do something to deter Departments and semi-State bodies from lumbering my desk and post bag with very expensively produced and heavy reports full of photographs of chief executive officers, chairmen, etc.? It is a nonsense. It should be possible to specify some sort of standard format for reports brought before the House. We do not need cosmetics and vanity publishing in this area.</P>
    <P>Another example of the lack of joined-up Government is that we have in the past year appended two additional pages to the Order Paper, thus making it a bound copy. I understand <Col N="2191" />that if it is unbound it is VAT rated and that if it is bound it is not. This also seems to be a nonsense, apart from the waste of paper which contributes to the destruction of the rain forests.</P>
    <P>The more serious point I want to make concerns the proposals for the decentralisation of the Departments, to which Senator Mansergh has already referred. I am probably lucky in that I do not have a constituency and am not attached to any particular town. I hope I can speak simply from my background in administration. I certainly have not been stimulated by any remarks the Minister of State made. Decentralisation is a bad idea and I totally disagree with Senator Mansergh's views on the matter.</P>
    <P>If we were talking about real decentralisation or devolution, I would be all for it. If it meant giving powers to strong local authorities and powers, functions and staff to regional authorities, I would be all for it. However, this is not what is happening. I agree with Senator Mansergh regarding the need to demagnetise Dublin. This should be done by having three or four strong magnets or nodes of growth around the country and not 20 or 30 Mickey Mouse magnets. The latter approach does not work.</P>
    <P>The national spatial strategy&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Dr. Mansergh: I would not describe my town in Tipperary like that.</P>
    
    <P>Dr. M. Hayes: I withdraw my reference to &ldquo;Mickey Mouse&rdquo; but I regard Tipperary as a less strong magnet than others and not perhaps as electrically charged as we would like it to be. I assure the Senator that my remarks were not intended to reflect on the good citizens of Tipperary.</P>
    <P>The national spatial strategy is flawed in that it tries to pretend everywhere can be a point of growth or a gateway. If one transferred Departments to three, four or five strong cities along with major hospitals and other facilities, one would create the quality of urban life and the sub-structural and cultural supports young people want, thus preventing them from having to come to Dublin.</P>
    <P>The relocation of Departments may be based on a false conception of how they do their business. One can relocate support units and outsource much activity that could just as well be done in the Tipperarys of this world but the relocation of whole Departments is not desirable. All their work is not done by memo. Very often, it is done at senior level through meeting people in corridors. Let us consider an example of relocation in the North. The Department of Education was relocated to Bangor, which was only 12 miles down the road. It so happened that there was an empty factory in the town which somebody wanted to fill. The Department became sep<Col N="2192" />arated from the administrative structure. Its staff did their own thing and one never saw them. The Department employed people from the local area and almost ghettoised itself. This broke down the interplay that occurred at senior level. Piecemeal and penny-package distribution of Departments is liable to seriously damage the quality of administration. I understand the argument for out-sourcing and relocating support services but I encourage the Minister of State to reconsider the idea of relocating the headquarters of Departments.</P>
    
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon): I thank the Senators for their informed contributions to the debate on the 2003 provisions and the necessity to ensure appropriate measures are in place to deliver value for taxpayers' money. The 2003 spending outturn shows there was sound management of the public finances during the year. As Senators Mansergh and Maurice Hayes said, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is admired, particularly throughout Europe&mdash;</P>
    
    <P>Mr. J. Phelan: Does the Minister of State still admire him?</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Parlon: Totally. My views are on the record. I am very proud and honoured to work in his Department and am learning every day. I am also pleased to have the opportunity to participate in this debate.</P>
    <P>Senator John Phelan raised a few issues to which I did not refer. Senator Mansergh responded to the points made about cuts in social welfare payments. There is an extra &euro;995 million in the social welfare budget this year, representing an increase of 10% over the budget for 2003. One should also take into account the massive decline in unemployment and the massive increases in social welfare provisions.</P>
    <P>Senator Mansergh referred to the adjustments. We must have a system with integrity. Adjustments will continue to be made and nobody will lose out because of them. The system is certainly compassionate in that if some people lose out it, will be able to cope with them.</P>
    <P>Senator Maurice Hayes expressed concerns about decentralisation. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, referred to what he sees as the very positive aspect of changing an element of the Dublin mindset although I know Senator Maurice Hayes is not a Dubliner. The mindset that obtains in the city is characterised by some negative views on decentralisation. Towns in my constituency and others which have been nominated to accept public servants regard decentralisation as a major cause of excitement and a boost to the local economy and the quality of life. It is not just a case of the extra money that will be available due to the additional salaries being earned in the towns.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2193" /></P>
    <P>Dr. M. Hayes: My point was that it would affect the quality of administration.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Parlon: There is no question that decentralisation will adversely shake up the Civil Service. It is a voluntary scheme. Not everybody will choose to move and some who move will have to acquire new skills. In the short term, this could cause some deficiencies which I hope would only be minor.</P>
    <P>Decentralisation will also offer scope for people to move up the ranks. It will afford opportunities to some of the younger, more talented people who might not be afforded them otherwise. From my limited experience in Government, I find civil servants to be very dynamic and interesting and they are very enthusiastic about moving.</P>
    <P>We have had sound management of the economy and investment in delivering output is very real. Since 1997, 8,500 people have been recruited on the medical side and while there have been criticisms, it takes time for services to be delivered. However, once one has the personnel, investment and hardware in place this will work out. There are 6,000 extra nurses in the system and that will have a positive impact on the health services. I also note the success of the treatment purchase scheme, which takes people off the long-term waiting lists. It has been very successful for thousands of patients.</P>

    <P>Mr. Kitt: I wish to share my time with Senator Ulick Burke. I refer to Brierfield national school, <Col N="2194" />near Tuam, County Galway. I am glad the school is listed on the schools building programme but the board of management of the school hoped it would be included as a pilot project or covered by what is known as the devolved grant scheme. I have visited the school on a number of occasions and it is in very bad condition. I welcome the fact that many schools in east Galway are on the list for the devolved scheme although this school is not.</P>
    <P>There are 64 students, three teachers and three classrooms in the school. There are also three visiting teachers &ndash; two resource teachers and a learning support teacher. Even though the school purchased a portacabin last year, space is still a huge problem. The resource teacher and the principal have to use the hall, as there is no staff room, and students must also use outside toilets. It is time the school was included in the devolved programme. The board of management was so keen to get the school included in that scheme that it suggested having the scheme in two phases.</P>
    <P>Under the devolved programme, if a certain amount of money could be given to the school it could do as much as it could with it. The phases I refer to involve the outside toilets and a staff room or room for the principal. When the principal has what are called &ldquo;principal's days&rdquo; he must use the hall, which is appalling.</P>
    <P>I am told the school is in band 3, which means it is not in the emergency or serious bands, bands 1 and 2. Other schools with facilities which are not as bad have received the devolved grant or been included in the pilot programme, but I hope the Minister of State agrees that any school with outside toilets needs refurbishment as badly as schools in bands 1 and 2.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State can tell me what the Department of Education and Science plans to do about this, as I would love if he or someone from the Department visited this school. I am visiting it again tomorrow to explain what is happening and I would love a devolved grant or pilot scheme grant to be given to the school to let it proceed with this urgent work. The school still has outside toilets and some form of general purpose or staff room must be provided for the principal and his staff.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. U. Burke: I thank Senator Kitt for sharing his time and I wholeheartedly support him in raising this matter. It is a classic example from the lists seen recently in the media which show what the Department of Education and Science intends doing in the coming year. We welcome the projects which have received favourable consideration but to judge by the language in these categories, apart from category one we are talking about condemnation for an indefinite period for boards of management, parents, teachers and students in these schools. The students in such schools will be long gone before there is any improvement in the facilities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2195" />It beats me how Department officials can exclude this school from the category they describe as extremely urgent and classify it as &ldquo;regarded as necessary&rdquo; in category three. This indicates a total lack of understanding of what it is like to teach in a school where conditions are so primitive. This is unacceptable as we head into 2004.</P>
    <P>I support Senator Kitt's call for a reassessment of those schools listed in the horrific reports in the newspapers today where teachers are condemned to continue teaching in substandard conditions, which parents must accept, for which boards of management must take responsibility and which students must tolerate. This is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House and explain the situation. We must inform him of the reality. I support Senator Kitt and appreciate his offer to share time with me. I hope the people of Brierfield receive some hope that they will get funding for improvements in order that their children can attend school in conditions similar to the best in the country.</P>
    
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon): I thank the Senators for giving me an opportunity of outlining to the House the current position of the Department of Education and Science on the allocation of funding for school building projects. Last year, for the first time, the Department decided to publish the complete school building programme in order to give the maximum amount of information to all of the partners in education &ndash; students, parents, teachers and management bodies.</P>
    <P>The programme announced for 2004 is a further step in progressing the Government's consistent commitment to deal with school accommodation needs. It details in excess of 170 significant school building projects being authorised to proceed to tender and construction in 2004. The two pilot initiatives &ndash; the small and rural pilot initiative and the permanent accommodation initiative &ndash; have proved promising and the Department has decided to extend the schemes to include more schools in 2004. It is absolutely convinced that devolving funding, responsibility and authority to schools for smaller scale projects is the way forward. As a further initiative in that direction, last week it put in place a new devolved summer works scheme which will cater for all necessary small-scale projects that can be planned and delivered during the summer holidays.</P>
    <P>The large-scale building project for Brierfield national school, Tuam is listed in section 9 of the 2004 school building programme. Projects listed in this section are at the early stages of architectural planning &ndash; pre-planning permission stage. The project has been assigned a band 3 rating in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects. The programme will be updated early in 2004 with details of how the <Col N="2196" />additional &euro;30 million funding announced in the budget will be spent.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. U. Burke: That is an election promise.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Parlon: If the Senator took a more positive frame of mind and lobbied the Minister, it might be more productive.</P>
    <P>All projects not going to construction as part of the 2004 school building programme are being reviewed with a view to including them as part of a multiannual building programme from 2005 onwards. The Department expects to be in a position to make a further announcement on the matter during 2004. The management authorities at individual schools should continue to use funds from their devolved grant to deal with any urgent health and safety matters.</P>
    <P>I again thank both Senators for giving me the opportunity of outlining the current position.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Kitt: I would appreciate it if the Minister of State tried to have Brierfield national school included in respect of the additional funding of &euro;30 million. It is looking for devolved funding.</P>

    <P>
      <b></b>
    </P>
    <P>Mr. Ross: I am grateful to the Cathaoirleach for his acceptance of this matter on the Adjournment. This is a sensitive matter because it touches on the Government immigration policy. There is a huge distinction between the various language schools which have been set up, of which certain schools are well established. This issue was brought to my attention by the Dublin School of English which has been established for more than 30 years and is owned by the Crossan family.</P>
    <P>As some bad apples in the language school business use the schools as some sort of shop for work or stay visas, others are suffering. I ask the Government to introduce regulations to allow schools which make a good living and operate in a legitimate and honourable manner to operate on a commercial basis. At the same time it should introduce regulations to stamp out those which are exploiting the business to provide some sort of cover to allow people stay here longer than Government policy allows. The Government has been unable to resolve this problem with its current regulations. Not only are the people who come here suffering, the schools, their commercial well being and the families of those who run them are also suffering. How does the Minister intend to resolve this problem?</P>
    <P>The Dublin School of English has brought it to my attention that almost identical applications for visas to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform have been refused in certain cases while others have been accepted. It appears a random numbers game is being played in order <Col N="2197" />to keep numbers down and reduce the dangers of people coming into the country for improper purposes. However, a crude instrument is being used to make selections. I ask the Minister to fine tune the selection process in order that established schools and those who run them for the benefit of those who use them and the country can continue to go about their business.</P>
    <P>More often than not, the reasons given for refusal of visas are inexplicable and vague or not relevant or applicable to the application. For example, a refusal may be made on account of insufficient documentation but no explanation is given as to what is missing from the application. A refusal might also be based on the belief a student will not return home without any basis for this belief or on the fact that a student is enrolled in a university in his or her home country.</P>
    <P>Applications are often lost. There is a large backlog and it is almost impossible to get through on the telephone to the visa office. There are bureaucratic problems which are unforgivable and inexcusable. Correspondence from the office is frequently unsigned with the result that one does not know who processed the application, thereby hampering further inquiries.</P>
    <P>The appeals process, supposedly in place, is a farce and insufficient. An appeal is lodged to the same office and dealt with by an unnamed appeals officer. A revision of the initial decision is virtually unheard of. In other words, the process does not appear to involve a real appeal; it involves the original decision being rubber stamped.</P>
    <P>There have been occasions when language schools operated as visa sale shops, which is inexcusable. It is right to crack down on these operations. However, I ask the Minister to consider this matter in the light of the fact that Enterprise Ireland has spent a lot of money promoting Irish language schools in China and Russia. It is a pity that another arm of government is crippling the ability of the Dublin School of English and others to attract students for a period to learn English.</P>
    <P>The evidence suggests that the business is moving overseas to Malta, the United Kingdom and the USA because of the difficulties encountered and the slow process involved in getting visas. The students concerned are from Mongolia, Russia and China, for whom a whole new world has opened up, as indeed it has for us. That should be encouraged rather than discouraged. It is not enough to have an investigation. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should introduce a list of legitimate schools and a licensing system should be set up that would be regulated consistently and fairly. When applications for work visas come from these schools, they should be dealt with more quickly, with the application of transparent criteria about which all are informed.</P>
    <P>I also ask that the visa office make itself more accessible and accountable. To trade in this market, the Irish businesses concerned need to have <Col N="2198" />a higher proportion of visas granted than at present.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Parlon: On behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who cannot be here tonight, I am pleased to respond to the matters raised by Senator Ross. It is difficult to deal comprehensively with all of the aspects of the international marketing of the Irish education product within the context of a debate of this nature. However, I will deal with some key points which are central to the Senator's motion.</P>
    <P>First, approximately 18,000 non-EEA national students currently reside legally in this jurisdiction. In April 2001, the Department pioneered an important initiative which greatly assisted in the marketing of the Irish education product abroad. The effect was to allow students to take up casual employment, defined as up to 20 hours part time work per week or full time work during vacation periods, for the duration of their permission to remain. This is not a work study system. It is a study system which embodies work relaxation elements which are primarily intended to facilitate foreign students, both in social terms and improving their language skills.</P>
    <P>The second point relates to the distinction the Senator draws between legitimate English language schools and others. Unfortunately, the problem cannot be neatly pigeon-holed and dealt with on the basis of that distinction. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has no statutory function in the regulation of English language schools. The Advisory Council for English Language Studies &ndash; ACELS &ndash; was established under the auspices of the Department of Education and Science to control standards in English language schools through an inspection and recognition scheme.</P>
    <P>This is a non-statutory, voluntary scheme. Its principal objective is the development of high quality education service standards, rather than compliance on the part of students or schools with immigration requirements as such. Many English language schools in Ireland are certified under the ACELS scheme and the Department certainly welcomes such participation. However, as there is no obligation in law to obtain recognition to operate this type of business, it does not follow that not doing so implies the school is not a genuine one or that the Department can simply refuse to deal with individuals seeking to study there. In addition, it is not the case that the students with whom the Department has had difficulties are entirely confined to schools which have not attained ACELS recognition.</P>
    <P>The third point relates to the calibre of the students themselves. Abuse of the student visa system is customer driven. It cannot operate where a student is genuinely study-orientated. Accordingly, it is reasonable to ask how schools seek to recruit genuine students. In the main, schools teaching English as a foreign language use foreign agents to recruit students to come to Ireland. The agent is a business operator who is <Col N="2199" />financially motivated and may have on his or her books a number of students who wish to travel overseas.</P>
    <P>In addition to the commission they receive from schools or colleges in Ireland, agents often take a fee for their service from the prospective student. In China, for example, the service they provide includes matching a student with a course programme of study in Ireland, advice on visa requirements, translation of documents, assistance with application letters and liaison with the embassy or consulate. The Irish school does not vet the visa application prior to its submission to the visa office. Irish visa officers in China have been told by certain agents that their services include the procurement of fraudulent documents and temporary funds to comply with visa requirements.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the mechanisms in place to deal with abuse of the system. In the first place, the visa determination process is more rigorous than ever and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform also now employs its own staff in both Beijing and Moscow. Second, the Garda registration system is now fully computerised and work has begun on computerisation of the Department of Foreign Affairs visa system worldwide. Systems which facilitate easier retrieval of data are more efficient in combating fraud and the provision of customer service.</P>
    <P>The visa system, which issued 10,000 visas last year, is clogged up with bogus applications. The Garda national immigration bureau visits schools to the extent that its resources allow and, as a result of these efforts, there are a number of schools in respect of which visa applications are no longer accepted. There is also a regime in place whereby an over-stayer who is not in a position to show that he or she is currently attending a school will not be in a position to get a re-entry <Col N="2200" />visa for Ireland if he or she wishes to go home on vacation. An employer who employs a non-EEA national who no longer has permission to remain as a student, is in breach of the provisions of the Employment Permits Act 2003 and liable to a fine of up to &euro;250,000. There are cases where persons who have breached their student conditions have been deported from the State.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Minister for Education and Science has, on foot of a Government decision, established an interdepartmental group with the remit of considering all aspects of the promotion of Irish education abroad. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is represented on that committee. To date, in accordance with its mandate, the group has consulted with a wide range of groups including MEI-RELSA, the representative body for the English language sector. The group will report to Government on its deliberations. On the basis outlined, I assure the House that the English language industry is an area kept under active review in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Ross: I thank the Minister of State for his reply, which I understood and with much of which I agree. However, I must ask what proposals the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has with a view to allowing those schools with long records and without any question of illegitimate activity, to go about their business without being penalised as though they were in the same category as those who are operating illegitimate language schools as a cover for people to stay and work here.</P>
    
    <P>Mr. Parlon: I will convey the Senator's concerns to the Minister when I meet him tomorrow morning.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 6.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 19 December 2003.</P>
