      <P>I have notice from Senator White that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to ensure that in the reform and reorganisation of the health services following the implementation of the Prospectus, Brennan and Hanly reports, there is a meaningful role for the democratically elected local public representatives in the governance of public hospitals and in primary, community and continuing care services.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Tuffy on the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the up to date position regarding Scoil Charman, Wexford; when the school is going to proceed to the construction of its permanent buildings and when adequate ventilation is going to be installed in the temporary building in which it is currently accommodated.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on the humanitarian situation in post-war Iraq, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 5 p.m, with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 12 minutes, those of other Senators not to exceed eight minutes, Senators may share time and the Minister to be called upon to reply not later than five minutes before the conclusion of the statements; and No. 2, Broadcasting (Funding) Bill 2003 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to be taken at 5 p.m. and to <Col N="566" />conclude not later than 7 p.m, with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 12 minutes, those of other Senators not to exceed eight minutes, Senators may share time and the Minister to be called upon to reply not later than five minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. Some weeks ago Members on both sides of the House called on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come into the House for a special debate on the gang land killings that are taking place. In view of the unprecedented scenes that occurred yesterday in the Central Criminal Court and the clear threat posed to society as a result of a small and persistent group of people who feel they have the right to give two fingers to society and reject the independence of the courts, does the Leader accept the necessity for that debate as soon as possible? Does she agree there is a need for the Government, particularly the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to get to grips with this issue? Witnesses who come before the courts deserve our protection because they come in the name of all citizens. It is also vital that where charges are laid against people, those charges are brought before the courts as soon as possible to ensure the veracity of statements given and that they are heard in open court.</P>
      <P>Does the Leader agree that certain gang land crimes, which have proliferated in recent times, should possibly be tried in the Special Criminal Court, away from a jury and the intimidation that can be brought to bear? This is a serious matter that goes to the heart of the independence of the Republic, the Judiciary and the court system. Will the Leader arrange such a debate with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform as soon as possible?</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform when he will make a statement on the publication of the Nally report? This report was commissioned following allegations made to the Government about the investigation into the Omagh bombing. This summer the Minister informed the Omagh bombing victims that he would be making a public statement on this matter in late September or early October when the House returned. To date, we have not had that statement. Will the Leader contact the Minister's office to inquire when that statement will be made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The perjury Bill has not yet been published, despite it being promised on a number of occasions by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Everyone is outraged by what happened in the Central Criminal Court yesterday. The protections in the system for innocent people from unfair convictions may have been abused in this case. How we move on this matter is important, but we need to do so slowly. We need to hear from the Minister as to what his plans are for dealing with this matter. I suggest <Col N="567" />we introduce legislation that allows statements to be entered into evidence once they have been made. People who have made those statements should then be allowed afterwards to claim they were made through coercion or to change them. Another method would be for all such statements to be sworn in the first place and entered as evidence. We must bring forward legislation so a jury and a court can be allowed to reach certain conclusions on the basis of a person claiming not to remember what he or she said in a statement but not claiming it was a forced confession. I would prefer a debate on this issue to focus more on what can be done. The Minister has to take political responsibility, but we also have a responsibility to bring forward proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it is urgent that we have a debate on the implications for the legal system and our democracy of what happened at the Central Criminal Court yesterday. There is a sense of horror abroad at this and that we have among us the type of criminals who will engage in such utter and complete contempt for our system. We feel helpless in the face of this contempt and it cannot continue. Senator O'Toole is right that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has a political responsibility for the matter, but we all have a collective responsibility to come up with a response. I assure the Leader that none of us will be found wanting in a constructive and responsible debate on the issue.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader if the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will make himself available for a debate on the proposed press council. There has been constructive debate in the media recently on this issue. It boils down to whether we have a statutory or non-statutory council. In light of this, it will be useful to have a debate in the House to hear the views of Members on this important matter. We, as public representatives, have come in for much odium recently and our profession is under much criticism, if not under threat. At the heart of the issue of a statutory press council is a fundamental distrust of the media itself. It is time the media looked at this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the leader to invite the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to update us on the procedures and requirements governing criminal investigations and how the names of suspects come into the public domain, in particular, the recent tragic case involving a woman in Mullingar. Here was a case where a person went through a tragic and traumatic time. As the story unfolded in the media, it was clear this was a classic case where procedures and compassion should and could have been reconciled. There have been similar cases in the past. We should revisit the whole process as to how these names are released. I am not suggesting the Garda acted wrongly in this case. However, the <Col N="568" />relationship between the procedures and the media should be investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>On a previous occasion the Cathaoirleach allowed me to raise the need to abort the sitting of the Central Criminal Court in Limerick mainly on the basis of the fear and intimidation of the people involved in the jury. This is another classic example where there may be suspected intimidation. While I am not saying there is, a climate of fear pervades in Limerick. We must consider the views of a senior member of the Garda who stated that the Garda force in Limerick is so depleted at present that all the gardaí are involved in tracking down the criminal families and do not have time for routine matters. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should come to the House and state what extra staffing resources he will provide for Limerick in order to cater for this. Some 2,000 extra gardaí were promised in the lifetime of the Government. We are not looking for 2,000 extra gardaí but are looking for proper resources to combat the situation that pervades in the Limerick area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I call on the Leader to ask the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to intervene as a matter of urgency with ESB, ESB International and Hibernian Wind Power in the case of the landslide in Derrybrien, County Galway to ensure the companies involved will provide absolute guarantees of safety to the residents and workers on site. The Minister should request that they declare openly and transparently that they have not been in any way negligent in the development of the wind farm on that site.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On 26 January next the blanket ban on smoking in the workplace will come into operation. I have no problem with certain restrictions on smoking. The evidence of the damage that smoking, including passive smoking, does is incontrovertible. However, certain aspects of the regulation are over the top. In particular, in the event of somebody deciding to light up in a pub the publican has the full responsibility and may be liable to hefty penalties. It is manifestly wrong that the entire onus for the implementation and enforcement of this should be foisted on publicans. The Minister for Health and Children should come to the House to see if something can be done in advance of 26 January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Ulick Burke's request concerning the landslide in Derrybrien, Loughrea. It has the potential to be worse than what happened in Pollatomish, County Mayo. There is great fear, insecurity and anger among the community over the way this has been handled. Not only do I agree with Senator Burke in saying that responsibility should be taken by ESB International, but I also believe that no further work should continue on this project. The idea of <Col N="569" />putting turbines on a very boggy area is wrong. The Minister should be informed of the strong feelings of this House on the way this matter has been handled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>On reflection and with the benefit of hindsight, would the Leader agree that it was rather unladylike, to say the least, if not unparliamentary for her to use the four-letter &ldquo;c&rdquo; word when last we met? </P>

      <P>I will not debate it. As always, I respect the ruling of the Chair. I want to say two things and then I will finish. The intimidation of witnesses should be treated in exactly the same manner as the intimidation of juries and signed Garda statements should have the same status in law as sworn affidavits. I look forward to the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Transport to the House to clarify the position regarding the upgrading of the N9 to motorway status. The commitment was made in the national development plan and restated in the spatial strategy, but some doubts have been expressed in recent utterances from the Minister. He speaks about fast-tracking motorways to other cities with the exception of Waterford. I ask the Minister to come to the House at the earliest opportunity to discuss the question of roads to the major cities and the motorways as promised in those two documents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all outraged at what happened in court yesterday. I remember seven years ago a young woman, Veronica Guerin, sat in the Visitors Gallery. Two weeks later she was dead. We acted as a State and as a nation against those drug barons and against those who had created the outrageous situation that pertained in those days. On this occasion we are very concerned about what happened yesterday. We should keep calm and try to keep a sense of proportion because we should be very careful to avoid tampering with our judicial system. Our democracy is a very delicate flower and we should ensure that whatever actions we take do not tamper with that system that has served us so well in the past. I support the request from other Senators for the Minister to come to the House and listen to our concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a strike in the postal service across the water and I believe there should be a strike here also except here it should be the consumers who go on strike. In Famine times a letter took one day to go from Dublin to Carlow whereas it can now take four to five days, if not a week. The postal service is in chaos all around the country. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources should come to the House and explain why letters are going missing, are taking weeks to arrive in certain places and why it is cheaper for businesses to post letters abroad and send them back to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Senator asking for a debate on the postal service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking for such a debate. It is ridiculous that 150 years ago it took a day for letters to arrive in Carlow from Dublin and it is now taking four days.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately this weekend there were a number of fatalities on the roads, many of them involving pedestrians. This may be a sector which is being ignored. I ask the Minister for Transport to come to the House to debate the matter and perhaps put in place some means of lessening the number of pedestrians being killed on the roads. These measures could include the compulsory wearing of reflective armbands, for instance. Many families are being torn asunder this week because of deaths on the roads. This issue should be debated in the House. The introduction of penalty points has reduced the number of fatal car crashes and the same should be done for pedestrians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon" hpid="Mr. Bannon Mr. Bannon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the view of my colleague, Senator Higgins, that it is wrong to hold vintners accountable for crimes committed by others. Regulations should be introduced to ensure the culprits of crime are held responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="571" />I support the request that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform be invited to the House. There is a general perception that law and order has broken down and the events in Limerick are terrible. It is having a demoralising effect on the Garda Síochána who are the protectors of the people.</P>
    <P>I also ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to the House for a debate on poverty. There is widespread rural poverty. The carer's allowance and home help were taken from elderly people. There are&mdash;</P>

      <P>I join my colleague, Senator Cummins, in asking the Leader to seek clarification from the Minister for Transport about the building of the motorway between Waterford and Dublin. This is an issue which has become somewhat complicated in recent times. We are unclear as to the current position and the Minister should clarify matters as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I also want the Leader to arrange for a debate on the arts. To the best of my knowledge we have not had such a debate in the time of this Seanad. It is important we do so prior to the casting of the budget. Last year's reductions in funding for the arts had a devastating impact on theatre groups and other artists. We should have a discussion on the national arts plan 2002-06 and ensure the Government sticks to it. I urge the Leader to arrange that debate as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition, Senator Brian Hayes, raised the matter of gangland killings in general but, in particular, yesterday's events in the Limerick murder trial. He asked that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform come here for a debate. I think we would all wish that to take place. What happened yesterday has diminished us all as citizens. I am sure a plan is being drawn up to deal with this issue as it could have grave import for life in <Col N="572" />Ireland. I have no doubt the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would wish to come to this House. Although I have no knowledge of it, I am sure the Cabinet discussed the matter this morning. I echo what Senator Quinn said, that there is a need for reflection on the matter. We should not rush in to make incorrect statements. All speakers have shown a commendable restraint. I will speak to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and ask when he would be able to come and give us his thoughts on the serious situation which pertains following the episode in the Limerick murder case yesterday.</P>
      <P>A separate issue is the Nally report into the Omagh bombing which was promised for public debate. We should first seek to debate the issue about which I have just spoken. Senator O'Toole put forward various points about statements to be taken on oath, the perjury Bill and other matters. The worrying aspect to what occurred yesterday is that those who seek to evade the law will be able to see loopholes for themselves in addition to the intimidation which might ensue.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Meara spoke of a sense of horror and she is right. She sought to have the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform come to the House to discuss the matter. She also raised the issue of a press council. That would be a worthy topic of debate as it is currently being discussed by the public.</P>
      <P>In addition to the incident yesterday, Senator Ó Murchú, raised the issue of how names and events connected with criminal investigations come into the public arena, sometimes to the detriment of those centrally involved. He referred to the example of a case in Mullingar. There are many such issues which should not have come out and which in this case led to a sense of panic in the woman concerned.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, 23 October Senator Finucane raised the issue of the intimidation to which witnesses were subject in Limerick. I accept he also did so on another occasion. He said there is a climate of fear in Limerick. I think it has spread throughout the country. He also spoke about staffing and Garda resources. I heard a person on the radio this morning making a similar point.</P>
      <P>Senator Ulick Burke wished to raise the matter of the Derrybrien landslide with the Minister for Communications, the Marine and Natural Resources. I am aware that Senators Kitt and Ulick Burke are particularly interested in the issue. As well as having a Minister come to the House, the matter could be raised jointly by the Senators on the Adjournment. It is one which requires answers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Higgins raised the matter of smoking. While he is in favour of the general ban, he is not in favour of making publicans responsible for enforcing the law. I understand the Minister for Health and Children will bring the smoking regulations, which he has signed, before the Dáil this week. They will come before the Seanad the week after. It would be useful for the Senator to <Col N="573" />contribute on that. The Minister is certainly not for turning and he has the country with him. While Senator Higgins did not say he was against the smoking ban, I suggest he should look at his diary. He can contribute next week.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan and I will speak afterwards about what happened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator agreed with the sentiments expressed by Senator O'Toole on gangland crime and the intimidation of witnesses.</P>
      <P>Senator Cummins referred to the status of the N9 road to Waterford. The matter has been raised and we will come to it.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn expressed outrage at what happened in the courts yesterday. As he put it, we must keep calm and maintain the delicate plant of democracy. The Members of the House had a very fine, general debate on the matter. People treated it with absolute seriousness and refrained from thumping the tables.</P>
      <P>Senator Browne raised the matter of the postal service. Mail used to take a day to come to Athlone in post-Famine times, but now it takes three days. There is a new person in charge now and he is making great strides. Hopefully, the service will improve. Senator Browne has asked that the Minister should come to the House to address the issue.</P>
      <P>The issue of road fatalities was raised. Whereas before traffic kept in line, on the road from Athlone to Dublin cars overtake even if one is travelling at the speed limit. There was a speed trap on the road this morning and four or five drivers were caught.</P>
      <P>Senator Bannon supported Senator Higgins's remarks about making publicans responsible for stopping smoking if it occurs. He asked that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform come to the House to discuss the matter. He also asked that the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs come to the House to discuss poverty.</P>
      <P>Senator John Phelan raised the matter of the N9 road and also called for a debate on the arts plan which would be very opportune. We have not had a debate on the arts since returning after the summer. We should hold one.</P>
      <P>We sought the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform last week, but he is abroad at the moment. When he returns it would be worthwhile to invite him to come before the House.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Hanafin for his compliment.</P>

The images and reports emanating from Iraq continue to dominate the news on an almost daily basis. The pictures portray a country in distress and a very difficult security environment where humanitarian organisations such as the United Nations and the Red Cross are apparently regarded as legitimate targets. The humanitarian community received one of the greatest setbacks in its history with the appalling attacks on the United Nations Headquarters in Baghdad on 19 August. This cold blooded and mindless assault resulted in the loss of the life of the Special Representative of the UN, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, and 21 colleagues.</P>
      <P>When speaking in this House last June, I warmly welcomed the appointment of Mr. de Mello, whom I met on a number of occasions, as the new Special Representative for Iraq. I anticipated that he would bring a wealth of much needed experience, commitment and ability to Iraq in the humanitarian, recovery and reconstruction processes. In the short time he spent in Iraq, Special Representative de Mello played a key role in the co-ordination of humanitarian and reconstruction assistance by UN agencies and between UN agencies and NGOs. He supported and encouraged international efforts to contribute to basic civil administration functions, especially in the areas of health, education, water and sanitation. A key objective of Special Representative de Mello was to determine how the UN might contribute to the political process. In this respect he sought to elicit the views of as broad a range of Iraqis as possible and facilitated communication between his Iraqi interlocutors and the Coalition Provisional Authority while offering his own comments and suggestions. His message was one of hope for a better future for the people of Iraq. His premature death has left us greatly saddened at a personal level and has also left a great gap in the international humanitarian and development community. His passing is much mourned.</P>
      <P>I was particularly horrified at the suicide bomb attack on the headquarters of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Baghdad. The significance of this attack cannot be underestimated. It is the first of its kind on the Red Cross, whose mission is to assist war victims on all sides. The impact on the ground may be considerable. The Red Cross has stressed, however, that it will not leave Iraq, but it is reducing its foreign staff based there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="575" />I pay special tribute to organisations such as the Red Cross family and UNICEF that continue to remain active on the ground despite the threat to lives and operations. The heroic work of the mainly Iraqi personnel of these organisations undoubtedly saved and continues to save many lives, as they selflessly address the needs of the most vulnerable.</P>
    <P>It is important to revisit the social and economic facts underpinning the humanitarian situation in Iraq. In short, Iraq is a nation whose collapse is etched in its social indicators. Iraq's position in the UN Human Development Index, or HDI as it is commonly known, has fallen from 76 in 1990 to 127 in 2001. I cannot think of another country that has fallen so dramatically and so rapidly. In 1990 <i>per capita</i> income was estimated at US$3,500. It is now estimated by some to be US$1,100 and by others to be as low as US$583.</P>
    <P>The health care system is in a state of extreme disrepair. For example, in 1989 the health budget for Iraq was US$450 million. In 2002 it was a mere US$20 million. One fifth of the children under five are underweight, and infant mortality has more than doubled to 100 per 1,000 live births over the past decade. Under-five mortality has increased from 50 per 1,000 in 1990 to 131 in 1999. This level of infant and child mortality is similar to that prevailing in parts of sub-Saharan Africa. The equivalent figures for both infant and under-five mortality in Ireland is six per 1,000.</P>
    <P>Water and sanitation systems have been badly degraded. Before the war only 60% of Iraqis had access to potable water. This has deteriorated even further, leading to a situation where today UNICEF is providing over 14.4 million litres of water on a daily basis to deprived areas of Baghdad, Basra, Mosul and Kirkuk.</P>
    <P>The news is not all bad. Senators will be aware that before the most recent war, 60% of the Iraqi people were absolutely dependent on government distributed food rations. There were great fears that food shortages and further malnutrition could result from the war. However, owing to the tremendous efforts and dedication of the World Food Programme, its partners, donors and especially the many thousands of Iraqis involved in the Oil for Food Programme, a humanitarian food crisis has been averted. However, on the ongoing food needs of the country, there are still some major challenges ahead, including the onset of winter, the absolutely precarious security situation and the large numbers still dependent on food aid assistance.</P>
    <P>The planned United Nations handover of the Oil for Food Programme, as outlined in Security Council Resolution 1483, to the CPA on 21 November 2003 will need to be carefully executed in order to ensure that particular attention is paid to protecting vulnerable groups after the phase out.</P>
    <P>I am encouraged that it is intended that the World Food Programme will continue to assist <Col N="576" />with food distribution, to finalise the delivery of commodities and to facilitate a smooth handover to the CPA, in co-ordination with the relevant Iraqi authorities.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that UN Secretary General Kofi Annan recently stated that the UN commitment in providing humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people remains steadfast. The violence and general instability have left little choice but to reduce UN international staff in Iraq to a bare minimum. Nonetheless, those that remain, with more than 4,000 committed and courageous Iraqi national staff, are continuing to provide assistance as best they can.</P>
    <P>I stress that based on the humanitarian information available from our key partners, overall assistance programmes in Iraq continue to be severely hampered by the security and unstable operating environment. In particular, movement around the country is limited. The current situation turns each humanitarian and development action into a challenge. Logistics and communications are more important than ever to ensure assistance reaches the most vulnerable.</P>
    <P>Humanitarian actions, however effective, are designed to meet the immediate needs of the most vulnerable. However those of us passionately interested in seeing the establishment of a peaceful and prosperous Iraq must look to the future. We must engage in recovery and reconstruction. We must look at rebuilding the livelihoods of the people and facilitating an environment in which the tremendous potential of the Iraqi people can be realised. We must examine the optimal way in which this recovery and reconstruction can take place.</P>
    <P>In this context I welcome the report of the United Nations-World Bank Joint Iraq Needs Assessment. This report was presented to the donor conference on the reconstruction of Iraq, which took place in Madrid on 23-24 October 2003. I express my deep appreciation to all members of the assessment mission for their dedication and commitment to producing this valuable document, despite the enormous difficulties and challenges faced by all during the mission. The mission itself was interrupted by the tragic events of 19 August.</P>
    <P>The report depicts a country in distress and disrepair with reconstruction and development needs on a huge scale. This needs assessment examined 14 priority sectors. These included the key social sectors of health, education, water and sanitation, employment, agriculture and food security. It is estimated that US $56 billion will be needed to carry out reconstruction activities in Iraq up to 2007.</P>
    <P>The donor conference in Madrid provided an important opportunity for the international community to come together, to co-ordinate efforts and support, to build a modern, open, democratic and prosperous Iraq. Representatives from 73 countries, including Ireland, and 20 international organisations attended the conference.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="577" />In Madrid donors announced overall pledges and indicative pledges amounting to more than US $33 billion, equivalent to &euro;28 billion, in grants and loans from now until the end of 2007. It was stressed at the conference that the disbursement of these pledges should begin as soon as possible and practicable. Many donors offered support in the form of export credits, training, technical assistance and aid in kind.</P>
    <P>The conference agreed that, to maximise donor co-ordination, an international reconstruction fund facility for Iraq should be established into which contributions by the international community may be channelled. This facility will be administered by the World Bank and the United Nations, in close co-ordination with the Iraqi authorities and donors. The establishment of the facility is to ensure that donor concerns in relation to transparency, accountability, monitoring and implementation are met and that activities are carried out in a way that meets the benchmarks of best development practice.</P>
    <P>Ireland will play its part in this critical endeavour. As Senators will be aware Ireland has already delivered &euro;5 million in humanitarian assistance to Iraq in 2003. At the Madrid conference Ireland pledged up to &euro;3 million to the future humanitarian and recovery needs of Iraq. It is intended that this pledge will be mainly channelled through the UN window of the international reconstruction fund facility for Iraq, and through valued partners such as UN agencies, international organisations and NGOs. Discussions will take place over the coming months with these partner organisations to examine sectors and priorities on a needs basis.</P>
    <P>As I have continually stressed, and as we made clear in Madrid, it is essential that the recovery and reconstruction process be owned by the Iraqi people and that high levels of international engagement are sustained for many years. Senators will be aware of my strongly held belief that the UN should be at the heart of the recovery process. I cannot help but see the comparison between Iraq and Liberia which I visited recently. After a horrific 15 year conflict in which people suffered greatly and the country was destroyed, Liberia now has a process in place, an interim government in place, and an election planned for 2005. It has a clear peace process and a pathway to recovery. All of the elements are in place, the United Nations, NGOs and a security, political, humanitarian and development process.</P>
    <P>The situation in Iraq is imperfect in comparison to the involvement the UN has in Liberia. It is a stark contrast. Admittedly, Liberia has a smaller population and it has passed through a different process. However its situation, with all the elements in place, is the ideal. Security in Liberia has the UN at the heart of the process and works with NGOs and civil society. It is a process that allows democracy to grow from the bottom up and that is what we want to see. The UN's experience, capacity and neutrality are essential ingredients in carrying forward the recovery of Iraq.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="578" />We know from the experience of Northern Ireland how difficult it is to achieve lasting peace where deep divisions and suspicions exist. It would be counterproductive for us to impose absolute conditions. Motivation and support are required rather than prescription and this is what we must aim to achieve. We have had good and detailed discussions on this process in this Chamber and this debate will help us move the situation forward.</P>
    <P>I welcome the unanimous adoption of Security Council Resolution 1511. Last night, I heard my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, speak of this as an important development. I am pleased that it took as its starting point the reaffirmation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq. It has also underlined the temporary nature of the CPA's powers which will cease when an internationally recognised representative Government, established by the people of Iraq, is sworn in.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the resolution does not meet all the wishes of all the members of the Security Council. It is by necessity a compromise which will not solve all problems. However, it is a step forward, representing an important advance towards the earliest possible restoration of sovereignty to the Iraqi people under a representative Government. I also recognise that there are major practical security and institutional problems. These must be overcome if an Iraqi Government is to be able to function effectively. Institutional arrangements must be put in place and security and stability must be restored.</P>
    <P>I welcome the strengthened role given to the UN in the physical and political reconstruction of Iraq. I hope the role of the UN outlined in Resolution 1511 will prove sufficient for it to carry out its work effectively. The resolution also calls on the UN to lend its expertise to the Iraqi people in the process of political transition. The Iraqi Governing Council is required to provide the Security Council, by 15 December, with a timetable and programme for drafting a new constitution and for holding elections. This is a significant step towards a clear timetable for the transfer of sovereignty. Having been at the inauguration ceremony for the new transitional government in Liberia, I underline the significance of this. It gives people the opportunity to vote and provides a process leading to that.</P>
    <P>A clear timetable is important in order to give the Iraqi people a clear understanding of the transition which lies ahead. It would also lead to a greater sense of confidence that representative government will be achieved sooner rather than later. It is crucial that the Iraqi people be given a sense of ownership over the political reconstruction process. It is clear that this can happen only when security and stability have been re-established in the country. Iraq will remain very much a focus of the Security Council over the coming months. It is now up to the Security Council members to monitor the progress under Resolution 1511 and work towards meeting the Coun<Col N="579" />cil's aims. The earliest possible restoration of sovereignty to the Iraqi people under a representative government remains the shared key goal. The Security Council deserves Ireland's full support and that of the entire international community in its efforts to achieve this goal. I very much welcome the Secretary General's comment at the Madrid conference that he will do his utmost to implement the mandate established by Security Council Resolution 1511, bearing in mind the inevitable constraints on building the required capacity and his obligation to care for the safety and security of UN staff.</P>
    <P>I wish to take a minute to pause and reflect on the needs of Iraq in the context of the global requirements for poverty eradication and the international community's commitment to meeting the millennium development goals. One of the Members of this House, Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú, referred to my comments when I was leaving Ethiopia after a visit there some months ago, prior to the conflict in Iraq. I noted the amount of money it would take to help deal with a pre-famine situation in Ethiopia, as distinct from the amount of money the conflict in Iraq would cost. That is history now. It is important that we keep in context the actual needs of the global community and in particular the most vulnerable and the poorest of the poor throughout the world. I make this comment in that context.</P>
    <P>These millennium development goals reflect the international community's commitment to halving key indicators of world poverty by 2015. Earlier I congratulated the efforts of the joint UN/World Bank needs assessment mission. This mission very quickly and efficiently assessed the needs of Iraq to be $56 billion over the next few years. Equally rapidly, the international donor community came together and pledged $33 billion to meet some of these needs. Some $33 billion was pledged to a country which is sitting on top of the world's second largest oil reserves. This is also a country with a rich and deep vein of human capital in terms of its educated workforce.</P>
    <P>The poorest and most vulnerable people in the world live in sub-Saharan Africa. The continent is being ravaged by HIV-AIDS, conflict, food insecurity and natural disasters. In spite of this, there are hopeful signs as communities, governments and the international community seek to find new ways of reversing this economic and social decline. Yet in 2001 total aid flows to Africa, a continent of over 30 times the population of Iraq, amounted to a little over $16 billion. This is a stark comparison to the $33 billion pledged to Iraq at the Madrid conference. Surely, the energy and commitment devoted to Iraq and its recovery should be equally bestowed on the countries of Africa. Their needs are equally pressing. The poorest of the poor of Africa deserve the same commitment, the same energy and the same support as those in Iraq.</P>
    <P>As I have said in this House on several occasions, the primary focus of our aid pro<Col N="580" />gramme remains on sub-Saharan Africa, where the greatest numbers of poor countries in the world are located. This focus will not change. I assure Members that the emergency humanitarian budget, which currently stands at &euro;23 million, is by its very nature designed to be flexible. It is not allocated in advance to any particular region or emergency but is available to save lives and livelihoods in whatever region of the world there is greatest need. Our pledge of funding to Iraq has not shifted resources earmarked for major emergencies elsewhere. I have sufficient funding under the programme as a whole to deal with the full range of humanitarian needs and also to tackle the longer-term or development challenges in Africa and elsewhere. I wish to underline that in this important debate.</P>
    <P>In previous addresses I have made to both Houses of the Oireachtas on the issue of Iraq, I have emphasised the importance of a secure operating environment for the effective and impartial delivery of humanitarian recovery assistance. The same requirement is necessary to ensure ownership of the development process by the Iraqi people. I am heartened to note this view reflects that of Secretary General Kofi Annan, who stated in Madrid that success depends not only on the availability of resources but also on security. According to the Secretary General this will be the primary constraint now and into the foreseeable future. It is also critically important, however, that we should not lose sight of the humanitarian needs in Iraq which are still enormous. Helping the people to survive from day to day must be no less an imperative for the international community than the task of rebuilding the country and laying the foundations for lasting peace and stability.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I assure Members that I will continue to do everything in my power to monitor the developments in Iraq and to assist where possible in alleviating the suffering, facilitating the transition to democracy, putting in place the building blocks for recovery and ensuring the UN plays its rightful central role in that process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. He has been here on several occasions debating the ongoing and changing situation in Iraq since last Christmas.</P>
      <P>I was interested in his words of optimism and satisfaction concerning the situation in Liberia and I note what he has said. One has to concede, however, that Mr. Charles Taylor of Liberia on his worst day was probably not as bad as Saddam Hussein. That is one part of the equation that makes the situation in Iraq more difficult to resolve than that in Liberia. The Minister of State indicated what can be done when there is full UN involvement and hopefully that will turn out to be the case in Iraq in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The humanitarian situation in Iraq is inextricably linked to the politics and security situation there. It would be difficult to make lasting positive changes on the humanitarian side without <Col N="581" />resolving those issues as they are all part of the one jigsaw. The politics of &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; is not going to add anything constructive to this debate and will not provide support for the beleaguered Iraqi population. It might give some satisfaction to a small minority of commentators but it will not put bread on the Iraqi tables, remove weapons from the Iraqi fields of conflict or reduce the daily killings in Baghdad or elsewhere. I am surprised at people's surprise at what is now happening on the ground in Baghdad and Iraq in general. No one could have been surprised at the outcome of the initial attack by the US and British military forces. The inevitable happened &ndash; overwhelming power and might won an easy victory. That was not in any way unexpected.</P>
    <P>Just as that initial invasion of Iraq was successful we should not be surprised that Saddam's loyalists are offering strong resistance to the American forces. The phrase &ldquo;they have not gone away&rdquo; applies to Baghdad and Iraq as much as it applies to any part of this island because the tens of thousands of people who were part of Saddam's armies and who propped up his brutal regime may have retreated during March and April but they have not gone very far. We should not have expected them to disappear. It was sadly inevitable that they would reorganise and to some degree regroup and carry on daily attacks.</P>
    <P>These attacks pose an interesting political question for us. If American forces alone were facing the brunt of the current resistance one could argue there was a strong Iraqi opposition and ground swell of popular opinion against the Americans. As the Minister of State said, however, some of the attacks have been against the United Nations and the Red Cross proving that the resistance is not just anti-American. The bombing of the UN and Red Cross targets is a sign that certain groups in Iraq are pursuing a straightforward terrorist trail of bombing and destruction and I am sure that those people who bombed the Red Cross and the United Nations buildings, and who murdered and killed people in those organisations, have no interest in building a new Iraq but want to return to Saddam Hussein's Iraq. These people were the beneficiaries of the Saddam regime. They were his protectors and his police and they want now what they had before. It is in the interests of the United States and of all groups who favour democracy to try to foil these attacks. Above all, it is in the interests of the future of the Iraqi people and their nation to ensure the people who tortured, maimed and murdered tens of thousands of their own citizens over the past ten or 20 years will not set the agenda for the building of a new Iraq.</P>
    <P>Since last Christmas, or thereabouts, we have been debating the Iraqi situation in the Oireachtas. While it has caused much division and some conflicting opinions there was a unanimous view in this House, namely that the United Nations would have to have a central role. There was very strong and valid opposition to the United States for going it alone. It has to be con<Col N="582" />ceded without question that by going it alone the United States and Britain severely undermined the United Nations. That is our starting point now. We cannot replay what has happened but we must ask what should come next. Every person who spoke in the House during previous debates stressed the absolute prerogative of the Iraqi people to be in charge of their own destiny and resources.</P>
    <P>In a sense what the Minister of State said concerning UN Resolution 1511 recognises those facts. We should now demand that the invading countries transfer power and responsibility to the locals at the very earliest stage. There is an opportunity for this early transfer of power to be part of a broader plan of rebuilding the work and the role of the United Nations across the globe. The United Nations cannot replay what has happened since last Christmas but if it can now seize a supervisory role in the handover of power from the present coalition to a broad-based Iraqi administration it would be a major step forward, not just for Iraq but also for the United Nations. There is a great degree of urgency about this issue because as long as there is a political vacuum &ndash; the Minister of State referred to this &ndash; and no clear route map or timetable for handing over power, the uncertainty and doubt among the Iraqi people will fuel the opportunity of Saddam's henchmen. The terrorists on the ground will gain more momentum and support and a vicious cycle of killings, mayhem and murder unfortunately will continue.</P>
    <P>It is not easy to solve this problem but as we have seen at home and abroad a political solution is the only way forward and where there is optimism about a political future or solution support for violence plummets. When hope for a political future declines mayhem and terror rise again. The most urgent task today for the United Nations, the European Union and for all international friends of the United States is to press for, insist upon, and agree a political way forward. Just as the lack of a political process in Northern Ireland, in the Middle East or any part of the globe causes a dangerous vacuum and a lack of hope so too with the situation in Iraq. It is imperative that the political process of building new institutions which will be inclusive and all-embracing is put in place. When the people of Iraq see this agenda they will truly feel that there is a new beginning.</P>
    <P>In that regard it is worth pointing out something not often mentioned, namely that the only semi-accurate means of ascertaining current public opinion in Iraq is an independent Gallup poll, carried out by one of the major polling organisations about five or six weeks ago. Interestingly, the poll showed that most of the ordinary citizens of Iraq feel their future will be better than their past, despite the difficulties in their country and its occupation by armies they do not wish to have there. Let us resolve to ensure their hopes and wishes in that regard are fulfilled. We may argue in this House and elsewhere about the methods used to bring about Saddam Hussein's downfall, <Col N="583" />but nobody can say that the Iraqi people are not better off without him. However, eaten bread will not sustain forever, so the new political future for Iraq must be carved out. The European Union has a big role to play in that regard, as well as the United Nations.</P>
    <P>On the question of the European Union, there have been major divisions between, on the one side, the British, the Spanish and others, including some of the countries about to join the EU, and on the other side, the French, Germans and some others. I hope all the countries of the EU and all the aspirant states will now come together as a positive force for change and, working with the United Nations, try to put in place new structures for a better future. Those who opposed the war in Iraq, whether their opposition was based on the lack of a UN mandate or, in a minority of cases a rather old-fashioned anti-American view of the world, can simply wring their hands and say, &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;. That would be a betrayal of the Iraqi people. If the UN is to have a viable future and if the EU wishes to build itself into a strong and reasonable counterbalance to the only remaining world superpower, we must now show we can lead as well as oppose.</P>
    <P>We cannot ignore the fact that weapons of mass destruction have not been found, but neither can we forget that Saddam Hussein was killing his own people and that he was setting up torture centres and totally ignoring the United Nations over the past 12 years. I fully accept that Hans Blix and his team should have been given more time, but I cannot pretend to be upset at the demise of Saddam. However, if the United States wants to be the policeman of the world, it must bring morality and good authority to its role. It cannot do it alone. The United Nations and the EU must become equal partners in the enterprise.</P>
    <P>Those are the political priorities. The immediate social priorities were outlined by the Minister of State. They include the development or redevelopment of a health service as well as sanitation services throughout the country and the provision of education. There has been a degree of progress over the past couple of months, which is somewhat better than we might have expected. That is welcome, but there is a long way to go.</P>
    <P>The pages of history turn slowly and the jury on what is currently happening in Iraq will not report for at least five years. All of us must ensure, by our work in this House and the Government's work in Europe and at the United Nations, that in the next five or ten years, the people of Iraq will be able to look back on a very difficult period in their history and see that things have improved, with the help of the United Nations. United Nations Security Council Resolution 1511 is a major step in the right direction. I commend the Minister of State and his colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, for what they are attempting to do. We must keep the focus on the UN and on joint EU policy as <Col N="584" />well. That is the way forward. We cannot solve the humanitarian jigsaw unless it is part of the overall political equation. To replay what happened six or 12 months ago is not going to make a whit of difference to any citizen of Iraq. Only what is happening at UN and EU levels can make a difference. I wish the Minister of State well in his ongoing efforts in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in welcoming the Minister of State to the House and I compliment him and the Minister, Deputy Cowen, on the work they have done. I especially welcome the announcement by the Government that &euro;3 million in humanitarian and recovery aid is to be given to Iraq. As the Minister of State has said, it is important that this is not being done at the expense of the Government's programme for the poorest areas of Africa. He said the focus in providing this money for Iraq was to target the pressing needs of women and children in particular. He went on to stress the crucial role that the United Nations should play in Iraq's recovery. That is important given that to date we have already given &euro;5 million, which has been disbursed through the Red Cross, UNICEF, the World Food Programme, Concern, Trócaire and GOAL. The response has been positive as regards the humanitarian crisis there.</P>
      <P>I am glad we are having this debate on Iraq. It may be difficult to see some of the improvements that have been talked about. In the north and south of the country there have been some signs of improvement, but the situation is still very volatile in the area west of Baghdad. The debate has been welcome at UN level. I notice the United States is waiting for matters to unfold in Iraq and it is neither delaying nor hastening the process. At the same time people such as President Chirac stress the need for a quick transfer of sovereignty in accordance with a clear timetable and say the UN should support that. Chancellor Schröder has been talking about the importance of strengthening the role of the UN, something with which we in this House would all agree. I hope serious moves will now be afoot to move towards that transfer of sovereignty. We should be mindful of the issue of security because of the terrible atrocities that have been carried out, as regards the United Nations headquarters and the International Red Cross. It is a matter of grave concern that when we talk about improving the situation in Iraq, the issue of security is still very much to the forefront.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was speaking in recent days to Mr. David Horgan from Petrel Resources, who was in Iraq. I understand he was on &ldquo;Questions &amp; Answers&rdquo; last evening. He has been in Iraq four times since June and he has travelled all over the country, not just to Baghdad. He has been staying in small hotels and meeting the people. He talked to me about the changes that happen week by week and mentioned a few surprises he had come across. He emphasised what the Minister of State has said as regards internationalising the conflict by <Col N="585" />having the UN as pivotal to the restoration of authority and legitimacy in Iraq. I hope the points he has made will be listened to because I believe he has first-hand experience of what is happening on the ground. He advocates that elections should be held as soon as possible, which would lead to the restoration of a sovereign government.</P>
    <P>One of the issues to which Mr. Horgan referred was the question of criminality. That is important, given the fact that we are now talking about the hiring of police and the establishment of an Iraqi army. As a person involved in the oil business, Mr. Horgan has his own reasons for advocating extra oil production. The current production figure is 1.7 million barrels daily on average, less than half the pre-war level. At that time we used to talk about sanctions and I have spoken in the House on many occasions on the depression caused by sanctions. Now that sanctions have been removed, hopefully the bottlenecks that arise within the oil industry should be relieved. The natural resources of this very wealthy country should be used for the benefit of the Iraqi people. That is important.</P>
    <P>Currently, oil production is less than half the 1990 level. That is something one could expect should be improved in the future. We need reform in Iraq. I have already mentioned the security situation. There are also issues I have raised in the past in the House as regards electricity and water supplies. Security, electricity and water supplies in Iraq must be re-established. We are moving from the warm weather of the summer to the freezing temperatures of winter and it will be a difficult time for women, children and old people. People are not prepared for the coming conditions, raising questions about the delay in improving those areas. The Minister of State mentioned that the health budget in Iraq was $450 million in 1989 while in 2002 it was a mere $20 million, demonstrating the need to fund the humanitarian effort.</P>
    <P>At least 60% of the Iraqi people are absolutely dependent on the food rations obtained through the oil for food programme. Amazingly, that aid programme continued throughout the war when logistics would have been a major issue. The short duration of the war may have helped the continuation of the programme and now the United Nations is to hand over the oil for food programme under Security Council Resolution 1483. That is very important and I hope those in charge of the programme will continue to assist with food distribution.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned the Madrid conference. I was glad that Ireland was represented at it and made funding available to humanitarian agencies, the Red Cross and NGOs as the need arises. People were critical of the pledges made in Afghanistan because those pledges are very different from cash. The conference, however, stated clearly where the money would go.</P>
    <P>Regional involvement is vital. There have been allegations that some of the atrocities in Iraq <Col N="586" />were committed by foreigners who have arrived in the country. The involvement of Jordan, Syria and Saudi Arabia has helped previously and they could be a positive influence in resolving the problems in Iraq. Senator Bradford mentioned that the weapons inspectors should have been given more time and I agree with that. The neighbouring countries should also have been allowed greater influence. We must secure such regional involvement because it could help to achieve a lasting peace.</P>
    <P>The suicide bomb attack on the local headquarters of the ICRC and the number of lives lost was appalling, as is the number of Iraqi people who have been killed. The attack on the Red Cross and the bombing of UN headquarters in Iraq were atrocities and I hope the United Nations will come centre stage and help the people of Iraq.</P>
    <P>Amnesty International has produced a report on human rights in Iraq, an area we may have neglected because of the urgent need for security and humanitarian aid. The report makes a good point about the need for justice for hundreds of thousands of victims of state abuse and points out that, as we go about the reconstruction of Iraq, human rights must be a priority for any new government. I congratulate Amnesty International on its report, entitled Iraq: On whose Behalf? Reconstruction must ensure the human rights of Iraqis.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and compliment him on his speech. He and his officials have applied intelligence to the situation because there is no good in being sentimental about it. We are all deeply upset. It is like the joke where a man is asked for directions and he answers that he would not start from here. None of us would have started from here in trying to help Iraq and it is no comfort to those who campaigned against the US-led invasion of Iraq that we are now in this dreadful situation.</P>
      <P>It depressed me profoundly to hear the Minister of State say that he had visited Liberia and the situation there is better than that in Iraq. That is terrible if one thinks of the history of Iraq and Mesopotamia as a cradle of civilisation compared to a country that is less than 250 years old and was engaged in a civil war for 15 years. It demonstrates how terrible this problem is. It is encouraging, however, that so many of us here are so interested in what the Minister of State is doing and anxious to support him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week I read the report in <i>The Irish Times</i> by Conor O'Clery on a speech made by the Irish ambassador to the United Nations, Mr. Richard Ryan, at the University of St. Thomas and St. Paul in Minnesota on the theme of Ireland on the world stage. He pointed out how much we managed to do on the Security Council, particularly on Afghanistan, when we insisted that humanitarian and human rights concerns be at the centre of the engagement in that country. Senator Kitt was right to stress the human rights aspect in Iraq which, unfortunately, has gone by <Col N="587" />the wayside in the invasion and occupation. If we have such a good relationship with America, we deserve to be able to point out to a much greater extent that it has taken on huge responsibilities it is not fulfilling.</P>
    <P>It is hard to see how humanitarian aid can be distributed in large parts of Iraq. Senator Kitt mentioned the first hand experience of Mr. David Hogan, who is involved in the oil industry. Humanitarian concerns are not being put centre stage by occupation forces which are obliged under the Geneva Convention to put the protection of civilian life first. This is not happening according to the reports coming out of Baghdad. It is sad that everyday, the number of American deaths and those of other occupying forces, all of which are regretted, are reported but no figures are given for the number of Iraqi dead, the vast majority of whom are civilians. They are shot at random, not necessarily by the occupying forces but by common criminals, although this makes no difference. It sends a terrible message to the Iraqi people about the lack of value the occupying forces put on their lives that the Iraqi death toll is not announced. Journalists are also denied access to the casualty departments of hospitals, so they cannot see for themselves what is happening there. If this can be brought up with the occupiers, it will serve some good. One cannot expect respect from people unless one shows them respect in turn. The first figure we must start getting is the Iraqi death toll.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that so much misinformation goes out in the US media. For example, it is tragic that the media have been censored to the extent that soldiers' coffins, draped with the American flag, cannot be shown on US television. This is an unbelievable insult to those who have died. It may help the Bush regime, but if I were related to anyone who lost their life in Iraq, I would take it as an appalling insult.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, brought up the statistics from the UN human development index. In the most recent report on the state of the world population, the maternal mortality rate in Iraq in 2001 was 336 per 100,000. In neighbouring Iran, it was 75. Fifteen years ago those figures would have been the reverse. One dreads to think what the maternal mortality rate will be this year in Iraq. While everyone in Iraq is suffering, women and children are suffering disproportionately. Many Iraqi women now cannot go to work because they are molested and raped. There has been a considerable increase in the number of illegal abortions in Iraq. As the Minister of State is aware, there is a system of &ldquo;honour killing&rdquo; among some tribes in Iraq, where, if a woman is raped, it is considered a disgrace to the family and she is killed to restore honour. These women are now resorting to illegal abortions to hide what has happened to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="588" />There are other ways we can ask the US to show respect for the Iraqi people. The Minister of State rightly pointed out that we are attempting to get more notice taken of UN Security Council Resolution 1511. How can this allow the sale of Iraqi assets, apart from oil and gas? If I was an Iraqi, I would fight myself to stop such action. Iraqis, who have been abroad for the past 20 years, when interviewed on radio and television, ask why they have not been given two to three years so they can buy their own property for themselves. It seems extraordinary that this is allowed. It makes the most reasonable of people fight as they believe that if they do not get rid of the occupying force now, they will have nothing left for themselves. In an interview, Mr. Bremer, when asked if property could be sold to Israel, replied it could. Has he any notion of how this could inflame Iraqis? As such actions are against international law, we can object to them.</P>
    <P>As the US does not recognise the International Criminal Court, there is no possibility of US citizens who commit crimes in Iraq &ndash; this is happening &ndash; being brought before it. Countries have signed waivers not to extradite US citizens indicted by the court. Otherwise, they will not receive military aid from the US. Furthermore, no effort seems to have been made to get the Iraqi court service going. I know a judge who was helping them was killed over the weekend. However, something more has to be done to show that the occupying force considers the rule of law to be of some importance. The prison at Guantanamo Bay, however, sets a terrible example.</P>
    <P>Weapons of mass destruction, of course, have not been found. I gather they have been reduced to an anthrax medium which was probably thrown down a drain in an environmentally unfriendly moment. We must bring pressure to bear on the US to resurrect the verification of the 1972 UN convention for biological weapons and toxins. Ireland has put in terrific work in the past and our delegation to the UN in Geneva is working on it again. However, we must make the US understand that it is included in the world order, not outside it. If we are its friend, as we are said to be, we must work to ensure this is the case.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister of State said that our financial contribution to Iraq will not be deducted from our contribution to sub-Saharan Africa. He is right to point out how dire the situation is there. I am also glad that we are to spend most of it through UN and international relief agencies and non-governmental organisations. Good as the IMF, the World Bank and the international reconstruction fund facility are, I heard a suggestion from the US that some money should be spent on PR, so that the situation would look better. I would not like to think that any Irish euro was spent on PR to make the situation look better. The Minister of State is right to concentrate on this aspect.</P>
    <P>After the 1991 Gulf War, I visited, on behalf of the Red Cross, the Kurdish refugee camps in the <Col N="589" />Turkish-Iranian mountains. I was delighted that Irish aid got to the Iranian border. The Iranians, however, were never given enough credit for what they did for the Kurds at the time, considering their own problems with them. At least in this war there has not been the same dislocation of the population and not as many refugees to be dealt with. I hope the Minister of State sends the contributions to UNICEF and UNFPA. Senator Michael Kitt referred to his conversations with Mr. David Hogan who works in Iraq. Ireland had a large number of people working in the PARC hospital until the first Gulf War. Is it possible to contact some of them to inquire of people in Baghdad, in particular, that could deal with the small scale operations that we, when giving aid, are so good at?</P>
    <P>It was sad to note that, while the US Senate voted for $87 billion in aid to be given to Iraq, most was to be spent on armaments. When they had to cut back on items, it was not on stealth bombers, but a children's hospital. We must be careful where our money is going because Irish people look on this as an important issue. I congratulate the Minister of State on what he is doing and he has support from all sides of the House for his efforts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, to the House. He is doing a fine job and it is recognised by all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>It is important to go back to the invasion by Iraq of its non-threatening neighbour Kuwait. The Iraqis claimed that it belonged to Iraq at one time. Whether it did is neither here nor there because it was an act of blatant aggression against a non-threatening state. The invasion was then repulsed by the US-led coalition forces. In that conflict, thousands of Iraqis, mostly young conscripts, needlessly died.</P>
      <P>Since that time, over a ten year period, the bombing of Iraq continued on a regular basis by both US and UK forces. Severe sanctions were put in place which resulted, indirectly, in the deaths of thousands of Iraqi children every month. This was because of the regime that existed. UN inspectors went into the country searching for weapons of mass destruction, which they never discovered and no regime change occurred. The excuse for going to war was that weapons of mass destruction existed and could be deployed within 45 minutes. The leaderships in the UK and US lied to their parliaments and their people about the existence of these weapons of mass destruction and about the potential of Iraq to launch strikes using them. At the time I did not believe that war was necessary. Earlier in the year, Pope John Paul II said:</P>
      <P>No to war. War is not always inevitable. It is always a defeat for humanity. War cannot be decided upon, even when it is a matter of ensuring the common good except as a very last option.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="590" />Not all the options were exercised before the US, the UK and Australia launched a war against Iraq.</P>
    <P>We should consider who suffered most. Although he lost two sons, it was not Saddam Hussein. Although he has disappeared, apparently he still exists. The republican guard was supposed to stand up to all forces of invasion. While many of them have been killed, most seem to have melted into the undergrowth. The people who suffered most were ordinary Iraqis, who are still suffering. We still have not discovered any weapons of mass destruction and now we are faced with a huge reconstruction of a country. Other sanctions could have been imposed to avoid this war. However, as Senator Henry said, we must start from where we are and not from where we would like to be.</P>
    <P>Civilians are being killed on an almost daily basis. Young soldiers, mainly American, are being killed almost on a daily basis. Where will this all lead? As the Minister of State said, the UN must take over as soon as possible. We must remind ourselves of the state of the Iraqi people at present. I repeat some figures quoted by the Minister that show how Iraq's position in the UN human development index has fallen from 76 to 127 in a matter of 11 years. The gross <i>per capita</i> income has dropped in some estimates to as little as &euro;500 or &euro;600. Infant mortality has more than doubled to 131 per 1,000 live births. These are horrific figures. We are now being asked to help these people. As the cold winter is about to start and with shortages of food, the whole country is dependent on assistance, as it was before the war took place.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>We must engage in recovery and reconstruction. We must look at rebuilding the livelihoods of the people and facilitating an environment in which the tremendous potential of the Iraqi people can be realised. We must examine the optimal way in which this recovery and reconstruction can take place.</P>
    <P>Who is doing this reconstruction? US companies have been awarded reconstruction contracts worth not just millions, but billions of dollars. All of these companies were major donors to President Bush's election fund. The biggest contracts have gone to the company in which Vice-President Chaney was formerly involved. Are we supposed to pour in aid to help this process? I previously said here that if Iraq produced bananas rather than oil, the war would never have taken place and I still believe that. The war was primarily about the control of Iraqi oil resources, then about reconstruction contracts &ndash; regardless of the cost in human life and misery &ndash; and finally about the removal of Saddam Hussein's violent regime.</P>
    <P>Having said that, we must ask whether we should adopt the same position as the French, Russians or Germans who want nothing to do with this issue. I do not believe we should. Having <Col N="591" />supplied many arms to Iraq, the French did not want to lose arms contracts. I understand the Russians did not want to join the war as the Americans refused to give them 50% of the reconstruction contracts. I do not know about the Germans.</P>
    <P>There is much hypocrisy. Despite the vagaries of international capitalism, the Iraqi people need help and it is incumbent on us to help in any way we can. Whatever help is provided should be done under UN control. It is time for the withdrawal of coalition forces. Any forces there should be UN peacekeeping forces in which Ireland might play a part. All aid should be distributed in the same way. Following the regime change, the Iraqis are not incapable of running their own country. There are millions of intelligent people and if they have sufficient food, grants for reconstruction and assistance from outside they can take back their country and run it properly with a democratically elected Government. That should be our goal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy" hpid="Ms Tuffy Ms Tuffy">
      <NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming here to address this matter. He said the humanitarian food crisis had been averted. This is excessively optimistic and too narrowly focused. As we know, Iraq already faced a humanitarian crisis and still does so according to the various reports in the press and confirmed by the Minister of State today. These problems include malnutrition, high mortality rates in children &ndash; particularly those under five &ndash; lack of hospital facilities, etc.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Bradford that we must look forward and determine where we go from here. There is no point saying &ldquo;We told you so&rdquo;. However, our actions must be informed by the fact that the war, the sanctions before that and the previous war were wrong and were largely the cause of the problems that have created many of the potential dangers for the future security of the region and the world. The culpability lies mainly with the occupying powers. However, despite what Senator Lydon said, the international community, including Ireland, did not take a stand against the war. It is particularly important that we now take responsibility for the reconstruction of Iraq. As Chris Patten said a few weeks ago: &ldquo;The question before us is not whether we should be involved in the reconstruction of Iraq, but how we should be involved and what is required for it to be a success.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned the Madrid Summit. I welcome the &euro;3 million committed by the Government and the previous &euro;5 million mentioned by the Minister. I ask the Minister to state whether we have increased our overall international aid this year. While he was at pains to stress he was not taking from elsewhere and the importance of maintaining our assistance to African countries, with which I completely agree, my reading of what he said is that the overall funding is still the same. This is not acceptable. <Col N="592" />We must recognise that the war happened and Ireland must accept part of the international culpability. We must also take responsibility for addressing some of the problems that have arisen as a result.</P>
    <P>While I hope the $33 billion, which the Minister said has been pledged by the international donor community, will materialise, I wonder if this will be the case. The Minister of State mentioned the international reconstruction fund facility. It is very important that the fund is administered in a transparent and accountable manner and that it is used properly and effectively. The NGO representatives on the fringes of the Madrid summit a few weeks ago raised the issue of the transparency of the administration of the oil for food funds. It should be top of the Irish agenda to ensure that the money is spent properly in an open and accountable fashion. I agree with the points made by other Senators and the Minister of State that the money should be spent for the benefit of the Iraqi people and that they should have a say in how it is spent. Various suggestions have been made as to how that would be done.</P>
    <P>I draw the Minister of State's attention to the recent Amnesty report on the reconstruction process, entitled Iraq, On Whose Behalf? The report makes a number of recommendations for the attention of the occupying powers and also other governments. Other speakers already mentioned some of these matters. The report states that human rights must be paramount in the reconstruction process and that all parties involved should prioritise projects that relate directly to the protection and realisation of human rights, concentrating in particular on projects relating to enhancing personal security and ensuring access to food, health, education and housing and reform of the justice system. Other recommendations include the involvement of Iraqis in decision making, involving women in the reconstruction process and protecting women's rights. It states the importance of ensuring that tendering and contracts for infrastructural projects are awarded in a transparent manner and that oil revenues are managed in a transparent and accountable manner.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State spoke of the necessity to involve the Iraqi people but I ask the Minister of State to say what action the Government plans to ensure this happens. We do not wish to see another mess created ten years from now.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry raised the issue of the importance of handing over responsibility for administration to the Iraqi people, but the manner in which it is done is very important. I read an article in <i>The Irish Examiner </i>today which used the term &ldquo;Iraqification&rdquo; which is modelled on the term &ldquo;Vietnamisation&rdquo; used to describe an approach by the United States which was basically an exit strategy when the Americans did not want to deal with the problem any longer. This article suggests that the same approach would be <Col N="593" />adopted by the US in the case of Iraq and it outlines the dangers such a strategy would pose.</P>
    <P>There are problems with regard to the ineffectiveness of the Iraqi army and police force. The Minister of State and other Senators spoke about the importance of security and it has been mentioned by Kofi Annan and Chris Patten. It is essential that security is restored so that all the other things can be done, political responsibility can be handed over and humanitarian aid and reconstruction can be provided. This issue was also raised in a recent Amnesty report which detailed the overwhelming climate of fear and insecurity. There has been a failure by the occupying forces to address the need to provide security. There is evidence of abuse of human rights by the occupying troops, such as unnecessary civilian deaths and ill-treatment of civilians. The police force and the infrastructure must be brought up to standard.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry spoke about the problem of women and girls and the general population living in fear. The Amnesty report was published in the UK and makes a number of recommendations applicable to the UK. It recommends the need for an international civilian police force to assist the Iraqi police in carrying out its law enforcement functions until it can operate effectively. It has a number of recommendations regarding the prevention of violations of human rights and recommendations to do with the restoration of law and order. I ask the Minister of State in his reply to state what are the Government's plans for assisting international efforts to restore security and the reform of Iraqi institutions and to ensure that human rights are respected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu" hpid="Labhrás Ó Murchú Labhrás Ó Murchú">
      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other Senators in welcoming the Minister of State to the House. One can only imagine the suffering of the Iraqi people at present and the extent of the fear and uncertainty and sense of helplessness which must exist. It is impossible for any person so far removed from the scene to make any proper or balanced judgment as to what may be happening there. We are dependent on where we are coming from ourselves. The best we can hope for is that we would make some inspired assumptions. A prerequisite for those assumptions must be in the first instance that whatever about the deception of the public by the protagonists in the current war that we should not allow ourselves to be tempted into self-deception out of a sense of loyalty to any one particular player in this terrible tragedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note a report in the <i>Irish Independent</i> where the language used in the report demonstrates a sense of confusion. Those who take part in attacks are not referred to as &ldquo;terrorists&rdquo;. The media refers to them as &ldquo;guerrillas&rdquo;. That in itself is an indication of the confusion which exists. The terrible onslaught on the local headquarters of the International Committee of the Red Cross and on the headquarters of the United Nations <Col N="594" />mission would have been regarded as absolutely impossible six or nine months ago. The Red Cross and the United Nations were always regarded as agencies of balance and fairness. The developments in the situation have become more complex.</P>
    <P>My position on the Iraqi war has been recorded in this House several times and in public debate outside the House. At the beginning of the war I said clearly that I considered it to be unjustified, illegal and immoral. Nothing has happened to change my opinion. That is not to suggest I hold another person's view in any kind of contempt because we are all so far removed from the scene. On the subject of humanitarian aid, I am pleased that Ireland is to the fore as it has been in all parts of the world where humanitarian aid was required. This was admirably reflected by the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt. It is particularly important that Ireland continues that role. Apart from the financial contribution we make, in many ways we will be seen as people who, down through the decades if not the centuries, have always endeavoured to give help for help's sake without having any underlying political agenda. That has been the strength of Ireland's involvement in the Third World and in other areas where war is raging.</P>
    <P>There are short-term and long-term aspects to humanitarian aid. The short-term objective is to relieve suffering without, necessarily, even looking forward to what solutions might come or the manner in which that help might give confidence to people to participate in that organic development in future years. The long-term objective is political in which the aim is to create a stable society and the return of sovereignty to the people. This aspect would include the continuation of international aid.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties with which we have to contend is perception. A European agency-funded poll appears in today's <i>Irish Independent</i>. It was taken on a European-wide basis. The results will shock Members of the House if they have not already seen the report. The question was asked as to what country is considered the greatest threat to world peace at the moment. According to this survey it is the United States of America. The second greatest threat is Israel, the third greatest threat is North Korea and the fourth greatest threat is Iran.</P>
    <P>Some 60% of Irish respondents regarded the United States as the greatest threat to world peace. I do not say this with any sense of satisfaction. If I were asked to stand up and say to which country I would like to give my loyalty, support and credence it would be the United States of America. My answer could not be otherwise, because as far as I am concerned it is a sister nation. The United States has always been supportive of Ireland. It opened its borders to us. It opened its heart to us and helped us in so many ways. I wish to highlight the perception in the report that is evident in Ireland and Europe. If this is the case then how do we begin to create a <Col N="595" />long-term solution to the Iraqi problem? If this perception cannot be changed then the next step has to be a radical reappraisal of where we are and where we want to go.</P>
    <P>The tragedy of 11 September 2001 shocked the world. We still suffer the after effects of the trauma of the incidents which took place that day, both because of their intrinsic gravity and the manner in which they were portrayed and brought into our living rooms. Having said that, we all accepted, or many people did, that weapons of mass destruction existed in Iraq. This comes back to what I said about deceiving ourselves, whatever about the protagonists deceiving the public. The fact remains there were no weapons of mass destruction.</P>
    <P>The political leadership of the United States and Britain are both suffering in terms of popularity as a result of what some people call a lie. I do not mind what it is called. If one wishes it may be called a misrepresentation. Until such time as we can renew confidence among the general public in its political leadership then we will have a problem.</P>
    <P>In the early stages of the war a large majority of those questioned in American opinion polls supported the invasion of Iraq. That majority is gradually being whittled away. The main Democratic Party aspirant for the presidency is now neck and neck in the polls with President Bush. The worst aspect of this is that the Iraqi conflict will be decided on domestic political issues in America and not in a manner in which we should be endeavouring to find acceptable solutions.</P>
    <P>I praise the Government for its handling of this issue. From the time the Minister for Foreign Affairs gave that inspired address to the Security Council to the present time, the Government has kept aloof from the political agendas of the protagonists, while at the same time it has been able to show that we were willing and, as far as possible, ready to help. It is necessary to become more proactive. We must take several steps back from where we now are in Iraq and realise that this is leading nowhere. Some say in an American context that it is leading to a Vietnam scenario, but it is worse than that because here one has the interaction of fundamentalist religion with politics and the interaction of superpowers who want to have greater power within the world. The only hope we have is to speak transparently, sincerely and courageously on this, for which we will be thanked, and not just by the lesser players but by the major players in time to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt, to the House. I congratulate him on his work in the Department. I read his speech with much interest. It is significant and important that we are debating this matter again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debates in the lead up to the war in Iraq were of a much higher quality in this House than in the Lower House, with all due respect to that <Col N="596" />institution. In the aftermath of the war it is important that we debate the matter again. This issue is a defining moment for the United Nations. Kofi Annan has referred to this. The problem has been set up as one between multilateralism and bilateralism. The suggestion is that the US position has won out in terms of the latter. If we want a genuinely multilateral world where the United Nations is a central player in the enforcement of international will within our communities then the United Nations has to enforce it. Much of the problem in this area relates to the fact that for far too long the United Nations stood back and did very little in respect of the problem of Saddam Hussein. Unlike many people who speak on this matter, I passionately believe the end of the Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq is a good thing. I am glad he and his regime are gone and that the people of Iraq can look to the future with some hope, albeit in this difficult time. The sooner the Iraqis are in control in their own country and the Americans leave the better. It will be better not just for Iraq but for the entire region and it is important it happens.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a role to play in these matters. If we want multilateralism there has to be a sting in our tail and an ability to enforce the will of the United Nations, which has been utterly lacklustre and unable to have its will imposed in the world for a long period. That issue has to be addressed, otherwise bilateralism and the actions of one or two countries will become the order of the day. We have a key role to play in that.</P>
    <P>The role of Ireland in terms of helping the reconstruction of Iraq is also important.</P>
    <P>I once asked a NATO general what the Irish could bring to peacekeeping missions. He told me, first, that we speak English, which is a major advantage, second, that we are regarded as honest brokers throughout the world because of our work in many places and, third, that we have collective expertise in helping to re-establish and rebuild war-torn countries. We must bring our collective experience as honest brokers to bear on the situation in Iraq, particularly the experience gained by our Army. I welcome the additional &euro;3 million committed by the Government in Madrid on top of the &euro;5 million already earmarked this year for reconstruction projects in Iraq. I hope that commitment is unconditional and that the money is given to the United Nations as soon as possible to allow it to continue its work.</P>
    <P>The tragedy of Iraq is not just a tragedy of the past year or so. As other speakers said, the country has been war-torn for many years and it has been governed by a corrupt leadership. This is despite the fact that it is one of the wealthiest countries in the region. It has significant resources. It is time the resources within that community are focused entirely on the Iraqis themselves. I stress the need to continue the excellent work of the UN's oil for food programme. Were it not for the United Nations, a humanitarian food crisis would be a huge issue in Iraq. We have been largely successful in turning <Col N="597" />that around. I say to the Minister of State today that we should use the resources of the people of Iraq.</P>
    <P>I am very critical of the United States of America's decision to demobilise the Iraqi army. As Senators know, when the invasion occurred the army fled and its leaders were arrested. Standing the army down had a devastating effect on its members who no longer have jobs and resulted in much instability. Had the army been left in place under a different leadership, it would have been easier to exert influence within post-war Iraq. A great mistake was made.</P>
    <P>As other Senators pointed out, the Madrid conference represented an important watershed for the entire international community. At least half the money sought to rebuild Iraqi society has been promised by the governments of between 70 and 80 nations. While that is important, the Minister of State was right to point out that if the same commitment had been made to Africa where the problems are much greater, we could have gone a long way towards sorting out that continent's difficulties.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome Security Council Resolution 1511 which means the USA has at last been able to obtain full support from all of the council's members. France, Russia and other countries paid lip service support to the resolution, but are not prepared to do much to help with regard to the post-war scenario. The EU and, in particular, France have a huge responsibility to bring their good offices to bear on Iraq.</P>
    <P>Like other speakers, I condemn utterly the appalling attack in August on the UN headquarters in Baghdad and the death, with many others, of Special Representative de Mello. Given the exceptional work it does throughout the world, the day the United Nations is seen as a legitimate target is a poor day for world order. That is why it is so important that security is the paramount issue for all NGOs and everybody else who enters Iraq. I hope the Government honours the commitments it made in Madrid and works with the UN and the EU to bring about peace and security in Iraq.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and compliment him on his speech, his ongoing commitment to his portfolio and on the provision of humanitarian aid to Iraq. It is vital that we continue as a House of the Oireachtas to debate Iraq and highlight issues we feel are important. We cannot abdicate our international responsibilities particularly to the less well off.</P>
      <P>It is often said that winning the war is easy and winning the peace is difficult. The latter is the stage we are at now. Unless we properly manage direct aid to Iraq, we are in danger of Iraq becoming saturated with food aid which is not directed at the people in greatest need. I worry about this because reports from Iraq indicate that food aid is being sold by black market operators. I urge the Minister of State to use what influence he has to ensure that the food aid programme remains under continuous review and serves the people in greatest need and the least privileged members of Iraqi society. This cannot happen without the establishment of functioning government and the rule of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With every day that passes, we see a further deterioration of order. Former members of the Ba'ath Party are regrouping and attempting to destabilise and compromise coalition forces while improving their position and influence with their supporters. Islamic fundamentalists are trying to enforce a type of Islamic rule by targeting Christian stores which sell alcohol. Allied to Islamic elements returning from Iran which wish to install Islamic rule we have criminal and gang elements which profit from chaos and destabilisation. What the local people want most is security. In a sense, they had that under the Saddam dictatorship which dealt with anyone who stepped out of line. When that system was removed, the immediate difficulty of filling the vacuum was created. The fact that freedom brings problems was completely <Col N="599" />overlooked by the USA during the planning phases of this war. The USA did not plan the peace.</P>
    <P>In Kosovo a job was done and a UN model of peace creation was put in place. This begs the question of why we have not speedily moved towards that model in Iraq.</P>
    <P>One cannot remove control from people and expect them to behave properly. Unless we form some type of government in Iraq in the short to medium term, there will be a continued deterioration in security. The Americans are taking a hammering in the Baghdad area, which will continue until Iraqis embrace the international community and ask it to assist. The perception must be changed from one of the Americans as occupying forces to forces which are assisting to bring peace at the request of the Iraqi people. The Iraqis will, in turn, use existing models to bring forward local government and establish law and order in their own country. We must redress the imbalance and remove the perception of the Americans as occupying forces as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the American Government accepts its responsibilities in this regard and, like Senator Brian Hayes, I am encouraged by the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1511. We now have an international willingness to move forward in a productive manner. However, the international community has a responsibility to maintain pressure on the US Government to ensure it fulfils all elements of Resolution 1511. I hope the Iraq Governing Council meets its December deadline, which will allow for elections which will establish a government of the Iraqi people. It is only by doing this that we can ensure peace and stability in Iraq.</P>
    <P>In any conflict, the Red Cross holds an international position which is recognised by all sides. There can be no benefit to any side in promulgating an attack such as the recent one on the headquarters of the International Red Cross in Baghdad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite" hpid="Ms White Ms White">
      <NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on the tremendous humanitarian work he is doing in the Department of Foreign Affairs. As a member of his cumann in Dundrum, I am proud of his work and have been telling my colleagues and friends how marvellous he is at carrying out such a serious job on behalf of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the points I wished to raise have already been mentioned. However, I formally condemn the attacks on the United Nations and the International Red Cross offices and express my sympathy to the innocent Iraqi citizens killed during the war and since it was declared over on 1 May by President George W. Bush. I have sympathy for the American soldiers who have given up their lives for this war and acknowledge the private pain of their families. I watch American television, including Fox News and CNN, every <Col N="600" />night and have seen the pain of parents of innocent daughters and sons who died for their country unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>President Bush and Mr. Paul Bremer, in the UN and US Congress respectively, described this aid package as similar to the Marshall Plan. It is anything but such a plan. The hallmark of Marshall aid after the Second World War was bringing adversaries together to work on rebuilding Europe. They did this successfully and it led to the EU. The reconstruction of Iraq should be in the hands of the Iraqi people, yet President Bush and his Administration have made no attempt to reach out to the adversaries in Iraq, namely, the Shia, Sunni, Kurdish and Turkmen groups, who are involved in a civil war. The US has made no attempt to resolve differences in order that these people can rebuild Iraq together, as was the case in Europe after the Second World War.</P>
    <P>President Bush said that $75 billion will be needed to rebuild Iraq. However, the Marshall Plan had a finite annual allocation of money for each step of reconstruction. In this case, there seems to be no end to when the reconstruction will be finished. There are some 130,000 American soldiers in Iraq. Mr. Bremer and his coalition should have involved Iraqi soldiers who did not fight against the US and by so doing, for every two battalions of the Iraqi military mobilised, one American battalion could go home. In this manner, the Iraqis would soon see that they were running their own country.</P>
    <P>The pain is that the UN and the International Red Cross, representatives of which I met in Colombia, look at everything from the perspective of human rights. The International Red Cross will ensure that even senior members of Saddam's administration captured by the US Government get a fair trial. Since its foundation, the International Red Cross has been seen as a totally independent human rights organisation. It is a tragedy that ex-patriates from the organisation and the UN must be taken out of Iraq and placed in Kuwait, Jordan and other countries. Our generation has always looked up to the International Red Cross.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a pity because I have been taking notes. I thank the House. This has been a good debate with careful and thoughtful contributions as before. I appreciate this because it helps inform the Department's plans for its contribution. I concur that the development of Iraq is dependent on a safe and secure environment. Kofi Annan has said there can be no develop<Col N="601" />ment without peace and security, as is the case with every country we visit.</P>
      <P>I strongly support the view that Iraqis must assume control of their own destiny as soon as possible and I am heartened by the view that the UN must play a central one. Senator Brian Hayes spoke about the ongoing debate about UN reform, with which I was involved last week at a time when Deputies were being criticised for not working. I was playing a role at UN level last week and there is serious engagement with this level of reform. I mentioned our successful involvement in East Timor, where we had international support from the UN. I also mentioned that Liberia has been involved in an horrific conflict for 15 years. However, a peace process is in place with all the elements centrally involved, including the UN and Ireland, and from my involvement in this case, I know we can do a good job. The engagement with Liberia is a difficult, high-risk one, but there is a pathway to peace with which we can work.</P>
      <P>Iraq has proved a controversial debate with many differing opinions but I am impressed by the way in which opinions across the political divide are coming together about the need to move forward. We will continue to do what we do best, namely, provide humanitarian and development aid. The Senator is correct to suggest that Ireland can play a useful political role at UN level. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has often said that we are the UN &ndash; we are a part of the UN &ndash; and it is not an institution upon which we call when there is a problem. My role, as Minister of State with responsibility for development issues, is to help to build and shape the involvement of the UN in Iraq. Our involvement in Liberia is more clear-cut. There is a clear aim towards elections in 2005, but our role in Iraq is not as clear-cut. We know what we are good at and what we can do. There are many other issues to which I would like to refer. Senator Tuffy spoke about human rights and the training of the police and the Judiciary. These are important areas which we will consider.</P>
      <P>I referred earlier to the budget. Thanks to the support of the Government, this House and the public, Development Co-operation Ireland now has a huge budget amounting to approximately &euro;450 million. This gives the Department and me flexibility when it comes to humanitarian support. I will ensure that money is well spent, particularly in Africa. That is my answer to those who suggest there is a danger that we will lose focus in Africa. I know Africa well. I have a strong association with the continent, especially sub-Saharan Africa, and I have the flexibility to ensure we continue to focus on Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Minihan was concerned that food rations should go to the most needy. The World Food Programme has carried out the largest transportation and distribution of food in its his<Col N="602" />tory. Food is distributed on a monthly basis from 44,000 distribution points.</P>
    <P>I would like to spend more time discussing this issue. I outlined earlier how Ireland can play its part. We will do our utmost to continue to do what we do best at a humanitarian level, but also at UN level, which is very important. Ireland can play a very important role at the UN, of which it is a highly respected member. We were asked specifically by Kofi Annan to go to Liberia. We have not been asked to go to Iraq. However, we will do our utmost to help shape the involvement and engagement of the UN in Iraq in the coming months.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contributions. From my point of view as Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, the debates in this House have been most helpful because we have had to grapple with a difficult situation. Many people have been uncomfortable, including myself, with the way this conflict has developed. We have always been realistic about the situation. We want to bring the UN back centre stage but that process has not yet been completed. Ireland should be proud of its role in all humanitarian crises throughout the world and we will continue to work together across party lines. This House has helped me across the political divide to ensure that our policies are well focused. Continued debates such as this will help us to keep that focus.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to open this debate on the Broadcasting (Funding) Bill 2003. This Bill is a core element in the programme of public service broadcasting reforms which I announced in December last year. It provides for the allocation of 5% of the net proceeds of the television licence fee, approximately &euro;8 million annually, to a scheme to fund new programmes on television and radio. <Col N="603" />This initiative will increase the availability of high quality programmes on television and radio in both the public and private broadcasting sectors. The scheme will be available for new programmes on Irish culture, heritage and experience. It will also deliver new programmes to improve adult literacy and additional Irish language programming.</P>
      <P>In recent years the debate on broadcasting in Europe has been dominated to a significant degree by issues related to digital television. The debate has focused on what technology will win out or what business model is most likely to succeed. Some people have criticised the lack of progress in this area. They advance simplistic and baseless arguments. They ignore the spectacular failures of a number of pay DTT platforms. They ignore the rights issues which our broadcasters would face on many digital platforms. They ignore the complex realities and the substantial cost to put up a DTT platform. I do not have that luxury because I must live in the real world, with real policies affecting real people.</P>
      <P>My bottom line is that I want digital platforms for Ireland which work. There is no point rushing to mimic the pay DTT platforms which have lost billions or rushing to mimic the satellite platforms where copyright issues would entail huge financial and ultimately programming losses for Irish broadcasters. I have instructed my officials to assess the options for rolling out digital television services in Ireland, in particular the options related to digital terrestrial television. This consideration is being informed by international experience, including the spectacular failure of a number of pay DTT platforms. My Department is consulting with industry and will report to me by the end of the year. I want whatever solution emerges to include the possibility of a broadband offering. This will improve the economics of the platform. It will also provide much needed cross-platform competition in the broadband sector and it could provide universal broadband connectivity. This is especially relevant to rural Ireland where the market is not addressing broadband demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While these issues are of consequence, it is important to remember that television is primarily about content. What is important is what people actually have available to them to listen to and to watch. It matters little to viewers whether radio and television services are delivered from a satellite, over a wire or by terrestrial means. Audiences are interested in programming. The core aim of the broadcasting fund is simple. It is to provide Irish audiences with more high quality programming. Recent experience in the case of the development of digital television is worth considering. The most striking aspect of digital terrestrial television has been the explosion in the number of channels on offer to viewers. Unfortunately, this has not resulted in an equivalent increase in the choice of programming <Col N="604" />available to viewers. It is true that many new channels provide more choice. There are specialised news, sports, history and music channels, for example. These channels meet a demand that exists for such specialised services. However, as they are generally only available on a subscription basis, access is restricted to those who are willing to pay and can afford to do so. It is also true that many extra channels just offer more of the same. There is a genuine concern that the digital era will result in fragmentation. This could result in viewers being offered more channels while being offered less real choice as broadcasters increasingly move towards a generic schedule in pursuit of the most economically advantageous audiences. In that scenario society would be the loser. Having regard to these developments the introduction of the fund is timely. The aim of the fund is to encourage broadcasters, who cater for Irish audiences, to include in their schedules additional programming of a high quality that is of interest and relevance to Irish audiences.</P>
    <P>The Government decision to introduce the broadcasting fund was taken at the same time as the decision to significantly increase the public funding available to RTE through the television licence fee. These two measures should be considered together. The decision to substantially increase the level of public funding for RTE was a clear indication of the Government's commitment to the principle of public service broadcasting. It was also a clear indication of the Government's resolve that the people of Ireland should continue to be guaranteed a minimum level of high quality programming that is of interest and relevance to an Irish audience. I am of the view that as we move increasingly to a digital era there remains a compelling case for providing the national public service broadcaster with adequate funds to continue to deliver the type of service that Irish audiences deserve and expect.</P>
    <P>RTE's services must continue to be available to all of the population and delivered without charge. As RTE is owned by the people, it exists to serve the people and it must be available to all the people for free.</P>
    <P>I fundamentally disagree with those who argue that with the explosion in new services there is no longer a need for intervention by the State. Nor can I agree with those who suggest that State funded broadcasters should be limited to delivering a restrictive range of outputs. RTE's mandate requires it to provide radio and television services for all the people. I see no justification for revising this legislative mandate.</P>
    <P>RTE should not be restricted to providing niche programming for a small proportion of the population. I have no doubt that the shape and range of services provided by public broadcasters will continue to be adjusted as these broadcasters react to changes in the environment in which they operate. Decisions on what to include in schedules should continue to be based on how best to <Col N="605" />serve the person who pays the licence fee. It would be over simplistic to expect that decisions would be based simply on whether the same service was already being provided by other broadcasters. Many other factors would have to be considered, including whether the service is available free of charge and available to all of the population; does the broadcaster need such a service to engage with certain elements of its audience; the impact of the programming in attracting the audience to other parts of the schedule; and remaining relevant to the audience.</P>
    <P>Decisions on scheduling are complex and are best left to the broadcaster. Such decisions should be driven by a consideration of how to best serve the audience and should not be influenced by the commercial concerns of independent broadcasters. The decision to establish the broadcasting fund should be seen in the context of the Government's commitment to ensure Irish audiences continue to have access to high quality programming that is of interest and relevance to them.</P>
    <P>The Government has acted in two ways. It has increased the level of public funding available to RTE. It has also proposed the creation of the fund to encourage all broadcasters serving Irish audiences to include additional high quality programming in their schedules that would be of interest to Irish audiences.</P>
    <P>The emphasis on additionality is central to the fund and it will be a fundamental criterion of eligibility for funding. Programmes funded must be in addition to the existing requirements on broadcasters and in addition to their existing outputs. The scheme will also be used to fund the development of archiving of television and radio programme material. This is a follow-up on one of the recommendations of the forum on broadcasting which reported to me last year. The forum highlighted the lack of a co-ordinated approach or overall direction to the archiving of programme material at present, and the variety of agencies already involved in the archiving of audio-visual material generally, including for example the National Archives, the Irish Film Board and the Irish Traditional Music Archive.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides the legislative framework for the scheme, which will be prepared and administered by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland. It does not set out the detail of the scheme itself, such as grant rates, allocation of funding to various categories, or assessment criteria and procedures. That detail will be developed as the scheme is put together, and the final scheme or schemes will be subject to my approval, and will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It may be useful to Senators to have some idea of the timeframe envisaged for the scheme. It is my hope that the legislation will be enacted before the end of the year. This will enable 5% of the net television licence fees for 2003 to be allocated to the scheme. It will also enable the Broadcasting Commission to begin preparation of the scheme in the new year. I envisage the <Col N="606" />scheme, because of its complexity and the intention to consult widely, will take some months to complete. It will then have to be put to the European Commission for approval as a State aid. Following such approval and my formal agreement, the scheme will be published and applications will be invited, hopefully early in the second half of 2004. Time must then be allowed for interested parties to develop and submit proposals, and for applications to be assessed. I hope audiences will begin to enjoy the new programmes on radio and television in 2005. Once the legislation is enacted the fund will come into being. In the period in which the detail of the scheme is being decided and applications sought the fund will continue to grow.</P>
    <P>I turn to the detail of the short Bill, which has nine sections. It sets out the framework for and objectives of the scheme, the amounts to be paid to the scheme, the details of the scheme to be included in annual reports and accounts of the Broadcasting Commission, and it provides for the contingency of the winding up and dissolution of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Section 1 is a standard provision which gives definitions for the purposes of the Bill. Section 2 provides, as I have already mentioned, that the Broadcasting Commission will prepare and submit for my approval a scheme or schemes to support new television or radio programmes on Irish culture, heritage and experience; new television or radio programmes to improve adult literacy; programmes under both of these categories in the Irish language; and the development of archiving of programme material.</P>
    <P>With a view to ensuring the widest audience within the State, television programmes may be funded only if broadcast on a free television service which provides near universal coverage or on a cable or MMD system, as part of a community content contract. Radio programmes may only be funded if broadcast on RTE or on services licensed by the Broadcasting Commission. This means the fund may support additional programming on the three pillars of Irish broadcasting. It will be open to the fund to finance programming carried on national, local and community services. As an effort to increase the range of broadcast programmes, funding is specifically not available for news or current affairs programmes.</P>
    <P>For reasons relating to EU legislation, it is not possible to construct the legislation so that the scheme is available only to broadcasters based in Ireland, such as radio and television services licensed by the Broadcasting Commission or to RTE services. The important aspect is that as a result of the scheme, more high quality new programmes will be widely available to Irish audiences. The fund is not for broadcasters but for the audience.</P>
    <P>Section 2 also provides that I, as Minister, may direct the commission to amend or revoke a scheme. This could arise, for example, where the operation of a scheme turns up particular anom<Col N="607" />alies, difficulties or unintended effects. The Bill also provides powers to direct the commission to prepare a particular scheme, if for example it had not put forward for approval a scheme covering any one of the categories previously mentioned. The section finally provides that any scheme approved by me will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 3 sets out the objectives of the scheme. In regard to programmes on Irish culture, heritage and experience, these are to develop high quality programmes; develop these programmes in the Irish language; increase the availability of such programmes to audiences; represent the diversity of Irish culture and heritage; record oral heritage and aspects of heritage which are disappearing, under threat or which have not been previously recorded; and develop local and community broadcasting.</P>
    <P>The objective of the development of archiving of programme material is to develop an integrated approach, including the development of suitable storage processes and formats and the accessing of material by interested parties. An objective for adult literacy programmes is not included in this section as there is already a specific reference to it in section 2. My colleague the Minister for Education and Science will be closely involved in this particular aspect of the scheme, in regard to the national adult literacy strategy under the national development plan.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for annual payments to the scheme of 5% of net television licence fee receipts. This will amount to an annual payment to the scheme of approximately &euro;8 million. At present the full value of the licence fee receipts, less collection costs, goes to RTE to fund its public broadcasting service. The 5% payment will be for the purposes of the scheme and any administration or reasonable expenses relating to it. Costs to the Broadcasting Commission of administration are estimated at about &euro;400,000 per year.</P>
    <P>Section 5 requires the Broadcasting Commission to review and report on the operation, impact and effectiveness of the scheme every three years, or at such other time as may be requested by me. If necessary following such a review the scheme can be amended or revoked under section 2, either on the commission's own volition or on my direction, and the ultimate option of winding up the scheme is provided for in section 7.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that details of the scheme will be provided in the commission's annual report and in a special account in its annual accounts. The Radio and Television Act 1988 referred to is the primary legislation relating to the commission.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the winding up and dissolution of the scheme. This is included as a last resort provision, in that once the scheme is wound up and dissolved by order it ceases to exist <Col N="608" />and cannot be revived. Section 2 already allows for the fine-tuning of the scheme over time by means of amendments or revocations. Winding up the scheme will require the consent of the Minister for Finance and the dissolution order will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 8 is a standard provision that the expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of the Act will be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. Section 9 sets out the short title of the Bill.</P>
    <P>This concludes the run through of the Bill's provisions. Senators will, I hope, see it as straightforward and non-controversial and give it their support. I look forward to hearing their observations on the Bill in the debate. I commend the Bill to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I give the Bill a guarded welcome. A statement made by the Minister to the effect that there was to be a clamp-down on profiteering from sales of radio broadcasting licences was carried in yesterday's <i>Irish Independent</i>. Many of those licences were issued 14 years ago and licence holders are now making excessive profits. The licences have made millionaires of many people and one might say good luck to them. In many cases the licences have been sold on to companies outside the country. I have been saying for some time that it is regrettable there was no provision in the original legislation for a clawback in order that this revenue would return to the State. If it were returned, a body such as the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland could decide how to dispense the funding. I welcome the Minister's decision to review the original scheme and to appoint consultants or consultant associates to look into this matter. This is timely and is very much in accordance with what I have been saying from any platform available to me over the past two years.</P>
      <P>The Bill is welcome. Last December there was a substantial increase in television licence fees to about &euro;140. At the time RTE's concern was that the level of increase would ease the type of financial difficulties it was experiencing. Earlier this year the Minister said that having received the increase, the RTE authority would have to justify itself and that it would look bad for the authority if, at the end of this year, it turned to the State and said it was not making a profit and would need further State assistance. While RTE had a deficit in the first six months and advertising revenue had dropped somewhat &ndash; Proctor and Gamble, because of a dispute, was not advertising on the station &ndash; the Minister has had reassurance that RTE will rectify the problem in the final six months of the year. We would all be extremely surprised if RTE came back next year and said it was having viability problems again. It has attempted to satisfy the Houses on the basis that it is making management changes within the organisation and has shed a lot of people in order to achieve a true profit situation.</P>

      <Col N="609" />It is interesting that 5% of broadcasting licence fees was projected as funding when this Bill was first mooted. Following the review on broadcasting, as far back as December, the Minister stated he was in favour of this 5%. I compliment him on that because he came under pressure from the head of broadcasting division in his own Department who said it would probably be contrary to normal broadcasting to have this money diverted. This is a first time decision. While it is probably healthy to have certain exchanges within the Department, I am glad the Minister is not to be labelled as a &ldquo;yes Minister&rdquo; type of person but is an independent thinker. RTE at the time disputed the decision that 5% of the considerable largesse raised by the television licence fee should go elsewhere. It felt it might go to commercial interests outside the country.</P>
    <P>In recent times there has been a growth in community radio throughout the country. In my own area, we recently had a successful pilot project local radio station in Newcastlewest. Many volunteers and others worked on the project which ran for a period of time. There have been discussions with the BCI to continue with the project and it has moved on to the oral submission stage. I hope that next year west Limerick will have its own community radio covering many areas.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to have community radios on a voluntary type of basis as opposed to the profit-making private radio stations I mentioned earlier. However, many of them face impediments to their survival. In many cases community radio stations only exist because of volunteers. A major impediment to their success is that the level of advertising they are permitted to broadcast on an hourly basis is considerably less than what the private radio stations can broadcast. Also, the funding they are allowed to raise on a commercial basis is limited to 50%. How can a radio station survive on a community basis and set up base stations with the prohibitive set-up costs involved if it has to rely on quizzes and other types of exercises and sponsorship to sustain its viability?</P>
    <P>While the Bill refers to the type of activities for which funding will be provided, community stations offer the particular type of programmes that conform to its objectives. The Minister has said that the funding could probably be increased to &euro;8 million per year. However, by the time legislation goes through and the Bill is enacted, it could be in excess of that because it goes back to the time when the increased funding was applied to RTE. In that context, if the Minister truly wanted to promote community radio &ndash; and he mentioned in the forum on broadcasting that he would try to encourage community involvement and community radio &ndash; it should be possible in this Bill to ring-fence an amount of funding specifically for community radio. This would conform with the objectives of this Bill, whether cultural or historical and with the other activities which it embraces.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="610" />There is a big difference between local radio stations and private radio stations. The private radio stations pump out music continually and probably only about 20% of their output relates to news and public affairs etc. Quite often they do not capture the type of audience community radio captures. Community radio around the country, whether in Connemara or west Limerick, spans the activities of what may be a small geographical population and is often just sustained by a community employment scheme within the area. If restrictions are imposed on community employment schemes, which is happening, we lose the potential manpower base which helps keep the community radio company viable. My main reservation is that while the Broadcasting (Funding) Bill is going in the right direction with 5% of the licence fees, it could go further in trying to ensure that community radio here gets off the ground. It is interesting that the Minister said in the forum on broadcasting that he wanted to foster and promote community radio. Now he has the chance to do so.</P>
    <P>The forum also refers to the future of RTE and the susceptibility of young people to advertising. This issue was aired at the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. I know that BCI is taking steps in this direction and is examining the type of advertising going on. I remind people that if they sit and watch any children's programme at this time of year, and I know the Minister has children himself, they will notice a huge level of advertising of toys. While this is understandable coming up to Christmas, which starts early on television, there is constant pressure from children of three, four or five years of age who want everything they see. This insidious type of advertising is geared in a certain direction. One should look at the Scandinavian model. In Scandinavian countries that type of advertising is done late at night so that parents rather than children are the arbiters of whether they wish to get the toys for their children. I look forward to the BCI addressing this issue.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister's return to the House on Committee Stage. We have often seen Bills in the Seanad, for example, a recent Bill dealing with marine matters, where the number of amendments on Committee Stage exceeded the number of Schedules in the original Bill. When the Minister returns to the House, I hope that the community radio aspect will be addressed seriously and that he will talk to his officials about it. They may have reservations that he is breaking the original spirit of broadcasting by going ahead and taking 5% of the revenue from RTE. However, it would establish credibility within the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources if they advised in favour of this course of action and argued that this would encourage community radio around the country. I speak very strongly on behalf of community radio having heard it in practice. The objectives of the Bill would be better realised by <Col N="611" />local community radio stations. That is my main reservation about this matter.</P>
    <P>It was stated at the forum that the Minister was very committed to community radio. I do not see much mention of community radio in the Bill. I do not see where the Minister states that a certain amount of revenue will be ringfenced. I would like a certain amount of money earmarked for what would be regarded as community content for community radio stations.</P>
    <P>Why does the Bill not make any provision for start-up funding? The start up process for radio stations can be expensive. I do not refer to private radio stations, which exist on a profit basis, but to community radio developments. In many cases, prohibitive start up costs are involved. If a sum of money is available and one sees that an effort is being made at local level, the Department should be able to top up that income to sustain and make a local community radio station viable. If this is not done, the energy and enthusiasm which is often displayed in these type of ventures will dissipate because of the costs over time. Rather than enhancing community radio stations around the country, we will see them going in the other direction. I would not like to see that happening because they answer a need in a local area and address all the different groupings there. They can produce very interesting programmes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of the Broadcasting (Funding) Bill 2003, which is a further step in the evolution of broadcasting in this country. I am wholeheartedly in favour of the intent of this Bill. I welcome that there is to be a fund which will ensure that our culture is given an additional chance of survival and that independent broadcasters and radio stations will be given an incentive to make programmes which may not have mainstream content but which, in themselves, are culturally valuable and will give satisfaction to those who are interested in seeing our culture survive.</P>
      <P>The first major step in the liberalisation of the radio market was taken with passing of the Radio and Television Act 1988, a move which removed RTE's traditional monopoly of the airwaves. The 1988 Act was a seminal piece of legislation in Irish media history. It provided the ground rules for the introduction of commercial broadcasting of both radio and television and paved the way forward for local radio in particular to address the core local audience within a clearly defined geographical space.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Radio, like television, is a broadcasting medium for the transmission and reception of communications and associated services. As a technology led service, past service providers, such as RTE, were given the responsibility to produce and supply a universal range of broadcasting services throughout the country. Broadcasting is a powerful force for influencing, shaping and directing public opinion in areas such as <Col N="612" />citizenship and democratic participation in society. This is recognised throughout the relevant legislation from the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1926 to the more recent Broadcasting Act 2001.</P>
    <P>Regulation, which naturally followed on from Acts of Parliament, attempts to ensure that access to different voices and viewpoints can be realised through fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory behaviour in the market. For example, RTE's radio and television stations are accessible free to air and I hope that they stay that way for the future.</P>
    <P>I am not certain that RTE realises the responsibility it carries in ensuring and guaranteeing free speech in broadcasting and that the licence fee is one way of ensuring that it is financially independent and generally free of the influence of vested interests. Since the passing of the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1926, the regulation of radio broadcasting rested with RTE. Up to the launch of Radio 2, RTE Radio 1 was the only legal radio station in the country. In the mid 1960s, several illegal radio stations began to pop up in many urban communities. The legal station, Radio Luxembourg, broadcast wall to wall pop music in Britain and Ireland for decades. In the early 1960s, Radio Caroline broadcast from a ship of that name anchored near the Isle of Man. They were bound to whet the appetite of the public for their own non-stop music shows, instead of the mix of talk radio, sponsored programmes and céilí music which was the then staple diet of Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>Pirate radio stations arrived in Ireland. These unlicensed operators broadcast a range of mainly music oriented programmes, not available from Radio Éireann, which had a wider remit than just one target audience. The growing popularity of these stations was reflected in the surge of new pirate stations in operation around the country. By the mid 1970s, there were approximately 25 illegal stations broadcasting across the country, while ten years later, this figure had risen steeply to almost 100 locally based stations. This was not too difficult to understand. The ability of the pirates to respond to their audiences' tastes and interests was quickly rewarded by high audience figures and advertising revenue. This occurred in the post 1960s boom and everyone wanted access to the airwaves and freedom of expression. Above all, they wanted a continuous stream of the type of music they had come to love and espouse. It was the type of music the national broadcasters rationed out in small doses. Now, instead, there could be a never-ending supply.</P>
    <P>People also wanted access to the airwaves. The rather conservative, musty, dusty Radio Éireann could never conceive of ordinary mortals on the radio, particularly as the practice of divulging the names of the resident programme presenters had not yet arrived. &ldquo;The Liam Nolan Hour&rdquo;, which actually ran for an hour and a half at one stage, was the first radio programme in this country to <Col N="613" />use the name of its presenter in its title. This was a major shift. In addition, there was a perception among the sharper members of the entertainment industry that there was money to be made in local broadcasting and one recording manager famously described legal local radio as a licence to print money.</P>
    <P>During the early 1980s, the Fianna Fáil led Government decided to publicly support the campaign for the legalisation of local radio and it subsequently passed the Radio and Television Act 1988. In order to acknowledge the historical role of news and current affairs in national broadcasting, all contract holders were obliged to devote at least 20% of their output to news and current affairs, or at least two hours of speech content between the hours 7 a.m. and 9 p.m. each day. Access to current affairs had to be given fair and reasonable prominence beside music on entertainment services. This commitment to a range of features is further expanded by this legislation.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his foresight in establishing this fund to ensure that Irish culture and language, the environment, our history, etc, are not forgotten. This will be seen in the future as a huge milestone in Irish broadcasting, where, for the first time, part of the licence fee will go to the private sector. This is something for which it has campaigned for a long time and now that it is to be achieved, I hope it will make a success of this new opportunity and properly fulfil its responsibilities towards programme making.</P>
    <P>We do not adequately acknowledge the role which RTE, formerly Radio Éireann, had in the development of broadcasting in this country. For all its faults, most of which only seem to be apparent with the benefit of a further 50 years of development, it laid down exacting standards for the medium in this country and set a headline which the stations of today, including itself, might do well to study again. We have come a long way since the mid-1970s when there was talk of providing a second television channel in Ireland. There were those in the Labour-Fine Gael coalition at the time who favoured the handing over of this resource to re-broadcast BBC 1, on the basis, no doubt, that whatever was produced in Britain had to be better than anything which could be produced at home. Whatever its faults, and faults there are, RTE has done a remarkable job over the last 40 years of television, and three quarters of a century of radio. Its productions have been identifiably Irish and we can be justifiably proud of it.</P>
    <P>Without sounding too prudish, I wish to take broadcasters to task for some of what they produce and offer to the viewing and listening public. There is no doubt that standards have fallen sharply across the industry in the last few years. Programmes which would never have seen the light of day a decade ago are now mainstream fare, which is very unfair to today's audiences, to parents trying to maintain reasonably high standards and to young people who are given a <Col N="614" />grossly distorted picture of what is acceptable. One constituent of mine who supervises teenage discos tells me of the continuing drop in standards of moral behaviour of a percentage of our teenagers. He is not critical of them, and he would not say that today's young generation is worse than any which has gone before. I believe that too and am proud of the young people whose standards in many areas of life are higher than those of previous generations. Unfortunately they see examples of behaviour, day and night, from a variety of TV channels, which have desensitised them and convinced them that liberal behaviour is quite acceptable and that sexual freedom should be their most important aspiration.</P>
    <P>This is unfair to a generation which has great potential and which is assaulted through all senses at a most vulnerable age. It will be difficult to roll back the damage which is being caused, particularly through the medium of television, but also through radio. Coarse language is now a regular and unremarkable feature in the media, with the use of words best suited to the locker room. The use of what the Christian denominations refer to as &ldquo;the holy name&rdquo; is widespread and one wonders if broadcasters would trespass on the sensitivities of other religions as lightly. There needs to be a clean up of radio and TV and a raising of standards again in the interests of our children. RTE is far from blameless in this and even last night, a programme was aired which drew the wrath of reasonable and balanced individuals. I understand the content, which was unnecessarily lewd, could be described as unsuitable viewing for anyone other than very broad-minded adults. Surely this &ldquo;arty&rdquo; material is not necessary and must appeal to and be watched by only a minority of viewers? There is no need to labour this point, as those who have a reasonable outlook will have had the same experience and seen the kind of content to which I object.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill before us today are simple, straightforward and highly commendable. If we are not to further loosen our grip on our heritage and culture, we must provide incentives, and make possible the creation of good and appropriate programming all over the country. This incentive is designed in the terms of the Bill, &ldquo;to develop high quality programmes based on Irish culture, heritage and experience&rdquo;. There are large untapped reserves of material all around the country which would prove very interesting, not only to those of a more mature age, but to young listeners who might be exposed to them. Local radio and television must be encouraged to make such programmes and funding is the best incentive. The best vehicle would probably be local radio stations to which young people listen most.</P>
    <P>One only has to listen to &ldquo;Sunday Miscellany&rdquo; each weekend to realise the kind of stories there are all over the country, which would transfer effectively from 600 words to half hour documentaries. One of the most popular home-produced programmes last year on RTE Radio was &ldquo;Hur<Col N="615" />ling's Top Twenty&rdquo; and this year, &ldquo;Football's Top Twenty&rdquo;, the excellent documentaries of Colm Keane. Most of these are based on, made in and represent rural Ireland, yet they are popular with all audiences. The possibilities are endless and one never knows what hidden talents would be thrown up by this incentive. I sincerely hope that it will not turn out to be a Dublin-based fund as local radio has proved that there is abundant talent and material in the provinces.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome this Bill with all of the possibilities it will open up. Some clarifications on the fine detail will be required from the Minister and I have no doubt they will be forthcoming during the course of this debate. This Bill will prove to be a watershed in Irish broadcasting legislation and I am pleased to support it wholeheartedly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome this Bill in principle and will not be opposing it on Second Stage. I intend, however, to put down a series of amendments to the Bill because, like Senator Finucane, I do not think it goes far enough. I note the Minister's general remarks with regard to the changing environment surrounding television not only here but in the European and global contexts. One has to take this into account in any consideration of this kind of legislation. It has become necessary for us as a country, and it is our responsibility as a nation, to ensure that our culture and heritage are protected in the area of broadcasting. The Minister has been quite forthright in protecting our interests in this area, particularly in terms of broadcasting large sporting events and he has full support in that.</P>
      <P>To expect that a fund of &euro;8 million, of which &euro;400,000 will go to the administration of the schemes proposed, will in itself ensure that our culture and heritage are protected as well as fulfilling the other intentions of the scheme is somewhat over-ambitious. RTE has been carrying out many of the functions of this fund for several years on its own. The Bill separates several of these functions and places them under the aegis of the broadcasting authority, as the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland will become. I am glad to see that archiving is on this list of functions because having worked in RTE, I am aware that archiving is a great responsibility and the station has not been able to maintain a full and complete archive. It is essential that this be done. I look forward to exploring that area in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Kenneally mentioned hurling and football as if they were rural experiences whereas both games, particularly football, are an urban experience today and both have a modern context. Colm Keane's documentaries, to which Senator Kenneally referred, are not only documentaries on past heroes of the games but are excellent examples of commentaries on a major leisure activity and part of social and cultural life in modern Ireland. Those programmes are part <Col N="616" />of the modern experience, not the historical experience. As a public service broadcasting organisation, RTE is fulfilling a major mandate in ensuring that it reflects our heritage and modern culture. It also reflects the changing nature of modern Ireland and the drama programmes in particular attempt to do that, although not always successfully.</P>
    <P>The fund and its aims must be applauded, but they do not go far enough. I would like to draw the Minister's attention to several comments which were sent to me, and which I am sure he too received. Dublin Community Television has been lobbying the Minister and has been in discussions with his officials regarding the terms of this legislation. It raises an important point, which I hope we can explore further on Committee Stage, namely, the notion of community media being a distinct strand of broadcasting that should be supported. This was discussed in the context of the report of the forum on broadcasting and it is timely that we look at this. It arose in the context of local radio, particularly in the last licensing round. The Minister might know that I prepared a report for the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources on the experience of local radio stations with the Broadcasting Commission and the licensing process. Out of that has emerged the whole definition and experience of community media, which is also clearly being referred to by Dublin Community Television. Community media, which does not necessarily mean small or local, is entirely different from independent media. Community radio or television does not have to be on a tiny scale. Neither does it have to be based in a small local area. However, it is non-profit making and obviously not commercial, but &ldquo;community&rdquo; gives it a whole different dimension and introduces a distinct brand of broadcasting, which if developed could be an extremely rich vein of broadcasting both in radio and television.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing this Bill does not potentially create the environment in which that could be generated and supported, except in a very small way. I will be tabling amendments on that and I hope the Minister of State will consider them carefully and use this fund and this legislation for the opportunity it provides to begin the process of supporting community media. That would mean funding would have to be available for infrastructure and investment. It is necessary to invest initially in not-for-profit television in particular, which is expensive particularly in the start-up phase, from a public service and community viewpoint as it does not rely on commercial funding and advertising, which completely undermine the whole principle. In the same way, for instance, that community activity in the arts is supported, it is well worth supporting community media and it is timely to do so, particularly in the current era, as the Minister of State has indicated.</P>
    <P>We are in an era of globalisation in the media and of digital television. As he pointed out, we <Col N="617" />might have a multiplicity of channels, but that does not mean we have quality or diversity. Sometimes one sees the same stuff on all the channels. One of the disappointing features is the area of children's television. As a parent I try to keep an eye on what my daughter is watching. It seems to me we are just getting a diet of awful American teenage stuff and we need to counter that with good quality home produced programmes centred in our own cultural and social experience.</P>
    <P>I am not saying we should cut off the American experience. It represents the dominant culture in the world and it would be wrong of us to totally cut off from that and not allow our children to experience it. However, to have that as the only experience is a difficulty. There is also a need to encourage diversity. The greatest diversity one can find is at local and community level. The reflection of community in television would be a very powerful statement. I am not saying that could happen in all parts of the country. However, there is a critical mass audience for community broadcasting, in Dublin at least and in some of our larger cities. That would require infrastructure along with a commitment to invest. It is a pity the Bill does not go far enough towards creating that environment and allowing it to happen, and it is important that is addressed.</P>
    <P>They are the main points I wish to make as regards this Bill. My final point is with regard to RTE. This is the first time that some part of the licence fee has been ring-fenced for something other than RTE's needs. It is important that this should be monitored to see how it is developing. It is possible, for instance, that within the context of the national broadcasting station, better value for money may be achieved by allowing it to carry out some of these functions, such as archiving, rather than having a separate infrastructure to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House, particularly as I have enjoyed the hospitality of his constituency in the recent past. I warmly welcome this Bill and the strong and vigorous defence of public service broadcasting contained in the Minister of State's speech. One or two points that he made deserve to be re-emphasised. He says decisions on scheduling are complex and are best left to broadcasting. They should not be driven by the commercial concerns of independent broadcasters. I could not agree more with that. In the context of there being a multiplicity of channels, it is important we do the maximum within our own jurisdiction to encourage programming that is related to Irish life and the need for high quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully agree with the emphasis of other Senators, particularly Senators Finucane and O'Meara, on the importance of community radio and the potential the provisions of the Bill have to give that extra degree of support for community radio stations. I am somewhat concerned, <Col N="618" />and have expressed this on a number of occasions in a Tipperary context where the local radio, which was commercial in status but community in character, will have its status changed to &ldquo;community&rdquo; from next February. There are real concerns about the ability to maintain employment and the quality of programming. I am not entirely satisfied that a sufficiently level playing field exists between the commercial and community sectors. I suspect Senator O'Meara may be right when she says this Bill does provide the ability to help, but in a fairly small way. I certainly hope that as the Bill goes through the Oireachtas, close attention will be paid to that to see if any means may be found to strengthen the content of support for community radio. This is not really quantified at the moment. As the Minister of State said, much of the detail has still to be worked out. I would like to see community radio stations given the freedom at least to break even, and to collect whatever advertising and other revenue they need to do that rather than being overly hamstrung.</P>
    <P>I said I agreed very largely with the concerns Senator Finucane expressed. We are both well within range of Tipperary Mid West Radio. To come back to RTE, I am neither paranoid nor hostile to it. In most respects it provides a magnificent service. Given we are a small country, with a much smaller population and much fewer resources, RTE keeps its end up well compared to the public service broadcasters of some larger countries.</P>
    <P>The long journey to and from Tipperary has been made much more enjoyable by the introduction of Lyric FM. It is a minority taste but it has been a great success. Having been in the Minister of State's constituency, however, I am concerned about the continuing stand off between the Wexford Opera Festival and the RTE Symphony Orchestra. I wrote about this in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Saturday because a festival needs commitment and flexibility, not rigid adherence to union rules. I hope that RTE will continue to cover the Wexford Opera Festival in the way it did in the past, this problem notwithstanding.</P>
    <P>I have two specific concerns that are not to be seen as critical of RTE overall. Since I became finance spokesman for Fianna Fáil in this House, I have been concerned about the way the monthly inflation figures are covered by RTE. I complained two months ago about a broadcast that struck me as overly politicised. The Broadcasting Complaints Commission did not uphold my complaint and I accept that, but it seems to me that analysis of the statistics does not take adequate account of the contribution of social partnership. Social partnership is not visible in a fall in the price of vegetables or housing, it is spread over all the indicators. Sometimes broadcasts attribute these falls to all kinds of external factors when a central factor in our economic strength in the last year is the way the most recent social partnership <Col N="619" />arrangement has broken the potentially dangerous rising inflationary expectations.</P>
    <P>I spent the bank holiday weekend with a delegation of 160 parliamentarians visiting the Middle East for political purposes and I was disappointed to hear later of the contribution of &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; about the Oireachtas. I am absolutely astonished that it would try to see what offices were occupied. When Parliament is not sitting, be it the US Congress, the House of Commons or the Oireachtas, the place of public representatives is in their constituencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu" hpid="Labhrás Ó Murchú Labhrás Ó Murchú">
      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>Looking through this legislation, it strikes me that we are focusing on areas which have required attention for a long time. Most people welcome diversity because television in a global sense has become commonplace and uniform. We have been lucky that the development of public broadcasting in Ireland has been in the hands of RTE over the years. We can make our views known because it is a public broadcaster and we feel a sense of ownership that has led to many lively debates.</P>
      <P>Prior to satellite television and the independent networks, when RTE had a monopoly, there was a danger of smugness. RTE could refute or refuse to listen to the views coming back from the audience and it is no exaggeration that many people felt that what was on the screen did not always reflect their aspirations or the quality of life they desired. There was not always an opportunity to respond to a centralised opinion that was often seen as elitist because there was no forum to do that.</P>
      <P>In the more competitive era, however, we have learned what life without RTE might be like. Those of us who watch Sky and, to our shame, Fox television, know that we are dealing with the lowest common denominator. It is propaganda that makes it obvious that the service is concerned with the profit margin, a fact that comes across strongly in much satellite television. RTE, however, has established a quality of service over the years which could serve as a model.</P>
      <P>I remember going to America for the first time many years ago and because of our perception of America as a progressive, successful country that was noted for freedom of speech, we expected television to be an inspiring example for the rest of the world from which we could learn but I have never watched anything more banal in my life. During the course of talk shows there was no effort to analyse any topic in depth, they were timed to the second and then there was a commercial break.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even at that stage, in the early days of RTE, we had looked more to the BBC, particularly BBC2, where quality was already established. Programming, particularly news and current affairs, was not just about entertainment, it was about artistic creativity and literary excellence, the goals to which any right thinking community would <Col N="620" />aspire, although it is for others to decide if we succeeded, and we must assess RTE in that context.</P>
    <P>I salute the contribution made by RTE to Irish culture. Looking back on the history of 2RN and RTE radio, we can see that great work was done in collecting Irish music and folklore and some of those involved, such as Séamus Ennis, Seán Mac Réamoinn or Ciarán Mac Mathúna, became icons in their own right, developing a unique archive of material. When Donncha Ó Dulaing went out to the highways and byways, from which his programme took its title, it is impossible to overestimate the sense of importance he bestowed on the communities which would never get to recording studios in Donnybrook but had a story to tell nevertheless, creating a sense of balance.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go over the top in praising RTE because if one does not keep setting goals to improve the service provided, then there is a grave danger that the lowest common denominator will be reached. It is easy to pinpoint areas where RTE could successfully improve and expand its service. Ironically, it was through such a concept that it created local radio. The first local radio was actually organised by Paddy O'Brien. RTE provided the outside broadcasting unit, went into towns and villages and brought together a local team to produce the programmes for a week, while providing technical assistance and backup. That was the taste of local radio left throughout many communities, which indicated that people themselves could be empowered in this area.</P>
    <P>By expanding that particular role, local radio became firmly established. Some might say it was in competition with RTE, but I say it was complementary. Local radio's achievements to a large degree are in the very areas in which RTE missed its opportunities. If only RTE had focused on those areas on which local radio is now focusing, where there is a sense of community and aspiration. I welcome the provision that part of the finance from the licence will come back to the local community, as it will create new partnerships. People involved in prospective community television broadcasting believe they will be sidelined and not involved in future developments. I am not sure that this will be the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and this Bill which is a further instalment in the ongoing national debate on public service broadcasting. It was a joy to listen to Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú and be reminded of those great successes of the past from RTE and how much heritage has been captured. I would love to think we can achieve that in the future too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as commercial broadcasters are concerned, one of the great strengths of what is now being proposed, is that it gives them an incentive to broadcast programmes they would not otherwise tend to. This could also be made a condition of the broadcasting licence in the first place in <Col N="621" />order that they could leaven the lump of their commercial offering with, other, less crowd-pleasing programmes. There is room for both approaches &ndash; the carrot and the stick.</P>
    <P>I hope this new approach to funding will not encourage commercial broadcasters to think that they have no additional public service responsibilities except under this scheme. I am aware that this Bill is enabling legislation and it will be up to the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland to devise a detailed scheme for the Minister's approval. In an area like broadcasting, it is impossible to forecast what will and will not work. There must be room for a certain amount of learning as we go along. I am not sure if there is sufficient flexibility in the Bill to allow subsequent changes in the scheme approved by the Minister. If there is not, then we can look at it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The exact basis of the funding for the programming that will be supported is not spelled out in this Bill. It is easy to overlook the fact that a broadcaster incurs two kinds of costs in creating public service broadcasting. The first is the actual cost of making the programme itself. However, this is not the end of the matter. In arriving at the total cost for the broadcaster, the income foregone by broadcasting that particular programme, rather than a popular one that can raise more advertising revenue, must be taken into account. This is an issue since the Bill specifically provides that the programmes funded be broadcast at peak viewing or listening times. I approve of that proviso. Otherwise, we will be paying good money to have programmes aired when half the country is asleep, a little like &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;. However, by insisting that they go out at peak times, we are putting a cost on the broadcasters. If they are not recompensed for that cost, the incentive to compete for this funding will be greatly reduced, if not removed altogether. Under this scheme, we are paying to make things happen that would not otherwise happen. We have to make sure that sufficient money is paid to the broadcasters.</P>
    <P>One of the more welcome aspects of this scheme is the opportunities it will create for independent production companies, as commercial broadcasters will outsource the actual production of such public service programmes. I expect that the broadcasters will be inundated with new programme suggestions from independent producers. This is exactly as it should be. The independent production sector is one that we want to encourage as much as possible. It must be remembered that after the broadcaster has paid the production company for the work, something must be left over for the broadcaster to make it worth its while to give up the valuable air time for the programme. It is vital that in drawing up the scheme, the BCI allows for this factor. If it does not, all the money will go to RTE because it would be the only broadcaster looking for them. There is hardly much point in passing an Act of the <Col N="622" />Oireachtas and setting up an elaborate scheme, if it only results in RTE getting back the 5% of the licence fee that was taken away from it. There will be no problem in getting RTE to apply for the funding. The main problem is to prevent it from drawing on the fund to make programmes it should make. I term this the &ldquo;lottery effect&rdquo;. We know how much former Government spending was diverted to lottery funds. While this was always denied, we all recognise it happened.</P>
    <P>Public service broadcasting is at the heart of this issue. However, the actual range of programmes set out in section 2 of the Bill is a good deal narrower than would be covered by any normal description of public service broadcasting. In particular, there is a specific exclusion of programmes relating to news and current affairs in section (2)(2)(<i>d</i>). I have no problem in excluding news, but I question the wisdom of excluding current affairs from the scheme's remit. One of the major merits of public service broadcasting lies in programmes of an investigative nature. These are the programmes that tend not to be made because doing so properly is inherently expensive. The long-term, in-depth research needed for investigative documentaries is precisely the activity that tends to be squeezed out of the agenda of commercial broadcasters. However, from a national point of view, such programmes are extremely valuable to the point that they are a necessary part of democracy.</P>
    <P>Is it possible to ring-fence some of the fund to support community broadcasting? Throughout the Bill, the word &ldquo;community&rdquo; is linked with the word &ldquo;local&rdquo;. In some cases, it states &ldquo;community or local&rdquo; and in others, &ldquo;community and local&rdquo;. However, community can be different from local. For example, FM104, a Dublin radio station, is a local one. However, community, in my understanding, refers to a not-for-profit community medium. We should be encouraging that community link in broadcasting.</P>
    <P>I wonder if part of the fund that has been accumulating since the licence fee increased could be allocated to the cost of setting up community television. I was contacted by DCTV, which makes a very strong case for separating community and local broadcasting. This group finds the Bill disappointing in that it makes no provision for the start-up fund or operating costs that community content producers such as Dublin Community Television will face. It states:</P>
    <P>There is no recognition of the added costs, the lack of investment and infrastructure that will undermine any programme production by community television. It is doubtful that start-up or operating costs will be recognised in the scheme that the BCI will eventually present as the mechanism for drawing down what is the only funding that mentions community broadcasting.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="623" />It further states:</P>
    <P>Community television provides much better value for money. Community television around the world has succeeded in harnessing the creativity, energy and resources of communities to create their own programmes across a huge range of issues, from inter-cultural experience to community development to local government to adult education. Coupled with the falling cost of high quality production equipment and low overheads of community television, communities can produce innovative formats and quality programmes for a fraction of the cost of commercial or public service broadcasters.</P>
    <P>It also states:</P>
    <P>Five hours of community based programmes using popular studio and mixed formats can be produced for anything from &euro;25,000 to &euro;120,000 depending on the format. This compares to at least &euro;25,000 that RTE pays for half-hour mainstream production. The fund's potential impact is multiplied through community television.</P>
    <P>I am making the case for community television on the basis of the efforts being made by North East Access Radio in Dublin, which is anxious to encourage this area. I believe it has a case and I urge the Minister to give it serious consideration.</P>
    <P>While the Bill is very worthy of support, before coming back to us on Committee Stage, I urge the Minister to remove the exclusion of investigative programmes to which I referred earlier. Doing so will greatly improve an important measure that I have pleasure in welcoming. On that basis, I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and the Bill, which will be of considerable benefit. It deals with a matter that needed to be addressed for some time considering the public service broadcasting element, which the licence fee should cover. For some time there has been debate over the extent to which the licence fee has been used for this purpose. While I agree that RTE has done a fine job for many years, it is important in the current changing environment with so many competitors in the marketplace that a fund should be established, which would be capable of being ring-fenced as this Bill sets out to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that Irish culture, heritage and the experiences of the past are covered by the Bill. The legislation also sets out to improve adult literacy skills and the archiving of programme material. This will be vital in the future, partic<Col N="624" />ularly when considering the change in culture that takes place each decade and even each year. A considerable amount of our culture has changed in the past ten to 15 years, as it does on an ongoing basis and it is important to record this for future generations. While at the time it may not be commercially viable or considered necessary by the current generation to put such programmes in place, as Senator Ó Murchú mentioned, much of the programming done by RTE in the past has provided a great historical bank for our generation.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Government on its work in this area. This Bill follows on from provisions in the Arts Act, with which Senator Ó Murchú is very familiar, in particular the Minister's commitment to establish a focus on the traditional arts, by ensuring that traditional Irish music and culture is properly funded through the Arts Council. It shows that the Government recognises that our culture, heritage, traditional music and practices should be recorded. It is important to record the change in our culture. Many practices, including farming practices, that would have been part of rural Ireland have now changed dramatically and will change again in coming years, particularly in the light of developments in Europe. At this time of change it is important to record those practices in television and radio programmes.</P>
    <P>The funding of the adult literacy element is of critical importance. On their own, such projects are not commercially viable but they create huge benefit. Research has shown that many people who have difficulties with general literacy are unwilling to address this general problem directly. They find that using a radio or television at home allows them to overcome their difficulties. It helps them develop better literacy skills without the necessity to mention to others the difficulties they have.</P>
    <P>Archiving is critical for retaining and cataloguing information. The free to air provisions are also important to allow such events to reach the widest audience possible. I would not want some broadcasters attempt to use this fund to ensure that they get to continue with the news and current affairs element, which is relatively commercial in its nature.</P>

      <Col N="625" />During the debate many speakers suggested the Bill should specifically ring-fence some of the fund for community radio and television. It was also suggested that the fund could be used to meet the set-up and operating costs of community stations. The Minister will consider these issues and will discuss them further on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The debate has been worthwhile and useful and I thank those Senators who have contributed. We politicians have a keen interest in the subject of broadcasting but this is an interest that is shared by the wider public. The people have been very well served by both public and independent Irish broadcasters and the aim of the fund is to build on this. The legislation is designed to provide a framework for the scheme which will balance both accountability and flexibility and ensure that public money is well used and that the scheme can be relevant and effective in the longer term. The legislation is not complex and the main detail of this initiative will be the scheme. The Bill specifies a yearly allocation and sets out clear parameters for accounts, reporting and regular reviews. Molaim an Bille seo don Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I congratulate him on the great work he is doing in the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>The matter I am raising on the Adjournment explicitly recognises the need for reform and re-organisation of the health service. It is neither in the interests of the patient nor of the taxpayer to go on as we are with frustration on all sides. The way forward has been charted in the three excellent Brennan, Prospectus and Hanly reports, and in more recent times the future strategy for radiotherapy oncology services for cancer sufferers has been clearly set out in the Hollywood report. I know the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and his Ministers of State have initiated many project groups involving the staff of the health services to chart the way in which these reports can be implemented in the most expeditious manner while maintaining the goodwill and commitment of the staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="626" />I regret to say that a similar approach of inclusion and consultation has not been adopted in the case of a very significant group of contributors to the health service, namely the democratically elected local representatives. Like all other participants in the organisation of the health services, the local elected representatives will face change in the reform now underway.</P>
    <P>I do not insist that all current institutional structures remain in place nor do I wish to be prescriptive in advocating one form of structure to govern the health services at this stage of the Minister's consultations but I assert most forcibly that there should be a meaningful role for the democratically elected local representatives in the governance of hospitals and in the primary community and continuing care services.</P>
    <P>It is the local representatives who are at the interface with their local communities in dealing with the problems of waiting lists, access to services and so on. When health board offices are closed outside the 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. office hours, five days a week, it is often the local elected representative who meets and responds to the needs of the community. Local representatives respond to the needs of the people in their own locality, turning their voice into action. It is a central element of the democratic process. The local representative brings a unique wisdom, procured from their connection with the local community, to policy making and decision making on health.</P>
    <P>The Brennan report found a consensus that regional health boards currently delivered advantages in terms of local democratic representation within the health service and expressed concern that proposals to replace the regional health board structure might compromise accountability for the health service. The Brennan report stated that its recommendations aimed to retain the best aspects of regional health boards while making the changes necessary to create a unified national management structure.</P>
    <P>This matter I am raising is fully in keeping with the Brennan report. It is imperative in the interests of local democracy that decision making on health accurately reflects people's needs and that there is a meaningful role for the local representative in the new structure. I ask the Minister to ensure this outcome is achieved at the end of this consultation process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator White for raising the issue and for the manner in which she raised it, highlighting some important points and aspects in the presentation of her case. I am pleased to have the opportunity to explain the underlying rationale for the decision made by the Government on the health service reform programme last June. The Government decision followed a number of searching reviews of governance and organisational aspects of the health system and aims to put in place a modern management and accountability framework <Col N="627" />designed to meet the more challenging requirements of the 21st century, to which I think we all sign up. While the health board model introduced in 1970 had many benefits, it also proved to have significant drawbacks. The design of the new structures has taken full account of both aspects of that experience, as well as the latest thinking internationally in organisation, design and up to date governance requirements. The health service reform programme now in the course of implementation is based on the Government's decisions following the Audit of Structures and Functions in the Health System &ndash; the Prospectus report &ndash; and the report of the commission on financial management and controls in the health service.</P>
      <P>Central to the decision is the establishment of a single health service executive for the health services in Ireland. Both reports identified this as the most important change required to establish the organisational improvements needed to meet the challenges of implementing the programme of development and reform set out in the health strategy document, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You.</P>
      <P>Prospectus Strategy Consultants found that in the past, in an attempt to meet the diversity of patient needs and respond to local consumer and political involvement, a number of structures and functions had been duplicated or executed in different ways. While accepting that the intention was often to meet the needs of multiple stakeholders it found that the result was sometimes weak integration of services and multiple contact points for patients.</P>
      <P>Since the 1970 Health Act, the scope and level of activities mandated for health boards dramatically increased. In this period, individual health boards evolved at different paces, resulting in a considerable geographic variation in service standards and availability, organisational structures and administrative practices. National strategies and policies added additional functions to individual health boards, for example, in areas like population health and social inclusion. While difference in approach by individual boards could be advocated as promoting innovation, it also resulted in a lack of standardisation across the health system, even in fundamental areas like entitlement or access to particular services. In addition, the different structural approaches taken in response to their expanding functions increased the likelihood of variable performance between health boards. The analysis undertaken suggests that the different pace of evolution and the current structural differences both within and between health boards led to practical difficulties in a number of areas such as, for example, ensuring a standardised approach to the implementation of national strategies and working on a conjoint basis on individual service or policy matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="628" />In addition to moving to a single health service executive, the Government has also endorsed the need for improvements in governance in many aspects of the system. Recommendations in this regard were designed to support the adoption of a whole health system approach to decision making at both national and local levels. The critique of current arrangements in this context highlighted a number of concerns, including the potential for tensions between local area concerns, regional interests and national policy objectives and the absence of effective mechanisms for resolving such tensions taking a whole health system perspective; competition between representatives on boards based on locality or professional background rather than objective need; decision making which is not always based on best practice or evidence; and a tendency to focus on operational and short-term issues over strategic issues.</P>
    <P>The emergence of a single health service executive at national level will entail the appointment of a single board, which will have responsibility for the entire range of health services nationally which are Exchequer-funded. The new structures recommended to the Government obviate the need for and do not incorporate the continuation of local statutory boards. In this context, the Government has agreed that health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority will be abolished as part of the overall health reform programme. One of the considerations around the balance that needs to be struck between central and local levels of decision making in this context is the influence which Members of the Oireachtas should have, given their representative role, in determining priorities in a centrally funded health system. I hope my reply so far adequately responds to the question on the organisational aspects of the radical reform package.</P>
    <P>I support Senator White's view on a meaningful role for the democratically elected local public representatives. As she and other Members are aware, I have been most involved in the structures of the health boards and health authority. I fully acknowledge the vital, important and meaningful role of the democratically elected public representative. With the Minister, Deputy Martin, I am happy to work with the Association of Health Boards in Ireland which represents all the elected members on this issue. I understand the Minister has already arranged a meeting which will take place shortly with the chairman of the association, Mr. Jack Bourke and the secretary Mr. Matt O'Connor. I keep in contact with the association and have advised it that my door is open at all times to work out the detail of its input. I would be happy to hear from Senator White if she requires any further assistance or information. If she thinks there is anybody else I should meet, I will endeavour to do so.</P>
    <P>I am advised that provision will be made for the input of political and other interests in the determination of priorities and plans at regional <Col N="629" />level. While the detail of this remains to be worked out, a specific feature of the new structures will involve regular contact between senior management at regional level and the relevant public representatives. I support the continuation of this meaningful role based on my experience as a member of the health board-authority and the Association of Health Boards in Ireland.</P>
    <P>At national level, Members of the Oireachtas will continue to be involved in the overall governance of the health system through their participation in various committees, for example, the Joint Committee on Health and Children and the Committee of Public Accounts. The new structures will be designed to ensure that an appropriate balance is struck between national priorities and local requirements but in a context which best serves the needs of the whole health system and the population overall. The Government has also accepted that there is a need to strengthen existing arrangements for consumer panels and regional co-ordinating-advisory committees in representing the voice of service users. These structures incorporate patients, clients and other users, or their advocates. They work to provide a bottom-up approach to understanding the needs of service users at a regional planning level. These existing models are at different stages of development and will continue to be enhanced. I am conscious of the concerns about the adequate governance of the new structures in a radically restructured health system.</P>
    <P>The Minister has agreed to bring more detailed proposals to Government on the arrangements for political involvement. He is currently completing his consultations with existing health board members, and will reflect on the various viewpoints expressed before tabling more detailed proposals on this in the coming months. I will be happy to listen to the views of Members and ensure the Minister will take those into account before reaching final conclusions for submission to Government. I understand he is satisfied that the new arrangements we are now implementing, combined with the introduction of system-wide best practice governance and accountability systems, will ensure a stronger, more effective health system and an improved health service for patients and clients. I trust that has been helpful.</P>

I was asked to raise the matter by a Labour Party member in one of the local Wexford branches.

      <P>Scoil Charman was granted permanent recognition on 26 January 1996. Consistent with the standard practice which applies to all newly formed schools awaiting permanent accommodation, responsibility for the provision of temporary accommodation rests with the school's management authority. It is the statutory responsibility of a school's management authority to ensure the accommodation it provides for its pupils and staff complies with relevant health and safety legislation and building regulations. Notwithstanding this responsibility, the school is currently accommodated in a vacant factory unit for which the local authority has not granted planning permission for change of use of the premises. The school management authority has appealed the local authority's refusal in this matter to An Bord Pleanála and, the Minister for Education and Science understands, re-applied to the local authority for change of use permission. All in all, this is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs.</P>
      <P>As a minimum measure, it is not unreasonable to expect that a body charged with the overall management of a school would not occupy a building in respect of which the local authority has not granted planning permission for use as a school. The Minister for Education and Science is, however, pleased to be able to re-assure Senator Tuffy and the House that his Department is committed to providing permanent accommodation for Scoil Charman. The Department has bought a four acre site on which it is planned to build an entirely new eight classroom school. Architectural planning of the new school is at an advanced stage. When precisely the project will proceed to construction depends on resources. No decisions will be made in respect of this matter in advance of the publication of the 2004 schools building programme. The Department of Education and Science expects to be in a position to publish the 2004 programme early in the new year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science wishes to draw the Senator's attention to three additional and relevant matters. The Department of Education and Science is providing 95% grant aid toward the cost of the temporary accommodation in use by the school in question. Additionally, the Department has contributed towards the cost of conversion works to the ventilation system. Finally, and perhaps most crucially, early last year the Department of Education and Science indicated to the school's management authority <Col N="631" />its willingness to provide temporary accommodation on the site of the new school. This offer was made in an effort to alleviate the difficulties associated with the unsatisfactory temporary accommodation sourced by the school's management authority. The offer was repeated this year and has been refused a second time. The Minister for Education and Science urges the management authority to re-consider this offer in the interest of the welfare of the school community that it serves.</P>

      <P>If the Senator studies the reply in detail, she will find that it would have been unwise of me to make a commitment on adequate ventilation in a building which does not have full planning permission. An application has been made to obtain planning permission which will take care of the whole matter. If planning permission were granted, it would help to resolve the matter. That is my interpretation.</P>
