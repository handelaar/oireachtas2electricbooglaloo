      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann hereby approves of the scheme for contributory pensions for Members entitled Houses of the Oireachtas (Members) Pensions Scheme which was made by a Joint Committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas on 1st December, 1960, and forms the Appendix to the Committee's Report (T.175) which was laid before Seanad Éireann on 8th December, 1960.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if it is necessary to say much on this motion.  I presume Senators have studied the scheme and made up their minds about it.  There have been proposals for such a scheme over the past 20 to 30 years.  It was necessary to give some form of legis <Col N="277" /> lative authority for such scheme.  That was done in the Bill dealing with the remuneration and allowances for Ministers, Deputies and Senators.  Such a scheme is in operation in other countries and it seems desirable that we should have one here.</P>
      <P>When the Bill dealing with allowances for Ministers, Deputies and Senators was enacted, the two Committees on Procedure and Privileges set up an informal Joint Committee to draw up a scheme.  In the end, they succeeded in drawing up what seemed an acceptable scheme.  It is entirely a contributory scheme.  Deputies and Senators will make their contributions to the scheme and will not ask for any help whatever from the State.  It is a compulsory scheme if passed by both Houses, that is, the contribution will be deducted from the source, from allowances paid to both Deputies and Senators, and, as the scheme lays down, any Deputy or Senator who will have served 10 years when the scheme comes into operation and who leaves either House will be eligible for a pension at the rate of one-sixtieth for every year's service.</P>
      <P>There is one clause which has perhaps given rise to some misunderstanding, that is, the clause which refers to a retiring Deputy or Senator who has a pension from some other source, out of public moneys.  That will apply only to a person retiring who has a pension from Government funds and will apply, in particular, of course, in the case of a Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary.  As far as Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries are concerned, they could benefit to some extent from this scheme but not to the full extent to which a Deputy or Senator who is not a Minister or Parliamentary Secretary could benefit. It sets the limit of £1,000 from all sources as being as much as he can draw.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A scheme like this is extremely difficult on which to get any sort of actuarial opinion.  We did have an actuary working on it and he gave us his opinion.  I should like to say that according to his opinion, it is doubtful if the scheme will be solvent as the years go on, but there is provision <Col N="278" /> in this scheme that it can be amended as time goes on, either by increasing the contributions or by lowering the allowances.  Of course if we take the more optimistic view, perhaps it may work better than expected and we might be able to reduce the contributions as time goes on, but there is provision for amending it either up or down in the light of experience.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything else of any importance in the scheme. The fund will be managed, as set out here, by three trustees, the Chairman of each House and the Minister for Finance.  They, of course, will have a very formal duty to perform, that is, to invest the funds.  They will not be called upon to decide who shall get a pension or how much he shall get.  All that is laid down here and their only function will be to invest the funds to the best of their ability so that they may earn whatever money may be earned from a safe investment.  In conclusion, I should like to say that the Committee who worked so hard for some time on this scheme and who succeeded in producing this scheme which appears to have general approval deserve our very best thanks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>All that is to be said about this motion is that, as we see, the proposals now being implemented were made as a result of the meeting of a Joint Committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas and that being so, I for one am in full support of the motion, as I hope everybody will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that, at first sight, it seemed to me that this scheme was not extremely urgent, but I think any such impression in the public mind has been answered by what the Minister said, when he made it clear that this is really a form of group insurance.  It is a self-supported scheme of the members of the Oireachtas, who are arranging to pay their own members pensions, and, consequently, from the public point of view, while some of the public may say they do not see the necessity for it, nevertheless they cannot cavil at the members of the Oireachtas deciding to start a scheme like this and spending their money in <Col N="279" /> this way, because it seems clear that this will not place a charge on public funds.</P>
      <P>It does seem to me, however, that the period of 10 years is rather short. In most avocations, you have to work a little longer than 10 years before you can be considered worthy of a pension. I do not know if the Minister would like to comment on the length of time prescribed but 10 years appears to be short, and may well prove capable of raising the public eyebrow, as it were.</P>
      <P>There are two further points in the scheme about which I am not quite clear, and which, if possible, certainly require a change.  The main one is that there is no provision for widows. I am inclined to say, &ldquo;as usual&rdquo; because, of course, we tend in this country to victimise the widow&mdash;and that is not too strong a term.  We do not make provision for widows, and we really care very little what happens to them.  I feel that in the case of pensions, just as in the case of salaries, which are intended to maintain the couple, the pension is also intended to maintain the couple, and if half of the couple, disappears, it is unfair that the entire pension should disappear. I should like to see some provision made for widows.</P>
      <P>I also want to ask what happens to the money contributed by members of the Oireachtas who die before coming into the period of benefit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the scheme and to say that, in my opinion, it was quite incorrect that there was no pension scheme provided up to the present.  The fact that the scheme is contributory and that no money is being made available to it from State funds completely justifies it, and justifies any decision made by the Committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also feel that there is a grave injustice which should be put right.  I am referring to people who gave their whole lives to the service of this or the other House in the past, and having done so are left to end their days in penury, or in reduced circumstances. <Col N="280" /> These people would be in much better circumstances had they not given the greater part of their lives, their energies and abilities to the service of the State.  While, in fact, to date, there is no suggestion that they will be helped, I am hopeful that at some time in the future cognisance will be taken of them, whether in the shape of contributions to their upkeep from this scheme or an enlarged scheme, or alternately by a contribution from a State fund.</P>
    <P>I know there are few of these people in bad circumstances, but they gave their lives to the service of this or the other House of the Oireachtas and if they did not achieve Ministerial rank, they are thrown out, with no recognition of those services.  If they were Garda, civil servants, teachers or other employees of the State, cognisance would be taken of them and they would have their own superannuation scheme.  The answer is, of course, that what is being done now should have been done 20 years ago.  There are many things that should have been done 20 years ago, but this is a group scheme and it is no fault of any individual that it was not done 20 years ago.  Quite frankly, I am sorry for these people who have given their services to the State and have not got recognition for those services.</P>
    <P>This is an excellent scheme and it is long overdue.  I only hope that some time in the future recognition will be given by some means to the people to whom I have referred.  They have passed on from the service of the Houses.  They are still alive but they cannot enjoy the benefits this scheme would give them, if they were still here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The newspapers that referred to this scheme last week unanimously used the heading: &ldquo;Pensions for Deputies&rdquo;.  It is very important that the newspaper headlines relating to these discussions should state that the pensions are for Deputies and by Deputies, and not from the public purse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a danger that the scheme might become insolvent at a very early date because <Col N="281" /> it is conceivable that after the next general election, many may pass from the scene of public representation, and the demand on the others may be too great.  After a reasonable life of Parliament, the fund would build itself up again, but it could happen that the fund would become insolvent.  For that reason, I think the trustees might have power to borrow because, after all, we all expect that there will be a new group of long-lived public representatives with long careers who will be able to build up for the future. In the meantime, however, in case there is any danger that some may pass from the political scene&mdash; and many of them have been in public life since the days of Sinn Féin&mdash; we should make sure that the scheme will not fall down in providing for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, the 10 year period is, I think, quite reasonable. After all, it means at least three terms in either the Dáil or the Seanad or between the two, and sometimes indeed it means four terms, because it is impossible to imagine that two terms of the Dáil would run exactly five years.  That is almost impossible legally.  We may take it, therefore, that it means three terms in the Dáil or Seanad.  I think we will all admit that a man who has spent three terms in either House has at least lessened his chances of making a living elsewhere and would therefore require this little help.</P>
      <P>The question of widows was put to me but, unfortunately, when the Bill was being drafted, widows were not mentioned.  I would have to have the Bill changed.  We may have an opportunity of doing that at some future time.  There is, as Senators are aware, an option given to civil servants to opt that their widows will get something, if they die first.  Something similar could be done in this case if we had the legislative authority to do it.</P>
      <P>The contributions of those who do not reach the 10 year period are forfeited, of course.  Indeed, the solvency of the scheme depends on those contributions, and we could not afford to give them back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="282" /> I have great sympathy I must say for the people referred to by Senator Donegan&mdash;the people who served for a long time in either House of the Oireachtas, got a very poor allowance, and are not in a position to provide for their old age.  I have great sympathy for those in bad circumstances. If any proposals are made to me with regard to them, I would certainly give them every consideration.</P>
    <P>The only other point raised was on the question of borrowing.  There is power to borrow in the scheme.  I must say that in drafting the scheme, I did not contemplate that the trustees would borrow for a long period.  I thought that if they exceeded their income by a small margin, they might borrow for a year or so in the hope that they would have fewer pensions to pay in a year or so and be better off.  As I say, the borrowing power is there and can be used with discretion.</P>

    <P>The Army Pensions Acts contain no current provision for the payment of pensions, gratuities or allowances in respect of disablement or death due to disease incurred by officers or soldiers during their service with the Defence Forces.  Such a provision was applicable in respect of service in 1922-1924 and in 1939-1946 when conditions <Col N="285" /> of emergency were considered to exist but, apart from those periods, disease is not considered to be a peacetime hazard of service in the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Disease is, however, a hazard of service overseas with contingents of the Defence Forces serving on United Nations duty and the purpose of this Bill is to enable the appropriate benefits to be made available to or in respect of officers, soldiers, members of the Army Nursing Service and members of the Chaplaincy Service who may contract disease as a result of such overseas duty.</P>
    <P>Members of the Chaplaincy Service are also being included within those provisions of the Acts which relate to the payment of pensions or gratuities in respect of disablement due to wounds attributable to United Nations service only.  All other personnel are already qualified for such benefits arising from wound disablements during their Defence Force service&mdash; irrespective of whether the service is rendered at home or overseas&mdash;and, similarly, the existing provisions of the Acts for the payment of allowances or gratuities to the dependants of officers and soldiers who are killed on duty or who die from wounds attributable to service at home are applicable to United Nations service.</P>
    <P>Sections 1, 2 and 8 deal with matters of interpretation, etc., and are selfexplanatory except that it may be emphasised that Section 2 underlines the fact that the Bill applies to all United Nations service, past, present and future and is not confined to the personnel at present serving in the Congo.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (in conjunction with the First Schedule) provides for the payment of pensions to officers, soldiers and members of the Army Nursing Service for disablement due to disease attributable to United Nations service. The only difference between the qualifying conditions now provided and those formerly applicable is that the time limit for applications has been extended from four to eight years. This was done in response to representations made in Dáil Éireann.  I am advised that four years is normally an adequate period for a disease to <Col N="286" /> show up but rather than run the risk that, because a tropical disease might have a longer period of incubation, a genuine claimant might be debarred from applying through the appearance of the disease after four years, I agreed to defer to the appeals made to me and to extend the time limit. The necessity for such a time limit is, of course, to provide a reasonable opportunity of a medical diagnosis and determination whether a disease is in fact attributable to service at all.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with the inclusion of members of the Chaplaincy Service within the provisions relating to the payment of pensions for disablement, whether due to disease or wound, attributable to United Nations service. Here, again, the time limit for an application for a pension in respect of disease has been extended from four to eight years.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 and 7 provide for the payment to officers, soldiers, members of the Army Nursing Service and members of the Chaplaincy Service&mdash; in circumstances where the normal disability pensions are not payable&mdash; of modified pensions for lesser disablement or partial attributability under conditions similar to those governing the payment of such pensions in respect of service in the periods 1922-1924 or 1939-1946.  In these cases also the longer time limit of eight years for the receipt of applications for pensions will apply.</P>
    <P>Section 6, in conjunction with the Second Schedule, provides that dependants' allowances or gratuities shall be paid to the relatives of officers and soldiers who die from disease attributable to United Nations service and carries a benefit&mdash;additional to those formerly available in respect of deaths &mdash;which enables an addition of 50% to be made to the allowances payable to widows and children of officers or soldiers who die during United Nations service, or within four years of its termination, from a disease attributable to such service.</P>
    <P>I hope that these points of explanation will have helped Senators to understand any matters of difficulty and I shall be glad to deal, when concluding, <Col N="287" /> with any other questions which may arise on the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am in agreement with the Bill, about which there is little to be said.  It is very welcome.  I should like to make just a reference to widows' pensions as outlined in the Bill, and to ask if they will be affected by the normal old age pensions when they become due.  The Bill is vitally necessary in many cases, now that some of these men have died, and I suppose the four years given for the development of any tropical disease is a fairly good length of time, so that nobody on this side of the House can find fault with the Bill.</P>

      <P>This amendment, and amendment No. 2, are in the nature of drafting amendments and are consequential on the deletion from subsection (2) of Section 9 of the Bill of the words &ldquo;being dwellings to which Chapter 2 of Part II of the Act of 1946 applied&rdquo;.  The object of that amendment was to give the courts when determining the basic rent for a dwelling which was not let on 31st December, 1960, discretion to have regard to the basic rents of any comparable dwellings whether or not they were controlled under Chapter 1 or Chapter 2 of Part II of the Act of 1946.  However, it is necessary to retain these words in subsection (2) of Section 9 for the purpose of deciding under Section 8 whether a basic rent automatically fixed under Section 7 is excessively low or excessively high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears, on further consideration, that the consequential amendments already made in Section 8 may not have achieved this object.  The two amendments now before the House will ensure that the provisions of Section 8 will not have been changed in substance by the amendment to Section 9 so that the criterion to be applied by the courts in operating the provisions of Section 8 will continue <Col N="290" /> to be the Chapter 2, or 1941, level of rents, except in the case of dwellings which have remained under control since 1915 where the application for revision of the rent is made by the landlord or by a tenant whose dwelling has a rateable valuation not exceeding £10.  In such cases, the criterion will be the 1914 level of rents.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the <Col N="291" /> Bill is to enable C.I.E. to close the Royal Canal to navigation on two months' notice; under existing legislation, C.I.E. could not close the canal to navigation, unless it had not been used for public navigation for three years or more.</P>
      <P>The Royal Canal, about 96 miles in length, extends from the Port of Dublin to the Shannon at Tarmonbarry.  It passes through the counties of Dublin, Kildare, Meath, Westmeath and Longford and served the towns of Dublin, Mullingar and Longford. Longford was served by a branch, about 5½ miles long, from the main line of the canal a few miles from its junction with the Shannon.</P>
      <P>The Royal Canal was constructed under the provision of a Charter of Incorporation of the Royal Canal Company under the Great Seal of Ireland in 1789.  Ownership of the canal passed to Great Southern Railways Company from the Midland Great Western Railway Company under the Railways Act, 1924; and subsequently, ownership passed to C.I.E. under the Transport Act, 1944. Neither C.I.E. nor their predecessor ever operated a commercial transport service on the Royal Canal.  Commercial navigation on the canal has in fact ceased since 1951.  The Broad-stone branch of the canal was closed in 1927 and subsequently filled in.  Recently the Longford branch and the section from Spencer Dock, Dublin, to Liffey Junction were closed to navigation. There is no longer access to the canal from the Port of Dublin.  During the past four years, there has been no public navigation on the Royal Canal except in a technical sense, that is to say, by locally owned rowboats or canoes.  In that period, the canal had been used on 14 occasions only and the total revenue derived by C.I.E. from tolls in that period amounted only to £10 5s. 1d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have been quite satisfied to allow the position of the Royal Canal to continue as at present until the five year term for the reorganisation of C.I.E. was completed in July, 1963.  The question has arisen, however, <Col N="292" /> of the replacement of various road bridges over the canal and it has been found that the cost of replacing these bridges will be increased subtantially if they have to be designed to provide for navigation.  For example, in the case of the &ldquo;Dublin&rdquo; Bridge at Mullingar which is due for immediate reconstruction, the cost of the new bridge will be increased by about £8,000 if it is necessary to provide for navigation.</P>
    <P>A similar position will arise in respect of other bridges on this canal which must be reconstructed in the near future.  If such bridges were to be reconstructed to allow for navigation shortly before the closing of the canal to navigation the Minister for Local Government feels, and rightly so, that the Departments and the local authorities concerned would be open to criticism for wasteful expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands is at present giving consideration to the possibility of developing the canals generally for coarse fishing and eel fisheries.  The closing of the Royal Canal to navigation will not prejudice any plans in this respect; in fact it should clear the way for further consideration of such plans.</P>
    <P>Lest there should be any misunderstanding on the point, I would mention that the closure of the Royal Canal to navigation would not affect the other obligations of C.I.E. in relation to it. C.I.E. would continue to be responsible for such matters as drainage and prevention of flooding and if, subsequently they should wish to abandon the canal these responsibilities will be transferred, if necessary, to some other body or bodies.</P>
    <P>In the course of the Dáil debates on the Bill Deputies expressed some concern that the closing of the Royal Canal to navigation might interfere with the supply of water from the canal to farmers and other users. C.I.E. at present supply water from the section of the Royal Canal between Dublin and Mullingar to some twenty persons or undertakings outside the city and to seven in the city including Dublin Corporation.  The closure of the canal to navigation will not affect <Col N="293" /> the right of the persons concerned to supply of water.</P>
    <P>Another point mentioned in the course of the Dáil debates was the question of the use of the Royal Canal towpaths.  The position in this regard is the same as in the case of water supplies&mdash;the right to use towpaths will not be affected by the present Bill.  If and when C.I.E. want to abandon the canal they will be obliged to seek an abandonment warrant from the Minister for Transport and Power of the day.  Needless to say, permission to abandon the canal would not be given without due regard to interests in respect of which C.I.E. retains responsibilities nor would such permission be given unless it were clear beforehand that abandonment would not prejudice proposals for development of the canal for other purposes.</P>
    <P>As to the future of the Royal Canal, the present intentions are that the portion of the canal between Liffey Junction and Mullingar will be retained indefinitely for water supply purposes; the portion of the canal west of Mullingar will also be retained for the time being, but ultimately it may have to be abandoned unless it is found possible to develop it for some other purposes.  The portion of the canal between the Liffey and Liffey Junction and the Longford branch have already been closed to navigation.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that this Bill deals solely with the Royal Canal.  The position in relation to navigation on the Grand Canal was explained by my predecessor in the course of the debate in Dáil Éireann on the Transport Act, 1958.  The provisions of that Bill, as introduced, would have enabled C.I.E. to close a canal to navigation on one month's notice.  It was, however, strongly felt by various interests that the Grand Canal still had a potential for future development, and to meet those views the Bill was amended to provide that C.I.E. would close a canal to navigation only where it had not been used for public navigation for three years or more.  The intention of that amendment was that those interests which supported the retention of the canal would thereby have an opportunity of demonstrating that the <Col N="294" /> canals would be used to an extent sufficient to justify their retention for navigation; and in relation to the Grand Canal this situation will remain unchanged at least until the end of the five-year period allowed to C.I.E. under the Transport Act, 1958, for reorganisation of the transport services.</P>
    <P>In all these circumstances and bearing in mind the urgent necessity to provide for reconstruction of certain bridges over the Royal Canal, I consider that the legal requirement to keep the canal open to navigation should now be repealed and, therefore, I recommend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not very much to be said about this Bill, except that there is something sad, if inevitable, about the bringing in of a Bill to terminate the active life of something that started in 1789 in such a blaze of glory, being established under Royal Charter and so on, but I think the Royal Canal has reached such a stage of decay and disuse that we must all agree the suggestions in this Bill are the only ones for winding up, as it were, this canal.  One cannot help having a slight apprehension, just as with the closing of the branch lines of the railways, that possibly we should be careful, even in the last stages, that we retain as much as possible of the usefulness of the canals that remains. It is only fair to say that the only use now of the canal is fishing and the supplying of water and these two factors seem to have been taken into consideration in the Bill and seem to be covered very reasonably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am rather interested in the Grand Canal which is still in a reasonably navigable condition.  I remember the time when these canals were being taken over by C.I.E. and I made some remarks in this House disagreeing with the taking over of the Grand Canal Company which at that time was operating quite successfully and, if I remember rightly, making a reasonable, though small, profit on its operations.  I felt at the time that here we were taking over something from private enterprise that was in fact quite successful.  Very often, we hear that something which has not been a success under private enterprise has to be <Col N="295" /> taken over by the State.  Now we have a case where something was taken over in a going and successful condition which may very easily find itself in the same position as the Royal Canal, the position we have before us today.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to hear the Minister refer to the Grand Canal and to learn that there is a belief that it may still be able to prove useful and be navigable.  As we know, in Germany and Holland and other European countries today, even in this jet age, the canals serve a useful purpose because they provide a rather cheap method of transport for very heavy goods which do not require quick delivery.</P>
    <P>There is also the tourist aspect. One of the most important tourist facilities we have, a facility which, I think, has not yet been developed sufficiently, is the use of the Shannon for yachting and as a holiday area. A very cheap means of getting yachts and boats from the sea on the east coast over to the Shannon is through this canal.  That should be borne in mind in future and we should be slow to do anything in the case of the Grand Canal which would put it in the same condition as that in which we now find the Royal Canal.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, the discussion on the Bill in the Dáil was very full and covered all aspects.  I think it is fair to say that a reasonable and full attempt has been made to safeguard all the rights and interests that will be affected by the closing down of this canal and therefore I support the Bill.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister one question, that is, what is included in the term &ldquo;navigation&rdquo;?  If there were an order, as I suppose there will be eventually, to close the canal to navigation, does the Minister envisage that it will exclude canoes and rowing boats?  That should be expressly stated and expressly understood. Canoeing is only in its infancy in this country, but year by year more people are engaging in it, and if more people come from England and other places for fishing trips, they will realise the possibilities of canoeing and boating in this country.  I think the canal is a navigable approach to the country from Dublin, or from the port of entry, shall we say.  The possibilities of its being available for that purpose should be kept in mind.  I can quite understand that the navigation of the locks would have to be undertaken by the canoeists themselves, but they should be able to do that.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that if an order is made closing it to navigation, it will be made available for boating in that form, at any rate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill sounds the death-knell of the Royal Canal and we all regret that.  The Minister mentioned water supplies.  Water supplies are of tremendous importance to farmers living along the canal and I hope their rights and interests will not be interfered with in this Bill.  Speaking in the Dáil, the Minister said that the portion of the canal west of Mullingar will also be retained for the time being, but ultimately it may have to be abandoned, unless it is found possible to develop it for some other purpose.  I hope that the canal will not be closed down any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister says he hopes it might be developed for some other purpose, is he aware that the Minister for Local Government has a scheme to bring piped water supplies to the <Col N="297" /> whole of rural Ireland?  In Westmeath, there are a few engineers carrying out a survey in that regard.  We intend trying to bring the water to certain areas, to some main arteries which the farmers can tap for their own dwelling-houses with the aid of the grants given by the State.</P>
    <P>I wonder would it be possible to use the Royal Canal as one of those main arteries?  Would the Minister consult the Minister for Local Government and his engineers at some future date in that regard, because I think there is a possibility or a probability that it could be so used?  The Royal Canal is 96 miles long and that would save the ratepayers of Dublin, Kildare, Westmeath and Longford an amount of money.  I do not know if it is possible; I am only throwing out the suggestion.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that portion of the canal outside Mullingar will be left open and will be used by the Inland Fisheries Trust.  I am glad that portion of the canal is to be left open.  There is no doubt that the Inland Fisheries Trust have done wonderful work in the midlands.  Hundreds of tourists came to Mullingar for the coarse fishing and I am glad that portion is being left open for development by the Inland Fisheries Trust.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to reinforce the point made by Senator Cole. The reason given by the Minister for the closing of the canal was the necessity of putting up new bridges or reconstructing existing bridges and such structures might prove a handicap in the future to whatever use the canal is put.  In other words, I regret that the future policy with regard to the canal has not been fashioned before any steps are taken that would make it less useful.  The business of pleasure boats and canoes could very easily be interfered with by the type of structures that would be put across the canal.  I do not see any reason why that could not be decided in the next year or two before any steps have been taken which would prevent an extension of that type of traffic by canoes or pleasure boats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know the great tourist attraction of the pleasure boats on the <Col N="298" /> canals in the Netherlands.  These boats are capable of carrying several hundreds of people.  It is conceivable that the type of pleasure boats which might be put on the canal would be limited by the bridge structures across the canal and would also have a certain bearing on the maintenance of the locks in that, as pointed out by Senator Cole, once it was closed to navigation, it would not be navigable by canoes or pleasure boats.  If that restriction were removed, it would mean that the locks would be put into such condition that they would not impede future development.</P>
    <P>In short, I would prefer if it had been possible for us to have a more comprehensive scheme before us with regard to the utilisation of the canal in order to ensure that no step we are taking would impede future development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support what has been said by Senator McGuire and several other Senators in relation to our canals.  This Bill deals with only one canal and it hands over the right to C.I.E. to close it down.  I feel that our attitude towards our canals and towards this kind of closing down is shortsighted and narrow, and I feel that if it were possible to take a wider point of view, a community point of view rather than a simple balance-sheet point of view, we might well decide that it might be better to spend public money and keep them open.  Obviously, in their present condition they are singularly unattractive. No capital has been spent on them in the way of putting up restaurants, boating houses or anything of that kind, and they have been allowed to fall into a state of decrepitude.  Yet I believe that neglect should never have occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We passed a Transport Act in 1958. On that occasion, some of us tried to ensure that a question about the closing of railways and so on could be brought to the Dáil or the Seanad and the Minister on that occasion&mdash;the predecessor of the present Minister&mdash; was very much opposed to doing that. He said that we must give the company full power on certain lines to enable them to make &ldquo;a go&rdquo; of it. <Col N="299" /> Certain safeguards, however, were inserted in the Act which meant that the company could not do certain things and we passed the Act with those safeguards.  Now I think many people in relation to the closing of branches of the railways and so on, regret the fact that they cannot debate them.</P>
    <P>We were told earlier today that the validity of a motion on the Order Paper is being contested on the grounds that under the 1958 Act, we cannot discuss that type of motion. Now, the 1958 Act did contain the provision, as the Minister said, that the company should not be given the power to close a canal unless it had not been used for navigation for three years.  I think I am not misinterpreting that clause when I say that, and, as I understand it, that clause is now being repeated under subsection (7), Section 1, of this Bill.  Unless I misunderstand it, that is the point of the subsection.</P>
    <P>That means that, in 1960, two years after the passing of the 1958 Act, which contained the proviso that a canal could not be closed unless it had not been used for navigation purposes for three years, we are being asked to reverse that proviso and give power to C.I.E. to close a canal.  In other words, one of the safeguards, the inclusion of which persuaded us to pass the 1958 Act, is now being removed. I do not favour that type of legislation.  I feel that it is getting in by the back door something we resolutely opposed when the 1958 Act was before us.</P>
    <P>It may well be that the poor old Royal Canal is in such bad shape now that most of its water reaches cannot be used for navigation.  I am not in a position to say, but what has been said by Senator McGuire about maintaining navigable waterways from the east of Ireland to the Shannon is of very great importance.  I agree with him when he says we have not done half enough in this way.  I am convinced that, apart from the local market which would be small, there would be a big British market for such boating facilities if the canal were developed and <Col N="300" /> advertised.  It might be possible on a large scale to bring yachts over from Britain to traverse Ireland by canal and use the Shannon territory as the Norfolk Broads are used.  The Norfolk Broads, are now, I understand, seriously overcrowded, through they have, of course, an immense mileage of canal and river.</P>
    <P>Nobody talks of closing those canals merely because they are not used for commercial freight traffic; they are used for pleasure boats.  C.I.E. has not been imaginative enough to attempt to develop that kind of boating on our waterways.  They have been content to let them fall into decrepitude, and then have come to us to ask us to close them altogether and that is not good enough.  It might be justifiable from a short-term point of view by a single company, but certainly it is not justifiable from the national point of view.</P>
    <P>With relation to our waterways, therefore, of which the Royal Canal is one, we in Dublin do not use our waterways as we should.  Some Senators mentioned the Continental canals and boating facilities.  Around Dublin &mdash;inland, which is largely the canals&mdash; such facilities are monstrously inadequate by Continental standards, but all that C.I.E. can do is to ask for power to close the canals, to fill in some sections and abandon others.  It may not be strictly a C.I.E. responsibility, unless it has great drive and initiative with regard to that aspect of its work, but I do not think C.I.E. should be given power to veto forever those possibilities as they might be developed by others.  Consequently, I am opposed to the Bill on those general grounds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>A constructive point was made by Senator McGuire when he said we were closing something which was paying.  With regard to the general transport situation of the country, I suppose the small must give way to the great and though a small unit of transport is paying, it must give way to a large unit of transport that wants to assimilate the work done by the smaller unit and so perhaps make the large unit more economic. <Col N="301" /> I am sure at least that that is the reasoning behind the closing of the canals but it is pathetic to see a private company now extinct, while a public company carries on the same work but not in the same way, takes over its operations and endeavours, by increasing its turnover and reducing overheads, to make itself pay.</P>
      <P>That is the way of all flesh, I suppose, but I would like to sound a note of warning inasmuch as the sort of authority, the sort of operation, proffered in this Bill before us to-day which is soon to become an Act is a steamroll sort of operation, an operation from which we get the right result whether the way of doing it is right or not.  I am fully aware that in the past few years we have had, and in the next few years, we shall have, the greatest drive ever made to make C.I.E. pay.  It is quite right that there should be such a drive but when we close up canals, we come very close to something of which I disapprove, interference with the rights of private individuals, private companies and private citizens who are carrying on a business which crosses the operations of a great national transport company which we are trying to make pay.</P>
      <P>I know that that has only a slight relationship with the Bill we are now discussing but that is the way I feel about it and about all the operations carried out to make C.I.E. pay: they should be examined by the Minister in the light of whether they are bearing down too heavily on any section of the population, on any private company or any set of individuals.</P>

      <P>I leith na ceiste seo, tá roinnt ceisteanna tagaithe im aigne féin ina thaobh.  &ldquo;The closing of the Royal Canal&rdquo;; an tús, an bunús atá leis seo: cad is ciall le &ldquo;closing&rdquo;?  De réir mar thuigimid an chaint is éagóir ar shlí ná beidh trácht a thuilleadh ag gabháil tríd, ach níl dul as sin, is dóigh liom; tá an pobal tar éis na canáil a thréigint ar son gléas eile iompair.  Níl aon ord nua le cur ann ach amháin an méid atá luaite ag cainteoirí agus atá luaite ag an Aire féin, go n-úsáidfear cuid den uisce a sholáthair do chuid de na <Col N="302" /> daoine atá ina gcónaí in aice leis an gcanáil seo.</P>
      <P>Má bhíonn sé sin mar ócáid phoiblí, mar riachtanas poiblí i leith na canálach, cé hé go mbeidh cúram air an chanáil a choimeád i gceart?  An é an comhairle condae é go bhfuil orthu uisce a sholáthar do na tithe agus do na daoine atá ina gcónaí sna háiteanna sin nó cé choimeádfaidh an t-uisce sa chanáil?  Rud is ea uisce atá tugtha do rith leis féin má gheibheann sé an chaoi.  Sna canála san tá comhla, tá doirse, tá geataí, tá glasanna.  Má caithfear an chanáil a choimeád ar siúl nó in éifeacht nó cúram uisce a sholáthar don phobal, cé hé go mbeidh sé mar chúram air aire a thabhairt go mbeidh uisce sa chanáil agus na doirse, na comhaltaí a choimeád ionas ná lobhfaidh siad agus ná titfidh siad as a chéile?</P>
      <P>Tá caint ar iasc nó ar iascaireacht nó ar bheathú éisc a bheith ar siúl sna háiteanna sin.  Caithfidh dream éigin eile a bheith freagrach as sin.  Cé a bheidh freagrach as uisce a choimeád in áiteanna agus an obair a choimeád ar siúl?  Cuir i gcás go raibh droichid le déanamh thar an gcanáil agus iad ró-íseal do thrácht nó do sheoltóireacht nó do bhádóireacht ar feadh na canálach féin: an mbeidh cead ag an gcomhairle chontae droichead íseal a chur thar an gcanáil sin agus é a chur choíche as feidhm maidir le bádóireacht nó aon ní dá leithéid a chur ar siúl arís ann?</P>
      <P>Tá an cheist san im aigne maidir leis an gcanál.  Cé bheidh freagrach má usáidtear iad do sholáthar uisce agus freagarach go mbeidh uisce ann? Ní hé Córas Iompair Éireann é, is dócha, má bhíonn cúram na canálach bainte díobh.  Tá rud eile sa cheist: ní bhíonn clathacha, claidheanna nó bancanna na canálach sin i gcónaí ó bhaol.  Má thagann bearna agus má ritheann an t-uisce síos ar fud na bpáirceanna an mbeidh Córas Iompair Éireann freagrach as an mbearna sin alíonadh agus a dheisiú?  Tá a lán ceisteanna ina thaobh sin ag gabháil leis an obair.  Níl dul as na canála a chur as feidhm oibre.  Tá an pobal tar éis iad a thréigint agus ní féidir go gcuirfidh an pobal an obtair chéanna ar siúl ortha arsís.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="303" /> Tá an pobal sa gcaoi chéanna ag tréigint na traenacha agus ag dul le gléas eile iompair agus ní féidir é sin a stopadh, ach má bhíonn an chanáil á coimeád oscailte, gan í a líonadh le cré arís, cé hiad sa deireadh a bheidh freagrach as aon éalaithe, damáiste nó briseadh nó má théann an t-uisce a bhionn sna canála i ndísc go mór mhór má bhítear ag brath orthu le huisce a sholáthar in aon cheantar?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the Senators here have been extremely sentimental in dealing with the Royal Canal and I suppose that is understandable.  A number of Senators have made points which are not strictly applicable to the Bill at all.  I do not see that C.I.E., as a semi-state corporation, has any obligation to provide facilities for pleasure boating.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington mentioned the monstrous lack of facilities for boating in and around Dublin.  He could have gone further and added that there was a monstrous lack of enthusiasm for any kind of boating at all in this country, so that there is no use in talking about providing facilities for boating when you have no boats to engage in that activity.</P>
      <P>This measure was, I presume, brought about by the fact that the Royal Canal can be said to have fallen into disuse for a long number of years. So far as the farming community west of Mullingar are concerned, many of them regard it merely as a nuisance. Whatever point might be made regarding the provision of drainage, that would be the only point that would count as far as they are concerned. Certainly those people who have been inconvenienced all down the years by the canal cutting through their lands at the most vital points will not be sorry to see it abandoned.  I know a number of farmers who would be very glad to get back the portion of the canal running through their lands in order to get a right of way to the land which was cut off when the canal was cut, in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither is there any use in arguing that C.I.E. should keep the canal there in the hope that at some future stage it might be used.  The Minister said <Col N="304" /> that the canal had been used only about 14 times in the past four or five years, and that since 1951, it has not been used in a commercial sense at all, and the revenue from it amounted to roughly £10.  I do not see, therefore, that there is anything to be gained by keeping on a property which has largely fallen into disuse.</P>
    <P>Surely if the Royal Canal was not used during the war years when we were short of fuel and finding it hard to move transportable goods, it is hard to see that it will be used in the future.  It will be very hard to make a case that it would be of any benefit to the community.  Similarly, whatever about the portion of the canal between Dublin and Mullingar, and whatever potentialities it may have regarding fishing, those potentialities will be limited from many points of view.  We in this country do not use even the Shannon, which is a lovely river.  Senators have spoken in a rather nostalgic fashion about pleasure boating.  I would invite any of them to come down the Shannon in summer, and they would see there the complete lack of interest in boating in general, apart from the very few little pleasure boats and the boats belonging to fishermen.  An argument against this Bill on the ground that it is going to deprive somebody of pleasure in that regard has no basis.</P>
    <P>I would press on the Minister to consider and, if necessary, recommend to the company, the proposition of abandoning the canal altogether west of Mullingar and returning the portions to the owners in the first instance.  If the company had to make provision for drainage or some other vital matter, these matters could be ironed out between the landowners, the company and the local authorities concerned.  Certainly from Mullingar down, the canal makes no provision, as far as I know, for water supplies. On these grounds, coupled with the facts I have put forward, I would be in favour of abandoning it as a loss to the company and to the community in general.</P>

      <P>I have a recollection that when the Transport Act, 1958, was going through the House, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the present Taoiseach, gave a very definite assurance that these canals would not be closed down, unless it happened that, within any period of three years, no form of transport had traversed either of the canals. I throught he was very emphatic on that.  If my recollection is wrong, if that was not the position, why did the Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1958 not avail himself of the opportunity at the time, if the Royal Canal is as useless as it is said to be, to provide in the 1958 Act for closing down the Royal Canal?</P>
      <P>As far as I can see, transport legislation in this country is developing piecemeal.  First of all, we set up a statutory body whose actions cannot be questioned.  The Taoiseach in the Dáil the other day would not consider allowing a motion on the Order Paper in relation to the closing of the West Cork and Waterford to Tramore railways. Then it is said we decided to give this authority to a semi-state body.  We are giving this authority to a semi-state body and the people's Parliament are not able in any way to question what is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rail and transport system of this country is being dismembered in a way that would remind one of the type of policy followed by someone who had a vested interest in getting more and more lorries and more and more motor cars on the roads of Ireland.  I am not saying that the Minister or anybody else associated with the Government has such vested interest, but if there were somebody with a vested interest in putting more and more traffic on the road, he could not go about it in a better way than the Minister and the Government have gone by transport legislation in this country for the past few years.  It does not matter a thráinín to the Government what representations the people make; it does not make the <Col N="308" /> slightest difference to C.I.E. what figures or arguments are produced by the people who are being robbed of the facilities of a railway line.</P>

What will be the ultimate cost to repair and maintain the roads that will be used more and more as a result of the closing down of railway lines and of potential forms of transport other than railways?</P>

      <P>With respect, it is pertinent and entirely relevant to draw an analogy between the conduct of C.I.E. in relation to railways and their conduct in relation to canals.  Without a doubt, the next thing that will happen is that we will have another Bill to close down the Grand Canal, and so it will go on.  The Board of C.I.E. are not making any attempt to get traffic on to their system.  They have adopted a <i>non possumus</i> attitude, the bleak and pessimistic attitude that railways and canals can never pay and that the only thing to do is to get rid of them.</P>

      <P>I do not think that what I have to suggest is out of order.  I agree that some of these canals were eyesores and the sooner such eyesores are removed the better.  I would suggest that, when the canal is closed, the possibility of utilising it as a means of bringing cattle from the cattle market to the North Wall should be considered. If the water were taken out, <Col N="309" /> the canal could be used to bring cattle from the market district right to the North Wall.  In that way, we might get over the big difficulty of having to drive cattle through the city on market and other days.  The site of the present market is quite convenient to the canal and cattle could conveniently be taken from the market to the line of the canal.  There is the possibility that the cattle could then be driven from the canal right down to the North Wall without interference with transport. That might be relevant.  I agree that what is useless&mdash;and the greater part of it now constitutes an eyesore&mdash; should be utilised.  The fact that there is no transport on it at present does not put any extra transport on the roads as mentioned by other speakers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no connection between this Bill and C.I.E. rail transport.  There has been no transport on the canal for a considerable time. I do not think I can say anything more in regard to that.  The usefulness of the canal for pleasure boat navigation is demonstrated by the fact that in the past four years it has been used only 14 times and then only by locally owned row boats and canoes.  The future use of the canal for now boats and canoes would be subject to C.I.E. permission which, I imagine, would be given in a reasonable way.  Safety would be a major consideration.  I do not think C.I.E. would prohibit the use of the canal by row boats.</P>
      <P>In connection with the Inland Fisheries campaign for coarse fishing, the Minister for Lands may decide to make use of the portions of the canal that are likely to remain open indefinitely. Fishing is usually from the bank.  I am unable to say what the intentions of the Minister are in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should remind Senator Sheehy Skeffington that the discussion which took place in the Dáil in 1958 related to the Grand Canal.  There was no mention of the Royal Canal at the time of the debate.  No one raised the issue.  There is nothing wrong with either of these canals, except that nobody will use them.  It would <Col N="310" /> be quite impossible for me to deal in detail with what might be the future of the Grand Canal.</P>
    <P>I should tell the House that Bord Fáilte have been asked to make the same kind of research inquiry into the possible use of the Grand Canal in relation to tourism as they made in connection with coarse fishing and as they have recently made in relation to the use of the Shannon for pleasure boats hired to people who come down there.  It would be wrong for me to prophesy their final decision.  At the moment, they are not very optimistic in regard to the use of the canal by tourists from England because of the size of the boats, generally speaking, involved.  They will be asked to make a report.  They are the people who should take the initiative to assess the value of the Grand Canal. All this does not really relate to this Bill, which is solely to close to navigation a canal which is not an arterial link and which has not been used except by a few row boats for a number of years.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Siochfhradha asked who would be responsible for the upkeep of the canal.  The only obligation of which the Bill relieves C.I.E. is that of keeping it open to public navigation. If, at a later stage, C.I.E. decides to abandon the canal, in accordance with statutory provisions, the rights of all concerned will duly be protected. If flooding is to be prevented, either C.I.E. will have to pay some other authority for the prevention of flooding and the maintenance of the banks or they will have to continue to do that themselves.  Their decision on whether or not to abandon the canal will relate to the convenience of all concerned.</P>
    <P>Senator L'Estrange suggested that the Royal Canal might be used in connection with the regional water supply system which has been proposed by the Minister for Local Government and surveys for which are being carried out in various counties.  I have no idea of the technical possibilities in that connection.  I am quite certain that if the county engineers get in touch with C.I.E. they will be able to get the necessary information as to how far <Col N="311" /> the canal could prove useful in relation to a regional water supply.</P>
    <P>In reply to Senator Quinlan, it is not intended to limit the character of the bridge structures.  The locks will be closed and the canal will be closed to navigation.  I want nobody to be under any misapprehension about that.</P>
    <P>A suggestion has been made that this Act is undesirable in that it repeals a section of the 1958 Act in relation to canals and, in so doing, prevents the full operation of the Act in relation to canals from continuing until the period which is due to elapse for deciding whether or not the canals should remain open has expired.  The answer to that is quite clearly expressed in the Bill.  I should not like to undertake piecemeal legislation of that character, except that the use of the canal has been utterly trival.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was being discussed in 1958, I do not think sufficient attention was paid to the position of the Royal Canal.  If I remember rightly while the bridges were due for reconstruction no final reconstruction plans had been prepared.  If representations had been made by the Minister for Local Government in 1958 then included in the 1958 Act would have been a provision to enable the Royal Canal to be closed for navigation immediately.</P>

      <P>What is the purpose of incorporating in subsection (2) a provision that the Board of C.I.E. will not close a canal unless they publish a notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil?</i> What function does it serve to publish a notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and a newspaper circulating in the locality?  Is it suggested that publication of this notice in some way or another may bring to the attention of the public the fact that it is intended to do this <Col N="312" /> and that the public may be able to do something to arrest the closure of the canal?</P>

      <P>I must refer to similar legal requirements in the 1958 Act in relation to the Greystones-Westland Row railway line.

      <P>Let us be clear about this.  In relation to the West-land Row-Greystones railway line, C.I.E., upon a particular day, closed down certain stations.  Before closing down these stations, they had never issued the notice required.  When that matter was raised here, it was ruled out of order on the basis that no Minister was responsible.  Here we incorporate in this Bill a statutory requirement which, as far as I can see, is worthless because if it is not obeyed, there does not appear to be anybody who can compel C.I.E. to carry out the statutory obligation.  Does the Minister know any way by which that can be assured?</P>

I also feel that it is all very well for Senators to say that there is no obligation on C.I.E. to provide amenities for boats that are not there and so on, but this Bill is giving them the right to veto and to prevent anybody else from providing amenities.  There is no use expecting anybody else to provide amenities on a canal that can be closed without any further resourse to the Dáil by this company.  We are putting the power of vetoing any further development in the hands of C.I.E. One may concede that it is not their responsibility to develop amenities but I am not prepared to concede them the right to veto anybody else doing it.</P>

      <P>Subsection (2) of Section 1 states that &ldquo;the Board may close to navigation the canal or any part thereof&rdquo;, and I want to return to the answer the Minister gave to my question about the bridges which are to be built across the canal. His answer has shown that my concern is well founded.  The average width of the canal is perhaps not more than 30 to 35 feet and how can £8,000 be saved by putting a bridge across that, unless the bridge can actually be put across simply by filling in the canal section under that and using a culvert to carry the water through?  Is that possible or has any minimum clearance to be observed between the water surface and the bridge itself? If we eliminate the navigation requirements. I do not see that there is any compulsion on an engineer to allow any clearance.  In fact it would be a waste of public money for a local authority to design a bridge allowing a clearance that is not required by law. As I see it now, the engineer could simply say: &ldquo;Put in a culvert, and <Col N="314" /> put the bridge across.&rdquo; Is that correct &mdash;can that be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is quite possible. C.I.E. naturally have to protect the interests of all those who might be affected by flooding, reduction in the water supply or any other nuisance thereby created.  The Bill makes it quite clear in fact that local authorities will be able to build bridges which effectively prevent navigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>But that makes the matter still clearer because the culvert will prevent flooding but it will prevent even the smallest pleasure boat or canoe from going through, unless it is lifted around the bridge.  We have to be very careful in this transport legislation, for we see the tremendous power we handed over in the recent Transport Act and the way the powers are being used, even to the extent of no discussion being allowed here.  We want to be clear on what we are doing with regard to these bridges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the implication. Nobody has used the canal for a very long period.  One would imagine that the people had been prevented from using the canal.  They have not been prevented from using it, except in so far as it, can no longer act as an arterial link between Dublin and the Shannon and they have not <Col N="315" /> used it to any extent at all.  If there had been any signs of a tremendous growth of activity in any direction, all these matters would have been considered.</P>

      <P>Just because that has not taken place is no guarantee that it might not happen in the future.  Coarse fishing will be possible in parts of the canal which are blocked at intervals but it would rule out pleasure boating completely.  I am not saying it is possible, but I feel at this stage of our development that the Minister and the Government are in a position to say whether it is or is not part of their plans for the future.</P>

On other occasions, the Minister has indicated his desire to consult with State and semi-State bodies such as Bord Fáilte and I should like to know whether Bord Fáilte have been consulted about the effects of closing this canal in the way contemplated and whether they approve of or have any objection to the proposal.  Fashions come and go and the Royal Canal may not have been used for some years, but there is no reason to anticipate that it will not be used in ten years' time and at that time we would find a whole lot of the bridges there which Senator Quinlan feels may be built.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, I shall have to make a rather lengthy case in its favour.  Before I start that case, in the hope of putting the Minister into good humour, might I say that I agree the Minister's figure in Section 4 is correct, that is to say, the increase for the purpose of rural electrification is from £30 million to £32 million.  It is a simple matter and the figure is correct.  There are 800 areas and £40,000 an area is the established figure so it should be £32 million instead of £30 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="317" /> This is a very different matter. Certain proposals were made in 1953 for an increase from 629 megawatts installed generating capacity of the E.S.B. to 1,042 megawatts by 31st March, 1961.  They were to be installed in a few months' time but instead of that, all that has been installed since were 99 megawatts bringing the total installed generating capacity, as we stand in the year 1960, to 728 megawatts.  The Minister was good enough in his brief on Second Reading to indicate that, between now and 1964, a further 80 megawatts installed generating capacity will come into use bringing the total up to 808 megawatts.  Accordingly, the electricity requirements of this country at 31st March, 1964, will be fully covered by 800 megawatts&mdash;to put it in round figures&mdash;installed generating capacity as compared with the proposals seven years ago for 1,000 megawatts at 31st March, 1961.</P>
    <P>If the Government in office in 1956 had been unwise enough not to lop off a chunk of that programme, an extremely expensive operation would have been completed because an additional sum somewhere in the region of £25 million would be required for the extra 400 megawatts generating capacity.  The Minister makes the case now that for the coming years the additional capital expenditure for generation and transmission would need to be stepped up from £100 million to £120 million.</P>
    <P>I find various figures which make it difficult for me to follow how the Minister arrives at that figure.  First of all, the amount of generating capacity to come into operation between now and 1964 is only 80 megawatts and, secondly, in the year 1959-60, the expenditure of the E.S.B. on these capital requirements&mdash;leaving out rural electrification which I think is quite in order&mdash;was £4.6 million.  That was the amount spent in the year 1959-60 on new plant brought into commission, as the Board put it in the annual report.</P>
    <P>Let me continue dealing with the financial end for the moment.  A number of people have written on <Col N="318" /> this subject.  In 1959, Mr. P.G. Murphy, Chief Engineer of the E.S.B., wrote in a journal called <i>Administration</i> published by the Institute of Public Administration.  I would not mind reading the whole of page 32 to the Seanad but I shall just quote one sentence.  By the way, this booklet was produced in the autumn of 1957.  Mr. Murphy made various statements comparing us with other countries with a great deal more installed electricity power such as Sweden and Switzerland where there are exceptionally big drops in the rivers.  He said: &ldquo;In the future the exceptionally favourable load building conditions of the past are unlikely to be repeated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I shall just make the comment that the experience of the past few years has, to my mind, been seriously affected by the building of the huge transmission line to the St. Patrick's Coppermines in Avoca, and the large line to the Whitegate Refinery.  They caused a fairly substantial upswing in the demand for electricity in the past couple of years.</P>
    <P>I want to refer also to Mr. Whitaker's <i>Economic Development</i> which was really compiled by a number of public officials in the Department of Finance.  On pages 181 and 182, there are some extremely strong comments, to put it mildly, on this subject of the amount of money spent in the past on generating capacity which has not been used.  This booklet was published by the Stationery Office.  On page 181, we read:</P>
    <P>It will be seen that, despite the magnitude of the investment which has already been made, the capital requirements of the E.S.B. continue to be large.  The development programme, as outlined in a White Paper published in 1954, was based on an estimated annual average growth in demand for electric current of 13.4 per cent., i.e. on an expectation that demand would double itself every five and a half years.  This was related to experience in the pre-war and early postwar years.  The expectation of such a rapid growth was not realised and early in 1956 the generating programme <Col N="319" /> was revised downwards on the basis of an annual growth of 9 per cent., but this has again been too optimistic.  In 1955-56 growth was only 7.5 per cent. and in 1956-57 only 4.7 per cent.  It has risen to 7.7 per cent. in 1957-58 (equivalent to a doubling of demand about every nine and a half years) but this rise may have been exceptionally stimulated by the severe weather conditions in the March quarter of 1958. As heavy demand cannot be expected from the bulk of the new consumers remaining to be connected (i.e. persons in the poorer rural areas) and as there is severe competition both in town and country from oil and gases, there is no good reason to suppose that there will be a greatly increased rate of growth in the near future unless a rapid expansion of the economy occurs.</P>
    <P>In recent years the provision of generating capacity has run ahead of the country's requirements, and the E.S.B. has surplus capacity, over and above a reasonable reserve for contingencies&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Now, this book was published in November, 1958, just two years ago. If I may continue:</P>
    <P>The E.S.B. has surplus capacity, over and above a reasonable reserve for contingencies, which would enable it to supply current of 400-500 million units a year in excess of the present demand of about 1,775 million units.</P>
    <P>Excess capacity at that time would enable it to supply an addition of well above a quarter to the demand.</P>
    <P>This alone would suffice for almost four years of growth of demand at last year's rate.  The period of excess capacity will be prolonged by the completion of new generating stations now under construction.</P>
    <P>I take it they are the extra 80 megawatts which the Minister mentioned will come into operation soon.</P>
    <P>The heavy excess investment in plant adds to fixed charges and <Col N="320" /> represents a deadweight burden on the E.S.B.</P>
    <P>Of course it has been shown in its accounts that there is now a deficit of, I think, about three-quarters of a million pounds where it always had credits up to comparatively recently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I continue:</P>
      <P>Heavy investment by the E.S.B. without a commensurate rise in revenue has meant a steep rise in the proportion of capital charges (interest, sinking fund and depreciation) to revenue.  In 1951-52 capital charges represented 30 per cent. of revenue and likewise 30 per cent. of working expenses; they now represent about 50 per cent. in each case or over £6 million a year, and will continue to rise.</P>
      <P>The report goes on to make constructive suggestions, mentioning, for example, that the new oil refinery at Cork would require a substantial amount of electricity annually, thus bearing out my own understanding of the matter.  What do I find in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of December 8th, just last week?</P>

      <P>A record demand was made yesterday on the Electricity Supply Board by its 620,000 consumers. Weather conditions necessitated, for the first time, the generation of a peak load of 513,000 kilowatts.  Last year's peak was 476,000 kilowatts.</P>
      <P>A kilowatt and a megawatt are the same, I should say at this stage.  They had to generate that peak load of 513,000 kilowatts on Wednesday of last week.  The E.S.B. have at the moment, as far as I know, an installed generating capacity of 728 megawatts so that in fact if we just take the question asked so many times of the Minister and do a simple sum in division, we get the answer.</P>

      <P>If you divide 700 into 500, you get about 70 per cent.  It is 728 into 513 or 513 over 728&mdash;whatever fraction that is.  That is so far as generating capacity is concerned.  I am on that at the moment and I shall talk about the financial end later on.  That figure of 476,000 kilowatts means working at about 65 per cent.  I know that the Minister says you could get in an exceptional year both a wet summer when you would have no turf and a dry winter when you would have no water, but in a wet summer, you would have plenty of water for generating so you would have something which you would have not in a dry summer&mdash;if those two things came together.  And it would be an extraordinary coincidence if it happened here, because I think it extremely unlikely that you would have a long, wet summer and then by some miracle of Providence, a long, dry winter, a very unlikely thing to happen in this country indeed, with our average of 40 inches of rainfall spread over the whole year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other method.  There are various ways of getting at this matter of whether the proposals in the Bill are reasonable or not.  I can revert to the balance sheet of the E.S.B., the total assets of the E.S.B. in their balance sheet of March 31st, 1960, the last one.  These include, do not forget, items other than electricity generating plant and transmission lines.  They include things like sundry credits, reserve for contingencies and so on.  The capital total in the balance sheet is £117,577,000&mdash; let us call it £118,000,000.  What is the total part of our one hundred million pounds which the E.S.B. have already power to spend to make <Col N="322" /> capital investment?  There is £100,000,000, plus £30,000,000 for rural electrification, so that on 31st March the position was in fact that £118,000,000 had been spent out of a total of £130,000,000.</P>
    <P>But remember, if practically all the authorised capital for rural electrification was spent there was a huge chunk of capital available for further expenditure on generating capacity.  I cannot, of course, give an accurate figure, but unless there has been astounding expenditure&mdash;and I doubt if there has &mdash;in recent months, I cannot understand why the figure the Board will require say in the next reasonable period of years should be anything like the sum of an additional £20,000,000. What I would put to the Minister is that I think the Board have enough money to cover capital expenditure for two years and in giving the Minister £10,000,000, I was giving him two more years on top; I was providing the Minister with all the money that should be required up to the end of 1964.  It is just possible that that might do the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is another way of getting it if he is worried&mdash;several ways.  The capital invested by the E.S.B. on generation plant and transmission lines was at 31st March, 1960, £108,000,000, according to the last annual report of the Board of Directors. But £26,000,000 of this related to rural electrification, so that the amount for generation transmission and so on, which is the money required in this section which I want to amend, at 31st of March, 1960, was £82,000,000; so that at 31st of March, on that basis, there was £18,000,000 left.  I do not mind being frank.  I do not understand how it came about or what the considerations involved were, but I should be glad of the Minister's explanation of his statement in his brief to us the week before last that the existing authority will be used up by 31st of March, 1961; that is to say, if my reading of this is correct, and I think it is, the Electricity Supply Board will have spent in the financial year 1960-61 on generation and on transmission lines, other than rural electrification, a sum of £18,000,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="323" /> Again in fairness to the Minister, I think he changed his emphasis on the last occasion in the House.  In his main brief in the Seanad debate on 30th November, 1960, he said at column 180:</P>
    <P>It is, on occasion, suggested that the Board has an excess of generating capacity.  I could deal with this suggestion at some length but it should be sufficient to refer to the annual reports of the Board for the last two years which indicate that, in 1958-59, due to shortage of both turf and water and in 1959-60 due to shortage of water alone, it was necessary to draw on the Pigeon House Station which is the stand-by station of last resort.</P>
    <P>That leaves one with the impression that the Pigeon House is an old station, but it has been modernised and is a normal station now.  Why it should be called &ldquo;the stand-by station of last resort,&rdquo; I do not know, except to create an impression that the generators were scraping the bottom of the barrel to the very limit of their capacity.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave a different impression in his reply at column 219, and I think his statement then was a good deal more correct.  He said:</P>
    <P>I have been supplied with figures by the Board whose chairman has my confidence, which showed that every single station at one time or another of the year is working at 100 per cent. capacity.</P>
    <P>Certainly you can plug them in in turn.  There is the point, of course, that the stations must be repaired occasionally, but anybody who did elementary physics&mdash;it is a long time since I did it myself&mdash;knows that there are no engines in this world that last so long as electrical turbines and generators. There are no engines to compare with electric motors.  Their life is colossal compared with that of other machinery.  And, of course, if you want to repair one and put in new turbines, say, at the Shannon where there are old turbines, you can do them one at a time, for they are in series.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that the Minister <Col N="324" /> has no case, but I think he has altogether exaggerated his case.  I want to assure the Minister, and I hope he will appreciate it, that this is a deadly serious amendment.  I believe it will provide for the requirements for the next four years, that is, up to 31st March, 1965, and I think that is a reasonable measure to give to a body like the Electricity Supply Board.  Once the Oireachtas passes this Bill, all control over expenditure by a body like the Electricity Supply Board is gone.  It goes into the hands of the managers. I do not want any inference to be drawn that I am condemning the way the Board has done its business.  There is nothing like that involved, but there is a principle involved in this, that Parliament does not make available large sums of money for the repayment of which the people will be responsible, without being fully informed and without being convinced that the moneys are really necessary.  That is the essence of my amendment.</P>
    <P>I could make a number of other points about it, but I believe that I am giving the Minister enough money to last for four years, and I say that this is all the figures add up to.  The fact is that there is an increase at present of about 10 per cent. a year in the demand for electricity.  My figures may not quite agree with other figures, but I went to the trouble of calculating the way the demand has gone over the past decade. The extraordinary thing is that by far the biggest single increase was from 1st April, 1950, to 31st March, 1951, when there was a 22 per cent. increase.  From 1951 to 1952, it was 11 per cent.; from 1952 to 1953, 11 per cent.; from 1953 to 1954, it was 13 per cent.; from 1954 to 1955, it was 14 per cent.; from 1955 to 1956, ten per cent.; from 1956 to 1957, it was four per cent.; from 1957 to 1958, it was five per cent.; and from 1958 to 1959, it was eight per cent.  It has been nine per cent. on my calculation up to 31st March, 1960.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister used the wrong figure of ten per cent., but I am prepared to accept that&mdash;I am not quibbling about it.  It is extraordinary that if the Board was scraping the bottom of the barrel last year, it can stand an expansion of demand of 10 per cent. a <Col N="325" /> year over the next three and a half years on the basis that there will be only 80 additional megawatts coming into operation&mdash;that a 10 per cent. increases in generating capacity will provide for a ten per cent. compound increases in demand.  The case put before the Oireachtas does not hold water, and therefore, in the hope that the Minister will be satisfied with getting a reasonable part of what he has asked for, I have put down this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that I am unable to accept the amendment.  First of all, let me deal with one or two minor points the Senator made.  He suggested that the Whitegate and Avoca installations were an important factor in recent consumption increases.  It is true that these provided together 40 per cent. of the total increase in the year in which they came into operation, but since then, the rate of increase has gone up further and is now running at the figure of about 10 per cent., instead of seven per cent when this programme was originally devised.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I should make it clear that the Pigeon House is an obsolete station. Two of the turbines are over 31 years old.  One of them is now being repaired. Two are over 24 years old, and the remaining two are over 20 years old.  The peak rate is little over half the nominal rate.  It is purely a stand-by station.</P>
      <P>The Senator also suggested that the deficit in the accounts of the Board resulted in some way from excess capacity.  I could not accept that.  The major part of the deficit is due to the fact that the subsidy for rural electrification was cancelled by the Coalition Government between 1955 and 1958.  This involves the payment by the E.S.B. of an annual sum in interest and sinking fund of £529,000.  If that subsidy had continued during that period, it might have been possible, for at least a short while, to avoid the recent increase of rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The deficits that arise are also due to the very heavy costs in rural electrification, in spite even of the subsidy given by the Government.  This is largely due to the isolated character of our rural community&mdash;we are the <Col N="326" /> most unvillaged community in the whole of Europe&mdash;and also due to the fact that so far the power has not been used to the same extent as we hope it will be used in the future for what might be described as agricultural industrial purposes.  If consumption goes up, the position may be more satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The Senator referred to the question of peak load.  The peak load referred to by him on December 8th is not really the critical load, so far as the E.S.B. are concerned.  If there happened to be an excessive capacity in relation to that peak consumption, that does not argue that we should not have the whole of this capital sum put into the Bill.  The critical time is when there is insufficient hydro-derived power.  I have some figures which might interest the House in that connection.</P>
    <P>In the autumn of 1959, the 219 megawatts of hydro-capacity could only deliver 40 megawatts hence 179 megawatts of hydro-generating capacity were insufficient.  Steam power to cover this gap must be available or loads will be shed.  The E.S.B. have to have a considerable amount of excess capacity to deal with all possible situations that may arise, such as the unusual situation at the end of 1958 or in the spring of 1959&mdash;I forget which&mdash;when the hydro-capacity was low and there had been a bad turf season or when, for example, all the stations might be operating to provide power and there might be a serious breakdown in one of them.  They have to provide for all situations, including a sudden and unpredicted increase in consumption in a given year.</P>
    <P>One could argue this question of excess capacity all night.  It depends how you interpret figures.  I am convinced that the Board of the E.S.B. have given me a reasonable statement in regard to their future needs.  The matter has been re-examined on a number of occasions but I could, if I chose, answer some of Senator O'Donovan's arguments because this is quite an interesting subject.  For example, I could quote to him one of the methods of survey in regard to <Col N="327" /> measuring utilisation of equipment in this country and in Great Britain.  The measure used is the annual load factor.</P>
    <P>The annual load factor represents the total units generated in the year as a percentage of the peak load, assuming the peak load to be maintained throughout the year.  The annual load factor for the E.S.B. in each of the last three years was 49.1 per cent, 46.8 per cent. and 50.1 per cent. respectively.  In Great Britain, they use a slightly different system in which they relate the percentage of units sent out rather than the units generated.  They make that a percentage of the total capacity.</P>
    <P>If we apply the English system in this country, we make what may not be an entirely satisfactory comparison. If, however, we make this comparison, using the British method, for the year ended 31st March, 1958, the system load factor, as this method is called, was 48 per cent. here and in England and Wales, it was 48 per cent.  For the year ended 31st March, 1959, the figure for the E.S.B. was 45 per cent. and in England and Wales, it was 47 per cent.  For the year ended 31st March, 1960, the figure here was 48 per cent. and 47 per cent. in England and Wales.  One may remark, in making these comparisons, that, in Great Britain, there is an enormous amount of shift work industry consuming vast quantities of electricity.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties is that there are very high peaks in the winter months at the end of the day when all the lights are on and people are cooking.  No assistance is provided by having to supply a 24 hour shift industrial demand of a very heavy order.  I could keep the House a very considerable time arguing on this subject from the technical standpoint, but, perhaps, it would be sufficient to state, because some members of the House might doubt the figure we have put into the Bill, that the Board must obtain the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Transport and Power before borrowing money for generation, so that during the period in which these plans are formulated, the E.S.B. have to come <Col N="328" /> to us and discuss with us how the programme is going on, how far the plans that have been made prove to be right.</P>
    <P>They have to discuss the advance programme to see whether it requires amendment and this figure which is put in here is an over-all figure which enables the E.S.B. to plan in advance and unless they know they can raise the capital on a general basis, they cannot plan in advance adequately.  It takes about five years to plan a power station from the time the design begins to go on the drawing board until the station is erected. Within that period, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Transport and Power can exercise control which should relieve the minds of Senators who think the E.S.B. are going to involve the nation in grossly extravagant expenditure for generating capacity, which will not, in fact, be necessary.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, the increase in consumption is greater than was envisaged when this sum of money was put in the Bill as being reasonable under the circumstances.  I hope, if the economy continues to expand and if industries continue to grow in extent and number, that the E.S.B. may have to revise their plans in the upward direction, but I can assure the House that there is no movement within the E.S.B. which, for some strange reason, wishes to impose a huge amount of excess capacity upon the country or to involve the nation in unnecessary capital liability.  We have gone into this in great detail. The Board, supported by their engineering staff, have made the proposal to us.  There is not any minority interest in the Board among the higher staff who are opposed to this development.  There is no sort of unseen plot; I do not know what the plot would be for or its purpose in connection with this matter.  For these reasons, I must reject the amendment.</P>

    <Title>Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Bill, 1959&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="329" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to oblige health authorities to fluoridate public piped water supplies to a level not exceeding one part of fluorine per one million parts of water in order to reduce the prevalence of dental decay &mdash;or dental caries&mdash;among us.   The need to take prophylactic measures against this condition has been pressed year after year by dental surgeons and school medical officers who have drawn attention to the ravages of the disease among school children.  And the Dental Caries Survey carried out under the auspices of the Medical Research Council of Ireland in 1952 indicated that the vast majority of children throughout the country suffer from this condition.</P>
      <P>A copy of the report of the survey is in the Library.  The survey was carried out at the request of my colleague, the Minister for Finance who was then Minister for Health, in order &ldquo;to ascertain whether there were significant differences in dental condition amongst school children living in different areas of the country and whether such differences, if they existed, could be related to differences in the dietary intake of the children.&rdquo;  For the purpose of their work, the surveyors divided the children into three age groups: five to six, seven to eight and 12 to 13 years old.  In all, the teeth of over 2,000 children were examined in Dublin city and in a number of towns and rural areas which were taken as being more or less typical of each of the four provinces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the depressing facts which it disclosed of the prevalence of dental caries among our children, the Survey furnished information on two questions of great social importance. It showed, first of all, that it was not possible to associate the incidence of dental decay with the intake of certain foods in the different areas as ascertained by the National Nutrition Survey of 1946; and it also showed that its incidence among children did <Col N="330" /> not significantly differ between the different areas covered.</P>
    <P>As to its main purpose the Survey revealed that in the group of children between five and six years old only 4.3 per cent. were entirely free from dental decay, while 68.2 per cent. had five or more deciduous, or first teeth, either decayed, missing or filled.  The number of decayed or missing deciduous teeth even at this tender age, represented 36 per cent. of the total number of teeth developed so far.  In fact, an average child at this stage of life had only about two-thirds of his or her deciduous teeth unaffected by caries. Even the state of their permanent teeth was not good; for almost 18 per cent. of them were already decayed.</P>
    <P>As regards children in the next age group&mdash;seven to eight years&mdash;it was found that only 1.4 per cent. were entirely free from dental decay in their deciduous and permanent teeth; and 41 per cent. of the deciduous teeth were decayed and 6 per cent missing.  Of the permanent teeth which had erupted at that age, about 25 per cent. were already decayed or missing.</P>
    <P>Only 0.9 per cent. of children in the age group 12 to 13 years had teeth entirely free from dental decay, and only 1.2 per cent were entirely free from dental decay in their permanent teeth.  Of the deciduous teeth which might still have been extant at this age, less than 55 per cent. were sound and the remainder were decayed or missing.  As regards their permanent teeth, over 25 per cent. had already been affected by dental decay or were missing and this as early as 12 or 13 years old.  Now, I would like to stress the findings among this group, the oldest of the children examined, as they show the position among those who are approaching the end of their primary school career.  Only 0.9 per cent., I repeat, were entirely free from dental decay; only 1.2 per cent. were free from dental decay in their permanent teeth; and 25 per cent. of all the permanent teeth examined were either decayed or missing.</P>
    <P>I think the Seanad will agree that the survey exposed a situation which was deplorable indeed.  Unfortunately, however, there is no reason for thinking that the position today is any better; it <Col N="331" /> is quite likely to be worse, and as for adolescents and young adults, it is to be expected that among them the position is worse than among school children.</P>
    <P>Though the incidence of dental decay in this country is very high, very high indeed, the available statistics show that the condition is a universally serious problem in all advanced western nations.  For example, a recent dental survey from Scotland reveals that despite the free dental services available to all children under the national health service there, the condition of children's teeth has worsened in recent years.  A typical Scottish child of five years old is said to have about seven of his 20 teeth either decayed, filled or already extracted.</P>
    <P>In New Zealand, 99 per cent of recruits aged 17 to 23 years performing their compulsory military training a few years ago had experienced dental decay and, on average, each recruit had 22 decayed, missing or filled teeth.</P>
    <P>On this point, the report of the Expert Committee on Water Fluoridation of the World Health Organisation has this to say:</P>
    <P>Dental caries is one of the most prevalent and widespread diseases in the world.  It is not restricted to any specific age, sex, or economic status, nor is it peculiar to any country or race.  In countries where dental surveys have been carried out, it has been found that almost the entire population is affected by dental caries and its consequences.  It has been found, too, that dental caries starts soon after the eruption of the deciduous teeth.  Numerous studies have been made on the prevalence of caries among children in many countries, and it has been shown repeatedly that the average child reaching school age has many carious teeth. The consequences of the disease can be particularly serious both in childhood and adolescence.  The carious lesions increase progressively in size, frequently leading to considerable suffering and eventual loss of teeth.  The consequent reduction of function may affect <Col N="332" /> nutrition in the growing child.  Impaired mastication is the direct cause of digestive disorders, and secondary infection from a septic mouth may have far-reaching effects on general health.  Not least among the unfortunate consequences of the loss of teeth caused by dental caries are traumatic occlusion, which can induce severe parodontal disease, and the serious psychological and social effect of facial disfigurement. Throughout the world, dental decay represents an economic drain upon both health services and individuals. It would be extremely difficult to assess the amount of efforts spent over many years in various countries to attempt to relieve this disease.</P>
    <P>And these views have been echoed recently nearer home.  Addressing the annual dinner of the Irish Dental Association last week, the outgoing President, Mr. D. Gogarty, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The number of man hours actually lost to industry in this country through dental reasons is extraordinarily high.  Proportionally, it is higher than in England although we cannot afford it to the same extent.  But what is even more difficult to assess is the vast number of potential man hours lost through inefficient application of skills, which inefficiency is in turn due to a state of poor dental health.</P>
    <P>There is absolutely no doubt that a man bedevilled with aches and pains in his teeth cannot work efficiently. There is no doubt that a man whose abscessed roots are oozing purulent matter constantly into his alimentary system cannot operate at peak efficiency.  And there is further no doubt that these circumstances apply more in Ireland than in many other countries.</P>
    <P>Some critics of the proposal in this Bill have argued that the problem should be tackled by expanding the facilities for treating the disease.  I do not dispute that an expansion of treatment facilities is desirable, but it must be recognised that there are definite limitations in regard to the availability of dental personnel which, of <Col N="333" /> course, seriously circumscribe our potentialities in the field of treatment. The Expert Committee of the World Health Organisation, which I have mentioned, had this to say on that point:&mdash;&ldquo;Early detection and treatment of dental caries is effective in controlling the disease and its results&rdquo;; but then they go on to add &ldquo;Even in those countries with the highest ratio of dentists to population, however, no more than one-third of the needs of the people in this respect are being met.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The number of dentists in this country (about 620) is, proportionate to population, about one-third of the number in countries like Sweden and U.S.A.  We would, therefore, it seems, have to increase the number of dentists here nine-fold to be able to tackle the problem adequately on a treatment basis.  With the financial and educational resources at our disposal now and for a long time to come, this is obviously out of the question.  All this apart, I believe, and as I am sure the Seanad will share the view, that prevention is better than treatment, particularly when treatment will not reverse the process of decay.  And as to prevention, even its critics concede that fluoridation is a most effective means of preventing caries.  They could not in honesty do otherwise, since several independent and reliable surveys extending over periods of years, have shown this quite conclusively.</P>
    <P>No responsible person now contests the fact that water containing about one part of fluorine per million parts of water, if ingested from infancy and throughout childhood, inhibits dental decay among children by up to 65 per cent.  Thus the prevalence of dental caries among children reared in a community served by public water supplies containing fluoride at the level I have indicated may be as much as 65 per cent. less than in communities served with water supplies containing no fluoride or, as is the case generally in this country, only insignificant traces of the mineral.</P>
    <P>Controlled fluoridation studies have also shown that no ill effect of any kind is caused by water fluoridated <Col N="334" /> as proposed in this Bill.  An example of such a study is that which was made at Newburgh, New York, in which the adjacent town of Kingston was used as a control.  The water in Kingston was not fluoridated; but the water in Newburgh was.  Comprehensive medical examinations were made of the children in both towns.  These clinical examinations included medical history, a general physical examination, measurements of weight, height, and circumference of the head and chest; vision; examination of the ear, nose and throat; measurement of hearing; and an assessment of physical development at successive examinations. X-ray examinations were carried out of the right wrist, both knees, and the bone density.  In the final examination the lumbar spine was X-rayed.  Originally 500 children in each city were selected and these were added to in later years.  The total number of children examined in Newburgh was 817 and in Kingston 711. The medical examinations mentioned were carried out each year on each of the selected children.  As a result of this very thorough study&mdash;and I think it will be admitted that it was a very thorough study&mdash;it was stated that &ldquo;no difference of medical significance could be found between the two groups of children&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A report was published about a year or so ago on the results of fourteen years' experience of artificial fluoridation at Brantford, Ontario.  It showed, in detail, the beneficial effects of fluoridated water on children's teeth in the age groups nine to eleven and twelve to fourteen years.  They were quite remarkable.  Having reviewed them the report went on to say: &ldquo;No untoward effects which might be attributable to the presence of fluoride in the water supply have ever been reported by the medical profession in either Brantford or Stratford&rdquo;.  Stratford, Ontario, is remarkable for the fact that it is a town with a naturally fluoridated water supply of 1.6 parts per million of fluorine.  We can see from the results of this study that no ill effects of any kind, which might be attributable to fluoridated water, have ever been reported either in Brantford, during fourteen years of <Col N="335" /> artificial fluoridation, or in Stratford, Ontario, where nature has endowed the water with 1.6 parts per million of fluorine.</P>
    <P>In fact the truly significant fact that emerges from the welter of controversy is that the harmlessness of fluoridated water on the general health of people has been endorsed by the very many most reputable and authoritative bodies who have studied this subject in recent years.  These include our own Fluorine Consultative Council; the Expert Committee of the World Health Organisation to whose report I have already referred; the British Medical Research Council; the New Zealand Commission on Water Fluoridation; the Royal Swedish Medical Board, and various other organisations such as the American Medical Association, the Canadian Medical and Dental Associations, and the Public Health Committee of the British Medical Association.</P>
    <P>The opponents of fluoridation seek to convey the impression that medical opinion is seriously divided on the question of whether fluoridation involves a danger to health.  It may be that some few medical men oppose it, but, against these, the remarkable thing is that so many authoritative medical organisations have unequivocably endorsed the safety and efficacy of fluoridation as a measure for the prevention of dental decay.</P>
    <P>My predecessor in office, Deputy T. F. O'Higgins, appointed the Fluorine Consultative Council to which I have referred in January 1957, to consider &ldquo;whether with a view to reducing the incidence of dental caries, it is desirable to provide for an increased intake of fluorine, and, if the Council considers it so desirable, to advise as to the best method of securing such an increased intake and as to any safeguards and precautions necessary.&rdquo; This Council comprised 17 persons, specially selected for their ability to assess the different aspects of this matter.  In May, 1958, the Council furnished its report to me.  In it the Council unanimously recommended&mdash;and I stress the word `unanimously'&mdash;the fluoridation of public water supplies to the level of one part per million of fluorine in the following terms:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="336" /> 38.  Having considered all the information available to it on the relationship between fluorine and dental decay the Council is satisfied that an increased intake of fluorine will reduce the incidence of dental caries and that it is desirable to provide for such an increased intake. The Council is further satisfied that the increased intake of fluorine can best be provided by the fluoridation of public water supplies to the level of 1.0 part per million F.  In so recommending the Council is aware that not quite 50 per cent. of the community would thereby benefit at present even if all public piped water supplies in the country were fluoridated but the percentage will increase according as public piped water supplies are extended.</P>
    <P>39.  Before any public water supply is fluoridated the Council considers that steps should be taken to assess the incidence of dental caries in children resident in the area served by that water supply.  The Council also considers that subsequent to fluoridation adequate steps should be taken to permit a proper evaluation of the results.</P>
    <P>40.  In so far as the engineering aspects of fluoridation of public water supplies are concerned, the Council sees no particular difficulty in the procedure as the methods employed in the addition of fluoride to a water supply are similar to those in common use for the addition of other chemicals to water.  The methods used in the protection of public waterworks workers handling fluoride salts are similar to those used in the handling of other chemicals which may have harmful effects and do not need special description here.</P>
    <P>41.  The Council is in doubt as to whether local authorities have the necessary statutory authority to add fluoride to public water supplies.  It recommends the introduction of any legislation which may be necessary to enable local authorities to discharge this function.</P>
    <P>This Bill is being brought in to give effect to the recommendation contained <Col N="337" /> in paragraph 41 of the Council's report which I have just read.  Its purpose is to clear up the doubt which was thought to exist as to whether public local authorities have the necessary statutory authority to add fluoride to public water supplies.</P>
    <P>The Council devoted a considerable part of its report to examining the possible ill effects of fluoridated water, under the headings of acute poisoning, growth retardation, changes in bones, effect on kidneys, etc., and came to the conclusion that no ill effects on health were to be feared from the drinking of water containing one part per million of fluorine.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 27 of its report, the Council say &ldquo;Fluorides in water at a level of 1.0 p.p.m. have no effect upon the taste, odour, colour or acceptability of water for domestic use.  No adverse effects on industrial, agricultural, horticultural or other similar processes due to the use of fluoridated water have been substantiated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Some few years ago the World Health Organisation set up an expert committee to consider this question of water fluoridation and, having examined water fluoridation from the safety aspect under various headings, said: &ldquo;All these findings fit together in a consonant whole that constitutes a great guarantee of safety&mdash;a body of evidence without precedence in public health procedures.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The British Medical Research Council called together a conference of experts in 1956 as a result of which the following statement was issued:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The experts agreed in general with the conclusions of the United Kingdom Mission (which examined fluoridation in North America in 1953) to the effect that, despite considerable interest and research there is no definite evidence that the continued consumption of fluorides in water at a level of about one part per million in drinking water is in any way harmful to health, and they consider that if any untoward effect is revealed by future research this is most unlikely to be serious.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Royal Swedish Medical Board, <Col N="338" /> in recommending water fluoridation in 1958, commented: &ldquo;In the opinion of the Board the enquiry carried out has shown that fluoridation of public water supplies does not involve any demonstrable health hazards even on prolonged consumption of the water.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The New Zealand Commission of Enquiry said: &ldquo;No harmful effects on health will follow the fluoridation of water supplies whether in respect of the complaints specifically made before us or otherwise.&rdquo;  They further said: &ldquo;In the proposal to fluoridate water there is no risk of chronic fluoride poisoning.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind these definite and categorical statements, what must be accepted is that the alleged ill effects of fluoridation have been considered by the various bodies which studied this subject and these bodies have endorsed the safety of the practice. Apart from the studies already mentioned by me, the studies included the health of adults in areas with naturally fluoridated water supplies at levels even much greater than one part per million.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the best known such study was that of the health of groups of adults, selected at random, living in the small towns of Bartlett and Cameron, in Texas, U.S.A.  In 1943, over 100 persons who had been living for at least 15 years in Bartlett, where the natural concentration of fluorine in the water supply was no less than 8 parts per million, and a similar number of adults who had been living for the same period in Cameron, where the water contained 0.4 parts per million, were submitted to medical, dental, X-ray and laboratory examinations.  The clinical investigations included a search for evidence of arthritis, raised blood pressure, stones in the urinary and bile tracts, goitre, abnormalities of the heart and blood vessels, etc.  Laboratory studies included examinations of the blood and urine.  These medical examinations were repeated ten years later in 1953 on the same individuals and, apart from mottled teeth among the Bartlett residents, the result of these examinations was that no clinically significant physiological or functional <Col N="339" /> effects resulting from prolonged ingestion of water containing excessive fluoride were found.</P>
    <P>Another way of checking on the harmlessness of fluoridated water was to compare various mortality statistics for 32 American cities which used naturally fluoridated water containing more than 0.7 parts per million fluorine with 32 other neighbouring cities using water with 0.25 or less parts per million of fluorine.  These comparisons revealed no significant differences. Furthermore, in Britain, where fluoride is found naturally present in some water supplies, up to a level of four or more parts per million, the British Ministery of Health stated in 1956 that a comparison of vital statistics, including several different causes of death, in high-fluoride and low-fluoride areas revealed no differences &ldquo;which could be interpreted as indicating any harmful effect on health, nor even a slight pointer to the need for any further studies to demonstrate this.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We in this country are fortunate in that we have come to consider fluoridation at a time when the process has already been the subject of extensive and exhaustive study and practical application over many years.  At present over 37 million people in the United States of America drink mechanically fluoridated water, while another 7 million people there live in areas where the water supplies naturally contain 0.7 or more parts per million of fluoride. Over 1 million people in different provinces of Canada are also supplied with mechanically fluoridated water. Three towns in Britain&mdash;Anglesey in North Wales, Kilmarnock in Scotland, and Watford in England&mdash;have been fluoridated since 1955 or 1956 and certain towns in the following countries have had their water supplies fluoridated in recent years: Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, E1 Salvador, West Germany, Japan, Malay, Netherlands, New Zealand, Panama Canal Zone, Sweden, Switzerland and Venezuela.</P>
    <P>In considering this question, it is essential to remember that fluorine is a natural mineral element and is found, <Col N="340" /> in chemical combination as fluoride, naturally present as a trace element in the majority of foods&mdash;in vegetables, meat, cereals, fruit, fish and tea.  So widespread are fluorides that it is prac tically impossible to select a diet which does not contain some trace of them They occur naturally, to a greater or lesser extent, in many water supplies, though in this country, so far as our evidence goes, only in infinitesimal proportions. Indeed an analysis of the fluoride content of forty-two drinking waters in different parts of Ireland, carried out in 1948 by Dr. J. A. Drumm, showed that only ten of them contained fluorides of between 0.1 and 0.3 parts per million.  The remainder, including the Dublin water supplies, contained less than 0.1 parts per million. The addition of fluoride to water supplies is, therefore, not the addition of a substance that is completely foreign to water but a supplementing of the amount of fluoride which we already obtain in our daily diet, either in food or water.  It is important to bear this point in mind when considering some of the objections raised against fluoridation.</P>
    <P>One of the main grounds on which objection is taken to the fluoridation of public water supplies is that it is unethical and, for that reason, objectionable in principle.</P>
    <P>Here is what the Fluorine Consultative Council in paragraph 37 of its report had to say on that point:</P>
    <P>The Council received representations to the effect that fluoridation of public water was unethical.  The main grounds for objection were that it was mass medication, an usurpation of parental rights by the public authorities and an interference by the public authority with the integrity of the human body. These objections were carefully considered and advice was sought and received.  The Council is satisfied that there is no ethical objection to the fluoridation of public water supplies within the margin of safety recommended in this report.</P>
    <P>That is a concise and very clear statement.  You will note that the Council say they sought and received <Col N="341" /> advice on the alleged ethical objections and were satisfied that there is no ethical objection to the fluoridation of water supplies within the margin of safety recommended, that is, at a level of 1 part per million.</P>
    <P>Two members of the Council signed the Report subject to the deletion of that paragraph but this, I understand, was not because they believed there were ethical objections but because they felt that the Terms of Reference given to the Council did not permit it to concern itself with this aspect of the problem.</P>
    <P>Fluoridation is said to be objectionable because it is &ldquo;mass medication&rdquo;. This is the usual slogan used by anti-fluoridationists wherever this proposal arises.  But is fluoridation mass medication in the proper sense of the term?  As already made clear, fluoride is ingested in minute quantities as part of our normal daily diet.  Fluoride is not a drug or medicine, but a nutrient.  It benefits the bones and teeth and is, in fact, a normal constituent of bones and teeth. The addition of fluoride to water supplies will supplement, only supplement, our normal intake of this element. This, I submit is not medication; the fluoride in fact does not cure any ailment or a defect.  It is simply a means of making people's teeth stronger and more resistant to the agents of decay.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that whereas it may be desirable to provide for the fluoridation of public water supplies the actual implementation of the process should be left to each local authority to decide.  There are very strong and cogent reasons why this matter should be decided by the Oireachtas and not left for determination by each local authority.  Firstly, as was demonstrated by the Dental Caries Survey of 1952, there is no significant difference in the incidence of caries between different parts of the country and the need to bring the fluorine content of public water supplies up to the optimum level of 1 part per million exists in all areas. Secondly, if we were to leave this matter for decision by local authorities, it would mean that the very large body of local representatives concerned <Col N="342" /> would have to make the attempt to familiarise themselves with the complex, technical, details of the issues involved.  If they failed to spend the time and effort in studying this matter they would inevitably be deterred from taking the action which the situation so urgently demands by the misleading propaganda of opponents of fluoridation.</P>
    <P>There are over 80 sanitary authorities&mdash;that is, water supply authorities &mdash;in this country, including the four county boroughs, the county councils, seven boroughs and 49 urban district councils.  Only a little over 1½ million people are supplied with public piped water supplies and of these about half are served by the Dublin Corporation. Moreover several of these sanitary authorities avail of a common water supply.  Thus in the Dublin area the Dublin Corporation water supply covers not only the city area but much of Dublin County and parts of Counties Wicklow and Kildare.  It will be readily seen, therefore, that if it were to be left to each sanitary authority, or even to each county council or city corporation, to accept or reject fluoridation, serious difficulties might arise in practice.</P>
    <P>This is a small country, with a homogeneous population, and members of the Oireachtas are in close and constant touch with local affairs.  Many indeed are members of local authorities. I submit it would be an absurd waste of time to have repeated, perhaps at every local level, the prolonged debate which has already taken place in the Dáil on this measure.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, I feel it is reasonable and logical for the question of the fluoridation of piped water supplies to be decided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Even when the Bill is enacted the Oireachtas will have an opportunity, if a member should so desire, of discussing in detail the application of the measure.  It will be noted that the Bill provides that before regulations are made under it surveys of the incidence of dental caries in the areas to be fluoridated shall be carried out and that the fluorine content of the public water supplies in those areas shall be <Col N="343" /> determined.  Reports of both these investigations must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, as must also the regulations when made.  Members of either House will then be in possession of all the facts to enable them to debate usefully any provision of the regulations which in their opinion calls for discussion.</P>
    <P>Finally, I come to the question of cost.  In paragraph 31 of their report, the fluorine Consultative Council said that the cost would vary with the size of the community and pointed out that in the fluoridation areas in Britain the cost, including allowances for capital costs, varies from about 3½d. to 7½d. per head of the population per year.  A recent report about the cost of fluoridation in Watford, England, said that the all-in cost, including materials, maintenance and depreciation of plant, is working out at 4½d. per head per year. It is estimated that the annual cost of fluoridation for our country as a whole will be of the order of £30,000.  Half of this cost will rank for recoupment from the Health Services grant.  The capital cost of the equipment and its installation has been estimated at £100,000 for the entire country.</P>
    <P>I will now refer briefly to the different sections of the Bill.  Section 2 imposes a duty on health authorities to arrange for the fluoridation of public piped water supplies in accordance with regulations to be made by the Minister for Health.  Subsection (2) of the Section empowers the Minister to fix a time limit for the carrying out of this function.  It will hardly be necessary to avail of this power but it needs to be incorporated to provide against unreasonable delay in any area.  Subsection (3) which provides for the regulations referred to, also stipulates specifically that the maximum amount of fluorine that may be added to public water supplies is one part by weight of fluorine per million parts of water, which is the level authoritatively endorsed from the points of view of efficacy and safety.</P>
    <P>Subsections (4), (5) and (6) provide for the carrying out of surveys of the incidence of dental caries among school children in the areas to be fluoridated <Col N="344" /> and surveys of the fluorine content, or other constituents, of public water supplies in those areas, reports of which are to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Under Section 3 is to be determined the health authority which shall arrange for the fluoridation of a public water supply.  Where a particular supply serves the population in the area of two or more health authorities the responsibility as between these authorities for arranging for fluoridation will be determined by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 4 will enable the Minister to impose a duty on sanitary authorities, who are the statutory bodies responsible for supplying water to the public, to act as agents for the health authorities in the fluoridation of the public water supplies.  The expenses incurred by the sanitary authorities will be met by the appropriate health authority.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides, where two or more health authorities are concerned, for the apportionment of expenses between them on the basis of the amount of water supplied to each.</P>
    <P>Section 6 imposes a general duty on the Minister for Health to arrange from time to time for such surveys as appear to him to be desirable to be made as respects the health, or any particular aspects of the health, of persons, or classes of persons, in the fluoridated areas.  This section was inserted to meet some views expressed in Dáil Éireann.  The report of any such survey, which may be carried out through local health authorities or some other organisation or body, must be presented to each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the carrying out by health authorities of surveys of dental caries in their functional areas whenever required to do so by the Minister.  Such surveys would among other things be of great value in demonstrating as time goes on the beneficial effects of fluoridation.</P>
    <P>Section 8 refers to the Health Services (Financial Provisions) Act, 1947. It is intended that half the current expenditure of health authorities on fluoridation will be recouped to them <Col N="345" /> from the Health Services grant as from the date on which such expenditure is incurred.  The necessity for the section arose from the fact that under the 1947 Act as it stood the recognition of a new health service could only have been made effective from the beginning of the financial year following the introduction of the service. The new section will enable the recognition of fluoridation expenses for the purposes of the Health Services grant to be made effective at any time.</P>
    <P>Section 9 contains the usual provision for the laying of regulations made under the Bill before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot give the support to this measure we would like to give because we believe it is far too complex and difficult a proposal in relation to the various types of water supplies we have.  The Minister showed some of the difficulties, but he gave it as a reason for taking the compulsory power in the Bill the number of county councils, borough councils and urban councils in the country.  I could add to that that there are a far lesser number of county medical officers and that they over-step the boundaries of the borough council and urban council districts and are in a broader sense the county health officers.  It is the advice of these officers that we shall rely on.</P>
      <P>The Minister having addressed us on this measure for nearly an hour I feel that some of this fluorine has almost gone into my bones, because the amount which he tells us requires to be injected in order to be of benefit is only one part per million.</P>
      <P>This is a chemical which it is necessary for chemists to record, if it is used in prescriptions.  Therefore, there must be some reason why people speak against fluoridation.  I should hate to think&mdash;and I hope the Minister did not mean to imply&mdash;that they were a bunch of cranks who went around with sandwich boards creating agitation against those who wish to do good by giving us another new panacea, such as fluoride in water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister purports to show that there is a far higher percentage than <Col N="346" /> one part per million in many places in the United States.  I think in those cases that it is calcium fluoride as it is found in its natural state which would have to be injected generally in the form of gas or liquid in the way town water supplies are chlorinated here. It is not quite the same as finding one part per million by way of chemical analysis.</P>
    <P>Before any Order is made under this Bill, surveys will have to be made everywhere to find out the possible effects.  In many counties, there may be as many as 10 or 15 different water supplies.  It might also be found as the scheme developed that it might be wholly uneconomic to compel the public health authorities in those areas to use fluorine in the water in these small supplies.</P>
    <P>There is another problem which should be answered emphatically and left outside the realms of controversy. What effect will it have on our food and drink industries?  Many of our exports are concerned with either food or drink.  Much of the food is processed and in many of those processes, water is an ingredient in some way. Will the fluorine have any ill-effects on those products?  I notice in a report which was sent to me that in Rochester, New York, a local company found themselves obliged to defluorinate the water in order to avoid an injurious concentration of fluorine in their prepared baby foods.</P>
    <P>When the Minister asks us to give compulsory powers and when he denies the right of the lesser authorities such as a county council, which would be the authority in a public health district, we have to examine the matter very closely to see if it is right to give him these rather sweeping powers.  I know he will say that all orders made under the Bill will be laid on the Table of both Houses of the Oireachtas, but, in practice, there is no system for having these orders examined and reported on to the members of the Oireachtas.  The Minister may say it is the duty of members of the Oireachtas to read all the orders, but I believe it would be a far greater safeguard, if it could be demonstrated that it is necessary to <Col N="347" /> have the Orders made beforehand, rather than have them compiled by some of the Minister's officials, submitted to him for signature and then laid on the Table of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I must say that the compulsion in the Bill is one of the things to which I have most objection.  I believe that many public health officers would recommend that the type of water in the area would lend itself to the addition of fluorine, that it has an addiquate amount of calcium in it to absorb the fluorine injected into it by mechanical means, and that their experience and the best technical advice would suggest that it would be best in the area where they are entrusted with the care of the public health.  In that way, the interests of all sections of the community would be safeguarded, rather than handing the whole matter over to the Minister and the Department in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will answer the objections I have made to the impossibility of imposing a system on hundreds and hundreds of different water supplies in the country, differing in their chemical and biological content, and the possible effect on our industries which manufacture food and beverages of various sorts.  In fact, any industry which uses water either directly or indirectly as a part of their processing methods, will naturally want to be assured that the adding of fluorine to the water supply will in no way affect their final product.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words in praise of the Bill and to congratulate the Minister for the courage and foresight he has shown in putting into effect the report of the committee set up by the previous Government. I do not wish to make this a political matter but I wonder what the arguments would be, or what line the Opposition would now be taking if their Minister for Health were putting this Bill through the House and hoping to make it a law of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From what I read of the debate in <Col N="348" /> the Dáil and debates in other places, it appears to me that there is opposition for opposition's sake in many cases.  Nothing scientific and nothing of any significance was put forward against the Bill in a number of places. Personally, I am shocked at the high incidence of dental caries, as shown in the figures from all over the world given to us by the Minister.  I had a feeling that we in this country had a very much higher percentage of that disease than other countries.  I find it most deplorable when young people, and even children at school, tell me they have had their teeth extracted. If only from the point of vanity, when we consider the beautiful Irish girls we hear about with their mouths full of artificial dentures, it is itself a terrible reflection on our health system.  In other countries I have visited, I have not noticed whether the young people's teeth are missing but these figures of the high incidence of the disease have come as a great shock.</P>
    <P>I am very hopeful that when the Minister puts this Bill through the Oireachtas and it becomes law, there will be good results.  I know it will take some time and that the scientists will be watching for results and I hope that most of them will be good results. It has been argued that scientists and doctors have not been unanimous but I would like to ask when, if ever, have any group of doctors been unanimous on anything.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">

    <Speaker pid="JaneDowdall" hpid="Mrs. Dowdall Mrs. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, but we are taken as individuals, while if a doctor speaks, he has spoken and you must accept his word.  I happen to know a little bit about this.  I have read a good deal about medical science and its development.  Going back to the original improvements in science, who treated Mr. Lister in the way he was treated?  Not the man in the street but the doctors.  All through medical history opposition has come from fellow doctors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This theory of the ethics of interfering with the individual was used very much at the time of the introduction <Col N="349" /> of anaesthetics.  Some people in the Dáil used the ethical argument very strongly.  They spoke about the result for individual people and their rights and about this mass medication.  If any of these persons had to have an operation and held the ideas which prevailed at the time, would he like to be held down by six strong men while his appendix was removed?  All developments took place in spite of doctors and, thank God, we are at the present time in a fairly civilized way, in spite of doctors.  There have always been enlightened doctors but hardly ever unanimity among them, so that part of it does not distress me much.</P>
    <P>There has been talk about compulsion, about making this compulsory for local authorities.  That is one of the wisest things the Minister has decided, because, as a member of a local authority, I do not have to tell members of other such local authorities of the utter and complete waste of time and energy that goes on in discussing the smallest matter.  In my own county, the vital matter of providing means of transport from one side of the country to the other involved, because two local authorities were concerned, 25 years of waiting for a bridge which should have have been done if an order had been made and they were told to get on with it.  So our great-great-great-grandchildren will have no teeth at all if things are not done by compulsion and if caries disease continues at the rate it is going. I congratulate the Minister on his courage and wisdom in making this compulsory.  I do not want to spend what is remaining of this term of the local authorities discussing whether we shall or shall not fluoridate the water. I shall be glad to get an order and help to do it with other members of the local authority.</P>
    <P>The scientific reports read to us tonight by the Minister are very considerable and I do not think that the people, however they wish to disagree, can ignore the reports of the World Health Organisation.  It is accepted that in that body there are some of the greatest scientists of the world.  I once heard the Minister say, when putting a Bill through the Dáil, that he would accept <Col N="350" /> only authorities known to be authorities, not self-appointed ones, so I suppose in this case, as in many others, we shall all be appointing ourselves minor or major scientific experts.  I want to congratulate the Minister.  I hope the Bill goes through the Oireachtas and that, in the future, whatever time it takes, it will show results and that we shall be happy to say: &ldquo;You were right, Mr. MacEntee.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Mrs. Dowdall in her general approval of this Bill.  We have to look at it, I think, in two lights: first of all, is it right that we should try to do this, and, secondly, is it necessary? Take it the other way round, if you like, but I shall take it in that order for the purpose of the discussion.  The ethics of how far a central authority should go in interfering with the food and drink of the people in general has been a matter of debate for very many centuries.  I do not think there is any doubt that the authority has the right to protect the public from disease through impurities in food or disease, through adulteration of food or interference with its natural content.</P>
      <P>That has been accepted in many Food and Drugs Acts in various countries and I think it has also been accepted that a Minister or any central authority has the right to publicise, to use all the propaganda at its disposal, to advise the public about foods that would be good for them, about those they should take and those they should avoid.  It is only when the question arises of introducing some specific thing into the diet, particularly into an article of diet taken almost universally, that the matter goes, or appears to some people to go, beyond that range of authority and responsibility, but in considering that latter point, we must remember that any central authority has a special responsibility for specific sections of the population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the main, you can assume when you exercise propaganda, by advertisements, films and so on, to encourage the public to do this or that about their diet, that adult members of the public will consider these things and <Col N="351" /> act accordingly, but there are children and people who are not in a position to make up their minds, and particularly regarding the younger section of the people, the responsibility of those in authority, those who have certain evidence to look over, has always been accepted as being very heavy.</P>
    <P>We have here a fluoridation of water supplies Bill and we must take that in particular relation to the fact that it is children whom we are proposing to protect in order that they may grow into more healthy adults, not having this great handicap of serious dental caries, at least so far as we can prevent it.</P>
    <P>This happened in the relatively recent past, the past 20 years.  It began during the war when it was realised that the flour in these islands would not be sufficient, that the flour used here and the flour it would be possible to import, would not be sufficient to make enough bread to go around.  In order to get over the difficulty in Great Britain and here, it was decided that the extraction rate of flour should be increased.  It was realised in Great Britain that this would probably involve interference with the absorption of calcium and therefore that some calcium should be added to the flour in order to make sure that growing children would have the opportunity of forming bones and avoiding rickets.</P>
    <P>That was done and there were no rickets in England.  In this country it was not done because there was less flour than in England and we had a different extraction rate and in fact, there was greater interference with absorption of calcium and a very serious outbreak of rickets.  We did some surveys on this and demonstrated it absolutely beyond doubt.  We advised the Department of Health.  It took a little while, but eventually the then Minister did add calcium to flour. The result was that the incidence of rickets fell and, after two years, it was back to the level at which it had existed before the war.</P>
    <P>That makes me ask the question; would that Minister have been justified <Col N="352" /> in deciding, on ethical grounds, to refuse to add calcium to flour? Children died of rickets in those periods.  Many children who did not die were deformed for the rest of their lives.  I think that, on ethical grounds, he would have been wrong to have refused to accept that advice.</P>
    <P>We must look on this in almost the same sort of way.  We have the same sort of situation.  The Medical Research Council, as the Minister pointed out, some eight years ago, did this survey at the request of a predecessor of his, and the appalling state was revealed that among children of about 13 years old, 20 per cent of their permanent teeth were carious.  Another figure even more appalling, which I do not think the Minister mentioned, was that only four per cent.  of these carious teeth had been filled.  That, of course, was due to the great deficiency of dentists in the country.  The Minister has mentioned that.</P>
    <P>I believe that there are at the moment 73 whole-time and 53 part-time dental officers employed by local authorities in this country.  Most of these officers are, of course, employed to look after the teeth of school children.  It is accepted that we should have about one dentist to every 1,000 school children.  We have something like over half a million school children, so that we should have about 500 full-time dentists looking after the teeth of those children.  The Minister said that we should have to increase our dentists ninefold, and that is about the size of it.</P>
    <P>We would need an enormous increase, and would want to find 300 or 400 more dentists.  On the Dental Register in this country, there are about 900 altogether, and the number on the register is slowly going down.  We are not producing enough even to keep the number of dentists at the level at which it exists at the moment.  This means that, even if the Minister could find the money for the additional salaries involved, we cannot imagine enough dentists being found within the next 20 years to bring the level of dental care in this country up to that required for proper conservative treatment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="353" /> It seemed, therefore, that you have no alternative but to do the best you can in the way of prevention, and this use of fluorine is the obvious thing at least to try.  Fluorine is, of course, deposited in the enamel of the tooth, and its presence there gives this enamel its hardness.  It is deposited there while the tooth is growing.  When the tooth is already erupted and has reached its permanent state, it has ceased to take up fluorine and the addition of fluorine then is probably ineffective.  Similarly, the addition of fluorine by application to the teeth in the way of tooth paste is, I think, also ineffective, partly for that reason and partly because it is unphysiological. The tissues of the body take up best those materials brought to them in the blood.  They utilise it best and form them into new tissues.  To apply a material directly is not the way nature has intended it to be done.</P>
    <P>We learned that long ago when we tried to treat arthritis by rubbing things on the joints.  It was only when we learned of a remedy that could be fed to the joints through the blood and taken by mouth that we were able to cure this disease.  When we come to find an effective hair restorer, it will not be found to be effective through being applied to the scalp.  It will be found to be effective by being taken by mouth or by being injected.</P>
    <P>I think that in this case we have no alternative to passing this Bill.  In fact we would be failing in our duty as people who have studied this matter and learned the lessons of other places where experiments have been carried out, if we did not pass this Bill.  The Minister set up a Commission that studied this matter for, I think he said, over a year.  His Department presumably has studied it in the intervening two years.  The Medical Research Council has given it considerable consideration and many other bodies have made pronouncements.  We have all this information, and if we cannot make up our minds and say that this is something which it is our duty to do, then we are just passing the buck.  It is not sensible, and we are leaving ourselves open to what the <Col N="354" /> Minister mentioned, the susceptibility of people who have not had an opportunity of considering this matter, to propaganda which is not always advisable.</P>
    <P>I remember well that when the British Government were considering the addition of calcium to flour, there was a centre from which a lot of propaganda issued, to the effect that this was wrong.  It was going to cause people blood pressure, to make their arteries harden and their kidneys to fail, and all kinds of other dire results were prophesied.  There was a name always associated with this propaganda&mdash;a doctor's name&mdash;and he was described as the Director of Research for the Prevention of Diseases.  There was no substance in any of the things he stated, and when somebody took the trouble to find out about this research institute in the prevention of diseases, it was found that he was the director of it but he was also the entire staff.  He had done one experiment a long time ago and had done nothing else except propaganda.  He was prepared to examine people who were afraid of their blood pressure going up because they were being forced to eat this calcium in the flour, and afraid of their arteries hardening and their kidneys failing in their functions, and all these had to be tested periodically.  I think there was an ulterior motive.</P>
    <P>I do not say that that is the sort of thing that is happening with the anti-fluoridationists, but I feel that if we have considered this matter and if we feel that this is the right thing to do, we should do it.  We should not pass it on and leave it open to other people to decide, when perhaps they are not able to give it as much attention as has been given to it hitherto.  I therefore support this Bill.</P>

      <P>I think that in nothing more than a Bill of this kind is the Minister for Health fulfilling his function best as Minister for Health, because whatever views we may have on the Bill, the purpose of it is clearly to promote good dental health among the population of this country, and the Minister this evening was particularly happy in the role <Col N="355" /> which this Bill gives him an opportunity of fulfilling.  I am sure he has derived great comfort from the very learned and lucid speech just made by Senator Jessop.  It seems that whatever stigma attaches in this House, even to this day, to university professors in the eyes of the people opposite has been removed by his learned contribution this evening.</P>
      <P>I was, I must say, extremely interested in the statistics given out by the Minister and like Senator Mrs. Dowdall, I was amazed to find that dental caries was so widespread in other countries, but there is one set of statistics which I should have wished the Minister to give.  Perhaps he has not got them or they are not available. Maybe he gave them at a time when I was not listening.  If that is so, I regret raising the matter.</P>
      <P>I should like to know the distinction between the incidence of dental caries among children in rural and children in urban areas.  It would probably throw some light on the situation.  Do I gather from the Minister that there is no difference?</P>

      <P>There is a growing tendency among young people to eat ice lollies and things of that kind and I understand from dentists that these ice lollies have a very deleterious effect on the teeth of young people.  Indeed, I wonder whether, instead of a Bill of this kind, we should not pay more attention to the prevention of the use of this kind of thing which may have a positive deleterious effect on dental health among young children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am given to understand also that ice lollies and things of that kind, of which children are so fond, are in some measure responsible for the incidence at particular times of the year of poliomyelitis. That may not be so, but it is a matter upon which I should like the Minister's comment because there exists among quite a number of people <Col N="356" /> the view that these things are not good for children or children's teeth.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the problem to which I should like to direct the Minister's mind, if I may.  This Bill concerns only piped water supplies and the Minister has stated that there is no difference between the incidence of dental caries in rural and urban areas. The effect of this Bill will be that the children in urban areas will enjoy better dental health than the children in rural areas.  Has the Minister any plan in mind to improve the dental health of children in rural areas?  Has the Minister in mind any scheme of propaganda, the effect of which would be to develop a consciousness of the desirability of cleaning teeth and of having teeth regularly examined of children living in rural areas?</P>
    <P>If we are not doing that, if there is not such a scheme in contemplation, we are not being fair to the children in rural areas who can never have the benefit of fluoridation in the water which they will drink.  I think that aspect of the problem of dental caries is one which should immediately engage the attention of the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <P>We hear about the number of university graduates who are emigrating and I am sure that among that group there are as many dentists as there are others.  We suffer so hopelessly from the shortage of dentists in this country that I wonder whether the Minister is taking any positive steps to increase the number of dental students and encourage young boys and girls to take up dentistry as a subject or as a career, because if he is not, it is quite clear that, for half the population dental caries will continue to be a problem and there will not be anything like a sufficient number of dentists available to deal with the problem of that half of the population.</P>
    <P>Certain objection has been taken to some people raising ethical objections to this Bill.  I am all on the side of the people who question the propriety ethically of a Bill of this kind.  I am all for that and I think they are the people who ensure that inroads <Col N="357" /> are not made upon the personal liberty of the citizen.  I think what the Minister said and what Senator Jessop stated with regard to the addition of calcium to flour during the war years laid my fears on the ethical basis somewhat at rest.  I think a case has been made out for the introduction of fluorine into water.  It seems to be as proper a thing to do as introducing any substance to make water pure and fit for drinking.  As a result of the statements made by the Minister and supported by Senator Jessop, my fears to some extent, from an ethical point of view, of this kind of measure have been quieted, but I would urge the Minister to pay some attention, if the problem is as great and as telling as it is, to doing something in relation to the children in rural areas.</P>
    <P>It always strikes me as being extremely odd that in country schools at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, there is no more light than there is in a school in the city.  I do not suppose that there is one out of 100 schools that has any form of artificial lighting.  The children in country schools have to sit down and read the print in books or on blackboards with inadequate lighting and, at the same time, we have a public health service with doctors going around examining children's eyes, prescribing glasses and cures instead of responsible authorities preventing the disease and providing the cure in advance.  I am rather inclined to think that this Bill is something in the same form as the service we provide in relation to the vision of children in our schools.  I hope that, once this Bill has been introduced and that water has been fluoridated, the Department of Health and the local authorities will not say: &ldquo;That is an end of the problem of dental health among the young children attending the schools.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Finally, there is an observation I wish to make in relation to subsection 4 of Section 2.  It reads:</P>
    <P>Before making regulations under this section, the Minister shall&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) cause to be made&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) a survey of the incidence of dental caries in a representative <Col N="358" /> sample of pupils attending fulltime day schools in the functional area or functional areas of the health authority or health authorities to whom the regulations relate.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I am quite sure, will agree that no health authority and no Minister can cause any child to appear before it to have its teeth examined in any survey.  I wonder whether the constitutional position of the parent and of the child is properly safeguarded by the proviso in subsection (2) of Section 7?  I wonder if it is intended that that should relate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>I have a recollection of a previous Bill, quite different from this one, the Greyhound Racing Bill, which was before us in 1957.  The Minister unburdened himself of his view of what attitude the Oireachtas should take regarding the constitutionality of its own legislation.  That view did not commend itself to me. Having read subsection (4), I began to wonder whether the Minister's views on the Greyhound Racing Bill were not carried into this Bill.  However, I do see some kind of safeguard in Section 7 and I am glad the Minister is so much alive to the Constitutional position of parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to the Minister when he was introducing this Bill, and I have read, I think, most of the debates on the matter in the Dáil.  Despite a good deal of pretty strong attack there, the Minister can be congratulated on presenting a case very expertly and urbanely.  There is no question that he has made himself familiar with the <Col N="359" /> subject.  I suppose most of us here are laymen and in some respects we are in the hands of the experts.  It is the privilege of the laymen, however, to put questions to the experts.  In my experience, if the expert gets annoyed on being questioned, then he is not quite sure of his ground.  If he answers calmly, the chances are that he knows what he is talking about.  My tendency, then, would be to put certain questions and to make certain objections to this scheme from the point of view of a non-expert who has read something about it and done a certain amount of thinking.</P>
      <P>The Minister quite rightly stressed, both here and in the Dáil, the incidence of caries in teeth&mdash;children's teeth in particular&mdash;in this country and the dangers involved.  He quoted at a good deal of length the W.H.O. report which talks about the dangers and the disadvantages of widespread dental caries.  He is certainly right to do that, and to be disturbed about it. He made a point, incidentally, which seems to warrant attention; I am sure it is true.  He quoted this extract from the W.H.O. Report as reported at column 274 of Volume 184 No. 2 of the Official Report of Dáil Éireann. He stressed the effect of bad dentition on</P>
      <P>&mdash;digestive diseases and secondary infection from a septic mouth [which] may have far-reaching effects on general health.</P>
      <P>That is a point that must be made, and is certainly sound.  Yet it is slightly disconcerting to find&mdash;and it is the sort of thing one finds implicit in other reports also&mdash;that as reported at column 283 of the same Dáil debate, when the Minister passed on to a consideration of two adjacent towns with similar situations, one of which had fluorine in the water and the other of which had not, no apparent general health benefit accrued to the town blessed with fluorine.  The relevant extract reads as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bartlett-Cameron survey, a 10-year longitudinal study of 168 individuals, demonstrated no adverse health effects with even 8 <Col N="360" /> p.p.m. in the drinking-water, although tooth mottling and a low incidence of osteosclerosis were found.  Mortality and morbidity rates are comparable for fluoridated and non-fluoridated population groups.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister sees the point I am trying to make there but it seems slightly disconcerting to find that despite the fact that a population with pronounced dental caries is prone to all kinds of digestive disorders and bad health of every kind, nevertheless when you compare the two towns as far as mortality and morbidity go, they are apparently much the same.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes the point that in this case one particular town has a big intake of fluorine&mdash;eight times what is proposed here&mdash;yet that does not seem to have any adverse effect on the mortality rate.  Apparently, though, the taking of fluorine has not had any beneficial effect either on the mortality rate.  From the general health point of view, it is almost as if it did not matter whether you took it or not.</P>
    <P>Our own Consultative Council say in their report at paragraph 25, page 10:</P>
    <P>Mortality statistics show that there is no significant difference in the general death rates between areas where fluoride is present and those where it is absent....</P>
    <P>I should have rather expected the contrary, for I am prepared to accept the view that fluorides absorbed in the early years make for better teeth, and that better teeth make for better general health.  Therefore, I should expect to find better general health in a community which had had the benefit of fluoridation.  Yet, apparently, mortality statistics show that as far as that goes it is much the same.  I merely comment on the fact that it seems strange that the mortality statistics are not better where they have had the benefit of fluoridated water.</P>
    <P>When I look at this country and hear the Minister talk about dental caries in children, I am quite sure he would share my view that dental examination <Col N="361" /> in our schools (a) is not half frequent enough and (b) when it is uncoupled with dental treatment, it is almost worse than useless.  I am afraid we are a little complacent or apathetic about this.  The children's teeth are examined, I suppose, once in three years, and what should be done is noted.  Actually, I am afraid that in a large number of cases, they are simply neglected.  As well as fluoridation, if we accept it, we should be active also in promoting dental hygiene among children.  The point has been made by Senator O'Quigley in relation to what they should eat and should not eat&mdash;the question of the eating of sweets and all kinds of things, which I think is not perhaps properly taught in our Irish schools, and this failure contributes to a state of dental decay which will not be entirely met even if every child in the country could be given the right optimum dose of fluorine.</P>
    <P>Now, there is no question but that the picture of the prevalence of dental caries presented by the Minister is substantially accurate; though a point revealed in the council's report is that the statistics and percentages quoted by the Minister are based on a sample of only 2,000 Irish children.  Two thousand children out of something like 600,000, say, up to the age of 12 or 14 is rather a small sample, but the chances are, nevertheless, I concede, that the result is pretty representative.  Despite the fact that it is dangerously small, if one wants to prove something in general, I am prepared to accept what the Minister says, though there might be small disparities in his percentages.</P>
    <P>It is also true, however, in relation to the heavy incidence of dental caries that our dental services are disgracefully inadequate.  I do not think we should be allowed to salve our consciences in relation to dental caries in Irish children, by simply saying: &ldquo;We will pass this fluoridation law, and in five years' time, a certain proportion of those children who have the benefit of tap water in their houses will be considerably better off.&rdquo;  That is not good enough and I believe with Senator O'Quigley that we must tackle <Col N="362" /> this grave problem a bit more radically than that.</P>
    <P>It is known that in Britain, when, after the War, with the extended health schemes the dental services were made available freely to a far wider section of the community, they were actually swamped out with what you might call a backlog of dental decay to cope with.  That is what would happen here, and what ought to happen, if we were really doing our duty in this matter of dental caries.  I am prepared to accept from what I have read, and from what the Minister has referred to, that the absorption of the right amount of fluorides of one kind or another does quite definitely reduce the incidence of caries.  It reduces the incidence because it is a preventative, and I do not think that point can really be argued.  We can grant them that it has been proved that through the absorption of fluorides in the right quantity the percentage reduction is so considerable that you cannot argue about it.</P>
    <P>The W.H.O. report which the Minister made available in the Library makes that point in a very balanced way, and I do not think you can have a legitimate argument about it.  It was also clear from the report that the major beneficial effect of the absorption of fluorides, and I am sure the Minister would accept this, is up to the age of about 12.  I do not deny that there may be some slight beneficial effect after that&mdash;some say up to the age of 15 or 16, and some even say that there is a perceptible effect up to 20 and even 40, but that is not regarded by the experts as proven.  I should also like to observe that the W.H.O. report lays stress all the time on the necessity for the dose absorbed being the optimal dose.  The dose has to be very strictly within certain limits. It is not good enough, if it is too small; it is dangerous, if it is too big. &ldquo;The optimal dose&rdquo;&mdash;that is the phrase they use, and the phrase which in fact the Minister quoted in the Dáil, when quoting from their report.</P>
    <P>Our own Consultative Council went into the matter in regard to Ireland basing their findings, I think, largely <Col N="363" /> upon statistics from outside this country but doing it in a conscientious way and quoting their sources.  I would have been happier if they had gone more deeply into Irish conditions and the likelihood of the correct dosage reaching the majority of our children and so on, but on the general principle, the report is obviously a sound one.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also referred to the Swedish report which I have here, the Swedish medical report on the whole question by a distinguished body of doctors who reported to the Swedish Government and reported in favour of controlled, and very carefully controlled, fluoridation of water.  But there were dissentient voices and they are quoted in the report.  I should like to quote one passage because it has been suggested that the experts were all agreed in the Swedish report that there should be flouridation.  The politicians got at it in the Swedish Parliament, we are told, and did the experts down. I should like to quote this passage as an illustration perhaps of one factor prompting the decision of the politicians in the Swedish Parliament not to accept the recommendations of this body.  This is on page 5 of the report and it deals with the special statement by Dr. Strälfors, and I quote:</P>
    <P>Dr. Strälfors views can be summarized as follows:</P>
    <P>&mdash;that is his views regarding the efficiency and safety of water fluoridation. He expressed criticism against several of the American investigations on which water fluoridation has been largely founded&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>In the large clinical investigations on the effect of water fluoridation no attempt was made to devise a randomization procedure, which would have eliminated bias on the part of the examiners.  No estimate was made of the method of error, i.e. the variability between examiners and between inspections of the same examiner.  No statistical evaluation of the final results was made in the Grand Rapids, Newburgh and Brantford studies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="364" />&mdash;which the Minister quoted&mdash;</P>
    <P>The claims concerning the amount of caries reduction are therefore open to doubt.  The effect of fluoridation, if any, was a delay of caries during childhood.  There exists no valid proof of any influence on dental caries after the age of 20.</P>
    <P>Water fluoridation gives a highly variable dosage&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;and, to my mind, that seems to be a valid criticism&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;because of the great variation in individual water consumption.  The intake of fluorine with food is also very variable.  To this has to be added that there are large differences between individuals in their sensitivity to fluorine.  There is no safeguard against toxic injuries to some of the people in a fluoridated area.</P>
    <P>I think that type of statement by one of the responsible Swedish experts, although he is in a minority in that particular case, was a factor in the hesitancy shown by the Swedish Parliament to adopt the recommendations; and, in fact, they turned them down.  Similarly, in the city of New York&mdash;I hesitate to quote this because I am afraid the Minister was not impressed in the Dáil by the quotation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>May I beg the Senator's pardon?  Before he passes from that point which he has just made about Dr. Strälfors, he is reading, I think, from this version of the Swedish report which I have.  Would he turn to page 7 and read the second paragraph because it would save time?  I might not have to reply if the Senator would read the second paragraph.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to do that, but I think on the whole I might be allowed to do it in my own time.  I think I made it clear that Dr. Strälfors' view was not accepted by the Committee as a whole&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Just as he passed some strictures on those of other experts.  The point I am really <Col N="365" /> making is to explain to some extent why the Swedish politicians hesitated to implement the recommendations of the report.</P>
      <P>Again, the Commissioner of the City of New York Department of Water Supply, Mr. Arthur C. Ford, made a statement, some of which was quoted in the Dáil; and there are matters in it to which reference must be made.  I am prepared to concede that Mr. Ford, although he has a great deal more knowledge than I have, could not claim any more than I could to be an expert on the question or to be a scientist in any sense, but he has his expert advisers.</P>
      <P>He said in the second paragraph of this document which was issued in April, 1956:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Department has extensive laboratories staffed by reputable scientists and competent sanitary engineers with a massive library, in which are contained over five thousand references on the subject of the fluorides alone.  We have continued to study and evaluate the effect of toxic substances as related to water supplies.  The matter of fluorides has been under our scrutiny for over twenty years.</P>
      <P>I do not think that can be brushed aside and I do not think we can regard New York as being just a hick town which is not well up in science or not in the forefront of the scientific world.</P>
      <P>We must pay attention to what is said by such a man and to his stated reasons for the decision.  He goes on to say&mdash;and I think this is relevant to those who say: &ldquo;After all, you do not object to chlorine, so why object to fluorine?&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
      <P>No one has suggested that dental caries is a water-borne disease or that water is a cause of dental decay.</P>
      <P>It is suggested, of course, that typhoid is a water-borne disease, and that you may have to combat in the water something that otherwise would be absorbed with the water.  There is a sharp distinction between putting chlorine into water to combat a water-borne disease and putting fluorine into water to combat something that is not in the water at all: dental caries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="366" /> He goes on:</P>
    <P>No satisfactory reason has ever been advanced to show why everyone in a community must be compelled to risk life-long extraordinary exposure to the toxic action of fluorides, particularly when safer, more effective and more economical ways of administering fluorides for caries reduction in children's teeth have been pointed out and are available.</P>
    <P>That is of extreme importance to us, if we accept the view, as I do, that the administration of fluorine is beneficial and worthwhile.  We must pay attention to the fact that a man in his responsible position says that there are &ldquo;safer, more effective and more economical ways of administering fluorides.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He says further:</P>
    <P>We are aware that the fluorides are extremely toxic substances, and evidence exists to show that even at the recommended level of one part per million of fluoride in drinking water...</P>
    <P>&mdash;and that is what is proposed here&mdash;</P>
    <P>... people in fluoridated communities have been harmed.  A very small percentage among a population of eight million, sensitive to the chemical and adversely affected, would constitute a seriously significant number of persons harmed.</P>
    <P>Later on, he says:</P>
    <P>Because of this, and for reasons of safety and economy, this Department has proposed that the City distribute fluoride tablets through health stations, free of charge, for parents to administer to children. The cost to the City ascertained at less than 25 cents for a thousand days for each child, would be less than one-fifth of the cost of a fluoridated water programme. Tablets (a pharmaceutical grade in contrast with the commercial by-product used in water fluoridation) would provide an exact procedure, under control, to be taken only by those during the formative period of their teeth.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="367" /> Again, we cannot leave this aside, and say he is &ldquo;only a Commissioner,&rdquo; that New York is unimportant, and he is not a scientist.  What he actually says is extremely cogent.</P>
    <P>He continues:</P>
    <P>Fluoride, besides being a toxic substance, is not all excreted when taken into the system, a significant percentage remaining cumulatively.</P>
    <P>That is relevant, if we are to have an adult population taking it indiscrimately for 30, 40 or 50 years.</P>
    <P>He goes on:</P>
    <P>Fluoridation of the drinking water at any level of concentration is a very indiscrimate procedure since children drink widely varying amounts of water...</P>
    <P>The last part of this report which I want to quote reads:</P>
    <P>The problem of managing the control of dosage of fluoride chemical to obtain uniformity&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;and it is essential where we are concerned that the optimum dosage shall be uniform&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;throughout a grid-work of more than 5,000 miles of pipe and tunnels involving different sources and pressure gradients, as in the New York system, is formidable.  None of those who have made statements to the contrary have ever had the experience nor do they possess knowledge of what the exact result would be.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that we must at any rate advert to that sort of argument, and not merely brush it aside unconsidered.</P>
    <P>I should now like to return, if I may, to the quotation made by the Minister, which I quoted, from the W.H.O. report about the Cameron survey.  In making the point I want to make, I recognise that the intake there would be considerably more than what is proposed here.  It said:</P>
    <P>.... although tooth mottling and a low incidence of osteosclerosis were found.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="368" /> That recognises that the tooth mottling and osteosclerosis were found in those places.  Again, I do not feel that we should be satisfied merely to brush aside that sort of factual statement about certain results.  Osteosclerosis is a disease of hardening of the bone.  I do not want to make a false case, and, as I stated, the intake there is far more than is likely here, except, perhaps, when it would be cumulative over many years in adults.</P>
    <P>Since osteosclerosis is apparently accepted rather lightheartedly, however, I should like to quote now from a thesis of a Danish scientist who is quoted by each of these reports.  He is Dr. Kaj Roholm and, in 1937, he wrote a clinical-hygienic Study on Fluorine Intoxication.  I should also like to say that he is, incidentally, quoted as an authority by the W.H.O. report and in the report of our own Consultative Council.  I do not think this can be lightly brushed aside, either.  He is dealing with workers who have been extracting cryolite and have suffered severe intoxication.  This is what he says:</P>
    <P>Among the most severe cases, four elderly men, there was practically complete rigidity of the entire spine and a more or less pronounced restriction of the head movements. This was particularly marked in a 57-year old male worker who had been employed at the factory for 12 years.  The head was fixed in a bent-over position and turned as in torticollis; movement was possible only to an extent of 5-10º, in both saggital and frontal planes.  In order to look sideways he had to turn the whole body.  Simultaneously there was an increase of the normal dorsal kyphosis and asymmetry of the shoulder region.  This man was unable to pick anything up from the floor by bending the knees and could not put on his socks without aid.  In the four workers of this group there was a moderate but distinct atrophy of the long extensor muscles of the back.</P>

      <P>They absorbed the fluorine from the dust in the mine.  That report was quoted with approval by our own Consultative Council.  They did not quote that extreme case.  I am not suggesting that this is likely to happen if we fluoridate our water unless there is a cumulative effect.  We are told that not all of the fluoride is excreted and what might be a nominal dose for a few years might become over a long number of years, quite a degree more serious, and this potential danger, cannot, therefore, be brushed aside.</P>
      <P>I should like to look now into the question of distribution of this fluorine. It will be distributed through piped water.  The point has been made by Senator O'Quigley that in a large section of rural Ireland, the children will not get it at all.  I feel we would not be honest in claiming that we are dealing with this problem unless we recognise how many dwellings there are in this country which have no piped water.  I intend to quote figures from the latest <i>Statistical Abstract.</i> The total number of dwellings in the Republic is 662,654 and of those, 255,244 have piped water.  That means that more than half of our dwellings have not got it.  That is the picture for the whole country.</P>
      <P>The picture for Leinster is that out of 283,025 dwellings, 163,000 have a piped water supply; in Munster, out of 205,966 dwelings, only 70,900 have a piped water supply; in Connaught, out of 112,400 dwellings, only 14,000 have a piped water supply; and for the three counties of Ulster which are in the Republic, out of 61,263 dwellings, only 7,200 have a piped water supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is fair to say that we must recognise now that, even with fluoridation of water in all cases, large sections of our people will not be reached at all by this new scheme.  I say that in relation to the distribution of these valuable fluorides, and I now suggest that the method of distribution in these circumstances which are not even adverted to by our Consultative Council, the method of distribution through piped water, is grossly inadequate if <Col N="370" /> we are really concerned with tackling caries in the children of this country, and not concerned only with city dwellers or mainly with Leinster.  I am making the point in the absence of the Minister who has apparently been called for a division but I think it better to continue.  I am sure that he will not mind missing what I have to say.</P>

      <P>A large proportion of our population, then, are not reached at all, and among those who are reached by piped water only those under 12 years of age will benefit.  So I say that distribution of fluoride by this method is haphazard, slapdash and wasteful, because, as has been said in the Dáil, a large amount of the stuff will be used for washing cars or watering gardens, and not usefully, and many of our children will not be reached at all.</P>
      <P>Now there are alternative methods of distribution as we see from the New York Commissioner.  I should like to hear the Minister&mdash;and perhaps his technical advisers will note my query and prevail upon him to answer this question: What is his comment on the possibility of public health authorities distributing tablets?  I should like to quote for his consideration the report of the Consultative Council, page 13, paragraph 33:</P>
      <P>The use of fluoride tablets was also considered.  No comprehensive studies have been carried out on the value of such tablets, but, assuming that adequate precautions are taken, we see no reason why they should not give satisfactory results.</P>
      <P>I think that is very important and I do not think that there can be any suggestion that if you absorb it in tablet form rather than by drinking it in water, you are absorbing it in some less adequate way.  In fairness, I must complete the paragraph:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The practical difficulties associated with their distribution and use are, however, of such a nature <Col N="371" /> that their adoption for general use cannot be recommended.</P>
    <P>They do not recommend the method, but see no reason why it should not be satisfactory, and I suggest that in the conditions obtaining in this country, where you cannot reach half the children through piped water, it would be far better to consider the distribution of fluorides in tablet form.  It would have advantages which you are unable to get at present in that it could be controlled both in quantity and quality because it would be pharmaceutically made up, not merely an industrial byproduct.  The amount absorbed by the children would be controlled and as it would not be distributed to old people or adults, there would be no danger of a cumulative effect in older people who might otherwise accumulate fluorides over a span of 30, 40 or 50 years.  I suggest&mdash;I speak from no expert knowledge &mdash;that no expert can deny that there are certain attendant dangers from cumulative effects in making adults absorb fluorides over the whole span of their life.  We do not know what cumulative effects there may be. We simply do not know, and none of our experts have tried to tell us.</P>
    <P>It is also true of course that experts change their minds.  Things that were not regarded as dangerous are coming to be recognised as dangerous, and expert opinion evolves.  I think we all remember the time when in the shoe-shops of the city you could stand on a machine and have a look at your feet and see if they fitted the nails in the shoes.  Now we are told that that is highly dangerous.</P>
    <P>In support of my view that experts change their minds, I would quote from the report of our radio-activity consultative council which has just been laid on the Table of the House. They mention the fact that the British Medical Research Council changed their mind and have now come round to the United Nations Report view in which it was recognised that &ldquo;the contribution of diagnostic radiology was estimated to be equal in the advanced countries to the normal background radiation&rdquo;.  It says:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="372" /> If those figures may be adapted to conditions in this country&mdash;and there is no reason why they should not be capable of such adaptation &mdash;it is quite clear that the greatest radiation hazard here is that derived form diagnostic radiology and secondarily from therapeutic radiology.</P>
    <P>On that point experts 20 years ago said it was nonsense, fantastic.  World expert opinion gradually changed.  For a time, the British Medical Research Council differed, but now they have intimated that they had &ldquo;reconsidered their earlier estimates and were disposed to agree with the United Nations Report&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I quote, again, from page 7:</P>
    <P>The genetic effects of radiation are appreciable only in relation to the population as a whole and not to individuals.  It is known that radiation induces mutations of genes and it is possible that many of the mutations which occur are caused by natural background radioactivity to which every one is exposed.  It is not known what percentage of naturally-occurring mutations are actually caused by natural radiation. Ionising radiations have genetic consequences only in so far as they affect the reproductive cells or the cells ancestral to them in the reproductive organs (gonads).  The frequency of gene mutation is increased by radiation and the rise in mutation rate is probably directly proportional to the amount of additional exposure to radiation. Any additional exposure, however small, must be expected to raise the mutation rate if only by a minute amount.  Damage to genetic material is cumulative and irreparable.</P>
    <P>I put the point that it is now recognised by experts that such damage is cumulative and irreparable.  Could it be that the toxic effects of long-term absorption of fluorides might also be cumulative and irreparable?</P>
    <P>In the report of our own Consultative Council, page 9, they quote Dr. Roholm and his work on fluoride poison from which I have already quoted, <i>Fluorine Intoxication.</i> They <Col N="373" /> quote on page 9 what he says at page 179 of his book, and I might as well quote from the source.  The point I am making is that they do not give the full quotation, and I know that the Minister for Health in particular is very averse to such a practice.  They quoted from Dr. Roholm when he says at the end of Chapter 27 that &ldquo;There is nothing to show that working with cryolite reduces the period of life or that cryolite workers acquire macroscopically recognisable organic lesions apart from the bone changes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They quote that for the purpose of implying that it cannot do you any harm, but they omit the sentences before that, where it turns out that this derived from an examination of only 15 people who died:</P>
    <P>The examination of the deceased cryolite workers shows that a considerable number of them died of pulmonary tuberculosis and cancer in the gastro-intestinal tracts.  Like the others, these diseases are among the generally occurring causes of death and the small material provides no basis for a discussion of the possible connection between working with cryolite and the cause of death.</P>
    <P>And then follows the sentence quoted in our own Report.  I think it is disturbing to find that our Consultative Council left out the first two sentences of Dr. Roholm's which say that there is nothing to show that it has fatal effects but that the case histories were too small to afford a basis for discussion. He does wind up, and this is significant: &ldquo;apart from the bone changes&rdquo;, and I have quoted already what he means when he speaks of &ldquo;bone changes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My objections, therefore, to the present scheme would be that in dosing our population by the fluoridation of trapped water, in order to ensure that the optimal dose is got by all, some may well get too much.  That is the first objection beyond any question to this legislation on the absorption of fluorides.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote one last illustrative point on that.  Our own Consultative Council made the point in Paragraph 26 that in a recent survey, <Col N="374" />&ldquo;very mild mottling of the teeth&rdquo; was produced in ten per cent.  of the children by the amount suggested under this scheme, namely, one part per million.  Ten per cent. were affected differently from 90 per cent.  I quote that simply to show that the effect does vary, and I make the point that a varying effect will follow from something that can be dangerous itself, by a fluoridation scheme which will ensure that the optimal effects will be got by all, without being able to ensure that some will not get too much.</P>
    <P>My second objection is that adults, for whom no benefit is claimed under this scheme, if they live in fluoridated areas, must absorb a fluoride regularly for 20, 30, 40 or 50 years in drinking the water, with no benefit to themselves but with some danger from cumulative effects.</P>
    <P>My third objection is that very large numbers of our children in homes without tap water will not get this preventive treatment at all, under the scheme before us.  No amount of talk about the dangers of caries and its incidence among children from such and such a place is relevant to the fact that they will not be getting treatment, if they happen in large numbers to live in areas where they will not be getting this water at all.</P>

      <P>I am summarising; I do not want to repeat.  All I would say, in conclusion, is that arising out of these three major objections, it would be far better if we were to have a voluntary scheme based upon pharmaceutically prepared tablets which could be distributed free to parents throughout the Republic and not merely in the city areas, and distributed for children only.  Coupled with that, and, I think, essential, is a long overdue wide extension of our school dental services.  In other words, I accept the view that fluorides represent a valuable preventive for caries in teeth, but I am convinced that the best way of applying them is not by this hit or miss non-uniform, partial <Col N="375" /> and very imperfect method here proposed, however attractive it might appear to be by its easiness and its cheapness.  I am glad to see, for the Minister's sake, I finished just as he has returned.</P>

      <P>The efforts of Ministers for Health to combat dental decay must be commended, and I should be very loath to say anything that could be taken as voicing disapproval of their efforts and their researches into ways and means of ending this serious condition.  I am not a trained scientist and my medical knowledge is very limited.  For this reason, I have taken great pains to read anything I could obtain on the use of fluorine in the prevention of dental caries.</P>
      <P>Many eminent persons trained in science, in medicine and in dental practice have made researches and reports on this subject.  I am quite sure that all these people are sincerely anxious to do everything possible to end the menance to health which arises from decayed teeth in children; yet, while there is evidence claiming that the solution lies in providing a certain regular intake of fluorine, there is also as much evidence to the contrary, the latter evidence going so far, in some cases, as to claim that fluoridation of public water supplies, even at the low rate provided for in the Bill, will eventually have a bad effect on teeth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dr. George Heard, a doctor of dental surgery, of Hereford, Texas, a town noted for the excellence of its people's teeth, made researches over the years into that condition and he came to the conclusion that the relatively high content of fluorine&mdash;1.4 <Col N="376" /> parts per million&mdash;was responsible for the excellent state of teeth in the area. As years went by, he observed that with dietary changes of the people from plain wholesome food to processed and fancy foods, tooth decay increased, in spite of the fact that they were drinking the same fluoridated water as hitherto.  He later stated that he was now fully convinced that good natural food is the preventative of dental caries.  He further said that while he believed that natural fluoride did, in a mild way, retard dental caries, he also believed the damage it does is far greater than any good it may appear to accomplish, in that it makes the teeth brittle and crumbly, so that when they do need attention, they can be treated only with difficulty, if at all.</P>
    <P>This statement is confirmed by many experienced dentists.  It has been claimed by those making researches into the subject of tooth decay that a 65 per cent.  reduction in dental caries has been achieved by the simple expedient of having children brush their teeth with a neutral dentrifice after meals.  On this point, I should like to express appreciation of the slogan now appearing on the stamp cancelling device which says: &ldquo;Teach your children to clean their teeth.&rdquo;  If children are given sufficient wholesome food and clean their teeth regularly, their teeth will take care of themselves and there will be no uneasiness with regard to side effects.</P>
    <P>Passing the windows of the Permanent Exhibition of Irish Goods in St. Stephen's Green the other day, I stopped to admire a beautiful display of Dungarvan apples when I saw this notice over them: &ldquo;In a recent large scale research by the Liverpool University School of Dental Surgery, it was found that eating a crisp juicy apple after meals is 90 per cent. effective for cleaning teeth as against 60 per cent. by using a toothbrush.&rdquo; That this pleasant method of preventing tooth decay in children is practical and can be put into operation is confirmed by a recent press report which recorded that the school health authorities in Widnes in Lancashire had arranged that an apple should be included in the <Col N="377" /> school meals of the children in their health area.</P>
    <P>We have all been shocked at one time or another by reports that, owing to a bumper apple crop, prices have fallen so low that it is not worth the growers' time to pick the fruit, which consequently has been left to rot in the orchards.  Here is a great opportunity to avoid this waste by arranging for the supply of apples to schoolchildren and encouraging their parents to do likewise, and thus avoiding dental decay, and at the same time, to give an opportunity of building up fruit-growing into a thriving industry. It could indeed be found that here we could find the preventative of dental decay in children.</P>
    <P>In my search for information as to whether the addition of fluorine to the public water supply was likely to prevent dental caries, I discussed the subject with a research worker who had studied the question over a period of years.  He said the trouble was that fluorine and fluorides and their effects are quite unknown and unpredictable. His belief was that the relationship between the low incidence of dental caries in certain areas was not entirely related to the sodium fluoride in the water supply, but to the presence of other natural factors associated with the type of water.</P>
    <P>Pressed on the question of the beneficial effects likely to follow the addition of fluorides to our water supply, I received the answer:</P>
    <P>Somehow I cannot help feeling that this method of preventing tooth decay is like a person sitting naked on the point of a harbour in a winter storm, stuffing himself with aspirin and sulpha tablets to cure his cold.</P>
    <P>Internationally-known medical men have pointed out that even the most ardent advocates of fluoridation admit that it can be effective only until dentition is complete, at 12 to 15 years. Beyond these ages, fluoridation can do no good whatever.  It seems undesirable, therefore, to add a substance to water which will benefit only about 25 per cent. of the population and <Col N="378" /> might be harmful to the other 75 per cent.</P>
    <P>Much of the food we consume contains fluoride.  Some people drink more water than others and will, therefore, consume more fluoride.  In the <i>British Dental Journal</i>, Volume 103, Number 8, Dr. C.G. Dobbs, Senior Lecturer in University College of North Wales, in an article entitled <i>The Safety of Fluorides in Water says:</i>-</P>
    <P>There is no level of intake at which fluoride changes from a toxic to a purely beneficial substance and since it is the total intake that matters, the question at issue is not the safety of fluorides at one p.p.m. but the safety of any permanent addition to the general intake of the fluoride, especially by those whose intake is already high.</P>
    <P>The dilution proposed in the Bill is very low but one cannot entirely overlook the warning of an expert.  It is known that some people are sensitive to certain drugs and other substances. There is more than a possibility that many people may suffer ill-effects from the constant use of fluoridated water. In this country, there is a very high incidence of rheumatism and allied complaints among our people.  Fluoride, as has been said, is a cumulative poison and, as such, is stored in the human frame, particularly in the bones and I think there is evidence that the substance is capable of aggravating rheumatism and similar complaints and causing greater suffering to those unfortunate enough to be afflicted with them.  These people can obtain no benefit from the fluoridation of water.  They can only run the risk of having their pains increased in a disease for which the medical profession admits they can do very little.  Has the Minister considered this aspect of the fluoridation of water?</P>
    <P>No one would want to halt the Minister in his pursuit of means to prevent dental caries and the ill-health which can arise therefrom, but the question is: is this the right way to administer the substance which he believes holds the solution?  Making the fluoride available in tablet form to those desiring and requiring it and the <Col N="379" /> education of children in dental hygiene seem better ways.  The Fluorine Consultative Council referred to the use of fluoride tablets and could see no reason why they should not give satisfactory results, though they did refer to &ldquo;practical difficulties associated with their distribution and use.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give his views on the distribution of fluoride in tablet form.  There are, unfortunately, as already mentioned, many areas in the country where there is no piped water supply.  I am sure, if the Minister is fully convinced of the value of fluoridation in the elimination of dental caries, his Department will have to make some arrangement whereby fluoride is made available to the children in these areas.  There does not seem to be any way to do this except by making the fluoride available in tablet form.</P>
    <P>If he does so and if he is able to get over the &ldquo;practical difficulties associated with their distribution and use,&rdquo; would be consider withdrawing his Bill to fluoridate the water supplies, and make fluoride tablets available, free of charge, to all those who wish to have the substance available for their children?  This would allay the uneasiness of the large number of people who are not convinced of the benefits claimed for fluoridation of the water supplies and who fear that this interference with water supplies by the addition of a toxic substance will have serious effects on the health of themselves and their children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make only one brief point on subsection 6 of Section 2.  The Minister has gone a long way towards meeting any objection that it might be a little unconstitutional to bring in such a Bill as this.  I should like to ask him to examine the position again to see if he has not gone too far in this subsection.  I feel that he has left the way open, bluntly speaking, for a crank to stop the Minister having an examination of a whole school under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There might be some reason for such a person stopping the examination before the local water was fluoridated, <Col N="380" /> but after that has been done, could a manager of a school, under this section, stop the pupils being examined? That is the point that is worrying me. Could even a headmaster of a school stop a re-examination after the water had been used for a year or two years? I feel that the Minister has gone a little too far in providing this constitutional safeguard.  I should like to hear the Minister on this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I must say that one of the main objections I had to this Bill was in relation to the question whether it should be merely permissive or whether the Minister should have power to direct the local health authority to comply with it.  The Minister, in his very lucid introduction, set my mind completely at ease on that.  If we are to have this done, then it is better that it should be done in the way the Minister has approached it, on the basis of research and a close study of the problem. The Minister indicated in the Dáil that this is being done in conjunction with the Medical Research Council so that I think the Minister has taken all proper steps in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think he would be well advised to hasten very slowly in this case.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington has done a great service to-night by putting on record a very reasoned and very detailed case showing that the matter is not all cut and dried, that it is not quite so well decided as the Minister would have us believe from his opening speech.  There are many very eminent and responsible authorities who hold against this. Apparently they are in a minority. Still, when that minority has amongst it such a distinguished person as Commissioner Ford of New York, we must pay quite an amount of attention to it.  I do not intend to weary the House with quotations.  They have already been given by Senator Sheehy Skeffington and are on record.  It urges upon us a policy of extreme caution. I hope the Minister will adopt that approach in putting this into effect.  In other words, go slowly&mdash;deal with only one or a few districts at a time and study the local effects very carefully. <Col N="381" /> More important still, those carrying out the research, the Medical Research Council and the officials of the Minister's service, will have constant reports coming in from other parts of the world as to how it is progressing, whether anything unexpected has been happening.</P>
    <P>We must realise that 20 or 30 years is a very short span.  Effects may take a long while to manifest themselves. Most of the experimental evidence is based on regions where there are natural fluorides in the water.  There may be a difference between natural fluorides in the water and the artificial injection of fluorides into a water system. I would feel very anxious in the years ahead to know what are the reports coming back from those regions that have been subjected to the artificial injection of fluorides.</P>
    <P>A policy of hasten slowly is essential. Go back a few years and recall something quite dramatic.  We might take the appearance of cortisone on the medical scene and the great relief it gave for rheumatism, for example. We find that a couple of years afterwards there were side effects that led to the discontinuance of that treatment. I do not wish to stress this too far.  The Minister has taken a very wise step in being so fully associated with the Medical Research Council in this matter.  He and his Department will show their wisdom by the reliance they place on the Medical Research Council in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>One of the big problems is the fact that so much of the country is without piped water supplies.  It seems a very crude and inefficient system that in order to get fluorides to children under 12 years of age who will benefit from the treatment, the whole water supply must be medicated.  It is held that not more than one or two gallons in every thousand are used for human consumption.  Of that, children consume no more than one-sixth or one-seventh.  Therefore, you are really using only about one gallon in every 5,000 to 10,000 that are treated.  That seems very wasteful.  Added to that is the fact that we know quite definitely it has no beneficial effect on grown-up persons.  It may even have <Col N="382" /> a bad effect but at least it is of no use to them.</P>
    <P>Even if it cost a little more it would be a safer approach if some other means could be used to give fluorides to the children.  It occurs to me that there should be no great difficulty in fluoridating the supplies to the various schools throughout the country.  A small plant, inserted in the entry water pipe and suitably designed, should ensure that the school supplies were treated.  If that were done, I feel far more children would be reached than can be reached by the present method. There must be a running water supply in at least 70 or 80 per cent. of our schools at present.  We should aim at a target of 100 per cent. as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The case has been made that, if that is not quite feasible, perhaps a tablet form is possible.  A quotation was given by Senator Sheehy Skeffington showing that this is actually in operation in New York city so we can see it is practicable, even if it costs a little more, which I doubt when you take account of the great waste of water encountered in the mass injection system.</P>
    <P>On the question of teeth care and the lack of dentists in the country it might be mentioned that we have only 700 or 900 dentists.  I hope the Minister will now make a serious effort to increase the number of dentists within the country.  If, as he says, £30,000 a year is a small cost to pay for fluoridation, no doubt he will regard an additional £30,000 a year as a very small contribution towards increasing the number of our practising dentists in the country.</P>
    <P>Speaking for our Dental School in University College, Cork, we are simply tied to an output of 12 to 14 students per annum because the facilities provided for the practical training of these students are inadequate. That can be remedied quite easily.  I believe the cost is only about another £30,000 to provide the necessary extension to the Dental Hospital. I hope that will commend itself to the Minister.  If it does, it will be a positive means of bringing better <Col N="383" /> dental care to those 50 per cent. of our children who are not likely to be reached by the present approach.</P>
    <P>I confidently appeal to the Minister, while he is in this generous financial mood, to give serious consideration to my suggestion.  Also, the capital cost involved in the present scheme for fluoridation is estimated at £100,000. If we had £100,000, we could do a mighty lot in our dental schools in Cork.</P>

Tá mé ar thaobh aon rud a dhéanfaidh aon leigheas nó maitheas d'fhiacla lofa páistí na tíre agus an dream óg atá ag fás aníos chugainn anois.

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In his remarks on the Bill Senator Burke raised a question with which I think I should deal now and I would hope that I shall be able to reassure him completely as to the effect on industry of fluoridating water.  In 1952, the British Ministry of Health sent a mission to study the fluoridation of domestic water supplies in North America as a means of controlling dental caries.  Among the points which are dealt with in their report is the effect on industrial processes of fluoridating public water supplies and this is what the United Kingdom mission reported in regard to that matter.  They said under the heading &ldquo;Effects on Industry&rdquo;:</P>
      <P>Fluorides in water, at a level of 1.0 p.p.m. do not give a taste or odour and in spite of persistent questioning we have been unable to learn of an effect on any industry, including bottling, brewing, baking, laundering and chemical manufacture.</P>
      <P>Now, that is the report of a mission which was sent by the Minister of Health for the United Kingdom to ascertain the effects.  It was not a mission which was in any way involved in a controversy about the fluoridation of water.  It was sent out to investigate on a purely scientific basis the effects of the process.</P>
      <P>The American Dental Association in November, 1956, dealing with the assertion that fluoridation may interfere with food processing said this:-</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the early years of controlled fluoridation there was some hesitancy on the part of food and beverage processors about possible bad effects on their products from changes in the water supply.  The weight of evidence now available from the experience of these industries in areas where the water contains fluorides, either as an incidental occurrence or in controlled amounts shows that there is no harmful effect from fluorides present in the water supplies in concentrations <Col N="386" /> recommended for dental health.</P>
    <P>The American Institute of Baking conducted a study in 1950 and reported, &ldquo;The addition of fluoride ion in concentrations up to 10 parts per million in the sponge and dough water has no effect upon bread quality.  Bakers in communities that plan to incorporate fluorine in the city water supplies as part of a program to reduce the incidence of dental caries should anticipate no difficulty in using such water for bread productions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is reported that Green Bay and Kaukauna, Wisconsin, have some of the largest cheese plants in the world.  Green Bay's water supply contains 2.5 p.p.m. fluorine and Kaukauna's water has 1.8 p.p.m. fluorine.</P>
    <P>It is also reported that Milwaukee breweries used deep well water containing as high as 1.8 p.p.m. fluorine before the city began to use lake water.  The following cities in Wisconsin have brewing industries and use water containing fluorides either in controlled amounts of about 1 p.p.m. or incidentally occurring at 2 and 3 p.p.m.: Rhinelander, Beaver Dam, Sheboygan, Columbus, Madison, Oshkosh, Green Bay, De Pere and Allonez.</P>
    <P>The report of the New Zealand Commission on Fluoridation has this to say:</P>
    <P>Very little evidence was made available to us in regard to the possible effects of fluoridation on industry, but Dr. Eva Hill produced as an exhibit a copy of an address delivered by her in Hastings on 8 November, 1955, in which she stated:</P>
    <P>I will briefly refer to possible detrimental effects on industry. Cordial manufacturers will be faced with a dilemna, the fluoride interfering with their processing. Canning factories and freezing works in the district, even if not using your water supply, will be under suspicion throughout the country, and sales may fall in consequence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="387" /> The Commission commented on Dr. Eva Hill's statement in these terms:</P>
    <P>In regard to this statement we think it is significant that no representative of industry appeared before us to support the views of Dr. Hill. This is particularly relevant so far as Hastings is concerned since that town has now had a fluoridated supply for some years.</P>
    <P>Our own Fluorine Consultative Council, in its report, says:</P>
    <P>No adverse effects on industrial, agricultural, horticultural or other similar processes due to the use of fluoridated water have been substantiated.</P>
    <P>I think that should dispose of any fears which may be entertained by Senator Burke or any other persons as to the effect on industry of the fluoridation process.  With regard to our great industry in this city, I may say I have received no representations from Messrs.  Arthur Guinness that this process is likely to be in any way harmful to their products.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley asked what provision we were making for dealing with the rural population.  Naturally, that is a matter to which I have given a great deal of consideration and it is not one to which I can find a very ready solution. One way in which we could do it would be to extend piped water supplies much more widely in the rural areas. If I had had my way this would now be well under way.  In 1947, I had set up a commission to consider the whole question of the extension of piped water supplies to the rural areas but unfortunately the Coalition Minister for Local Government who succeeded me in that Department scrapped that commission.  We are now perhaps 10 years behind the times.  I know my colleague, the Minister for Local Government, has the matter again under investigation.  We hope that in due course we will extend piped water supplies as widely as we have extended electricity supplies to the rural areas.</P>
    <P>We are not, however, merely relying upon something which may happen in a few years from now.  At the moment, the position is that there is intensive <Col N="388" /> propaganda going on in most schools in the country through schools medical inspections, lectures in the schools, school film shows, and so on, to make the children alive to the fact that their teeth are precious and worth preserving. In addition, we are doing our utmost to increase the dental personnel in the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and I have recently joined in an effort to provide funds for the building of a new dental hospital in the city of Dublin. That is a matter which has been under agitation for a very great number of years but it remained to us&mdash;and I think I am entitled to claim credit for the Minister for Education and myself for the fact that we have at last succeeded in removing the obstacles which prevented the building of a dental hospital&mdash;to make provision for a dental hospital in the city of Dublin adequate to meet the demands of those who are anxious to become members of the dental profession.</P>
    <P>The position in which we find ourselves in that regard in this country is very much due to the fact that it was quite impossible&mdash;I withdraw the words &ldquo;quite impossible&rdquo; and say that for many years past and even to-day the accommodation for dental students in the city of Dublin is very restricted.  It is even more restricted in Cork.  But the particular problem there had not to wait for my attention until Senator O'Quigley raised the matter here to-night. I can say that simultaneously with the decision to make provision for a new dental hospital and teaching hospital in the city of Dublin, I asked the committee in charge of the dental hospital in the city of Cork to submit proposals to me for an extension of their hospital.  We are taking what I think are unusual steps to ensure that the dental school in Cork will have an opportunity to develop even more successfully than it has done up to the present.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington expressed disappointment with the results of the effects of fluorine on general health, as evidenced by the study of the effects of fluoridation of <Col N="389" /> the water supplies in the twin towns, Bartlett and Cameron.  He was surprised that the morbidity and mortality in those two towns was more or less the same.  I am not holding out fluoride as a sort of cure-all.  I have never said it will prolong life.  I merely said it will make teeth less susceptible to dental decay and if people have good sound teeth, they are likely to enjoy good health.  A man may live for quite a while in bad health.  It will not be a very happy existence, but if he has good teeth, he he is more likely to enjoy good health and have a happier life.  As I say, I am not saying that fluoride is a cure-all. I merely say it seems to be an essential constituent for the development of good sound teeth&mdash;&mdash;</P>

But Mr. Commissioner Ford seems, in my view, to go far outside his territory.</P>

      <P>I was speaking about Mr. Ford of New York, of the water supply system of New York, and as a supplier of water, I am sure he does as good business as any water supplier in the world.  But health and <Col N="390" /> particularly dental health is not really his province, and while the waterworks of New York have rejected fluoridation&mdash;while the city of New York, I should rather put it, has not yet adopted fluoridation due to the opposition of the water supply department&mdash; the New York board of health, which, I think, are more concerned about the general health of the public and are more likely to speak with the greater authority, recommended fluoridation in 1952 and on the basis of exhaustive study, they reaffirmed their endorsement of fluoridation in 1956 as a much needed public health procedure.  If I wanted to know what I should do in order to preserve my teeth in a sound condition I would go to a dentist and if I was going to avoid certain ills, I would go to a physician rather than to a mineral water manufacturer to advise me on both these things.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>He has long ceased to be a poet.  Dr. Stralfors, who reported adversely on fluoridation in Sweden, had a great deal to say about the inadequancy of the study which had been made in America and elsewhere and was very caustic&mdash;that would not be an overstatment on what he had to say&mdash;particularly about Bartlett and Cameron.  His remarks about his scientific colleagues elsewhere, however, were mild indeed by comparison with what the majority of the members who signed this report had to say about Stralfors.  That is why I asked the Senator to read what they had to say about him.  They said this:</P>
      <P>On February 21, 1958, Drs. Sellman and Ericsson submitted to the Royal Medical Board an addendum to the report, in which these authors comment upon some of Dr. Stralfors' statements in Chapter IV of the main report.</P>
      <P>The authors supply more exact data from many of the articles quoted by Strälfors.</P>
      <P>Therefore, they find him guilty of suppression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="391" /> These data demonstrate that Strälfors' criticism of investigations supporting the safety and caries preventive effect of water fluoridation is exaggerated, while on the other hand a notable lack of criticism appears in his quotations of papers produced against the fluoridation of drinking water.  Some of Strälfors' statements are found to be purely speculative.</P>
    <P>If I were looking for an authority to support me in a case against fluoridation, I should like to have a more reliable one than Dr. Strälfors to rely upon.</P>
    <P>The question of using some alternative method to fluoridation to prevent dental caries was raised both by Senator Dr. Sheehy Skeffington and, I think, by Senator Miss Davidson and some other Senator.  I think Senator Sheehy Skeffington stressed fairly strongly that Mr. Commissioner Ford had suggested that tablets might be used as an alternative.  This is what the Expert Committee of the World Health Organisation has to say about tablets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I quoted that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall just put it on record again and I shall quote the paragraph in full:</P>
      <P>At present, the value of milk and salt for fluoride administration cannot be compared with that of drinking water, since the evidence in favour of the first two vehicles is incomplete; in particular there is a total lack of clinical evidence of their effectiveness.  On the other hand, tablets have been shown to have some positive effect although the experiments with tablets have been performed for a much shorter time and on a much smaller scale than drinking water fluoridation.</P>
      <P>Continued research on these fluoridation methods should be encouraged.  If their effectiveness, practicability, and safety of application can be satisfactorily demonstrated, they may become very valuable in regions where water fluoridation is impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="392" /> It is quite clear from this that the whole thing is in a highly experimental state and that we cannot wait, having regard to the extent which the dental survey showed of the prevalence of caries in this country.</P>

      <P>We are satisfied, says the New Zealand report, that there are weighty objections to the use of fluoride tablets.  These are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  There are no published studies on the use of tablets containing fluorides.</P>
      <P>(ii)  The obvious difficulty with this method is that it is necessary for the parent to administer fluoride to each child each day and every day for the first 8 to 12 years of the child's life.</P>
      <P>(iii)  The studies establishing the effectiveness of fluoride show that if the full protective effect of the fluoride is to be obtained the daily fluoride ration must be consumed in liquid form on a number of occasions.  This adds substantially to a mother's domestic activities.</P>
      <P>(iv)  While in individual instances the use of tablets may prove a feasible method, generally for families containing more than one child, it tends to be troublesome and spasmodic in application.</P>
      <P>(v)  It is suggested that if these tablets are used the majority of people will cease using them in adolescence and any subsequent benefit arising from the topical effect of a fluoride on the teeth would be lost.</P>
      <P>Our own Consultative Council says this:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of fluoride tablets was also considered.  No comprehensive studies have been carried out on the <Col N="393" /> value of such tablets, but assuming that adequate precautions are taken&mdash;&mdash;</P>
