    <P>Sections 1 and 2 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage, I stated that a person paying tax this year would have to pay a half year's tax on 1st January, a half year's tax in July and three months' tax in respect of October, November and December.</P>
      <P>I referred specifically to the calendar year 1960.  The Minister purported to reply to that point.  He spoke of my saying that a person would pay 15 months' tax in a year.  I said in the calendar year, 1960.</P>
      <P>I do not see any point in the Minister pretending to reply to an argument when he did not reply to it. He took the financial year 1960-61 and said he would get only 11 months' tax in the 12 months.  It was gilding the lily to imagine he would get only 11 month's tax in 12 months.  He was pushing the matter further.</P>
      <P>In his speech, the Minister three times referred to lies.  I do not see why he should twist my words.  He can look at the Official Report.  What I said is quite plain.  I referred to the calendar year 1960.  There is no answer to the case that any person who will go on P.A.Y.E. will pay a half year's tax in January or February, a half year's tax in July or August and he will pay a further three months' tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a person whose duty it is, in this context, to represent the taxpayers, I do not care if the Minister gets in only ten months' tax in the <Col N="1964" /> year owing to the creaking of the system.  That is not my function here. He can plead that if he likes.  However, he must not pretend to answer something I said and twist it when, in fact, he is not answering the point. He will not get away with it.  I do not see why the Minister should pretend to refer to the case I made which was specifically related to this calendar year and say, in effect: &ldquo;Oh, no; I am getting in only 12 months' tax in the current financial year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We had all this out on the Finance (No. 2) Bill last year.  The same kind of case was made by the Minister. There is no question that any taxpayer on a salary and subject to P.A.Y.E. will pay 15 months' tax in the calendar year 1960.  I do not mind what case the Minister makes otherwise. He can make any case he likes but he will not make such statements about my remarks on the Second Reading without protests from me.  He will not twist what I said.  As reported in the Official Report of 6th July, 1960, Column 1943, he said:</P>
    <P>Therefore, instead of Senator O'Donovan being right when he said that we will receive 15 months' tax instead of 12 months' tax, we will actually receive 11 months' tax. That is so far as the Exchequer is concerned.  Still, we are facing that and we hope things will turn out all right.</P>

      <P>With respect, Sir, I think that Section 1 went through very rapidly, indeed.  This whole part of Part 1 of this Bill refers to income tax.  I do not think it really matters upon what section the matter is raised. It is a general point about income tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Although you have ruled the Senator out of order, Sir, perhaps you will allow me to say a word in reply.  We have in these matters to talk about the financial year.  You could make all sorts of fantastic calculations if you do not stick to the financial year.  In my case, having paid income tax on 1st January and 1st July, I could claim that I paid a full year's tax in seven months.  That is the sort of case Senator O'Donovan would like to make in order to embarrass everybody.  It does not lead us anywhere.</P>

      <P>The taxpayer is not interested in whether the Minister or Senator O'Donovan is right.  What he is interested in is whether these new regulations are going to cost him more in the two years 1960 and 1961.  Could the Minister answer that specific question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If you take the two financial years, it will cost exactly the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Stanford asked was it going to cost the taxpayer as much in the two years 1960 and 1961.  In reply, the Minister speaks of the two financial years and not the two years 1960 and 1961, the two calendar years.  There is no use in the Minister trying to get away with that kind of slick answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing arbitrary about the period I took.  It is the period for the commencement of this tax.  I did not make it arbitrary.  I had nothing to do with it.  The Minister can make any case he likes but he will not twist my words.  I referred specifically to the two calendar years.  My <Col N="1966" /> exact words, at column 1848 of the Official Report, were that as far as the ordinary man was concerned on a salary or wage on PAYE, he will pay 15 months' tax in the calendar year 1960.  The Minister says &ldquo;in a year.&rdquo;  I did not say in a year; I said in the calendar year 1960.  With the introduction of PAYE, there is no question about it that in the two calendar years 1960 and 1961, the taxpayer will pay 27 months' tax.</P>

      <P>The matter should have been raised on Section 1. Senator O'Donovan was not in when the section was taken and the Chair allowed him to advance his arguments on this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Chair was quite right when nobody offered to speak on Section 1 to say that Section 1 was passed, but in the peculiar circumstances here where somebody wants to get a question asked, it could be allowed if the Minister does not mind answering it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is that we passed Sections 1 and 2 before we had opened the Bill.  That is not the Chair's fault.  The question I want to ask is in relation to the document which was circulated in connection with the introduction of PAYE.  That document shows certain allowances and I think that those allowances would have been changed as a result of the new current Bill.  There is, however, some confusion about it amongst the ordinary workers who got the document and who are trying to ascertain their position and I would like very much if the Minister would clarify the matter for me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The document, for example, shows that the allowance for each child is £133.  It seems to me that the correct figure now would be £160.  Of course, <Col N="1967" /> this document is still going round and is still being studied by the workers who are trying to ascertain their position.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of that which is called into question amongst trade unions is a comparison of the allowance.  I should like the Minister to let me have his observations.  It shows that the allowance for an unmarried person is £312 per annum, whereas for a married man, it is £525.  The comparison is made that two single persons living together would each have an allowance of £312, whereas a married man, supporting a wife, would have an allowance of only £525.  It seems, therefore, that a brother and sister, both working and living together will be on a total allowance of £624, whereas a married couple would have only £525.  I am assured that it is just as expensive to maintain a wife as it is for a sister to maintain herself.  Would the Minister say why it is supposed that to maintain a wife is somewhat easier than to maintain two single people?</P>
    <P>A third question on this which has been asked by the trade unions is in relation to the personal allowance.  It is pointed out that some workers, by reason of their work, have a very heavy wear and tear on clothing, as can be appreciated.  The purchase of dungarees does not protect the person's suit if he has dirty work, for example printers and such people.  I wonder if any provision is made to deal with the problems of special categories of workers.  What should they do about the matter?  Would the Minister say whether they should either through their trade unions or as individuals approach the income tax people to ascertain what allowances can be given to them in respect of the wear and tear of their clothing?</P>
    <P>On the question of allowances, if the Cathaoirleach will bear with me for another moment, it is suggested that employers are allowed on their contributions to chambers of commerce for income tax purposes.  I do not know whether that is true, but if it is, I think the contributions made by an ordinary worker to his trade union should also be considered.  The purpose <Col N="1968" /> roughly seems to be the same: to join together for collective protection and if it is a fact that employers can claim contributions to chambers of commerce and such like bodies for income tax purposes, the contribution of individual workers to their trade unions should similarly be allowed for income tax purposes.  I wonder would the Minister be kind enough to let me have his remarks on those three points?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures already issued for P.A.Y.E. will have to be amended where a taxpayer has children.  That is the only amendment that is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will £160 be the correct figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With one child, yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>For each child?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With one child; with five children it would be a whole lot more. In regard to the discrepancy arising between a married person and two single persons, before P.A.Y.E. came in, a married person had roughly about twice as high an allowance as a single person but now a person's earned income is amalgamated and it gives a different result.  The married person has an earned income allowance on one salary or wage but the two single persons have two salaries and therefore it usually comes to a little more than what the married person would get, on account of the earned income allowance being amalgamated.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Senator's request for a personal allowance for special clothing, these things are broached by the individual and sometimes by a group but it is preferable to the Revenue Commissioners to deal with a group.  If the Senator had any particular point to make on behalf of the trade unions, the Revenue Commissioners would be glad to hear the case made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure but it may be that an employer would be allowed his contributions to chambers of commerce. It must be remembered there is a difference between the Schedule D <Col N="1969" /> and Schedule E taxpayer.  The Schedule E taxpayer is a person receiving a salary or wage and the theory is that he gets that without any further trouble of advertising himself or anything else and therefore he is not as kindly treated as the Schedule D people because a Schedule D person must look for his living.  For that reason, he may be allowed his contributions to a chamber of commerce.  I know he is allowed subscriptions in certain cases where the Schedule E person would not be allowed them.  For instance, a professional man who is working in the Service as a civil servant and receiving a salary could not be allowed his contributions to certain scientific organisations because he has got a job and there is no more trouble as far as he is concerned.  However, the professional man who is in practice outside must keep himself up to date, must keep himself before the public and so on, and as I said, for that reason, he may get a concession of that kind, where a Schedule E person would not get it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would agree that the normal Schedule E taxpayer, a salaried or manual worker, has his particular salary and rate of pay and whatever permanent employment he has largely by reason of the action of his trade union and in that way is somewhat comparable with the businessman mentioned by the Minister. I wonder would the Minister look into the matter later on?</P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Sections 4 to 11, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 12.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 12 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>On this section which deals with the remission of entertainment duty on cinemas, I should like to make the point that it seems to be legitimate for the Minister to remit some of this tax for the <Col N="1970" /> reason that though there was a time when cinemas were making very big money and it was fair enough then to tax them and make them contribute very handsomely to the revenue, it is now obvious that for a variety of reasons, the amount of money being made by the cinema proprietors is considerably less, and therefore this is an equitable section, reducing as it does the entertainment duty.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, when the plea is made for a reduction of this tax, which has been granted by the Minister, we should recollect two points.  One is that large amounts of money were made in the past by cinema proprietors, and that consequently the poor mouth which some of them are now making is not really justified by past circumstances. The second point is that some of the falling off in revenue, for which they are being compensated in this section, is due to a past neglect of the interests of the public.  The public was not infrequently treated by the cinemas, when they were coining money hand over fist, almost with contempt.  It was allowed to queue in the rain and kept outside for longer than was justified by the numbers inside, for the purpose of putting up the price of certain seats and so on, and while recognising, therefore, that the Minister is right in making this concession, one should recall that some of the reasons for loss of revenue have been sins of commission and omission, on the part of the cinema proprietors in the past, who did not make things all that easy for the public when they were having it pretty good themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand the workings of Senator Sheehy Skeffington's mind.  We cannot tax past income. The Minister is quite right in reducing the tax on the cinemas.  The impact of television on the cinemas has meant that their income has been much reduced, while their overheads remain the same.  With regard to this question of past omissions and commissions I feel that any cinema proprietor who would keep people standing longer than necessary when he had seats inside would not be the horrible type of person Senator Sheehy Skeffington suggests <Col N="1971" /> but would be a person better locked up in a lunatic asylum because he would be refusing money.  I feel this queer sort of tangled expression of opinion on profits by Senator Sheehy Skeffington is ridiculous and the Minister is quite right.  Incidentally, chambers of commerce are not collective protection societies.  The comparison which Senator Murphy made is not as between chambers of commerce and trade unions, but as between federated unions of employers and trade unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not very much to say on this.  I think the figures would show that, over the past two or three years, the patronage has not gone down but that expenditure has gone up.  I refer to the past two or three years.  For that reason, the cinemas needed some relief.  I must say that I made the two points raised by Senator Sheehy Skeffington when I had discussions about this matter with the cinema people.  I said they had made good profits in the past, and they said those profits were gone.  I made the point also&mdash;I am not a very great patron of the cinema myself&mdash;that complaints had been made to me that the general run of the pictures shown were poor and that, for that reason, they had lost a certain amount of patronage. They admitted that, but said they could not afford in present circumstances to show better pictures. They admitted they were not as good as they would like them to be, and they said that, with further reliefs, they might be able to improve the programmes as well as cover their losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make one point on that.  The Minister quite rightly considered the point of view of the cinema proprietors.  Whatever about the cities, the position as outlined by Senator Sheehy Skeffington does not obtain in the country, and I know of no cinema proprietor who would deny a person admittance.  We all know that the advent of T.V. has made inroads on cinema attendance. As a matter of fact, I am not a cinema fan at all, but I must say, in fairness to the cinema proprietors, there were group meetings at which accounts and balance sheets for a number of years <Col N="1972" /> were produced which convinced the group meetings that the cinema proprietors had a reasonable case to make to the Minister for a remission of taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make this point clearer than apparently I did.  With regard to what I said about past neglect or even contempt of the public, what used to happen was not that the cinema proprietors kept the public out of the dearer seats by compelling them to queue for the cheaper seats, but that there were cheaper seats kept vacant in order that as many as possible would be driven into taking the dearer seats.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the imposition of duties and taxes on hydrocarbon oils.  I should like to ask the Minister if he has gone into the question of what would be the result of an increased duty or tax on petrol used for private purposes, and also whether he has gone into the question of the revenue possibilities of increasing the price of petrol, as is done in many Continental countries as a kind of gauge, as it were, of luxury or semi-luxury spending, which it is within the power of the individual to spend or not to spend; but in so far as he does spend, he contributes to revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with heavy oils duty which was taken off where they were used for industrial purposes, say, for combustion engines, and so on.  With regard to the question asked by Senator Sheehy Skeffington, I think nearly every Minister for Finance is obliged, we might say, to look at all the taxes every year to see if he can <Col N="1973" /> get more tax on any particular item. We were advised that this is as highly taxed as possible and that if it were increased we would lose and not get as much out of it.  With the present price of petrol, an increase in tax would mean that less petrol would be used and the Minister for Finance would be no better off.  I think that is roughly the position.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Sections 19 to 22, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 23.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 23 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 23 deals with death duties and Sections 23 and 24 both deal with the points I want to raise.  Section 23 deals with the Second Schedule and sets out the rates per cent. of duty on the amount.  I notice in the Second Schedule the amount now starts at £5,000 instead of £2,000 as it was previously, and that is brought about by the next section.  Section 24.  I regard the principle underlying these changes as a mistaken one. The Minister is, in fact, raising the exemption limit from £2,000 to £5,000 and the taking of duty from the estate of a deceased person will not start in future until the estate is worth £5,000.</P>
      <P>With your permission, a Chathaoirligh, I should like to mention now something that arises partly under Section 24 and partly under Section 23 Section 23 makes it quite clear that because of the Second Schedule, it starts at £5,000 now and not at £2,000 as previously.  The argument put to us in favour of this concession to the better-off sections of the community so far is that death duties act as a &ldquo;disincentive&rdquo; to saving.  I should like to question that.  I wonder is that really so?  Does a person say to himself: &ldquo;I have an estate worth £2,000, but I am not going to add to it because if I do, I shall have to pay three per cent. duty, or my heirs will when I am dead, on the third, fourth and fifth thousand pounds.&rdquo;  I do not believe he does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1974" /> Furthermore, I do not believe the duties in operation now are in any sense punitive.  I think they are entirely legitimate and I think there should be such things as death duties for redistributing usefully, by Government channels, wealth which has over-accumulated. I am not in favour of increasing the accumulation of wealth in fewer and fewer hands.  While the Minister's change is a small one, I think it is a small step in the wrong direction. I should like to examine the question of incentives to savings and disincentives to saving.  It is sometimes argued that people want to save money and leave it to their children which is true of course and legitimate.  I feel, however, that in so far as the State is doing its duty to cherish all children equally and by giving in relation to clothing, housing and education equal opportunity to all, the necessity for providing for such things for one's children by means of one's own accummulated wealth will decrease.  In other words, it should not be necessary or possible to buy privilege and advantage for one's children, in such fundamental matters as education, housing and clothing.</P>
    <P>What I would like to see is the State tackling it from the other end and making it apparent to parents in particular that there is no particluar merit in leaving large estates, and that they would be just as well to distribute them before they die.  That is a way that is now open to them to avoid death duties, and it is rather a good way.  Many parents might be encouraged to prise themselves loose from their property many years before they die and pass on their responsibilities, whether property or money, to their children.</P>
    <P>The Minister by raising the exemption is making a mistake.  After all, if the children have the merits of their parents, the best way to bring those merits to fruition is to start even with the children of other parents.  A hundred yards champion does not expect to leave his championship to his son, who if he is to become a champion, must prove his own merits.  The accumulation of wealth should be minimal and not maximal, and the Government <Col N="1975" /> should be moving in the other direction of increasing death duties and lowering the exemption limit rather than decreasing the duties and raising the exemption limit.</P>

      <P>I feel that Senator Sheehy Skeffington has put words in the mouth of the Government and of previous Governments which they did not utter or wish to utter.  He said&mdash; and I have taken a note of it&mdash;that death duties were useful for the purpose of re-distributing wealth that has over accumulated.  I do not think the Minister or any of his opposition ever said that death duties were useful for the re-distribution of wealth, rather I think that neither the Fianna Fáil Party, Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party nor any other Party ever suggested that they wished to re-distribute wealth, because in my view that is the end of our way of life; it is the end of Christian and Catholic families and the end of Ireland as we know it.  The re-distribution of wealth is not our job.  If one were to quibble over words the word over-accumulation could scarcely apply to a person dying with £5,000 which is £10 a week for ten years.</P>

      <P>I refuse to be taken off the point.  The Minister with regret said that he had to collect death duties.  The purpose was to collect £3,000,000.  It was not and I hope never will be to re-distribute wealth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why does he not give it to them before he dies?  I know a man whose father died unexpectedly.  That man was farming hundreds of acres of land and paying his employees about 25 per cent. more than the minimum agricultural wage.  The capital expenditure <Col N="1976" /> on that farm by his father over 25 years has been extraordinary.  Now it has to be sold because of death duties.  I am quite certain that that would be a subject for regret by the Minister, by the people on this side of the House, and that the prospects of re-distribution of wealth had nothing whatever to do with the law that unfortunately means that from 18 to 20 people's livelihoods are now in jeopardy.  They live now&mdash;a most rare thing in rural Ireland&mdash;happily and with security of employment and with all the things a large farm can give such as firing, free milk and so on, and a decent wage 25 per cent. better than their fellows; yet all that has to go in the name of re-distribution of wealth.  How much of it will ever come to those families when it will go through all the maw that exists and must exist in the running of the State?</P>
    <P>I was asked by Senator Sheehy Skeffington why he does not give it before he dies.  How does anybody know when he is going to die?  God forbid, but if Senator Sheehy Skeffington and I were to walk today out of the Seanad, how do we know that we would ever arrive at the bottom of the stairs?  In the last analysis, it is the employees of those businesses and farms and properties whose livelihoods would be in danger in the name of re-distribution of wealth.  The thing is of course completely against all the things this State stands for.</P>

Why should all we hold dear be imperilled by the suggestion that death duties should be increased? The Minister's statement was one which, I am sure, everybody on this side of the House would most heartily support and is what the people of Ireland think, namely, that it is most regrettable that £3,000,000 must be collected in death duties, and that if there was a way to collect that sum otherwise, the Minister would do so.  If the Minister came from this side of the House, his attitude would be the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1977" /> The suggestion has been made twice in the Seanad that these moneys should be used as a means of re-distribution of wealth.  The State, it was said, must cherish all its children equally in matters of housing, clothing and education. There must be equality.  That I think hits completely and absolutely against the Christian and Catholic family, because after all what has a man worked for 99 times out of 100 but to provide a better living for his children, and the law of the State and the law of God will see to it that if he does not work, if he drinks his earnings or gambles them away, unfortunately that will fall not only on himself but upon his children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself at variance with both the last speakers.  I think that Senator Donegan can do nothing about the re-distribution of wealth or taxation in this country because it has been going on for 30 years, and Senator Sheehy Skeffington need not be so pessimistic, because the pattern of depreciated money which we all see in our lives&mdash;exactions made on those who had money, using this money for social services, the borrowing of great sums by the State and local authorities to pay for social services, housing and repaying of them in many years' time for much less value in money, plus death duties and plus very high taxation, have effectively accomplished the transfer of wealth in my life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Death duties are not levied generally on liquid wealth.  Only a completely unknowing person would claim that they were.  Property is held when a man dies, and on that property, which is what he holds in excess of what he <Col N="1978" /> owes&mdash;there are a great many creditors to be satisfied&mdash;taxes are paid.  Great hardship has very often been imposed by this levy on property which must in many cases be sold to discharge the debts claimed on the estate.  This is a trend very slightly to improve that situation and I welcome it.</P>

      <P>At least it is evidence that we think about the subject. We have not the uniform monolithic point of view that is so prevalent in certain parts of the political set-up in this country.  I agree with the Minister about this matter.  Strangely enough, when I read Senator Sheehy Skeffington's remarks in the Official Report, Volume 52, No. 18, Column 1934, when he said:</P>
      <P>It seems to me that in this country ... class privilege has been growing up and increasing,</P>
      <P>I agree with him in general but I think he is clamping it on to the wrong target.  I would agree that in recent years class privilege has been increasing in this country, but I do not think a discussion on the question of death duties is a suitable time to attack that phenomenon.</P>
      <P>Let us consider the new rates the Minister imposed.  Let us take an estate of £200,000, a sizable private business but not an enormous business, by any means.  The rate of death duty is 50 per cent.  Therefore, £100,000 will go in death duty.  Suppose the estate goes to a single son. Then, on the next death, 40 per cent. of that £100,000 will go in death duties.  That estate of £200,000 will in a period of 30 or 40 years dwindle to only £60,000.  I think that is steep enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister absolutely in excluding from death duties estates up to £5,000.  It is socially good because the handling of these estates was greatly complicated for the people who have to deal with them.  Very often, a man will leave a sum like <Col N="1979" /> £5,000 or £10,000.  It will be represented by a shop, a farm, some shares, a little money in the bank and little pockets of money here and there.  If the people handling the estate have to put it through the Estate Duty Office, it complicates the matter greatly.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Donegan, though I do not agree with his economics. Death duties are the well-known method of the redistribution of wealth in many countries.  However, I agree with him that it is extremely hard as, for instance, in an estate of £100,000. Admittedly they are slightly lenient in the sense that the Revenue Commissioners do not value to the last halfpenny. The estate duty is £40,000. Theoretically, it is quite easy to lay your hands on £40,000 if you are worth £100,000.  It is not easy at all in fact.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be commended for this move.  Estate duties in the past in this country have been hard, though they were by no means as high as in Britain.  I remember a case some years ago when a member of the Guinness family who lived in this country died, leaving £3 million.  The estate duty pushed up the yield that year.  The estate duty was £1.3 million.  If he had lived in Britain, the estate duty would have been £2.4 million.  In other words, by living near Dublin, £1.1 million was saved to his estate.  I am glad he lived near Dublin and that that amount was saved to his estate.</P>
    <P>One does not have to have a very big business nowadays for it to be worth £100,000.  The income multiplied by a number of years' purchase is found to be the value of the estate. It is extremely hard and indeed there are all kinds of approaches.  People take out insurance policies, turn their business into companies, and so on. They do not do these things out of greed for money but in order that the business may continue afterwards. Sometimes, they are compelled to do it by harsh necessity.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be commended for bringing in Sections 23 and 24.  It is quite irrelevant to introduce something which is dear to my heart and dear to <Col N="1980" /> the heart of any reasonable person, namely that there should be better provision in this community today for education, particularly scholarships. When you compare our conditions with those in other countries, particularly in regard to higher education, it is extraordinary that 70 to 80 per cent. of the students of different countries are subsidised by the State through various forms of scholarship.  That has my sympathy.  However, it is not relevant to the problem before us.</P>
    <P>We are not so short of resources that we cannot, in a Budget of £130 million, make things relatively easy so that a person of ability will not be deprived of a higher education because his father is an agricultural labourer. That is a problem that would be quite easy to tackle.  It has not been tackled in this country.  I do not think there is much point in it now unless Senator Sheehy Skeffington wants to hang his hat on something in raising it on Sections 23 and 24, unless he wants to demonstrate that class privilege has been growing up and increasing.  I think it has.  However, this is not the right place to attack it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister probably knows from what I said on Second Reading that I am opposed to the abolition of death duties.  I welcome the easement that has been given to what I might call very small estates indeed: the lifting of the level from £2,000 to £5,000.  I do not agree with Senator Sheehy Skeffington in that criticism.  People who are not housed in corporation dwellings, the bulk of the working population, are engaged in the purchase of their houses.  When the houseowner dies, the value of the house, in all probability is about £2,000.  If he has some insurance to cover him or some superannuation benefit coming on his death the estate he would leave to his widow and orphans, though no great yield, would very definitely exceed £2,000.  I am talking now of the ordinary clerical worker or tradesman working in this city of Dublin.  I do not think Senator Sheehy Skeffington would want us to believe that such individuals are wealthy people and that their estates should be taxed when they are passing <Col N="1981" /> them on to their unfortunate widows and orphans.</P>
      <P>I heard Senator Donegan talk about the business that has to be sold out because of the impact of death duties. I referred on a previous occasion to the lack of evidence to commissions in Britain to support that sort of assertion.  We can take it that the impact of death duties is very frequently used as an excuse by heirs who do not want the responsibility of carrying on the business, who say they have to sell out because of the impact of death duties but who simply do not want to be bothered to take the responsibility or to do the hard work involved in carrying on the business of the person who has died.</P>
      <P>We seem to be discussing Sections 23 and 24 together.  As I am on my feet, may I raise a question on Section 24?  I read the section and I confess I found it impossible to understand.  I think that that will readily be understood by the House.  I turned to the Dáil debate to see if that could clarify the situation for me.  It seemed to confirm the suspicion in my mind that this section could allow the parcelling out of an estate into £5,000 lots thereby avoiding death duties.  It was clear that an astute lawyer could so arrange things that an estate of about £20,000 or very near that amount, could be parcelled out into £5,000 lots by various devices and thereby the State would not be able to collect estate duties.  I do not know if that is really the intention of the Oireachtas or of the Minister. Are we really in earnest in providing that things could be so arranged, that people could employ solicitors who would know enough about so complicated a problem as this as to be able so to arrange things that death duties in respect of an estate of almost £20,000 could be avoided, whereas the estates of other people who would not be wise to these clever arrangements would, in fact be liable to death duties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to clarify that for me.  First of all, is it really intended or not that there should be this provision in regard to the parcelling out of estates?  Am I right or <Col N="1982" /> not from reading this section and reading the debate on that section in the Dáil in supposing that is so?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem of the redistribution of wealth has arisen. I should like, if you permit me, Sir, to expose the fallacy of that by recounting an historical incident.  The fallacy is that if we divided up all the wealth of the rich, we would have plenty for all.</P>
      <P>It has been recorded, I think, that during one of the minor revolutions in France in the middle of the nineteenth century 12 revolutionaries broke into the house of the richest man in Paris, Baron de Rothschild.  They rushed into his private room and immediately demanded a redistribution of his wealth.  He took them very quietly and asked them all to sit down.  He said: &ldquo;Now, gentlemen, let us consider this as a practical proposition.  The population of France at the moment is approximately 20 million people, say. My total wealth is approximately 100 million francs and 20 into 100 goes 5 times.&rdquo;  He put his hands in his pocket, took out his francs and went to the first man and said: &ldquo;Here are 5 francs for you.&rdquo;  He went to the next man and said: &ldquo;Here are 5 francs for you.&rdquo; So he solemnly went around the 12 men.  By the time he had finished his little ceremony, they all began to wonder was it worth the trouble they had taken.  I think that this anecdote exposes the fallacy that if we divide up all the riches of the rich people and distribute them to the poor, general prosperity will result.  It is absurd.</P>
      <P>To depart from the historical to the practical, I should like to emphasise that this wealth, as Senator Donegan rightly pointed out, is living, growing, fruitful wealth.  If it is taken from its owners, turned into money and handed out in doles or whatever it may be, it becomes the dead money which Senator Sheehy Skeffington rightly attacked at our last sitting.  I think that this catchword about the re-distribution of wealth needs serious consideration by many.</P>

      <P>Might I further comment briefly on some of the points made before the Minister makes his reply on these two sections? <Col N="1983" /> I would differ very strongly from the various Senators.  I find myself closer to Senator O'Donovan.  When it is suggested by Senator Donegan, for instance, that it is a good thing for people to be allowed to buy advantages for their children by reason of their wealth, in such fields as health and education I find myself differing very strongly from him.  I do not think that these are fields in which one ought to be able to buy advantages.  I do not think that advantages in education or health and so on ought to be granted simply on the grounds of the wealth of parents.</P>
      <P>I asked Senator Donegan, but he avoided an answer, when he was saying that the whole spirit of our country was against the redistribution of wealth, what he thought about the work of the Land Commission.  Is he opposed to all the work being done by the Land Commission in breaking up big estates and dividing them?  I must take it on his speech to-day that he is totally opposed to any such notion since he would regard it as un-Irish, un-Catholic and un-Christian.</P>

      <P>A great number of people who regarded themselves as revolutionaries in this country have in Senator Donegan's eyes being wasting their time, and not only that, but flying against the principles upon which the State should be based.  I must take him up with a query when he tells us that it would be anti-Christian to attack the accumulation of wealth.  I know that Senator Donegan has a good deal more experience of agricultural matters than I have but I wonder has he any experience of trying to drive a camel through the eye of a needle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told on quite good authority that that is an easier thing to do than for a rich man to get into Heaven. Therefore, I am rather surprised to hear him suggest that the accumulation of wealth in fewer hands, the greater accumulation of money, with fewer people becoming richer and richer, is in some obscure way more Christian <Col N="1984" /> than a greater, distribution of wealth. It seems to be that some of these people are going to find themselves in an even more difficult position, apparently, having accumulated all that wealth and failed to distribute it before they die, than the camel whose ambition would be to get through the eye of a needle.</P>
    <P>The £3 million mentioned which are levied in this way at present Senator Donegan seems to think are not redistributed. I think they are redistributed in the best possible way.  I differ from Senator Stanford.  I am not prepared to accept the proposition that State revenue is simply handed out in doles and so on.  A state run democratically is presumably spending its money intelligently for the community. It may be that in particular details we would differ.  There is no question but that the £3 million raised in this way is redistributed for the benefit in general of the community at large.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan suggested that while that may be so, this is not the place to make the point but I should like to make the point that it seems to me to be just pretence on the part of such speakers as Senator Donegan to say that the £3 million are not redistributed. They are redistributed through the channels of State expenditure.</P>
    <P>I do not accept at all, of course, the contention of Senator Stanford, because nobody said just redistribute the wealth unit by unit.  What is required is intelligent and planned spending by the State, the running of a planned economy, not the handing out of a penny here and a penny there.  The fallacy which he demonstrated was a fallacy of his own creation and not of mine.  It was certainly not suggested by me.</P>
    <P>I should just like to ask the Minister one point of detail: What does he estimate will be the loss to the revenue by the implementation of Sections 23 and 24?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter how much speakers may have disagreed with Senator Donegan, he has a point.  I am also convinced that where Senator Sheehy Skeffington errs is that he is <Col N="1985" /> falling between two stools simply because of his half-way measures.  In both Houses of the Oireachtas, we believe in the profit motive.  If we do not believe in the profit motive, it is a matter of &ldquo;the profit motive or else&rdquo;. The profit motive in the past has built up many fine economies.  It has yet to be demonstrated successfully whether the &ldquo;or else&rdquo;&mdash;and I refer to socialism &mdash;will provide a comparable economy. Therefore, we may regard this argument as partly hypothetical.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the section referred to is to raise the exemption for death duty.  Any fair-minded person will agree that an estate of £2,000 is a very small unit at the present time.  I assume that if the Minister could forgo the £3,000,000 which he proposes to collect from the altered rate of death duties, he would do so.  The trouble so far as one can see is that we have not got enough monied men in this country and the pity of it is that at present, when we are trying judiciously to import capital, we cannot forgo death duties altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel I must join issue with Senator Sheehy Skeffington on some of his replies to me.  First of all, he said that I stated it was a good thing that money should be used to advantage for a child in education or health and such like.  Now, if you go back to the Rothschild story, if it were possible that the five francs per person in France could have provided every right for any child with the ability to justify it, the longest period of university education that was necessary for any height of academic brilliance, then of course you can have it any way you like.  You can have it the way Senator Sheehy Skeffington would like to have it, equal opportunity for every child, but when you come down to practice, you find, in the richest countries in the world, that the old Christian and Catholic way of the parents saving to educate the child is a good precept, an excellent one and one which we should cherish.  It is one which I cherish and which the people of Ireland, with a few exceptions, cherish.  If that parent, while paying a just taxation, cannot save and give that opportunity to that <Col N="1986" /> child, a greater opportunity than the parent who did not save, who drank, squandered and gambled, then a very sad situation has developed; but the whole precept and way of life in this hemisphere anyway is that we should have the family and if we want the family, then we must give the parent the opportunity to afford a better opportunity to his child&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Well, we marry for better or for worse.  That is the answer I give to that.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington also said that according to my sort of ideology, all the work of the Land Commission in the redivision of holdings was bad and in fact had not had the effect it should have had and that if I had my way, I would never have had it started.  To that, I answer &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;  I have examined the moneys handed to the Land Commission and I find that only a fraction of the money is devoted to land division and I think if the whole sum had been devoted to improving agriculture, it would have meant a great improvement in the wealth of the people who work on the land, of whatever station they may be.</P>
      <P>He also said that my ideology would say it is anti-Christian to attack the accumulation of wealth.  It is definitely anti-Christian to attack the just accumulation of wealth and I do not put a tooth in that.  It is as clear as a bell that it is anti-Christian to attack wealth which has been justly accumulated.  A man is entitled to that wealth.  The idea of redistribution is incorrect.

      <P>I should like to ask a question in regard to a deceased husband who leaves an estate, which may be comparatively small, to his wife and in the course of a couple of years the widow dies before the estate has been fixed up legally.  Must death duties be charged on two occasions within a few years? There is a distinct hardship here where death duties have to be charged on the death of a husband and soon afterwards on the death of his widow.  I have known cases where a business had to be sold because of a duplication of death duties within a very short time.  I should like to ask the Minister is there anything in the Finance Acts &mdash;certainly there does not seem to be anything in, this Bill&mdash;to alleviate the difficulty created on such an occasion. It would be a great thing if there were a fixed period during which death duties could not be charged on two occasions on the same property.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has ranged over the question of the redistribution of wealth which was regarded as desirable by Senator Sheehy Skeffington and, I think, Senator Murphy, but Senator Donegan was opposed to it as being anti-Christian.  I shall not go into the morals of the matter, but I am told that every Christian country all over the world has something of the kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall go on to the proposition about the £5,000.  I think Senator Murphy is right when he says he is <Col N="1988" /> not in favour of the abolition of death duties but raising it to £5,000 is advisable because it allows in people who are not really wealthy.  On the agricultural side, a farm of 30 or 40 acres, fairly well stocked, would probably be valued at about £5,000.  As Senator Murphy says, even a working man today who has bought his house, and leaves it and a life policy would probably be leaving about £2,000 worth of an estate, which was the exemption limit up to now.  So I do not think it can be argued that we are going into the realm of wealth when we make the exemption £5,000.  It must be remembered&mdash;Senators may not beaware of this&mdash;that if the estate is more than £5,000, death duties will be paid on the lot.</P>
    <P>If we take an estate of £25,000&mdash; where there can be no dispute about the amount being near the limit&mdash;they will pay on £25,000, not on £25,000 less £5,000.  Another argument which was not used so much today is the argument that the abolition of death duties would attract wealthy people to the country.  That matter was not raised today and, therefore, I shall not deal with it.</P>
    <P>So far as revenue is concerned, the effect of this provision will be that, if we take the year as a normal one, of the number of estates which would be liable for death duties, more than half will be relieved from that tax.  It must be apparent to Senators that, comparatively speaking, the administrative expenses of collecting this duty on the smaller estates is much higher than it is on the big estates.  We have, in recent budgets, been moving in the direction of removing charges where the cost of collection was abnormally high.  In this Finance Bill, we have abolished the duties on licences for tobacco because it hardly paid to collect them.  We are also simplifying the liquor licences in order to make the collection very much easier.  We shall collect less, of course, but proportionately at least it will pay us better.  There will be a net loss, of course, but, as I say, proportionately it will be better.  In the same way here, there will be an administrative saving by getting rid of these smaller estates.</P>
    <P>I was asked what the cost would be. The cost is estimated this year at <Col N="1989" /> £50,000.  The full cost of a provision of this kind does not fall upon the Exchequer for about four years because as Senators are aware, estates are rather slow in being cleared up.  In about the fourth year, this provision will cost about £200,000.  On the other hand, the yield is moving up because estates are becoming more valuable.  To go back to the exemption on a 50 acre farm, 25 or 30 years ago, a 50 acre farm, fairly well stocked, would be valued at a lower figure than it would be valued at the present time. That applies to estates and every other type of property as well.</P>
    <P>I was asked a question by Senator O'Donovan as to whether in a case where a husband dies and leaves his estate to his wife and she dies soon afterwards, she has to pay the full amount.  There is some relief, if the death takes place within five years.  I must confess I am not able to answer precisely what the relief is, but some consideration is given in such a position. I would be able to give more information on another occasion, if I were asked.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question asked by Senator Murphy, it is possible to get relief on more than £5,000.  I must say I was not very clear on this until the Bill was going through the Dáil or, indeed, I might have tried to deal with it before bringing in this relief, but that can be done at another time.  This is a very intricate business and one would want to be a lawyer or an auditor to explain it fully.  There is, first of all, a difference between settled and unsettled estates.  If a man settles a certain amount on himself for his own lifetime and then it goes to his wife, that is treated separately from what he leaves in his will, and will come under the £5,000 duty exemption.  There are different categories under which a person might be exempted.</P>
    <P>The settlement might not be made by the man himself but might be settled on him by his father, and he passes it on after his time.  Theoretically, one could have three amounts each under £5,000 and all would be exempted, but that would be very unusual and, of course, it is not within a person's own power to do that.  He would have to be in the position first <Col N="1990" /> of all of having had money settled on him and then it is within his power, it is true, to manipulate his estate in such a way that he could get exemption on the two amounts of less than £5,000.</P>
    <P>As I say, I was not as familiar as I could be with the matter.  It was said in the Dáil that that could go on <i>ad infinitum</i> but that is not true. There is a limit.  I believe there is one other case which I was told about but it was so remote a possibility that I did not take notice of it.  As I say, I was not as <i>au fait</i> with all that business until it was being discussed in the Dáil or I might have tried to deal with the question, but there will be another opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is the correct place to raise the point that was raised in the Dáil on this section, and to which the Minister promised to give consideration.  I refer to the Dáil Debates of 22nd June, column 215, Volume 183.  Deputy J.A. Costello raised a point on this section dealing with deduction of income tax from dividends by companies which get some taxation relief on account of exports. An amendment was tabled by Deputy Costello which was ruled out of order, and the Minister stated that he would look into it.  I should like just to raise the point again.  As the Minister has promised to consider it, perhaps it might be no harm to remind him of that promise and to bring it to his attention very shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It all arises out of the relief of taxation on exports under the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act of 1956, under which income tax and corporation profits tax earned on money received for goods exported out of the State are exempt from income tax.  Any companies which gave that concession deduct from the dividends of their shareholders that relief, and therefore the shareholder pays income tax on the <Col N="1991" /> net rate which the company pays. That, I am told, is the law today.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, on debentures, the company is entitled to deduct income tax at the standard rate, so that in that case the benefit in the relief gained by the profit on the exports goes into the pockets of the company and not into the shareholders' pockets.</P>
    <P>Under the Companies Act of 1959, provision has been made for redeemable preference shares, and a number of people in the commercial world are anxious that shares of that kind issued in the future should be treated in the same way as debentures and not in the way of ordinary preference shares for the purpose of deduction of income tax.  The suggestion is that the law might be amended to allow redeemable preference shares to be issued in future from which the income tax to the shareholder would be deducted at the standard rate, although the company itself might be paying a lower rate of income tax on account of this exemption from income tax in respect of exports.</P>
    <P>The advantages in favour of that are, in the first place, that the company would retain more of its profits for investment and development, that the point of this exemption is to benefit the company rather than the individual shareholder and to enable the company to build up reserves and to invest money accumulated in that way for the purpose of increasing its exports.</P>
    <P>The second advantage is that the present method of deduction does give preference shareholders an entirely unreasonable yield on what is invested, that if they have bought shares on the basis of 6 per cent. preference share, after income tax is deducted at less than the full standard rate, they are actually getting more than 6 per cent. on their money, which is an uncovenanted benefit to which they really have no claim.</P>
    <P>Finally, no injustice would be involved to any existing shareholders as a result of the change, because the suggestion I am making is that there <Col N="1992" /> should be provision for future issues of preferential shares on this basis and that they should for this purpose be treated as debentures rather than as ordinary preference shares.  The Minister promised to look into the matter when Section 30 was being debated in the Dáil, and I now remind him of his promise.</P>

      <P>The Senator is quite right.  I did undertake to look into this question and I had given some cursory examination to it when the amendment was put down.  It is an extremely complicated business.  I should say, of course, that the company is quite entitled to retain the profits and not distribute them at all if they wish but that is not a satisfactory answer to the Senator.  If dividend are paid, there are many difficulties in the present system.  I am having the matter examined to see if we could get over them in any way, because naturally we would like to get rid of what may appear to be rather restrictive practices which we have at the moment, but there are difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say one or two words about the nature of the Minister's reply to some of the points I made on the last day.  It looks very polite of the Minister in his reply to say that he would try to deal with the points made, but the fact was that in the four or five of my points he replied to, he did not deal with what I said. To take an example, I said in Column 1842 of Volume 52, that there had been in the previous year an increase of £45,000,000 in the gross State debt, and the Minister turned this into something entirely different, by saying at Column 1940: &ldquo;Senator O'Donovan <Col N="1994" /> started by drawing attention to the fact that spending this year of £45,000,000 was the largest ever for the capital programme.&rdquo;  I said nothing of the sort, and there is no connection whatever between those two matters, or if there is, it is extremely tenuous. Similarly with a number of others. However, that was the worst example.</P>
      <P>My main point about this Finance Bill this year and the proposals for the raising of taxation to meet expenditure is that the Minister and all the people who have been talking with him are just whistling to keep up their courage. Since I spoke, there have been two further examples.  The Chancellor of the Exchequer is leaving his office in Britain.  That was something which was said earlier.  I am afraid people generally are putting a certain construction on it.  Then we have the announcement this morning that the British Government will raise £300 million for two years at 5½ per cent. at 99, surely a fantastic rate of interest. Its result here will be that if the Minister goes looking for a loan, he also will have to pay a fantastic rate of interest.  There is no use in the Minister saying, as he did, that he prefers the Central Bank version of matters to mine.  I would prefer it myself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to confirm an Order which I have made under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, on the recommendation of the Fair Trade Commission, relating to trade practices affecting the supply and distribution of carpets, carpeting and floor rugs.</P>
      <P>There are three principal manufacturers of machine-made woollen carpets. Navan Carpets, Limited, who are the largest manufacturers, make Axminster carpets.  Youghal Carpets, Limited, also manufacture Axminster carpeting.  Kincora Carpets, Limited, produce Wilton carpeting as well as Axminster and Brussels carpets.  The Navan company's policy has been to distribute direct to the retail trade where it is economic to do so and to supply the balance of the retail trade through their wholesalers.  Up to 1958 Kincora Carpets, Limited, supplied wholesalers, but in April of that year they decided to distribute exclusively to the retail trade.  Youghal Carpets, Limited, adopted a distribution system similar to that of the Navan company. Sales through wholesalers by the Navan and Youghal firms have been somewhat less than 50 per cent. of their total sales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1954, the Fair Trade Commission made fair trading rules relating to the supply and distribution of carpets. These rules provided, <i>inter alia</i>, that in the application of his conditions of supply a manufacturer should not discriminate between traders in the same class and that the conditions should not be unreasonable or be operated in such a way as unjustly to exclude new entrants to the trade.  After the coming into operation of the rules, certain firms engaged in the wholesale trade in floor coverings represented to the Commission that the conditions of Navan Carpets, Limited, particularly those relating to the size of orders, were beyond the competence of prospective new entrants.  To facilitate all parties, the Commission subsequently made revised fair trading rules which came into operation on 1st April, 1958. The new rules provided, <i>inter alia</i>, for quantitative limits to the purchases which a manufacturer might require a wholesaler to make as a condition of <Col N="1996" /> supply.  However, renewed representations were made to the Commission by the complainant wholesalers that they were still unable to obtain supplies of carpets from the Navan company. Subsequently, this company filed with the Commission a statement of terms and conditions which, though showing a considerable relaxation in requirements concerning the size of orders, retained a number of other conditions which seemed to be in defiance of the rules.</P>
    <P>About the same time, Kincora Carpets, Limited, decided to withdraw the wholesalers' discount and the esablished wholesalers represented to the commission that, as the Kincora firm were the sole manufacturers in this country of Wilton carpeting, their action was a breach of the rules in that it unreasonably and unjustly eliminated wholesalers from the trade in this type of carpet.  The Commission decided that the appropriate way of dealing with these representations was to hold a public inquiry.</P>
    <P>At the inquiry a number of wholesalers stated they were unable to enter the wholesale trade in home-produced carpets because of unreasonable conditions prescribed by the largest manufacturer.  One of the wholesalers considered it unfair that they should be excluded from the carpet trade because they handled other products. The complainant wholesalers agreed that it was reasonable for a manufacturer to specify that a wholesaler should have a showroom but they regarded it as unwarranted interference for him to prescribe minimum showroom space and to indicate the details of fittings and shelves.  The condition requiring wholesalers to employ fitters and sewers was thought to be unreasonable on the ground that the retailer is the obvious person to provide this service for the consumer.</P>
    <P>The requirements to give an initial order of 10,000 square yards, valued at from £12,000 to £15,000, and to guarantee an annual intake of 20,000 square yards, valued at from £24,000 to £30,000, were considered to be not alone unreasonable but impossible for a wholesaler since he would have to test the market and build up his trade gradually.  The wholesalers accepted <Col N="1997" /> that it was reasonable to insist that orders should be of a certain minimum size but they considered that the requirements should not exceed 1,500 square yards for an initial order and 6,000 square yards for the annual intake.  It was the view of the wholesalers that it was unreasonable to require that all orders should be equal in size to the initial order.</P>
    <P>In their report of the inquiry, the Fair Trade Commission express the view that a manufacturer is not justified in specifying that a wholesaler must deal exclusively in carpets nor is he justified in denying supplies to a wholesale firm which has only a remote connection with a retailer of carpets.  In the commission's opinion a manufacturer may legitimately require a wholesaler to have a showroom but it is not necessary that he should specify a minimum size or any other minimum requirements.  The commission considers that a manufacturer should not insist on the provision of making-up facilities as a condition of entry to the wholesale trade.  It is the view of the commission that the requirement imposed by Navan Carpets Limited, to place an initial order costing about £15,000 and guarantee an annual intake costing £30,000 is unreasonably onerous.</P>
    <P>The terms and conditions of Youghal Carpets, Limited, were regarded as reasonable by the complainant wholesalers and the commission agree with that view.</P>
    <P>At the time of the public inquiry, Kincora Carpets.  Limited, were no longer supplying wholesalers and marketed their products exclusively through retailers.  As the purchases of the three established wholesalers from this manufacturer in recent years did not come anywhere near the requirements specified in the manufacturers' conditions, the commission consider that the company's decision to supply exclusively to the retail trade was not unreasonable.</P>
    <P>The Commission consider that the conditions prescribed by one of the manufacturers has the effect of excluding, without good reason, new entrants to the wholesale trade in carpets. <Col N="1998" /> They recommend, therefore, that an Order should be made requiring a manufacturer to lodge with the Commission a statement of his terms and conditions of supply and providing that, if a prospective wholesaler does not agree that the conditions are reasonable, the Commission should examine the position and should have power to require the manufacturer to make whatever alterations in the conditions may be prescribed by the Commission. The Commission also recommend that a manufacturer should be required to apply his terms and conditions in an equitable manner to all wholesalers seeking supplies.</P>
    <P>As Senators will be aware, I have made an Order to give effect to the recommendations contained in the Commission's report.  The Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953 provides that an Order of this kind shall not have effect unless it is confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas.  The Bill now before the House is the Confirmation Bill which is necessary to give the force of law to the Order.</P>
    <P>In the case of Confirmation Bills of this kind, the arrangement is that the Order which it is proposed to confirm would not be capable of being amended by the House but would be accepted or rejected as it stands.  The matters dealt with in the Order have been the subject of a detailed Public Enquiry by the Fair Trade Commission and the arguments in favour of adopting the provisions embodied in the Order are set out in the Commission's report.  I have no hesitation in commending to the House this confirmation Bill which, on enactment, will, I hope, put an end to unfair restrictive practices in the trade in carpets.</P>

      <P>I should like briefly to welcome this Order on restrictive practices in this trade.  I think the Minister is acting quite rightly and I think the Commission reported admirably on the situation.  Of course, this refers to only one trade.  The pattern has been found in other trades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The restrictive practices to which the Minister referred have had as their aim to keep trade as far as possible in the hands of a privileged little circle, <Col N="1999" /> the test for admission to which has largely been wealth.  The Order quite rightly tries to put an end to that and tries to ensure fair play for all in the trade, whether they be wealthy or not. It attempts&mdash;I think it will probably be successful&mdash;to stamp out this type of unfair method of establishing and maintaining quite unwarranted privileges in the hands of very few, in this case the particular trade referred to. I welcome this Order as being very emphatically in the public interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a simple Bill which proposes to introduce into the law, governing the treatment of offenders, a number of minor changes which experience has shown to be desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first of these is the grant of parole to convicted prisoners.  The necessity for making such an amendment of the law was first borne in on me shortly after I took office when an application for parole was made by a prisoner whose mother was dying and had expressed a wish to see her son. The circumstances were so tragic that I decided to grant the application although I was advised that I had no statutory authority to do so and that if the prisoner chose not to return to prison after a temporary release there would be no way of compelling him to return.  In fact, this prisoner did return when the period of parole expired. Later, I had similar cases brought to my notice and I decided that it would be a good thing and in the interest of the rehabilitation of prisoners to have a power of parole for special cases.  I intend to use the power sparingly but, perhaps, in time it may be possible to extend it to selected prisoners serving long sentences <Col N="2000" /> where this would be likely to help to rehabilitate them in society.  I may consider granting it also to selected prisoners at Christmas.  I shall feel my way as I go along and the extent to which parole is granted will depend on how the early cases honour their parole.</P>
    <P>Secondly, parole facilities are being provided for criminal lunatics who are not regarded as dangerous to themselves or to others.  In this case no more is involved than extending to criminal lunatics what can already be done for other mental patients at the discretion of the Chief Medical Officer of the hospital concerned but, in the case of criminal lunatics, it has been considered advisable to require the consent of the Minister for Justice to the grant of parole.  As in the case of some prisoners, parole will be granted to mentally afflicted persons for short periods to enable them to adjust themselves to conditions in the outside world before their final discharge.  For some patients, perhaps, it might not be too much to say that temporary releases of this kind will go a very long way towards eventual restoration to full mental health.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to ensure that those released on parole can be compelled to return and the relevant provisions are contained in sections 5, 6, and 7 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill is designed to help to relieve the present position of having the criminal lunatics now in district mental hospitals concentrated in the hospitals near Limerick, Portlaoise and Mountjoy Prisons.  Under the present law criminal lunatics must be sent to the district mental hospital in the area in which they are liable to be confined in prison: the provisions of Section 8 will enable a criminal lunatic to be sent to any district mental hospital.  It is being provided, in addition that any criminal lunatic may be sent to the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, and be transferred from there to any district mental hospital. These provisions are in the interests of both the patients and the hospital authorities.  The patients can be located in institutions nearer to their homes and relatives.  Those of them whose treatment requires reasonable <Col N="2001" /> freedom of movement within an institution but who are prone to escape can be transferred to an institution such as the Central Mental Hospital where adequate precautions can be taken.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions of the Bill are concerned with the treatment of young offenders.  The object of these provisions is to keep young offenders who may not yet be set in their ways from association with habitual criminals. Section 9, for example authorises the Courts to remand young offenders in custody to a remand institution, with their consent.  For girls, the remand institution will normally be a convent. Not a great many are involved, just a couple at a time up to a maximum of about 30 a year.  I am indebted to His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin, whose interest in youth problems needs no stressing on my part, for having kindly arranged to have St. Mary Magdalen's Asylum, Seán MacDermott Street, made available as a remand institution.  I have no doubt that other convents will be willing to accept girls on this basis also.  Only a very few girls of other religious denominations are remanded in custody but I shall be glad to co-operate with the Church authorities concerned with a view to providing similar facilities for these girls as far as may be practicable.</P>
    <P>As regards a remand institution for youths, the question of adapting portion of St. Patrick's Institution for the purpose is under active consideration. St. Patrick's is, of course, the Institution for youths sentenced to Borstal detention and also for youths between sixteen and twenty-one years of age who have been sentenced to imprisonment but who have been transferred to the Institution under the provisions of section 3 of the Prevention of Crime Act, 1908.  Since 1956, when the Institution was transferred from Clonmel to Dublin by my predecessor it has been the practice to transfer to St. Patrick's virtually all prisoners under 21 and now, out of a total population of about 91 youths only 36 are Borstal detainees undergoing the prescribed minimum sentence of two years.  The remainder are serving short sentences, usually for not more than three months.</P>
    <P>The Bill recognises this situation by <Col N="2002" /> authorising the Courts to sentence young offenders between 16 and 21 years direct to St. Patrick's instead of to prison.  It also proposes to drop the use of the term &ldquo;Borstal&rdquo;, although the power of the Courts to send offenders to detention in the Institution for a minimum period of two years, in the same circumstances as offenders can at present be sent to Borstal, is being preserved.</P>
    <P>General criticism of our prison administration does not make sufficient allowance, on the one hand, for the practical difficulties that have to be faced and for the need for detention to act as a deterrent and, on the other, for the solid good work that is being done by the staff of St. Patrick's and the voluntary workers who have interested themselves in the work of rehabilitation.  The youths in St. Patrick's are kept fully occupied from day to day; many of them receive instruction in useful crafts; they have facilities for healthy recreation, both indoor and outdoor; they have lectures of an educational or religious character; a most enthusiastic Visiting Committee and Welfare Association interest themselves in the youths practically individually; and, what is of importance, too, there is a full-time Catholic Chaplain and a Church of Ireland Chaplain to advise them and to minister to their spiritual needs.</P>
    <P>Whatever defects the Institution may have, I have no doubt that the efforts of all concerned in its day-to-day administration go a long way towards overcoming them.  I am satisfied that a proper balance is being maintained between the discipline which is essential in any institution&mdash;but particularly in an institution where most of the inmates are young men many of whom have been convicted several times of serious crimes, including crimes of violence&mdash;and the humaneness which must be extended to fellow-creatures whose offences, in many cases, are due, in part at least, to bad environment or bad upbringing or lack of education or mental retardation.  Many glowing tributes to the work being carried on in St. Patrick's and to the manner in which the buildings have been adapted to institutional needs have been paid <Col N="2003" /> by visitors with experience of such institutions abroad.</P>
    <P>Of course, in an ideal situation where cost need not be counted, young offenders, youths and girls, would be classified into three or four or more categories, for example, remands, short-term offenders, long-term offenders, maladjusted offenders, etc., and separate institutions including some of the &ldquo;open&rdquo; type, established for each separate category in various parts of the country.  The cost of doing so would be entirely extravagant in relation to the number of offenders concerned in this country.</P>
    <P>At present the prison service costs the taxpayer around £4,200 a week or £220,000 a year for keeping a daily average of 475 prisoners.  This cost would be enormously increased if a number of new institutions, with separate staffs and amenities, were established. And, apart from cost, the number of persons likely to be sent by the Courts to the institutions might easily be so low as to make it impracticable to run them at all.  For example, over the last ten years the daily average of Borstal detainees has not exceeded 24.  In these circumstances it would be hard to contemplate establishing an institution exclusively for such offenders.</P>
    <P>All this is not to say that I do not realise the importance of trying to ensure that a period spent in detention will help to turn the offender away from the path of crime.  But it would be wrong to ignore the difficulties I have referred to or the amount of good work which is being done, quietly, in this respect by people who are determined to make the best use of the existing facilities.  To a large extent St. Patrick's Institution is still in a development stage and it will not be possible to assess its worth until experience has been gained of the operation of the provisions of section 13 of the Bill, which allow the Courts to send offenders direct to it.  It would be premature to consider major changes of an administrative character before such a review takes place.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to express the hope that the modest <Col N="2004" /> reforms which the Bill proposes will meet with the approval of the House and that the Bill will come into force with the least possible delay.</P>

      <P>I should like to say that we on this side of the House welcome the Bill and particularly the introduction of the parole clause.  It seems extraordinary that, in 1960, there was no clause which enabled the appropriate Minister, the Minister for Justice, to parole a prisoner for the humane reasons outlined, or any similar reason.  It is only in accord with normal living in civilised countries that there should be such a provision and while it was extraordinary that none existed, I think the Minister was quite right in allowing that prisoner home to see his mother before she died.  The Minister was placed in a situation where he had to take a personal risk which could react against him even from the point of view of questions being asked in the other House.  In my view, it would have been wrong for him not to have taken that risk.  I must congratulate him on doing that.</P>
      <P>His most instructive and very reasonable statement on St. Patrick's we welcome also.  The situation is very difficult.  There are these delinquents, and particularly in the city of Dublin the situation has become such that crimes of violence are not unusual.</P>

      <P>Dublin, is the largest city in Ireland, and there are usually greater numbers in the larger cities than in the smaller towns.  As I was saying, the position is very difficult inasmuch as there are these delinquents who have perpetrated crimes of violence and with whom it was necessary to be tough.  At the same time, we must have regard to their youthfulness and to the hope that even the most hardened among them may turn away from what they have been doing, and <Col N="2005" /> become proper and useful citizens.  For that reason, I think that the underlining by the Minister, not only of the discipline necessary in St. Patrick's, but also of the welfare committees and the attempts at rehabilitation was a proper and fair approach to the problem.  I think these minor changes were necessary and I am glad they are being put through.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Connolly O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in this Bill against which anyone can speak, with the exception of one section.  The rest of the Bill wins the approval of all but there is one section in the Bill which aroused my indignation.  I think it was thoughtlessness that caused it to be inserted, because I do not think any adult person in this country is unaware of the connotation of St. Mary Magdalen's Asylum.</P>
      <P>There is no corrective institution in Ireland for girl delinquents.  When they go before a court and are found guilty of the offence with which they are charged, there is only one course open &mdash;they must be sent to prison.  There is no provision for them such as there is for boys.  This Bill is concerned in one section with removing the stigma of &ldquo;Borstal boy&rdquo; from male juvenile delinquents.  That is right because after all &ldquo;Borstal&rdquo; is an internationally known term and carries with it a certain stigma.  In Section 9 of this Bill, the Minister proposes that we permit unconvicted girl delinquents to be sent to St. Mary Magdalen's Asylum until they come up for trial, and any girl delinquent before she is convicted will be legally committed to St. Mary Magdalen's Asylum and suffer for the rest of her life the stigma of having at one time been an inmate of that asylum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is any member of this House who is ignorant of what the stigma would mean to a girl if she had mended her ways, if she had been corrected and was leading a normal and upright life, and had to spend the rest of her life in the fear and terror of being charged with having in her youth been an inmate of St. Mary Magdalen's Asylum.  I think to a girl when she becomes an adult the stigma of having been a &ldquo;Magdalen&rdquo; is even <Col N="2006" /> greater than would be the stigma of having been a &ldquo;Borstal boy&rdquo; for a boy delinquent when he becomes an adult.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides that a girl will have the choice, when she is being remanded, of going to prison or to St. Mary Magdalen's Asylum but the girl juvenile delinquents who go before a court may choose to go to the asylum under the nuns rather than go to prison while they are on remand, not knowing, not realising how the term &ldquo;Magdalen&rdquo; can work against her in after life.</P>
    <P>If I were asked to advise girl delinquents, no matter what offences they were charged with, whether to go to prison on remand, or to go to St. Mary Magdalen's Asylum on remand, I would advise them wholeheartedly to choose prison, because I think having a record of having been in prison as a juvenile delinquent would not be so detrimental to the after life of the girl as to have it legally recorded that she was an inmate of St. Mary Magdalen's Asylum.</P>
    <P>I think it was through thoughtlessness only that, when the Minister was looking for some place to put these girls, instead of prison, he allowed himself to accept that asylum and did not consider all the implications of sending them there, while on remand. I hope that now I have brought the point home to him, he will find some other convent, or establish a St. Brigid's, as a sister institution to St. Patrick's for these girls while they are on remand.</P>

      <P>My remarks on this Bill will be very brief because it is a measure which does not lend itself to long discussion.  I must say that while I have a certain amount of sympathy with the point of view put forward by Senator Mrs. Connolly O'Brien as to a stigma being attached to young girls who are sent to St. Mary Magdalen's Asylum, I am afraid the Senator overlooks the fact that no young girl can be sent there without her consent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOBrien" hpid="Mrs. Connolly O'Brien Mrs. Connolly O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Connolly O'Brien</NameTxt>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;so I think the position is not as the Senator represents it to be.  After all, there must be some place of detention for such young girls who are remanded in custody for whatever time is thought to be necessary.  However, the Minister is perhaps better able to deal with this question than I.  I do not know whether it would be possible to find alternative and more suitable accommodation, but perhaps it will, as time goes on.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because I think it represents a more enlightened and a more humanitarian outlook on this question of criminal justice.  There is an awareness now obviously that it is not merely the idea to administer punishment to offenders of the type envisaged in this Bill that is to be the criterion, but also to do something towards the correction and rehabilitation of the people concerned.  When the major statutes dealing with criminal justice were passed, the conditions of life were dissimilar to what they are now.  We are living in a more enlightened age and therefore we have to deal with these problems on that basis. As regards the young offenders, they are a special problem in themselves. It is right to say that in many cases these young offenders find themselves where they are because of their upbringing, because of lack of parental control, and negligence on the part of their parents.  That must always be taken into consideration.</P>
      <P>The elimination of the word &ldquo;Borstal&rdquo; is a step in the right direction.  That word has been handed down to us from other days, but at the same time, it must be admitted that the Borstal idea was a good one as far as it worked.  The only thing that can be said is that the young people who are committed to that institution are not kept there long enough, but probably that is due to circumstances over which we have no control, because, as the Minister said, there are only a very few people committed to that institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our present system as a whole is a reasonably good one, no matter what criticisms may be levelled against it. There is a way of ascertaining whether <Col N="2008" /> the system is working properly or not, through the medium of the visiting committees, and as far as I am aware there have been no recent complaints about the way in which prisoners are being treated in the prisons.  As I said, this is a Bill which does not lend itself to much discussion.  I welcome it because I think its provisions are the product of enlightened thought and consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VictorCarton" hpid="Mr. Carton Mr. Carton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carton</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ó Ciosáin has skated over a very important point.  A girl chooses where she will go&mdash;to prison or to this home&mdash;but in fact she does not know what she is choosing. That is Senator Mrs. Connolly O'Brien's point.  The Bill is tremendously welcome, but for that point, and the Minister should answer it and give great thought to it.  It is the most significant part of the Bill and requires profound and serious thought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all agreed that the concern on, the part of the Minister and the Government which has prompted the introduction of this Bill is a very good thing and something to be welcomed.  I have said before in the presence of the Minister's predecessor on the Appropriation Bill that we should have a far more radical change in our penal code.  I welcome this Bill as at least a valuable first step towards that.  I have always felt that in this country where many of our leaders, to their credit, have known the inside of jails, we have been very slow to change the conditions about which first-hand experience should have made us more compassionate in relation to the ordinary prisoner.  The Minister in introducing this Bill is going very much in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the kind of reform that is required, and his own stressing of the introduction of parole facilities was a very valuable symbol of the spirit in which this kind of reform of the penal code is being tackled, because, to my mind, one of the most valuable things you can give a prisoner is trust.  It is one of the most reforming things you can give him.  It may occasionally be abused but that is very rare indeed. The Minister is certainly to be commended for laving emphasis on the value of allowing prisoners out on <Col N="2009" /> parole and giving them this very precious gift of official trust.</P>
    <P>The Minister threw out some figures, and some of them were startling.  I noticed that it costs £10 a week to keep a prisoner.  I think I am right in saying that, because he mentioned 400 prisoners and £4,000 a week.  I wonder are we as a State getting full value for that, or is it, owing to antiquated buildings and equipment, being wastefully spent.  Could we or the prisoners get better value for that £10 a week? There are other places where they could stay for £10 a week and have a much more entertaining time than can be afforded to them for that figure at present.  On the other side, is good value being given to the citizens?</P>
    <P>I should like to come briefly to details of the Bill.  First, Section 1 gives a definition of remand institutions, but the definition is not so illuminating because it refers simply to any institution which the Minister may approve.  I should like to ask the Minister what kind of characteristics he will seek in an institution before he will give it his approval and recognise it as a valid remand institution.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the point raised by Senator Mrs. Connolly O'Brien and supported by Senator Carton.  This is the question of the choice put to a girl who might perhaps be charged with petty pilfering, shop-lifting or something of that kind, of going to a Magdalen Home or jail while on remand&mdash;that is to say, a person who is presumed to be innocent.  I feel (a) that the choice is not a very full choice, and (b) that, as Senator Carton has said in reply to Senator Ó Ciosáin, the girl might not by any means realise all the implications of the choice.  It might be put up to her in particularly nice terms:&mdash;&ldquo;Would you rather go to jail or to the nuns?&rdquo;, without even mentioning what type of convent is in question.  The Magdalen Homes might treat her with every consideration and compassion, but, as Senator Mrs. Connolly O'Brien has mentioned, it is a label that may well matter in her life, just as the word &ldquo;Borstal&rdquo; would matter in the life of a boy.  Therefore <Col N="2010" /> I should like to add my support to what has been said in that matter.</P>
    <P>Section 3 refers to criminal lunatics. There is no definition of a criminal lunatic, and I should like to make the suggestion that there is no such thing.  I do not think a lunatic can be regarded as a criminal, and I feel that for criminality to be there, there must be responsibility, and lunacy is the lack of just that thing.  I am not happy about the use of that term.  The Minister is changing the word &ldquo;Borstal&rdquo;, and his Department might well set about seeing whether it could recommend a happier phrase than &ldquo;criminal lunatic&rdquo;.  It is, in a way, an unfair term.  It seems unfair to attach the label &ldquo;criminal&rdquo; to a mentally ill person.  Therefore, although a word may be convenient and we may be aware of what is meant, I feel &ldquo;criminal lunatic&rdquo; is a term that might with advantage be replaced.  The minister might perhaps be willing to give that matter consideration or to give us his opinion on it.</P>
    <P>I notice in Section 9 (2), page 4, that a person shall not be detained under this section or under section 10 of this Act in a remand institution which is conducted otherwise than in accordance with the religion to which the person belongs.  It sometimes arises that there is no equivalent institution of a religion or no religion to which the person adheres.  Sometimes it is not found possible to find an equivalent Protestant or a Jewish institution. What is the Minister's view on what can be done if the provisions of subsection (2) are to be maintained?</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the abolition of the word &ldquo;Borstal&rdquo;.  It is only a name. Some of us have had the opportunity of seeing a picture by a very brilliant Irish writer, Brendan Behan, in his book <i>Borstal Boy</i> of what a Borstal institution in Britain meant to him. The book is banned in this country. One would have to go outside the country, presumably, to read it.  In fact, it is a sensitive and compassionate picture as well as a humorous and frequently irreverent one.  But the sensitivity that is there enabled Brendan Behan to give a picture of the Borstal at which he was a prisoner <Col N="2011" /> which in large measure is sympathetic. I would even say it is a picture which recalls his gratitude for what was done for him in such an institution, though it had this name.</P>
    <P>Bearing that in mind, I should like to ask the Minister, and I am sure I shall get a favourable reaction, to concern himself legitimately here with the name but also to concern himself with what is behind the name when changed. In other words, let us not be content simply to say: &ldquo;We will not call it Borstal.  We will call it another name&rdquo; and that it will be the same old place.</P>
    <P>I want to ask very specifically if the Minister is satisfied now with the conditions in St. Patrick's.  He referred to the conditions and I think, in deprecating terms, suggested that it is the best we can do at the moment.  It is all very well to call it &ldquo;St. Patrick's&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;Borstal&rdquo; but the Minister will agree that that is not enough and that if we abolish the name &ldquo;Borstal&rdquo;, we must also abolish, as has been done in England without abolishing the name, the spirit that used to be regarded as &ldquo;the Borstal spirit&rdquo;.  I am not familiar with the conditions in St. Patrick's.  I should like to hear from the Minister whether inside the building and in relation to the grounds, fields, accessibility of open air, and so on, he is satisfied that St. Patrick's is the best we can do for such boys.</P>
    <P>This Bill constitutes a good step on the right road, the road towards prison reform.  I believe the Bill will have to be followed by many more steps.  I look forward to the introduction by the Minister of further measures of radical prison reform.</P>

      <P>I join with other Senators in congratulating the Minister on the introduction of this Bill.  Strange to relate, Senator Sheehy Skeffington has referred <i>in extenso</i> to the principal matter to which I wished to refer, that is, the use of the term &ldquo;criminal lunatic&rdquo;.  All our legislation as an independent State has been directed towards doing away with the terms &ldquo;lunatic asylum&rdquo; and &ldquo;lunatics&rdquo;. We have used instead &ldquo;mental hospital&rdquo;, &ldquo;mental home&rdquo; and &ldquo;mentally affected people.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2012" /> When I saw these words &ldquo;criminal lunatics&rdquo; in the Bill, I did not like them and I join with Senator Sheehy Skeffington in hoping that before this Bill leaves the House, the Minister and his Department will be able to use some other term, if possible, within the law as it exists.  I think it can be done within the law.  It struck me that we might use the expression &ldquo;mentally affected persons&rdquo; rather than the words &ldquo;criminal lunatics&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I also appeal to the Minister to look into a matter which has already been referred to by Senator Sheehy Skeffington. The words used by Senator Mrs. Connolly O'Brien do not appear in the Bill.  I assume the Minister has secured and was pleased to get the services of the nuns in St. Mary Magdalen's Asylum.  The fact that it is not in the Bill which we are about to enact signifies that it can be changed.  It lessens the strength of the argument against having a prisoner or a detainee by choice going to a convent managed and run by nuns, irrespective of the name and implication of the convent.</P>
    <P>I object to the words &ldquo;convicted prisoners&rdquo;.  Naturally people will think that a convent so named is not a suitable place for a young girl to be detained until her case is heard.  I join in the hope that some better name than &ldquo;Asylum&rdquo;, as is referred to here in relation to the detention of young girl delinquents, will be used.  There seems to be no difficulty as far as young boys are concerned in what we now call &ldquo;St. Patrick's&rdquo; The abolition of the &ldquo;Borstal&rdquo; is good.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington was able seemingly to get outside the country to read Brendan Behan's description of a &ldquo;Borstal&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Irrespective of that, it is good to have such an institution named &ldquo;St. Patrick's&rdquo; and to abolish the name of &ldquo;Borstal.&rdquo; Perhaps I may be allowed to refer to the methods of dealing with juvenile delinquents? It might be appropriate to refer to the appalling incident which occurred at Crumlin Technical Schools.  Some young people went into the schools and with deliberation, <Col N="2013" /> smashed up every desk and press and even scientific apparatus.  I have an idea which might require amendment of the law.  I should like to see chaps who do these things, maybe for the first time, detained in some place where they would have to work sufficiently long to earn enough money to compensate for the damage that was done.  The amount of damage in this case was, I understand, £2,000.</P>
      <P>It would be a long time before a youngster detained on a farm or in some institution could earn sufficient money to pay that amount, but what is running through my mind is that it would have a corrective influence if we had a system where a youngster would not be classified as &ldquo;sentenced&rdquo; or &ldquo;imprisoned&rdquo; but simply detained in an institution where he could earn sufficient money to compensate for the damage he and whatever associates he had caused.  Perhaps this is not relevant to the Bill, but we cannot pass without thinking of the seriousness of such an incident as this where young lads can go into a school and cause such destruction for apparently no reason but to destroy.</P>
      <P>To my mind, it would be a magnificent thing if we had a new system to deal with such young delinquents: bring them to a school and say: &ldquo;You have got to work here for such a time to help at least to pay for the damage you have done.&rdquo; Instead of leaving young people, whether boys or girls, with the stigma of getting a sentence from any court, you could have such a system of dealing with juvenile delinquents which would also help the citizens generally.</P>
      <P>That is all I have to say.  I have referred to the naming of the girls' institute.  I do not like the term &ldquo;criminal lunatic&rdquo; and if this could be amended in Committee, I should be glad.</P>

      <P>This Bill, as the Minister stated at the outset, deals with a number of amendments in our prison laws.  Like every other country and especially England and certain European countries, it is inevitable that we should try to move forward.  It is gratifying to know that our average prison population is small and that <Col N="2014" /> therefore this population can be contained in very few prisons.  The big trouble, as I see it, is dealing with short-term offenders.  You have a higher proportion of these than of long-term detainees and it is unsatisfactory in so far as you cannot classify them, punish them or train them to certain trades.  Apart from that, they may be described as &ldquo;in and outers&rdquo;. In any country it is inevitable that you should have a higher percentage of &ldquo;in and outers&rdquo; than any other type of prisoner.  Nevertheless, this situation entails passing legislation, taking note of it and offering opinions which might be considered helpful to the Minister in dealing with the matter.</P>
      <P>It is gratifying also to know that prison conditions in general have improved, that, for instance, rations have become much better, that prison clothes have been changed and that taking it all in all, prisoners are now treated in a more humane fashion.</P>
      <P>I want to make a brief point on Section 9: Senator Connolly O'Brien mentioned the Mary Magdalen Home. I do not object to the name.  I do not see what is significant about it or what stigma it attaches to prisoners or to persons not committed to prison any more than any other name.</P>

      <P>We must not be too scrupulous about this matter.  I can see no harm whatever in adopting this name for any institution dealing with corrective training of young&mdash;or old, for that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Criminal lunacy has been mentioned and some Senators entered the realms of jurisprudence.  I am not sure that the term &ldquo;criminal lunacy&rdquo; is inappropriate <Col N="2015" /> because we have various degrees of mental illness and various degrees of lunacy and again we must not go too far and err in the direction of being too lenient in the names we place on criminals of this type.  It is all in the mind and it is not a very easy matter to deal with.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the term &ldquo;Borstal&rdquo; is being dropped under this Bill.  As we all know, the name derives from the village in England where this treatment was first tried on young offenders.</P>
    <P>It is a good thing also that costs are rigidly related to conditions and that the number of prisoners and detainees being small, costs are kept as low as possible.  It is good also that the daily average of detainees is inclined to fall and we hope that in future it will fall still lower.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;juvenile delinquent&rdquo; often arouses a lot of sympathy to which he or she is not entitled. In my view, it might be no harm if the birch could be brought into play on juvenile delinquents, especially the &ldquo;in and outers&rdquo; who refused to be corrected and will not respect corrective training otherwise. I think they learned that lesson in England.  Various ways of dealing with this matter were also tried in America and considerable sums of money were spent on corrective treatment of one kind or another, not always with the best results.  We should not be too soft when we come to deal with the type, described here in the Bill, who refuse to respond to corrective treatment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like all the other speakers, welcome this Bill.  It is, to my mind, a forward step more in keeping with our ideas to-day of the treatment of prisoners.  I welcome particularly the granting of parole because I know that it was a very sad note in some people's lives that they were not able to get parole.  Unfortunately, they committed some error which put them in jail for a short time and tragedy happened at home. I welcome that section of the Bill very much.  I know it is to a large extent <Col N="2016" /> experimental.  Let us hope it will work out all right.  I believe it will.</P>
      <P>With regard to St. Patrick's Home, I confess I do not know anything about it.  I should like to know something about the conditions in it.  I am not one of those who believe, as some comments I heard would lead one to believe, that conditions in jails should be all comfort.  I do not agree with that.  On the other hand, I do not agree that they should be unduly harsh but one thing which I think should be part of the routine in St. Patrick's is some type of work for the young offenders during the day, something to occupy their minds and something to try to inculcate in them the value of work, the use of work, and give them the idea of work.  Unfortunately, some of them appear to think that everybody else should keep them.  I put that to the Minister.  I do not know what the rules and regulations may be.  I think that work for some hours a day should form part of the routine for the people in St. Patrick's.</P>
      <P>As regards St. Mary Magdalen's Home, I find myself agreeing with Senator Mrs. Connolly O'Brien.  I think it is an unfortunate choice.  I know it may not be easy to find alternatives to which to send young delinquents.  In fact, they are not proved delinquents&mdash;they are only on remand.  I think it would be very unfortunate, as Senator Mrs. Connolly O'Brien said, that some young girls who may be ignorant of what the Home meant, should choose to go there to keep out of jail, as they thought, and later on, perhaps, after being acquitted, find they had been in such a place.</P>
      <P>I think the choice of the place is unfortunate.  Personally, I would rather see the position as it is than just have that.  Surely, it should be possible, at least in the framing of this measure, not to state specifically that Home but to leave it in some general way as some home or convent approved by the Minister.  Within a short time, I am sure if the Minister sets himself out to do so, we shall be able to find some alternative convent or home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is a mistake to have that <Col N="2017" /> there for all classes who may come up and be remanded and who may possibly be innocent.  Even if it were only a case of one or two girls, I think we should not pass it without some further effort to find alternative accommodation to that Home for these girls.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I said in my opening remarks that this was a simple Bill. That does not mean that it is a Bill that cannot be criticised.  I certainly welcome the criticism to which I have just listened.  I think that it will be helpful and useful in regard to future consideration of matters of this kind. Let me deal first with the criticism which was made by Senator Mrs. Connolly O'Brien in respect of the place of remand for girls.</P>
      <P>I should like the House, first of all, to remember that I am in the hands of the ecclesiastical authorities in this matter of remand institutions.  I cannot just say that we will remand girls to this convent, that convent or some other convent.  When we decided that it would be a desirable thing not to remand young girls who might be innocent of the crime with which they were charged to a prison, we began to discuss what other place or institution, would be suitable.  We thought it would be desirable that young girls should be remanded to convents rather than to prison.  We had to see whether we would be allowed to remand girls who were charged with crimes to such institutions and his Grace very kindly suggested that we could utilise the services of the sisters in St. Mary Magdalen's Asylum in Seán MacDermott Street.</P>
      <P>I want to impress upon the Senator who first raised this matter that I myself was conscious of all she was conscious of.  I discussed the matter with my advisers and I made it clear that girls so remanded should be remanded to a portion of the convent where they would not be in contact with the type of person whom the Senator has in mind.  Whether or not that would be possible, I do not know.  I have not got a reply on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to remind the <Col N="2018" /> Senator that in the course of my opening remarks, I said:</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that other convents will be willing to accept girls on this basis also.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether or not we shall get the use of other convents.  I hope we shall, but if we can have these girls remanded to St. Mary Magdalen's Asylum and if they will not be in association with the type of inmate which the Senator has in mind I do not think we can object very strongly.  It is just a question of whether the indignity of being remanded to St. Mary Magdalen's Asylum is a greater indignity than being remanded to Mountjoy prison.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington was the first to raise the question of the criminal lunatic.  He said that there was no such person as a criminal lunatic.  I think there is and I shall give an example. A person who is sentenced for a serious crime may be in prison for a year or two years when he suddenly loses his mental balance and becomes insane.  He has to be removed to a mental hospital, He is sent there as a criminal lunatic.</P>
    <P>Then there is the individual who has been charged with, say, the murder of some person and in the course of his trial, he either becomes insane or feigns insanity and the jury decides he is insane. He is not sentenced to death; he is sent to the Central Criminal Lunatic Asylum, as it was called, during the pleasure of the Government.  That is another example of the type of person who is included in the term &ldquo;criminal lunatic&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>However, the question will be settled in the near future as we shall be bringing in a Bill dealing with that particular question and <Col N="2019" /> it is quite possible that we may be able to get rid of the term.  It is not a nice term, I admit, and it is not one that we want to inflict on somebody who in the course of time may leave the mental hospital and resume a normal life.</P>
      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington asked whether the prisons paid.  I do not think any prison pays.  I do not think they are meant to.  They are millstones around the necks of the unfortunate taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>My question was not whether prisons paid but whether we get adequate value from our expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>That would depend on what would be regarded as adequate value.  If, for example, the prisoners were being sent out completely reformed, then I would say we were getting full value, but do we succeed in doing that?  I do not think we do. However, if it is a question of whether the prisons pay for themselves they do not.  Of course, there is valuable work being done in them.  For instance, they manufacture all the mail bags for the Post Office and they make quite a lot of clothing which is used for the manufacture of uniforms.  They also produce quite a large amount of firewood blocks and kindling.  The same applies to St. Patrick's Institution.  The boys there are kept fully occupied.  I can assure Senator Colley who seemed to be worried on that aspect of it that as far as work is concerned the boys may regard themselves as overworked. They are kept fully employed for several hours of the day and their recreation is not forgotten either.  They have a magnificent recreation field where they play football.  They have a recreation hall and they participate in boxing tournaments with outside clubs so that they are not entirely out of contact with normal life outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody asked if I was satisfied with the conditions in St. Patricks. Personally I was satisfied from my inspection of the institution.  I am sure that there are Senators who if they went there would be so critical that <Col N="2020" /> they might see where improvements could be made and so on but from my examination of the institution I was wondering like Senator Carter, whether we were going too far in fact with this business of making prisons a home from home.  Mind you, when you see some of the crimes which have been committed recently in this city, in the main, by young fellows under 21 years of age, you begin to ask are we lacking in the disciplining of that type of individual or are we too soft with them or is juvenile delinquency brought about by the public generally&mdash;parents, the Government and everybody concerned &mdash;being too sentimental, as we appear to have been in dealing with this matter here.</P>
    <P>There has been a certain amount of sentiment shown in the discussion which has taken place and we ought to ask ourselves whether we are in some degree responsible for the lack of civic spirit which appears to be abroad at present.  I should say of course&mdash;and I think it was Senator Carton who referred to this&mdash;that most of the crimes in this State take place in the cities and other large centres of population.  Rural Ireland is practically clear of that type of crime, and that is to the credit of the residents of rural Ireland, but we have to deal with great masses of population such as we have in the city of Dublin&mdash;something like 600,000 people&mdash;and we are beginning to reach the stage that they appear to have reached in some of the great capitals of Europe.  That is something that will have to be very seriously considered by all who are responsible for the handling of these matters.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any more that I can say except on the question of parole.  As I mentioned at the beginning, when I decided to deal with a case in which a prisoner's mother was dying I can assure the House I had certain misgivings, with regard to the parole which I granted to a man who was not legally entitled to it, as to whether or not he would honour it. It is to his credit that he did.  On a second occasion, in similar circumstances, the parole was honoured too. Parole involves putting trust in an individual and, like Senator Sheehy <Col N="2021" /> Skeffington, I believe that giving a man that sort of personal trust gives him an uplift.  In one case&mdash;I think it was the first case&mdash;the man was to report back at 7 o'clock and he actually reported back at 6.30 p.m. in order to ensure that he would honour his bond and be there in ample time.</P>
    <P>It was arising out of these little matters that this Bill has been brought in.  As I said a moment ago, I do not think there is anything more I can say and I think I have answered most of the questions I have been asked.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>The Criminal Justice Act, 1914, provides that when the District Court is satisfied that a young offender, by reason of his criminal habits and a previous criminal history, should be subject to detention in a Borstal Institution, the Court, in lieu of passing a sentence of imprisonment, may commit the offender to prison until the next Circuit Court which shall enquire into the circumstances of the case and decide whether the offender should be sent to Borstal or otherwise.  The point here is that the District Court must commit the boy to prison pending the decision of the Circuit Court.  Under a further provision of the 1914 Act the Minister for Justice can transfer the boy forthwith from the prison to the Institution.</P>
      <P>It would be preferable if the District Court had power to send the boy direct to St. Patricks instead of to prison.  Nothing much is involved but I should like to make this change in the Bill if the House is agreeable.</P>

    <P>The Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes are made under the authority of the Defence Forces (Pensions) Acts, 1932 to 1957 and deal with retired pay pensions and gratuities for or in respect of members of the permanent defence force and for members of the army nursing service and the chaplaincy service.  Section 4 of the Act of 1932 provides that no scheme shall come into force unless and until it has been laid before each House of the Oireachtais and has been confirmed by a resolution of each such House.</P>
    <P>This scheme contains 31 Articles, the first of which are definitory.  Seven articles&mdash;Nos. 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 and 17&mdash;are designed to give formal effect to increases in retired pay and pensions which are in accordance with the increases for State pensioners, generally, authorised by the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement in April 1959. The increases amounted to 6 per cent. for personnel discharged before 1st September 1949 and for certain widows and children, while a 4 per cent. increase is payable to personnel discharged between 1st September 1949 and 1st November 1952.  These increases were approved by Dáil Éireann in an estimate introduced by the Minister for Finance on 22nd July 1959, and they are being paid since <Col N="2026" /> August 1959; they cost approximately £10,000 a year.</P>
    <P>Eight other articles&mdash;Nos. 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20&mdash;are related to the increases to be made on 1st August 1960, in retired pay and pensions in accordance with the increases for State pensioners generally mentioned in the budget statement of the Minister for Finance on 27th April 1960.  In this case an increase of 7½ per cent. will be granted in the pensions payable to personnel discharged before 1st September 1949 and to certain widows and children, while a 5 per cent. increase will be paid on the pensions of personnel discharged between 1st September 1949 and 1st November 1955. These increases will cost £10,000 in this financial year and £17,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>Seven of the remaining 12 articles&mdash; Nos. 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 28 and 29&mdash; provide for normal increases in retired pay, pensions and gratuities made necessary&mdash;following service pay increases&mdash;in order to preserve the relationship between remuneration and retirement benefits.  Articles 21 and 23 are related to a service pay increase for certain married officers which was granted in March, 1956, and in respect of which appropriate retired pay and gratuity increases were not provided in the Amending Schemes of 1957 and 1959.  Articles 22 and 24 provide for increased retirement benefits to officers arising from the service pay increases which were made effective from 1st April, 1958, and 15th December, 1959. For convenience of reference the provisions for retired pay and gratuity increases in the amending scheme of 1959 for certain of these officers are being re-enacted in this scheme so that all the increases from 1st April, 1958, and 15th December, 1959, are shown together.  In the table to article 22 and in article 25 the increase provisions relating to the rank of lieutenant general are expressed to refer only to an officer who retired on 1st January, 1960.  This is because there is no serving lieutenant general and because the service pay to which these retirement benefits are related was, therefore, applicable only to the officer who retired in that rank on 1st January, 1960 (the former Chief of Staff).</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2027" /> Articles 28 and 29 provide for the increases in pensions and gratuities for N.C.O.s and men appropriate to the service pay increases granted from 15th December, 1959, only; the April, 1958, increases for these ranks were provided in the amending scheme of 1959.</P>
    <P>The remaining five articles&mdash;Nos. 19, 26, 27, 30 and 31&mdash;contain amendments to the principal scheme.  Article 19 provides for a new grant of retired pay to be made&mdash;based on service since 1st October, 1923, only&mdash;in the case of an officer who received a military service pension, in respect of a period before 1st October, 1923.  The necessity for this amendment arises because certain officers who were not eligible for military service pensions when they retired from the defence forces received retired pay based on service before October 1923, and having later succeeded, on appeal, in their military service pension claims were awarded military service pensions in respect of periods already covered by the retired pay awards.  This article enables these retired pay awards to be replaced by new awards which will exclude the overlapping service periods; it also applies the 1959 budget increases to these new awards.</P>
    <P>Article 26 (1) serves to clarify the intention that the provision in the principal scheme for a 20 per cent. increase in retired pay for officers of the army medical corps is applicable only to medical and dental officers in the corps and would not benefit an officer attached to the army medical corps for other duties.  Paragraph (2) of the article provides, merely, that the definition of a &ldquo;special service&rdquo; officer for retired pay purposes will conform as closely as possible to the definition in the defence force regulation relating to service pay for such an officer.</P>
    <P>Article 27 of the scheme is designed to remove the restriction on widows' pensions contained in the principal scheme which requires the reduction of such a pension by the amount of any remuneration earned by the widow from public moneys.</P>
    <P>Article 30 enables an officer to count as pensionable any period of service in <Col N="2028" /> the Volunteer Reserve or in an officers' Training Corps which he was allowed to deduct from his age in order to qualify for appointment to be an officer of the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
    <P>Finally article 31 supplements the provisions of the amending scheme of 1959 regarding adopted children so as to provide that, where an adopted child is in receipt of an allowance from public funds by reason of services rendered by his natural parents, a married pension which the adopted child attracts to his adopting father shall be reduced by the amount of such an allowance.</P>
    <P>I hope that this résumé will have served to clarify the provision of the scheme and if there are any points of difficulty remaining I shall be glad to deal with them when I am concluding.</P>

      <P>First of all, I should like to tell the Minister that I welcome the measure.  I should like a clarification of the phrase in Section 8: &ldquo;Further increases&rdquo;.  Am I to assume that the further increases here mean increases in addition to the increases of last year?  I am presuming that Section 8 refers to other ranks.  Remember, last year I chimed in here and we were both on the wrong Bill, but I believe I am on the right one now.  If the further increases refer to the increases given last year and the present increases given this year, it is understandable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VictorCarton" hpid="Mr. Carton Mr. Carton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome it on that score because the rest of the measure is all quite laudable and most acceptable.  The increases of 6½ or 7½ per cent. to other ranks are acceptable also but I cannot say most acceptable, because I feel that some system of flat rate approach to this would be better and more satisfying to all concerned.  For instance, when you have an increase of 6½ or 7½ per cent. to a private soldier with £1 a week, that ?d. is a good distance from the 35/- or £2 a week the higher grades will get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the back of any rise in pensions, gratuities or retirement pay is an <Col N="2029" /> attempt to adjust the income of the recipient to the existing cost of living or the cost of living as it gradually increases and as last year this slight rise was given and this year it is happily being done again, I should like the Minister if he is considerng something for next year, to consider deeply that ?d. to the private soldier is not sufficient.  I know that the Minister is tied to certain systems of making these advances but I believe that the amount which is secured by the higher grade officer is not of such importance to him as an extra 4/- or 5/- would be to a private soldier or an ex-non-commissioned officer.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the Minister. This was something we were agitating for and I did not think we would get it.  It is not of course enough; we would like to get more.  However, I am satisfied that it is a move in the right direction.  Next year, having regard to the fact that the Minister did it last year and this year, I believe the Minister will approach the matter a little differently, even if he were to give 10 per cent. or 12 per cent. to a private soldier, but bringing it down to three per cent. or four per cent. where it is not vital a rise be given at all.</P>
    <P>I did not peruse the scheme to any great extent until I came to the part which really affects the ex-soldier.  I stopped at that point.  I am satisfied that the Minister has made a step in the right direction.  I thank the Minister and I hope he will take heed of what I suggest&mdash;to raise the percentage for the small groups because the higher groups are not in such need.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if all categories are covered?  I am tempted to mention a <Col N="2030" /> particular case which I tried unsuccessfully to deal with.  It was the case of a Leitrim man who served in what I would call the Free State Army in 1922.  The poor man was killed in action in Dublin.  A couple of years ago, as far as I recollect, a dependent relative applied for some pension and was informed by the Department of Defence that he was a week too late.</P>

      <P>I want to thank Senators for treating this measure in the spirit in which it was brought in. I can understand Senator Carton's concern for the pensioners whose pensions are at a smaller rate but the position is that State pensioners generally have always been treated in the same way.  The same percentage increase is given to all.  I hope that it will eventually be possible to do something more than that in respect of the people to whom Senator Carton refers but I cannot give any undertaking in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do promise to try to see that, when there is any increase of this nature going, it will be available to the Army pensioner as well as everyone else.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>There has grown up in this country, particularly in recent years, a mentality which has been encouraged and inspired to a great extent by certain newspapers which throw <i>masla</i> on anyone having anything to do with what is described as politics.  On the occasion upon which we last dealt with Senator Stanford's motion, Senator J. D. Sheridan, concluding his address, column 679, volume 52, had the following to say:</P>
      <P>We have had a surfeit of politics, and if we gave it a rest for a few years, the country might benefit.</P>
      <P>Because of the campaign to which I have referred and because of the attempt which is being made to poison the minds of the young generation in regard to their civic duties and responsibilities, I think it well to devote a little time to dealing with that matter and to reminding Senator Sheridan and those others who apparently think like him of a few points which are of vital importance in an appreciation of the proposition which is before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Politics, the term used by Senator Sheridan, is defined as the art of government or the administration of public affairs.  Does Senator Sheridan want government to end?  Obviously not.  It must be, therefore, that his reference was directed at political Parties, their policies and their members, <Col N="2032" /> but I would like to ask Senator Sheridan and those who think like him to answer the question: Where would we be in a democracy without political Parties?</P>
    <P>I should like also to remind Senator Sheridan and the House of the famous words of Edmund Burke, that all that is necessary for triumph, of evil is that good men should do nothing, and that appears to be the future that is envisaged for us by those who think in the same way as Senator Sheridan's expression here on the last occasion, that we have had a surfeit of politics.</P>
    <P>It is well to remember in considering this matter that there are only two methods of government to choose from, the first being as Lincoln put it &ldquo;Government of the people, for the people and by the people.&rdquo; That is the type of government we have here today and it is called democracy.  The second type, the alternative to democracy, is government by a single great man called a dictator.  In Europe, in our time, we have had a surfeit of dictators and unfortunately great parts of the Continent still have them.  I think it necessary also that in considering the two types of government in relation to this matter, to remind the House of the hallmarks of the alternative to the democratic system which we have.</P>
    <P>They could be summarised in this way: under this alternative to democracy, every form of criticism is stifled everything remotely connected with freedom of thought and conscience is destroyed; political opponents are persecuted; trade unionists are trampled under foot and the rights of workers to organise and to strike and fight for better conditions are denied; Protestants as well as Catholics and Jews are persecuted and attacked and espionage and terrorism are the instruments of government.  That is the alternative to the system we have here, which is democracy, and that surely is not what Senator Sheridan has in mind for us as a system of administration.</P>
    <P>Let us go back now to the system of democracy.  It is obvious that it means the existence of parties and here in our system of democracy we have <Col N="2033" /> two great nationally organised Parties and a smaller sectional one. I should like to ask&mdash;and I think it is. well that the question should be asked here in the Seanad in discussing this motion&mdash;who are these politicians about whom we hear so much?  What breed of untouchables are they that so much scorn and ridicule is poured on them and who cause Senator Sheridan to say that we have had a surfeit of politics?</P>
    <P>These politicians are the ordinary workers, farmers, businessmen, lawyers, doctors, teachers, road-workers, etc., who band themselves together to serve the community.  In my opinion, they are the elite guard of our citizenry.  What do they do? How do they operate?  For the information of vocational Senators and those who do not appear to realise the great contribution which is made to the continuance of our democratic institutions, it is no harm to summarise it. All the year round these people, the ordinary persons to whom I have referred, attend meetings; they have discussions; they go on deputations to this, that or the other State Department or local authority.</P>
    <P>In rural Ireland in particular&mdash; vocational Senators may not appreciate this&mdash;men and women who are organised in political groupings come many miles, many cold and wet and wintry miles, over hills and mountains, to attend meetings.  They are the leaders in their localities in every effort formulated for the general good. They are elected to public bodies.  In the recent election for the local authorities, they gave many hours every week, many hours of fine service to the community at considerable inconvenience to themselves.  When elections come around for the Dail, these are the people who operate the machinery of democracy and there is quite a lot of this machinery.</P>
    <P>It should also be remembered that Parties cannot exist without money because elections cost a great deal of money in printing, advertising and general publicity to inform the citizens of what the particular Party stands for and why it seeks their support.  Vocational Senators of course do not have to <Col N="2034" /> worry about such things.  They leave it to the Parties in a general election to carry the baby and do the worrying. The members of these political Parties who are so much sneered at raise the money which is required.  Everybody knows that collections are a distasteful job but they do the job voluntarily and enthusiastically so that the groups of citizens called a Party and whose policy they believe may be able to speak their mind and put their claim for support to the widest possible sections of the community.</P>
    <P>In passing, in regard to this matter of money, I might say another facet of this campaign against politicians, and a disquieting one at that, is something which is happening in many parts of the country, that is, the attempt by certain Church dignitaries to deny the right of the citizens to make collections on the public highways under permit from the Garda Síochána, which is the only legitimate authority entitled to give a permit for that work.  It is a disquieting feature that interference of this type is becoming more prevalent. I should like to say publicly to those who think that way or who act that way that they more than any others should appreciate the value of maintaining our democratic institutions and our way of life and they should be their strongest props.  I hope that this interference with the rights of the citizens and this attempt to usurp the civil power of the people will cease because in order to avoid unseemly incidents, it may be necessary that legislation would have to be considered to deal with a situation of that nature, which in my opinion, is a menace to the continuance of democratic institutions in this part of the world.</P>
    <P>To get back to the point with regard to the service of individual members of political Parties, all of this service is given freely by the Party members who want nothing but the general good of the community.  In this connection, I should like to commend the attitude of Senator L'Estrange who, at a recent meeting of the Westmeath County Council, defended those who had taken an active part in the public life of the country against the sneers and the jeers of those who take part in the campaign <Col N="2035" /> to denigrate them.  I should like to reiterate his statement that most men and women who serve the public on local councils leave public life worse off financially than when they entered it.</P>
    <P>Politicians work hard locally and nationally.  They work hard for the public and they do not have to apologise to anyone, vocational Senators, vocational institutions, vocational bodies or anyone else, for so doing. Particularly do they not have to apologice to certain newspapers which have led this campaign of sneers at politicians and at the Seanad as at present constituted.</P>
    <P>In regard to this proposition about vocational membership of the Seanad, I should like to know if these people who get in here on the basis of vocational qualifications alone are so anxious to serve the people, why do they not do as the political Party members do, and thus merit a place in either the Seanad or the Dáil, and come in to either House with knowledge and experience which they would have worked for and got as a result of work?  Why do they consider themselves the chosen people and by what right do they claim title to reserved seats in this House?</P>
    <P>I feel strongly on this matter because, as I say, of the increasing strength of the campaign which is calculated to bring into ridicule and disrepute not only members of Seanad Éireann but every citizen who feels it his duty to take part in public life and to work for the advancement and the welfare of his fellow citizen.  Party members have served their apprenticeship in public administration and they are qualified to know how the machine runs.  They know how the finances are raised, they know the people must bear the burden and they can appreciate their difficulties and sympathise with them.  The others are not in a position to bring to bear on the problems which face the members of the Dáil or Seanad the same balanced mentality as those who have had experience in public life.</P>
    <P>In another way I should like to support something which Senator <Col N="2036" /> Hayes said not once but often.  I should like to quote from George Bernard Shaw who in his <i>Political What's What</i> published in 1944 had this to say:</P>
    <P>Now a chemist may have the most thrilling dreams and visions of the future of chemistry and the most public-spirited industry in furthering its latest developments; but if he knows nothing more about antimony and manganese than that they are both black he will blow himself and his neighbours up instead of contributing to a New Order.</P>
    <P>A Chancellor of the Exchequer may read the most abstruse mathematical studies and speculations of Sir Arthur Eddington and Sir James Jeans with intense interest, but if he has no grasp of the fact that two plus two equals four and not 80, he may wreck the nation's finance and industry with every intention of building Jerusalem in England's green and pleasant land.</P>
    <P>That exactly hits off the situation in regard to the campaign for vocational representation on a big scale in Seanad Éireann, in my opinion.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the debate which began a few months ago in this House, I notice that only five of the 12 speakers so far, anyhow, want to change the system of election to the Seanad.  The change would involve&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is not my recollection, but if Senator Stanford insists, I shall bow to his knowledge of the matter.  Anyway, irrespective of how many spoke for or against it, the fact is that the change recommended would involve the direct nomination and election of 23 members by certain vocational bodies.  That change would be only the first step in the direction of a House composed, in the main, of representatives of those bodies.  That, I take it, would be the ultimate objective.  Another objective would, I take it, be that eventually the House would be non-political. That would mean&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Anyhow, it means that the electorate of vocational bodies would select people who have no political views.  I do not believe there are any such people in existence.  I do believe, however, with Deputy de Valera and Senators Barry, P. Crowley and Donegan that direct election might seriously damage the vocational bodies themselves.</P>
      <P>It has been pointed out here by several speakers that a non-political second House does not exist anywhere and that if there were such, it would be useless.  Senator McGuire, for instance, who supports the motion, was a firm believer in an all-out vocational Chamber when he first came in here. He is older now, wiser, with much more experience, and he admits that the idea is unrealistic and that in fact such a Chamber would be a laughing stock and that it would wind up in chaotic conditions with regard to legislation.</P>
      <P>Senator Hayes, who is prepared to accept the proposed change as an experiment, and whose views on this non-political ramp merits serious attention because of his outstanding knowledge and his experience of the working of the Oireachtas, nevertheless believes that the demands made on the Senators cannot be adequately borne or answered by those who do not take a political view.  I am one hundred per cent. with him when he says that he has no faith in non-political people, and like him, I have had a vast experience of the breed. From my own short experience here, too, I cannot see how the House can do its job within the Constitution without some kind of political organisation such as we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion, the most down to earth contribution to this debate came from Senator P. Crowley, who is a vocational representative, incidentally, and I should like to recap the main <Col N="2039" /> points of his excellent speech because I think they deserve to be re-emphasised. Senator Crowley believed that the proposal would inject politics in a very undesirable way into the social and economic life of the community.  Having gone through two elections to Seanad Éireann, he believes that the electoral college as at present constituted gives us the nearest thing we can get to direct election of the Seanad by the people. Senator Crowley sees the practicability of enlarging the college by adding extra electors from the vocational bodies, and he suggests that the aim of enlarging vocational representation could be achieved by simply increasing the number of seats that may be filled in each nominating panel.</P>
    <P>Emphasising that the House is dealing with political problems and that he is not a member of any political Party, Senator Crowley said this in Column 643, Volume 52:</P>
    <P>Nevertheless I realise that if I am called upon to give an opinion or to cast a vote I must obviously enter politics to do so, and I make no apology to anyone for doing so.</P>
    <P>That is an honest declaration from a vocational Senator which throws daylight on the situation as it exists here. Even Senator Stanford in his admirable statement proposing the motion admitted that the House is a political one.</P>

      <P>I am very glad that Senator Stanford is displaying all the attributes of the politician.  While Senator Sheehy Skeffington will support the proposal, he believes the present Seanad has justified itself and in fact that it is at times more in touch with the man in the street than is the Dáil itself.  That is an interesting observation.  Let us therefore have a <Col N="2040" /> look at this Seanad which merits such appreciation from some of the Senators who want to change it.  I had a quick look through the membership, and I have listed the following points which may be of interest in this connection. Forty-three of the members of the Seanad were elected in 1957 by an electoral college of 872, composed of 147 members of the newly-elected Dáil, 60 members of the outgoing Seanad, and 785 county councillors and borough councillors.  Six more were chosen by the graduates of our two universities and eleven were nominated by the Taoiseach.  As Senator Crowley said, the system gives us the nearest approach to direct election by the people, which, in my opinion, is an ideal thing.</P>
      <P>Now, on this point, can this Seanad claim to represent widely scattered areas in the country?  I think it can, because on a quick run through the membership, I find that it is drawn from no less than 23 of the 26 counties under our jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>I should like further to ask another question: can the present Seanad claim to be a vocational body in the widest sense of the term?  I say it most certainly can, much more vocational than any other system of election could possibly give us.  It has, on my summary, 19 farmers, 16 businessmen, eight educationists, five lawyers, three trade union executives, two Party secretaries, two doctors and two others &mdash;a veterinary surgeon and a municipal government official.  Fifty per cent of its total membership is engaged in local government.</P>

      <P>I shall come to that; I am not dodging that at all.  As I said, fifty per cent of the membership are engaged in local administration as county, borough or urban councillors. Four of its members are women.  I am sorry to say that there are not more, because I am convinced that we should have in all the public bodies, Dáil, Seanad and the Government, an adequate representation of women.  Now, in regard to <Col N="2041" /> Senator Sheridan's comment, there are 19 former members of Dáil Éireann&mdash; 14 elected on the Oireachtas subpanels, one on the nominating bodies sub-panel and four nominated by the Taoiseach.  For the information of these vocational Senators, 12 of these are Fianna Fáil supporters, six support the Fine Gael Party, and one, as far as I know, supports Labour.</P>

And if Senator Sheridan thinks that they are not as qualified to be here as he is, then he should investigate the facts of life.</P>

      <P>I should like to quote paragraph 29 of the Commission's report, which Senator Sheridan, probably has forgotten.  Here is what it says: &ldquo;We consider it well at this point to refer to the contention expressed in memoranda submitted to us and elsewhere that candidates defeated in elections to the Dáil should not sit in the Seanad.  The Commission were unable to find any valid grounds for this contention.&rdquo; I hope Senator J.D. Sheridan will take note.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to record a protest at this point against a broadcast from Radio Éireann containing a piece of typical propaganda against Seanad Éireann and which was framed in language that Radio Éireann authorities should never have allowed to go on the air.  In the course of the Radio Éireann, discussion on 30th April in which, incidentally, a tremendous amount of rubbish was spoken by some allegedly intelligent men, one gentleman was brazen enough to say: &ldquo;The Seanad is a form of limbo for rejected Teachtaí Dála; it provides a place for a form of corruption in public life.&rdquo; The discussion of the subject which the <Col N="2042" /> broadcast dealt with was taped and was undoubtedly played back before it went on the air.  I should like to protest against the failure of the Radio Éireann authorities to cut out that observation. I regard it as most insulting and as entirely unsuited to broadcast from our national radio station.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise three other paragraphs from the Commission's Report which embodied the views I urged on the Commission as far as I could and to which I adhere in the light of my experience here during the past three years.  In paragraph 24, the Commission have this to say of the duties of the Seanad:</P>
    <P>These duties are political and inevitably influence the composition of the Seanad.  We would like to emphasise that even if the Seanad were composed entirely of vocational representatives elected wholly by vocational organisations it would still, because of the powers and duties vested in it by the Constitution, have to make decisions which are in the fullest sense political.  No alteration in the system of election or composition of the Seanad can alter this fact.</P>
    <P>Again, speaking of the type of person required, paragraph 27 has this to say:</P>
    <P>On the other hand the political character of the work of the Seanad and the fact that alterations in its membership would not change this were emphasised.  It was urged that the type of person required for this work should have a wide understanding of the issues of government and public policy such as can best be gained by practical experience of politics and public life rather than from experience of a particular vocation or occupation.  It was argued in particular that specialist representatives of vocations who would give expert advice exclusively on their own subjects would not be the best suited for the type of work the Seanad must perform.</P>
    <P>I should like Senators to remember that many members of the commission &mdash;I think, practically all&mdash;expressed <Col N="2043" /> the opinion that, notwithstanding its handicaps, Seanad Éireann as a second Chamber compares favourably in competence of its members, the quality of its discussions and its general approach to all questions with any similar body. I do not believe that increased vocational representation would add anything to the Seanad.  It might have a detrimental effect on the vocational bodies which would have to operate the system envisaged.  I firmly believe it is a good insurance policy for the future of this nation that we should have no mumbo-jumbo about nonpolitical people or people who can give an unbiased opinion on legislation because they are not tied to political Parties.  We must be honest in this regard.  Therefore I feel that the Seanad as at present constituted gives us the best possible type of Second Chamber we can get under our Constitution.</P>

      <P>I would not dare to emulate the Leader of the House because he has put the case so well. However, I have a few notes here which I should like to quote from, though they may appear a bit disjointed. I have them more or less since the subject was introduced to the House.  I could not agree more with any statement than that which the Leader has just made.  This House is an integral part of the Parliament and as such is essentially political.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carton</NameTxt>
      <P>That being so, any criticisms of its electoral college on political grounds are unhelpful and unconstructive.  The Leader of the House referred to the electoral college. My figures are somewhat different but probably they approximate. The electoral college consists of approximately 900 men and women who had to qualify for membership by facing the ordinary electorate and entering public life, thus enabling themselves to participate in the conduct of affairs in their county.  Having secured places in the machinery of local administration by their own effort and by the confidence placed in them <Col N="2044" /> by a thousand fellow-citizens, who in this land are better qualified to choose between candidates for this House and give preference to those who in their expert political opinion are best suited for membership of Seanad Éireann?</P>
      <P>Is that not the most effective way of electing members to this House? The Leader of the House has covered this matter more effectively than I hope to do.  No better way has been suggested.  Where else in the democratic world is there a better way of doing it?  If there is, why was it not indicated by the papers that are the main protagonists of the anti-political Party attitude?</P>
      <P>As an alternative to this system it is proposed that election to this House ought to take place in a myriad of back offices amongst irresponsible persons without a shred of administrative knowledge, who in the main are concerned with a vocational single-mindedness, with a &ldquo;could not care less&rdquo; attitude to everything other than their vocational interests.  One cannot blame them for that.</P>

      <P>I wish they did say it. They are concerned about their vocational interests.  We do not blame them for that because they feel they have a mission here.  Whether they represent the farming industry, the cattle industry, building, education, and so on, each believes that his is the mission.  The rest of us here are just the people who vote for them and their beliefs&mdash;an attitude that could result in an all-over ineffectiveness in this House.  That has been covered by the Leader of the House.  People purporting to speak on behalf of the vocational groups have gone to press in recent years penning frothy vituperations against politics in their desire to get into the political arena.  They are wolfing to get into politics, cursing it on the way in and then accepting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2045" /> The examination and critical discussion of legislative measures is a job for men and women who are skilled in the field of politics and to obtain proficiency in that sphere an opportunity will be afforded in the future&mdash;an opportunity was afforded in June last.  That opportunity will be open to anybody who wants to become skilled in politics, in that most laudable profession as quoted by Senator Stanford who said as recently as this evening that he is proud to be a politican in Seanad Éireann.  Last month, upwards of 3,000 men and women from all walks of life, from all the vocations, offered themselves for election to the local authorities.  They offered their time and their talents purely voluntarily for five years and as the Leader of the House said, that means some hours a week.  In point of fact, the minimum is 36 meetings a year and some men who are enthusiastic and specialise in certain spheres of local administration also give their time in the afternoons to sub-committees which means approximately 50 meetings out of 52 weeks.</P>
    <P>These men and women are willing voluntarily to give their talents for the benefit of their communities.  Here is the opportunity for aspirants to get into politics, to come into this House by the most &ldquo;hateful&rdquo; method of all, the political Parties&mdash;as the Leader of the House has said, by this &ldquo;obnoxious&rdquo; method&mdash;and be of some use to the nation.  These candidates will have worked for their conception of good government in one or other of the Parties for years before they feel they possess the ability to participate in local government.  Men and women cross the mountains into the valleys in the depths of winter to attend meetings. I attended meetings myself in Wicklow&mdash;in many parts of the country but mainly in Wicklow&mdash;last winter and a number of men and women took hours to come in a downpour of rain and members on the other side of the road were doing the same thing, every man and woman of them believing that he or she could help to run this country as it should be run. Those who have gone, we should be saluting for ever.</P>
    <P>Ninety-five per cent of the members <Col N="2046" /> of this House and of this Parliament entered public life in this laudable way.  Does anybody know a better method than the present method?  I am dealing only with the method of election to this House.  The Leader of the House dealt with the whole subject more comprehensively.  The end product here is as good as it is anywhere.  Let us have a look at what the end product is like to-day.  We have, apart from the university nominees, professors, doctors, leading industrialists, farmers, lawyers, teachers and trade union leaders and business is represented in all categories.  We have a university professor with the finest of national and cultural backgrounds in the Chair.  As Leas-Chathaoirleach, we have a doctor in the forefront of the educational field. As Leader of the House, we have a man of sound ability with a wide knowledge of affairs and an intimate association with national aspirations. We have a daughter of James Connolly, a sister of Pádraig Pearse, a son of Sheehy Skeffington.  We have a lady with a lifetime knowledge of trade unionism and a lady who graciously occupied the mayoralty of Cork last year, so that even the papers who criticise us have had to admit that they were very proud of her efficiency. Senator Stanford highlighted the situation that occurred on occasion when, but for the political side of the Seanad, it would have been impossible to go on with the business.</P>

      <P>There is an organisation, I believe, which is making you stand up and say these things and it will not look good when it is quoted. If this House were composed of Senators elected by small influential vocational votes, abuses would abound in a very short time.  In the recent by-election, it was said that one of the candidates&mdash;and I should like to say that he was not elected to this House &mdash;joined a nominating body purely to obtain his candidature before the election.  That is possible with a vocational body but it would be <Col N="2047" /> highly improbable with a political Party.  Apart from that aspect, it is abundantly clear that loyalty to the Oireachtas would be merely secondary to loyalty to the group who sent their representative here with the result that the control of the House would pass to pressure groups with their various antagonisms.  In spite of the fact that this debate did succeed in getting a profession of political faith from Senator Stanford, I cannot agree with his motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is generally agreed that the Seanad has two functions to perform, that it has in the structure of the State two reasons for its existence.  Its first reason is to be a House to review legislation, to have a second look at Bills when they come from the Dáil and sometimes to have second thoughts about the desirability of these Bills.  It very often happens that legislation goes through the Dáil rather quickly and without much notice; it very often happens that it goes through before the public have time to form an opinion about the particular Bill.  The second Chamber provides an opportunity for public opinion, if it is suddenly aroused, to form as to the significance of the particular Bill, to examine through the members of the Seanad, the Bill again and to hold it up or amend it.  In my view, this function of the Seanad of reviewing legislation, of having second thoughts, is its principal function.  I think that is certainly true of second Chambers in other countries and it is also true of the Seanad in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second function which the Seanad has to perform is that of a vocational Chamber, a Chamber where the vocational bodies of the country can give their views on the desirability of Bills, give their comments and give their expert opinion where that is <Col N="2048" /> applicable on Bills affecting particular vocations and it must be admitted that the Seanad has an important function in that field also.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the vocational character of the Seanad should be extended, that we should have considerably more members both nominated by the vocational bodies and elected by them.  Whatever may be said for extending the number of members who are nominated by the vocational bodies, I think that possibly there is something to be said for the suggestion that the members who are nominated by the vocational bodies should also be elected by them, but whether the number nominated by the vocational bodies should be extended is, to my mind, another matter.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that in the Seanad we have already gone a very long way towards giving the vocational bodies representation.  At present more than one-third of the members of the Seanad are members nominated by the vocational bodies.  In addition, it is quite obvious that almost all the remaining members of the Seanad are themselves active in some vocation or occupation and that, as such, they are, in fact, vocational members; that they can voice the vocational point of view of the particular vocation or occupation to which they belong, so that it is quite clear that we have between the strictly vocational members and the other members of the Seanad a very strong vocational point of view.  There can scarcely be any vocation in the country, as has been pointed out by some of the previous speakers who have been enumerating the views which are represented here, which are not represented in the Seanad and which is not very adequately represented by some member or members here.</P>
    <P>What is important, I think, about those members who are not actually nominated by vocational bodies is that they do not always voice a vocational point of view.  They keep their vocational point of view in proper perspective. They speak sometimes from the vocational point of view but very often they speak merely from the point of <Col N="2049" /> view of a politician, merely from the point of view of a representative who is giving his view from a broad national point of view.</P>
    <P>The Seanad has often very important national decisions to make, decisions which are not relevant to any particular vocation.  They are decisions which it would be most improper to make from a narrow point of view or from the point of view of any particular vocation.  It is very important, therefore, that the members of this House, or at least that a majority of the members should be primarily politicians rather than primarily representatives of a particular vocation.</P>
    <P>When I say politicians, I want to explain quickly, before Senator Stanford gets up to protest, that I mean politicians who are sufficiently realistic and have sufficient commonsense to know that the only effective politician is a politician who is a member of a Party.  There may be exceptions to that rule but they are very few and far between and they merely&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Senator something?  Does he, therefore, rule out all the politicians of ancient Greece who had no organised party system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what destroyed them.  That is why the Greek democracy fell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator O'Reilly has answered that very effectively.  I have no hesitation in saying that I believe the only effective politician is a politician who is a member of a Party.  The exceptions to that rule are so few and far between that I think they merely go to show that the exception proves the rule.  I say it is essential that the Seanad should be primarily composed of politicians. The reformers of the Seanad seem to seek some form of pure vocationalism. They seem to think that if everybody speaks from the point of view of their own vocation, that if they are untainted by Party politics, in some way they will then be able to express better views, expert views or more valuable views.  I do not believe that is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2050" /> In fact I do not believe there is any such person as a person who is a pure vocationalist, a person who is nonpolitical. If there were such a person, I am quite sure that if the Seanad were entirely composed of such persons, it would be a very poor Seanad and a very bad Chamber for considering national measures and making decisions on them.</P>
    <P>The Commission, in the course of their findings, referred to the evolution of the Seanad and they acknowledged that the Seanad was a young Chamber; that it has not been very long in existence and that, consequently, it is hard to judge it.  I believe it will take the present Seanad a considerable time to assume definite characteristics. I believe it was unfortunate that there has already been so much interference with the second Chamber in this country and so many attempts to reform it by legislation.  I think it would be a mistake, a very serious mistake, at this stage to attempt again to make this a better Chamber by legislation.  It would be much better that it should be given time in its present form to find a niche in the structure of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I might not go the full way in accepting at one stroke the recommendations of the Commission. I would suggest that the Government might seriously consider going a little way in some form or another by recognising bodies of a certain size in some way.  Although I was very impressed by the speech of the Leader of the House and also by Senator Carton's speech, they did not, to my mind, distinguish between allowing these bodies to nominate and allowing them to elect.  The position is that there is not very much difference between the two suggestions.  Take the case of organisations which have nominated and elected their nominees to this House.  I wonder if that suggestion would bring politics into these vocational bodies?  I wonder has it really brought politics into any of those bodies and has it had a detrimental effect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a body which originally nominated the late Senator Baxter <Col N="2051" /> and which also nominated Senator O'Dwyer.  I do not think the fact that that organisation nominated two Senators from two different Parties has done it any harm.  I am sure there are other bodies like that, so that that possibly would dispose of the suggestion that it would do vocational bodies a certain amount of harm. Senator Carton suggests that a person might join one of these bodies simply to get a nomination.  That point could easily be legislated for by making it necessary for voting members to have, say, three or five years' membership.</P>
    <P>I regret in a way that the House has not taken a more academic view of the proposals in the Report instead of a political, or at least a non-vocational, view.  A great many of the speakers, although they spoke against it showed, I thought, a certain amount of admission that a lot could be said for vocational bodies and especially a vocational Seanad.  I feel that we must all admit, even the Leader of the House, that an ideal Chamber would be composed of completely independent members. I am the first to agree that it would not work but an ideal Parliament would be composed of single members and one would think that an ideal Upper House would work if there were a great many members who were not officially in Parties, which is the next thing to being completely independent. While not officially members of a Party, they might to some extent be members and have sympathies with a Party.  The fact that a House composed of Independents would be the ideal thing should not stop the Government from going a little way to experiment, perhaps with some members of this House elected in that way.  If we have ideals, we should at least have the courage to put some of them into force. That, I think, was the original idea of the framers of the Constitution when this House was re-constituted.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should be overimpressed by people who say that our Houses are political and must be political. They are purely political Houses.  Although we have adopted legislation and ideas from other countries, there is no reason why we <Col N="2052" /> should not adopt those parts which suit us, or be a little original.  We are a young country and we have had many original ideas and I do not see why a more original idea of an upper House could not find its birth in this country.</P>
    <P>As regards the type of man who would be sent forward by a vocational body, I once had an opportunity of talking to a British, official who had the job of selecting candidates for British Colonial posts.  I was in the company of a headmaster of a school at the time and he was very keen to obtain information about the type of candidate who, in the opinion of this official, or in the opinion of the Government, would make a good administrator. The official said that they looked primarily for a student who had one good subject&mdash;let it be mathematics or classics, he did not mind, provided the man was good at the subject, although he might be finally chosen to go on to the legal side, or some other side of the administrative service.</P>
    <P>To my mind, that is very important in answer to the suggestion that we would have too many experts here who would only deal with their own subject. I do not think we have in this country a number of the people whom the late Professor Laski, I think, described as experts who know more and more about less and less.  I do not think there is room or a living for many real experts in this country and I think the person who comes from a vocational body&mdash;whom perhaps we should like to call an expert&mdash;is not an expert in the sense that Senator Hayes said he would like to listen to these experts but would not like to be ruled by them, or some such words.</P>
    <P>I do see a great advantage in having members elected by a body which would have a general knowledge and an interest in every sphere of the activities of the Seanad, a person who would come with a particular knowledge of his own subject, let it be education, or farming, and who would be in a position to speak in detail on a Bill having heard the views of the members of his own organisation for and against, and who to a certain extent, <Col N="2053" /> while not an expert would be solely interested in the subject of that Bill. Such a person would be an ideal person to come to this House provided he had a general wish, as we all have, to further the interests of good legislation. After all, the people who are nominated by these bodies are liable to be elected.  They are to a certain extent experts, and they have a general wish to further the interests of the country generally.</P>
    <P>To get back to where I started: where is the difference between the body electing them straightaway and nominating them and letting another electorate elect them?  That, to my mind, is the crux of this whole debate. There is a great deal to be said for recommending to the Government to go a little way with these suggestions in the Report of the Committee.</P>
    <P>One would like to make other suggestions for the improvement of the Seanad.  One suggestion that might perhaps be out of order on this motion is that the Seanad might be enlarged by letting ex-Ministers become members of the Seanad, ex-members of the High Court and, in spite of what has been said about them, ex-T.D.s.  As the number of those members elected by the vocational bodies grew, the Leader of the Opposition in the House could be given the right&mdash;admittedly, it might involve constitutional drafting&mdash;and the power to nominate members, fewer members than the Government, but at least the power to nominate members to assure him of his continuity in the front bench.  I would urge the Government not to reject the suggestions of the Commission out of hand and at least to consider them.  Perhaps they are novel, but at least they are ideals that we should approach perhaps in a small way at first, but they would find great favour in the country.  I urge that point of view on the Minister.</P>

      <P>I feel perhaps at a disadvantage in getting up to speak on this motion because quite a long while ago I felt so strongly on this matter that after reading the Report, I prepared some notes which I intended to use in this debate, but because the motion has been so long on the Order Paper, and because the discussions have been so broken, I now find myself without the Report and without my notes.  However, perhaps it is all for the best because I intended to lambaste the mover and seconder of the motion and also the Leader of the House because he is one of those who signed this Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage I find myself in a certain amount of sympathy with Senator Stanford because it is obvious to me now that when he put down this motion, he did so to have it discussed on the best academic lines, as suggested by Senator Cole.  I suggest he did not intend that it should become the plaything of groups of people outside this House who want to misrepresent, debunk and destroy it.  I know that Senator Stanford is in no way connected with those groups of people who are engaged on that type of work.  Therefore, knowing him to be a sensitive person, I sympathise with him and I know that after what <Col N="2055" /> has happened, he is inclined to protest.</P>
    <P>An interjection of mine when Senator Ryan was speaking leads me to say to Senator Stanford that, in my opinion, while he is trying to protect the Greek classics, he has failed to learn a small lesson of history.  I am prepared to suggest to him that it was because of an attempt at idealistic vocationalism in Athens that the system, which was the earliest democracy I know of, broke down.  I am not qualified to take on a discussion with the Senator but, in my view, the proposer of this motion apparently attacks Party politicians.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of fact, I have never attacked any Party politicians&mdash;never.  That is a fact.  I have been 12 years in this House and I have never attacked them as such.  I have attacked Party politics and Party statements but never Party politicians as such.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was taking the view that the Senator was not an accomplished politician, but I am now inclined to think that he is and that he would make an excellent addition to any Party.  He is a pretty good tactician. The Senator may not have attacked Party politics, but the implication of this motion is that a Seanad composed of members of Parties who are Party politicians is not as good a House as a Seanad elected by vocational bodies, or, might I say, pressure groups.  I do not agree with that view and I think the Senator has so little experience in this matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that he is inclined to take the view that Parties are run along such lines as make for bad Governments.  I do not subscribe to that view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator made another statement when proposing this motion which reminded me of another Senator without a Party.  I am referring to Cicero who ultimately finished up with his head on a rostrum in Rome.  One of the reasons <Col N="2056" /> why that happened was that he failed to become a member of a particular Party at a particular time.  I believe if we were to continue along that line, instead of having an improvement here, this House would disimprove.  I feel that the groups, the trade unions of teachers, transport workers, doctors and University professors would perhaps elect to this House men who are not necessarily the best, but men who would advocate the points of view of those groups which would represent a narrow sectional outlook. It would be disastrous on broad national issues when difficulties arose, if we had in this House a position in which no firm decision would be taken by the people so elected.</P>
    <P>I heard once from a senior executive of an insurance company that before there was a fire brigade in Dublin different companies put their own sign on buildings which they insured so as to know in the event of a fire what buildings they were covering, and it was known that when a fire broke out and some good citizen called the nearest fire brigade that brigade would go to the spot, and seeing that the sign was not its sign, would say that the fire was not its responsibility.  I greatly fear that if the Seanad were elected along the lines suggested in the motion that sort of thing would tend to develop, and it would be a disastrous development.</P>
    <P>Looking at the other side of the case, this Assembly has, by and large, acquitted itself with some distinction and has carried on its business in a fairly intelligent and workable manner. I do not think that the people who elect to criticise and debunk it would, if they were elected, be any improvement.  If the people who make those sustained charges had a little more charity, they would not make them.</P>
    <P>People have talked about this House being a limbo for defeated T.D.'s I have been a fairly long time a member of this House and was never a Dáil Deputy, though I almost was one once or twice; but I was a director of elections more times than I can count, and whether that should be regarded as a qualification or not, apparently the <Col N="2057" /> people who vote and the particular Party did regard it as a qualification.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the people who are arguing that political Parties are undesirable.  I do not want Senator Stanford to make any further protests, and I am not suggesting that he is subscribing to that view, but it is unfortunately true that there were many people making that case at the time the Senator put down his motion.  Most of the members, I feel, will agree that it is unfortunate that people have tried to misrepresent the situation at the very time this motion was on the Order Paper.</P>

      <P>That, I think, is most of what I had intended to say.  There were a few other things which I am afraid I am missing but the House will have to suffer the loss.  I do not <Col N="2058" /> agree that this motion should be passed.  This House has served the country pretty well and I cannot understand why so many people with common sense signed this Report. That includes Senator Ó Maoláin, and it should be an object lesson to Senator Stanford in Party politics to read the Report and then bear in mind Senator Ó Maoláin's speech after signing the Report.  I want to say in conclusion that it would be a tragedy if this motion were accepted by the House, but I do not think it will be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I come to deal with any part of the discussion or the terms of this motion, I would like to take the opportunity of putting on record my deep appreciation of the members of the Commission, both of this House and the other House and those outside both Houses, who sat on the Commission and who gave us a Report in a very expeditious way. I am deeply grateful for that and I am sure all of us feel a sense of gratitude to those people who did this service for us.</P>
      <P>I have listened with very great interest indeed to the debate on the Commission's recommendations.  I have listened to the arguments that have been excellently presented and the speeches very properly put by the various speakers.  Indeed, I might say that the speeches were put in the traditional manner in this House.  They were very clear and moderate and concise.  Senator Stanford, proposer of the motion, summarised the entire question, or certainly the question of importance in regard to the terms of the Comission's Report, when he put the question &ldquo;Should 23 Senators be nominated and elected by vocational bodies?&rdquo; I very particularly emphasise and stress the word &ldquo;elected&rdquo; because as we know at the moment, the vocational bodies are empowered and entitled to nominate to each of the five panels a number of candidates at each Seanad election, and no matter what happens, no less than 16 members so nominated will be elected to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2059" /> Therefore, it would appear to be a question, on this particular issue at any rate, of the difference between a maximum of 16 elected from the nominating bodies sub-panels, or the vocational groups if we wish to call them that, and a fixed 23 as appears to be the wish of those sponsoring this motion and the recommendation of the Report itself.  Of course, the difference of seven which appears to be there need not exist at all, because 23 or more vocational nominees may in fact be elected under our present system, so that it does not really seem as if there is a very great deal between the supporters of the <i>status quo</i> and the proposals in the Report so ably advocated by Senator Stanford in his opening address.</P>
    <P>Of course, there are those who have already said, and I am sure will say, that the present electorate makes it extremely difficult for more than 16 vocational people to be elected to this House; but let us look at the electorate which, as has been pointed out already by some other speakers, really makes the choice between the Oireachtas sub-panel candidates and the vocational bodies sub-panel.  It is composed, as Senators are aware, of the members of this House, the members of Dáil Éireann, and the members of county councils and county borough councils scattered throughout the country.  I entirely agree with the speaker who said that this electorate is as broad as it is possible to get, and I would go further and say that to make it any more widespread and representative would mean no less than going directly to the people themselves.</P>
    <P>That is the electorate that makes this choice.  It is a good and most representative electorate.  Within that electorate, as is known to every Senator, there are quite a large number of independent, non-committed people who vote and participate in the Seanad elections and who cannot be said to be controlled in any way by any group or Party.  Surely that electorate, which represents a fairly significant proportion of our local bodies, must give us food for thought when we talk of making a change?</P>
    <P>I listened with very great interest to <Col N="2060" /> all the speeches.  I am glad to hear the views of anybody who has studied this subject in a serious manner.  I was particularly interested in the views expressed by the vocational Senators.  At this stage and subject to check, out of 17 speakers in the debate only five vocational Senators spoke and there are 16 of them in this House.  It might be six&mdash;I am not sure &mdash;but, on a quick check, I think, only five spoke.</P>
    <P>I was particularly interested in the views of the five vocational Senators on this subject.  They know intimately the type and scope of the work of this House.  They have had that experience since they became members. With those five&mdash;subject to a re-check, of course&mdash;what do we find?  Senator Barry, who actually seconded the motion, found himself in the curious position of disagreeing somewhat with the recommendations of the Commission. He disagreed with the Commission's main recommendation which we have been discussing to a very great degree.  Instead of the Commission's proposal for the direct election of vocational Senators, he recommended that the present electorate be leavened by a number of vocational electors.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire, who declared himself in support of the motion, gave us a really excellent description of the functions of political Parties in the Seanad.  He pointed out that the effort to create a purely vocational Seanad without political Parties would create chaos.  I entirely agree with that view. However, as he proceeded, I am afraid I then came to the point when I could not agree at all.  Having made an excellent case as to why we should not have a vocational Seanad, as such, he then deduced that a greater number of vocational Senators are desirable. I do not quite follow the trend of his thought.  He makes a case with which I entirely agree up to the point of his deducing that we should have more vocational Senators although he said that by having all vocational Senators, we would make a mess of things.  That is as I recall his speech.  I took a note and checked what he said in the Official Report. Senator Crowley did not think the changes recommended by the Commission <Col N="2061" /> would justify the risks. Senator O'Dwyer voiced probably the feeling of many when he said that even if we had vocational members elected by vocational bodies, the result would still be political.  I think that is agreed by practically everybody here.</P>
    <P>I think I would be quite fair, though possibly others may think I am not, in summarising the views expressed by our vocational Senators by saying that only one of the five I have counted fully and wholeheartedly supported the motion proposed by Senator Stanford and he is Senator J.D. Sheridan.  I hope nobody will feel I am in any way reflecting on Senator J.D. Sheridan when I say that he himself would be a perfect example of what Senator McGuire had in mind when he visualised the chaos which would tend to exist here if we had 60 independent-minded, vocationally-trained and elected nominees in this House.</P>
    <P>One of the most vital questions to be discussed in this House for very many years was the recent question of the referendum.  Senator J.D. Sheridan, as is his right, decided not to vote&mdash;I am not wronging him, I hope&mdash;his line being that it was a political question and as such, he did not want to and would not participate in a decision one way or the other.</P>
    <P>That, then, would bring us to the situation when we would have, excluding the 11 people nominated by the Taoiseach and the six elected by the Universities, 43 people with minds very definitely made up on certain subjects but with a firm commitment that when a political question was to be decided, none of them would vote. That would be the complete and absolute negation of the idea of a second House.</P>

      <P>The word &ldquo;chaos&rdquo; used by Senator McGuire as a description of the result is very mild.  The work of this House is political.  That is fairly well accepted by anyone who to my knowledge has spoken here.  One has only to look at the Order Paper of this House today to see the many and varied matters all of which can be described as of political and topical <Col N="2062" /> importance.  Surely, if we were to say: &ldquo;We belong to vocational bodies; we should not make political decisions&rdquo; I wonder where the items Senators have so expeditiously dealt with today would find themselves?</P>
      <P>This idea of course that the Seanad is a political institution is quite unoriginal.  It is recognised and admitted by everybody who stops to think.  To quote one item from the Commission:</P>
      <P>We would like to emphasise that even if the Seanad were composed entirely of vocational representatives elected wholly by vocational organisations it would still, because of the powers and duties vested in it by the Constitution, have to make decisions which are in the fullest sense political. No alteration in the system of election or composition of the Seanad can alter this fact.</P>
      <P>Another matter commented on by a number of Senators, as I may have already mentioned, was the danger of making the vocational bodies not only the nominating bodies but also their own electorate.  Four or five Senators on both sides of the House spoke of these dangers and said that it tended to bring politics into the vocations rather than bring any great advantage from the vocations into politics.  These people, Senators Barry, Lenihan, Sheehy Skeffington, Hayes and Carter, taking them by and large, are a fair cross-section of the opinion of this House and I believe that the fears they express would possibly have a fairly sound foundation.  I am inclined to agree with those five Senators and would indeed feel that there is great danger of what they suggest happening, if this aspect of the Report were put into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Donegan raised another very important point.  He was the only one to raise it and call a spade a spade.  He talked of the situation before the present system of Seanad election was instituted when we had an electorate overall of about 400.  The talk of corruption in those days was possibly a contributing factor to the change that took place in the actual electorate and in the system.  If the recommendations here before us <Col N="2063" /> regarding the electorate for the vocational panels were accepted, surely it implies that in future the importance of one vote in each group of one hundred of an electorate in the vocational groups would be far greater than was one vote out of four hundred in the open electorate which we are told lent itself to abuse.  Certainly if it did not give rise to abuse it was talked of in a manner which led people to believe that it did and in matters of public interest such as these, it is almost as dangerous when such things are believed to have happened as when they do happen.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Donegan that giving an electorate of one hundred to each of the various panels would draw us back to a greater degree than an open electorate of four hundred which resulted in so much talk and accusations of corrupt practices being slung around by those who possibly hoped to injure this institution.  We have a bigger electorate to-day and since the electorate was extended to its present size, there has been no breath whatever of a suggestion of corrupt practices regarding Seanad elections.  Certainly I would say that to go back to a situation where such suggestions could be made would be a very retrograde step and one all of us would regret.</P>
    <P>Seventeen speakers made contributions to this debate so far as I can ascertain on a check.  Might I say&mdash; and I am sure Senator Stanford will entirely disagree because he has already held that the figure is somewhat greater than I make out&mdash;that of those 17 members who spoke, there were two people fully for the motion: Senator Stanford, the proposer, and Senator J.D. Sheridan who spoke at a later stage.  Senator Barry, I would say, was about 50-50.  In his own words, he found himself in some difficulty in seconding.  He wanted the motion discussed and therefore he was seconding it, although he did not entirely agree with the idea behind it. Senator Hayes, I thought, spoke against it; I felt he spoke against it. I have read what he said since and I am still convinced that he did speak against it, but he wound up by saying that we should try it as an <Col N="2064" /> experiment in deference to the agitation raised and the general feeling that something should be done.</P>
    <P>Might I also couple Senator Cole with the idea that the Government should go a little way at any rate and at least experiment?  I believe, with due regard to both Senators and to this House, that this is far too serious and important a matter, too delicate a subject, to be experimented with. If that were the only reason for a change, it would be foolhardy to attempt it even though a change might appeal in certain ways.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire, I felt again, spoke against.  On reconsideration of what he said as reported in the debates of this House, I am still convinced of that, but he wound up by saying that he supported the motion.  That gives us two speakers who seemed finally to come down on the side of the motion, with Senator McGuire being half in favour of it, and two others who might come down in favour of an experiment.  In all, we have two and a half for and two doubtful out of 17 speakers and the rest against.</P>
    <P>In addition, I would say, subject to correction, that only five of the 16 vocational Senators spoke at all, either for or against.  Of those five, I make out that two were for, one of them half and half and two against, so the five would appear to me to be evenly divided.</P>
    <P>Taking all that as the background and realising full well that the contributions made here will take a little time to digest fully, I should say at this stage that no formal decision has yet been taken. I have on many occasions said in the Dáil in reply to Parliamentary Questions that until we heard the views of this House and considered them, no final decision whatever would be arrived at by the Government. Despite that, I feel that, overall, my impression would be that no really worthwhile case has been made to justify the departure suggested by this Report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to thank the Minister&mdash;I am sure all the House will join with me in this &mdash;for his patience in listening to our debate and for his contribution to it.  I <Col N="2065" /> must add that I am disappointed at the general tenor of what he has said. I shall try to meet one or two of the arguments he made.  He did argue that only two were fully in support of the motion, namely, myself and another Senator.</P>
      <P>Here, I should like, with due deference, to say that it was hardly fair to single out one Senator in his absence and take him as a kind of example of what the Seanad might or might not do if all of us here were primarily vocationalists.  I really do not think that this was an entirely justified approach.  It would be perfectly possible for me to single out some unfortunate Senator either present here, or in his absence, and say his conduct was a reflection on the Party or something like that.  It is the last thing I would do, but it is perfectly within my power. I do not think it is a fair argument against vocationalists to single out a person and say that he is an example of what is likely to happen.  I should like to say that emphatically.  I think this is a negative approach.  I think we should have a constructive, positive approach to a matter of this kind.</P>
      <P>It is not worth going over an analysis of the figures which the Minister gave because he has his mathematical methods and I have mine. Perhaps, neither of us is a pure mathematician.  We could not come to absolute agreement on this.  As I see it, seven out of 17 gave a partial support to this motion.  It is quite true that there were reservations in many cases.  But I think it is only fair to say to the Minister that there were reservations on the other side, too.  Among the ten who supported the motion, some made suggestions for changes or improvements in the constitution of the Seanad.  It would be perfectly possible for me to whittle down that ten on the other side, but I do not think that is really a practical approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider the principles that underlie this debate and consider where the best principles, the most constructive principles, for the welfare of the country lie.  The Minister's argument&mdash;it was the argument of many&mdash;was that a kind of chaos would result if the loyalties of Senators were <Col N="2066" /> primarily vocational.  He quoted, very rightly, the remark in the Commission's Report that the Seanad must be in the fullest sense political.  But what the Minister is doing and what pretty well every member of this House who is in opposition to the motion is doing is refusing to see that there is any form of politics, or valid politics, other than, Party politics; that Party politics is the be-all and end-all of good government in this country and in every country.</P>
    <P>Let me remind the House that history has its lessons.  The Party system is a bare 300 years old at the most. It has served its purpose and is still serving its purpose.  Some day it will go like the other systems.  In Athens, you had a system of personal leadership. It served its purpose and very brilliantly for a while.  I think even Senator O'Reilly might concede some good things were done by the Athenian democracy, even in the absence of a Party organisation.  That was personal leadership.  It served its purpose.  In Rome, you had a kind of class organisation&mdash;the Knights, the Senators and the <i>plebs.</i>  It served its purpose, and it went.  In the English House of Lords, you had an hereditary system.  It served its purpose and produced a very good House, though it is being gradually changed now by life peers.  The fact is that there are other valid and valuable forms of political organisation besides the Party system, and unless you are going to shut your history books and see no further than the shores of this island, you cannot deny that.</P>
    <P>Again and again in this debate, we have had the view that politics means Party politics, as if anyone who is not a member of a Party cannot be a politician. The thing is idiotic.  When I use the word &ldquo;idiotic,&rdquo; I use it charged with over 2,000 years of force.  When the Greeks used the word <i>idiotes</i>, what they meant was a man who did not take a proper interest in national politics and none of us here should be an idiot in that sense, taking no interest in national politics.  Why should vocationalists be idiots in that sense. either?  Surely, they have a sense of <Col N="2067" /> national responsibility just as much as the Parties?</P>
    <P>Sir, may I say through you to the House that I am not attacking the Party system?  It is good up to a point but it is not the last word.  It is not the only possible source of political energy and political intelligence in this country.  Anyone who says it is is denying the universality of the Irish nation because there are a good many people in this country&mdash;a fair number, at any rate&mdash;who just do not particularly like the Party system.  They prefer another system.</P>

      <P>I am pained by the way in which the words &ldquo;politics&rdquo; and &ldquo;political Parties&rdquo; have been grossly abused and misused throughout this debate. It is a reflection on the intelligence of the House in many ways.  It is obfuscating our minds.  This debate has not succeeded in clearing the air completely because these falsified terms have been bandied to and fro.  If we could only have agreed upon a definition at the beginning, as wise politicians and diplomats do, we would have had a much better debate.  The agreed definition should have been this, as I am sure that all will agree: politics is the art of Government, and the politicians are those who take part in government, local and national.  That is the meaning of the word and I do not think that any sensible man can honestly deny it.  I am afraid that even the Minister lent himself to that obfuscation of our thought by tending to identify the whole question of politics with the Party system. History denies that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I turn to the contribution of Senator Ó Maoláin?  I am very grateful to him.  He is an honest man who speaks his mind.  But he also changes his mind as a supporter of his Party pointed out in a very choice phrase. Senator O'Reilly described him as &ldquo;one of the people who signed in support <Col N="2068" /> of the Commission,&rdquo; a very well-chosen phrase.  But we are perfectly entitled to change our minds in a few months like that, provided that we always do it honestly.</P>

      <P>Senator Stanford knows very well that it was not a question of changing my mind.  I urged on the Commission, as Senator Stanford knows and as the Report of the Commission will show, my particular viewpoint.  For the sake of getting a report and having it discussed, I agreed to sign.  There was no question, as Senator Stanford knows, of changing my mind.</P>

      <P>Senator Ó Maoláin signed the Report as it stands, and I cannot see how a man who signs a report can say he did not support the report at that time.  He may change his mind afterwards.  I know he made reservations at the meeting&mdash; I think I was at nearly all the meetings &mdash;but he did not come out with this masterly attack that he used today. We did not hear that at all.  He has now changed his mind.</P>

      <P>I wish I could change it back for him.  I know he will listen to reason.  He began with a eulogy of the Party system and I kept saying in my mind: &ldquo;Yes, yes, yes; of course it has done good but who is attacking it?&rdquo; I am certainly not and no one in this debate did, with one exception, which I regret.  But he insisted that the Party system is the only source of good, strenuous political work in this country.  I think that is where he is wrong.  He said that the Party politicians learned to operate the machinery of administration and complained that they were sneered at. They were not sneered at by anybody in this House or by anybody who signed the Report.  That is not relevant.  The question that concerns us is: would this House be improved by an infusion of politicians whose primary loyalty, after that which they must all have for their country, is not to Party but to their profession or vocation?  That is the question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>He went on to say that only the Party members served their apprenticeship and saw how the machinery of politics worked. But does he honestly think that a man who has been chairman of a hospital for ten years or a man who has run a big factory employing hundreds of people for ten years or a man who has organised and run a trade union for ten years, or a large business firm&mdash; are such people completely ignorant of the art of government, of managing people, of making regulations?  The thing is absurd.  Some Senator seemed to imply that they would know nothing of public life.  Could anything be more absurd?  They will be people who have taken part in medical politics&mdash; and that is pretty political in all senses of the word; or played a part in academic politics&mdash;and let me tell Senator Ó Maoláin that academic politics have little to learn from the sharpest Party politicians&mdash;or in trade union politics.  There are other forms of apprenticeship which will be valuable for this House if the vocationalists come into it.  These people will have experience of public life, experience of the art of government.  They will have experience and knowledge of human nature.  What more do we want? There was too much emphasis on the political machine.  This really is not a matter of machinery and machines, but of human beings.  I claim that some of the vocational politicians will be useful human beings in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I deplore it when Senator Ó Maoláin speaks of this non-political ramp. Those are unnecessary words here.  I take it that what he means is that some people in this country have decried politics in general; other people decried Party politics in general.  But that is not the motive behind this motion or the motive of those of the Commission who really wanted a change.  That is not so.  They want to improve national politics, to stimulate Party politics by a kind of Opposition which is at a different level, not necessarily higher and not necessarily lower, <Col N="2070" /> but simply, shall we say, from a different angle.  I think that would do good.  I hope I am being fair to Senator Ó Maoláin.  I know he will interrupt me if I am not.</P>
    <P>In general, I think his argument was, first, that this motion amounts to an attack on politicians; secondly, that it is an attack on Party politics; and thirdly, that it is an attack on the Seanad.  Now, I deny all three of those.  We are all politicians here and must always be, or else I hope that anyone who says he is not will be shown the door by the Captain of the Guard.  That would be the proper way to deal with him.  Secondly, only a fool would decry Party politics in general as an evil thing.  But it is not the only possible source of political wisdom and energy and action in this country.  That is the distinction.</P>

      <P>Party politics provide the largest and the most effective source at the moment.  But I am saying that there is another possible valuable source.  I did not hear that murmuring?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>Thirdly, no supporter of the motion attacked the Seanad as far as I know and no one intended the motion as such an attack. I could quote from my opening speech, but I will not as the hour is late.  I made it clear in my opening statement that I think this is a good House.  I think it has done good work in this session and in past sessions. But I also said that I think it is capable of being improved.  Like every human institution, it is capable of being improved.  I am simply arguing that one way of improving it is to get a section of the Seanad away from the Party system.  That is all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say a word on what Senator Carton said in his stimulating speech.  I think he argued&mdash;again on this exclusive approach&mdash;that local government politics and local politics were the best schools, so to speak, for national politics.  In fact I think he said that this was the only possible school, or something like that.  I say <Col N="2071" /> that there are many other such schools, and that in the vocational political arena, you get a different kind of schooling in politics which may be valuable.</P>
    <P>Now there is one argument which disturbs me in the whole debate and I concede it frankly.  Senator Ó Maoláin referred to it, as did Senator Crowley and others.  It is this: the danger that the wrong kind of politics&mdash;I shall not specify it&mdash; would get into the vocational bodies if more members of this Chamber were elected from them.  I agree that that is a risk, but I think it is a risk worth taking and I shall go back to that in a moment.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan spoke of two functions of the Seanad, quite rightly, one to review and revise legislation and the other to be a vocational body.  My claim is that until you get a larger proportion of people both nominated and elected by the vocational bodies, there will not be enough vocationalism. I know it is a matter of opinion, but it is my convinced opinion.  I do not want to launch any attack on the vocational members of this House&mdash;it would be most improper although the Minister has almost put it up to me. It is possible in some cases that we would get better representation of vocationalism if they were both elected and nominated by those bodies.</P>
    <P>The outside people I am referring to, these vocationalists whom I should like to bring in, are genuine politicians, are politically-minded.  Their first loyalty is to their country and their second loyalty is not to Party but to their vocation.  They do not answer the Party Whip.  At the moment those in this House who rely on some Party support for their election must quite often be torn in their decisions between what the Party line says and what their vocational supporters may say.  There is always a risk of this: I do not say it often actually happens.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan said with much truth that the only effective politicians were members of Parties.  By and large, that is true in Ireland today.  But is that the best thing for Ireland?  Would it not be better possibly if there was <Col N="2072" /> a kind of politician who would be separate from the Party, devoted to his country and its best interests, and with enough effective influence, as it were, to balance the Party system in respect to the body politic?  That is arguable. I cannot prove it would be the best thing, but I think it would be an improvement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Senator indicate what would happen if all those good people were to adopt that attitude?  Suppose all the Parties and all these good people were to be patriotic, and so on&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I say to Senator Ó Maoláin that I will not pursue that line of argument because it is completely irrelevant.  I refuse to discuss it.  We are discussing whether it would improve the Seanad to introduce 23 vocationalists, pure and simple, and I submit that Senator Ó Maoláin's inquiry is completely irrelevant. I am willing to discuss it in another case and on another occasion. I am now discussing the infusion of 23 pure vocationalists&mdash;I am not using the word &ldquo;pure&rdquo; as a nasty word, which it seems at the moment to be in this House&mdash;and I am simply saying that after their loyalty to their country, they would be devoted secondly to their vocation, whatever it is.  That is clear enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I could be provoked into severe retaliation along those lines but I shall not do so. I should like to sum up, Sir.  The main point at issue is whether the Seanad would be improved by gradually increasing the number of members whose second political loyalty is to their vocation rather than to a political Party.  I must emphasise again and again that the kind of vocationalist I see in this House, if this proposal is put through, will be an intelligent man who has had experience <Col N="2073" /> of the art of government in his own vocation&mdash;many of his duties may call for that&mdash;who would bring a new point of view on the art of government into this House, not a narrowminded expert.  Some people seem to be terribly frightened of the word &ldquo;expert&rdquo;, as if an expert had some malevolent power which could be switched on like a death ray on certain occasions while for the rest of the time, he would be as still as a comptometer or something of the kind.  It looks like that.</P>
      <P>Now I agree that such a man would be utterly unsuitable.  But the men I refer to would be expert in their vocation, would have experience of government in their own vocation and in the world in general, but would not be subject to the Party Whip.  The Party Whip is in some cases a good thing but in others perhaps not.  In other words, that is what is wanted by some of us&mdash;the Minister says two; I think approximately seven of those who have spoken, but I shall not quibble about numbers&mdash;and a great many people throughout the country must be included, as well.  That is perfectly clear.</P>
      <P>I should like to emphasise that my intention was not to attack politics, Party politics or politicians.  But there is in this country a strong body of sensible opinion saying that the Seanad could be improved.  I believe that this is true.  Senators must not jump to the other conclusion that I therefore think the Seanad is inefficient or bad. That is not so.  But it could and should be improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some bias is inevitable in politics. Besides our loyalty to the nation, we must have some kind of second jumping-off ground.  For most of the Senators here, it is the Party, and a very good jumping-off ground that is in many cases.  But I suggest that if we had others who could jump off from the vocational ground, we would get to a much higher level in our national politics.  I personally believe that there are many good citizens who would make excellent Senators who could play a fruitful part in politics but are prevented from doing so by not liking the Party system, either rightly or wrongly.  I suggest that there <Col N="2074" /> should not be an absolute bar&mdash;as it virtually is&mdash;to those people.  I suggest that we should enlist a greater number of those people in this House.  I believe this country is losing valuable political energy and wisdom by the virtual monopoly on the part of the political Parties.</P>
    <P>I shall end by emphasising one point. I admire this House.  I have spent a good deal of time in this House for the past 12 years.  I do not want to give the impression that I come here to disparage what has been done.  It is not my intention in any way to criticise the House.  That is certainly not so.  I am simply suggesting that a move along the lines recommended by the Commission might improve, strengthen and enrich the House.  I say there has been a strong demand for that in the country for some time. No better method than the one which has been laid down by the Commission has been suggested by anyone in this debate or anyone outside.  It is the only practical suggestion we have at the moment.  If we reject it, we shall stay where we are now.  If we cannot improve along those lines, if we refuse to make the experiment, I personally think it will be a pity: we should be slightly adventurous.</P>
    <P>The control of the House will remain largely with the Parties.  That is perfectly right.  They do most of the work &mdash;there is no doubt about that&mdash;but we should be slightly adventurous and increase the number of pure vocationalists in the House.  That would enrich the political life of the country.</P>
