    <P>Question again proposed: That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday evening, I had just been saying on this Bill that this was not the first report of a Board of Visitors in connection with the National University of Ireland. There was a report last year of a visitation sent to inquire into a point raised by Professor Henchy in the National University itself with regard to a Faculty of Law.  That visitation has reported and from the point of view of form and content and approach, I was about to compare these two reports.  The two reports I shall call by the name of the chairman in each case.</P>
      <P>The report which we are considering now, which I call the Murnaghan Report, does not contain a copy of the Petition which it was considering.  It does contain a sentence from Mr. Kenny's Petition but although it does give a number of other quotations, does not give his statement before the Visitors that if the titles were changed, that is, if the words &ldquo;College Lecturer&rdquo; were dropped, he would be content. The Report signed by Mr. Justice Ó Dálaigh gives the Petition with which it was dealing <i>in extenso.</i></P>
      <P>There is no acknowledgment in the present Report of a legal case presented in writing to the Visitors on behalf of the College but a number of findings are given which are not supported by any legal argument.  The Ó Dálaigh Report contains 13 pages of an appendix which I have before me, 13 pages of closely reasoned arguments on the law, which is headed, &ldquo;Reasons for the Board's Opinions&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1320" /> The Report which we are considering here does not give at any point any legal reason for the decisions arrived at.</P>
    <P>There are other contrasts between the procedure of the two visitations and between the two Reports.  The Ó Dálaigh Report notes that an informal meeting was held with the University authorities before formal proceedings could be begun.  That was in accordance with all precedent, the precedent, as I have said before, that these visitations come from the person who granted the Charter and are generally of a friendly character.  The Visitors to University College, Dublin, were asked by the authorities of the College to discuss informally the method and scope of the inquiry at a preliminary hearing.  They refused to do that.</P>
    <P>Having so refused, they circularised certain members of the staff, all the College Lecturers and Assistant College Lecturers, inviting submissions from them.  They wrote also to the National University of Ireland, to University College, Cork, University College, Galway and to Saint Patrick's College, Maynooth.  None of these bodies shared the view of the Visitors that the visitation to University College, Dublin, was any concern of theirs.  Perhaps I could be allowed to say.  Sir, that the Visitors threw their nets very wide but that the catch was small.  University College, Cork and University College, Galway made no submissions.  No College Lecturer and no Assistant Lecturer came forward to make any submission or give any evidence and the Senate of the University replied, as is made clear in the Report and made a little bit unclear as well in page 9 of the Report, by sending a copy of a Resolution passed by the Senate which refused to concede that there had been any irregularities at University College, Dublin.</P>
    <P>One professor and one University lecturer made submissions in favour of the Petition but did not appear before the Visitors to give any oral evidence.  The only persons who appeared in favour of the Petition were the Petitioner himself, Mr. Kenny, and Professor Henchy, who had made the <Col N="1321" /> Petition in connection with the National University of Ireland and who, during the course of the recent hearings, raised a further legal point with regard to University College, Dublin, and raised this point to the National University.</P>
    <P>That illustrates the point I was making about the application of a legal magnifying glass to our Charters. We have had two visitations and the threat of a third.  If the lawyers want to examine our Charters very carefully, they presumably can have any number of petitions and have any amount of difficulty raised in deciding what is the precise meaning of particular words in particular enactments.</P>
    <P>Let me come now to the specific matter upon which the Visitation were appointed.  Mr. John Kenny presented a Petition, the point of which was that the College has no power to bestow the title of College Lecturer upon persons who had been employed as Assistants in the main and who had given long service in that capacity in the College.  There can be no doubt that the College has power to appoint Assistants.  Assistants, who had given approved service, have been appointed and called College Lecturers which gives them higher salaries, increments and pensions and gives them a title which they prefer.</P>
    <P>May I say that the title &ldquo;Assistant&rdquo; has, I think, disappeared from most Universities in Britain and the title &ldquo;Lecturer&rdquo; has been substituted?  The net point in the Petition, therefore, was assumed to be a matter of titles, whether Assistants could be called College Lecturers after years of service. That and no more, was what was referred to the Visitors for determination by them.</P>
    <P>The Report of the Visitors on that point, which I shall quote later, is not particularly clear but it is accepted by the Minister and all of us as meaning that the College has not the power to give the title &ldquo;College Lecturer&rdquo;, to Assistants.  The Visitors, however, go far beyond that particular matter of legal interpretation&mdash;this is my point about irrelevancy&mdash;and set down verdicts against the Governing Body of <Col N="1322" /> University College, Dublin&mdash;in general they talk about the policy of the Governing Body&mdash;and against the President of University College, Dublin, in particular.  These verdicts read more like the factual findings of a jury than the reasoned decisions of judges.</P>
    <P>Inferentially, the Visitors condemned the Senate of the University and the General Council of County Councils.  It is worthy of note that when the 1908 Act was being passed, the local representatives in Cork and Galway were confined to the local bodies, in the one case, in Munster and in the other, in Connaught.  The local representatives for the Dublin College Governing Body were selected&mdash;the Lord Mayor of Dublin, a representative of the County Council of Dublin and eight representatives of the General Council of County Councils. Perhaps, the people who framed the 1908 Act had an idea that the Dublin College would, as has been proved to be the case, find students from all over the country.</P>
    <P>The Senate of the University, as I shall explain later on, also comes in for criticism from the Visitors.  The Rev. Dr. O'Rahilly, who for a number of years was in University College, Cork, and President of that College, stated in an article which appeared in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on May 10th that the Report contains irrelevancies, inaccuracies and insinuations.  These, it seems to me, are mild and charitable words in which to describe this document.</P>
    <P>The Petitioner, in the course of his evidence, said that if the titles were changed, he would be content but the Visitors were not content.  There are many quotations in the Report but this particular quotation from Mr. Kenny does not appear and is not quoted.  The Visitors travelled far beyond the question of titles and they insinuated in the Report, in the last paragraph, that a change had been made in the method of appointment which could lend itself to patronage. The Report is explicitly confined by the Visitors to the past 10 years. Therefore, one must assume that that word &ldquo;patronage&rdquo; was used to imply <Col N="1323" /> that there was a change in the method of appointment and that the present President and the Governing Body are guilty of patronage.</P>
    <P>The system of making appointments has not been changed.  Mr. John Kenny, the Petitioner in this case, was appointed a couple of years ago as an Assistant to the Law Faculty on the nomination of Professor Patrick McGilligan after his name had gone to the Academic Council and the Governing Body.  I was appointed in January, 1912, quite a long time ago, on the nomination of a Professor of French and by exactly the same process as that under which Mr. Kenny became an assistant in University College, Dublin, a couple of years ago. The President, it has been alleged, has power to appoint people on the academic staff.  That is not so.</P>
    <P>In order that there will be no question of being invidious, let me take my own case.  If I wanted, as I did want since I became Professor, an Assistant, I would have to find out first whether money would be provided. I wanted an Assistant to deal with Scottish Gaelic.  I did not want to appoint a University Lecturer and be saddled for years with somebody whom I had not seen at work.  I wanted to get somebody who would come here and work as an assistant, and be promoted, perhaps, later.  I established first whether money would be forthcoming.  Then, not by advertisement, but by writing to the Professor in Glasgow and the Professor in Edinburgh and to the only person alive, as far as I know, Mr. Calum MacLean, who is a native speaker of Scottish Gaelic and a first-class speaker of Irish and who knew something about our circumstances, we got a man and paid his expenses over here.  The Lecturer in Modern Irish and I saw him. He said he would come but, unfortunately, instead of coming to Dublin, he went to Cyprus in the British Army as a conscript.  The man we got a couple of years afterwards wrote in September to say that he had got a far bigger salary in Glasgow.  Our choice must have been very good.  We finally got <Col N="1324" /> somebody who is an Irish speaker because he is married to a native Irish speaker.  Because of that, he will presumably be anxious to stay in this country.  Native speakers of Scotch Gaelic with a University education are very often students for the Presbyterian ministry and naturally do not desire to come here.</P>
    <P>That has to go to the Celtic Faculty. The Celtic Faculty contains people who know Irish extremely well and are good judges.  It goes to the Academic Council and the Academic Council contains other people who know Irish well.  It then goes to the Finance Committee and then to the Governing Body.  All that would dispose of the charge of patronage.  I think that in the Report of this body, which was not asked to deal with this matter, the introduction of a word charged with a certain amount of emotion and atmosphere like patronage is quite unworthy of three gentlemen of judicial standing.</P>
    <P>On page 4, the Board finds&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  That the College Lecturers and Assistant Lecturers are not Assistants whom the College is empowered to appoint and remove by virtue of the College Charter, Clause III (5).</P>
    <P>It therefore appears that College Lecturers are not Assistants.  On the other hand, on page 7 of the Report, the Board states that &ldquo;it is satisfied that the members of the staff involved are in fact Lecturers&rdquo;.  To the reader, therefore, it would appear that Lecturers under the provisions of certain documents are not Assistants but that Assistants in truth and in fact are Lecturers.  Nowhere in the Report is there any definition of the word &ldquo;Lecturer&rdquo;.  It would be interesting to have such a definition and to a layman it would appear that such a definition is necessary.  The Visitors make no suggestion as to how this difficulty of their own creation is to be got over.  Perhaps this peculiar situation could be more adequately dealt with in Irish where there are two verbs &ldquo;to be&rdquo;, one of identity and the other of being or essence.  A <Col N="1325" /> member of the Staff of University College, Dublin, could say: &ldquo;Nílim im léachtóir feasta, ach cé déarfadh ná. gur léachtóir mé?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I can't be called a Lecturer for the future but who will deny that I am a Lecturer?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Page 9 of the Report is a further excellent example of the state of mind of the person who drafted this Report.  The statement is made on page 9 that the course adopted by University College, Dublin, &ldquo;might affect not only the University but the other Constituent Colleges.&rdquo;  None of these bodies, however, appeared before the Board and, in the words of Rev. Dr. O'Rahilly, the Visitors have &ldquo;sorrowfully&rdquo; to admit that the Senate of the University also refused to adopt the Board's interpretation.</P>
    <P>On page 9 of the Report we read: &ldquo;A special meeting of the Senate was held on the 13th February, 1958, to consider the Committee's report.  It was agreed by a majority of 15 to 5 (there were 28 members recorded as being present) &lsquo;That the Senate take no further action, not being convinced that there has been irregularity in the proceedings of University College, Dublin.&rsquo;  As far as the Board is aware, the Senate did not obtain the legal opinion suggested by this Committee.&rdquo; The 28 members are put in juxtaposition with the vote so as to convey the impression that 20 people voted but that 28 people were present.</P>
    <P>That statement is untrue and the visitors must surely have known it was untrue.  It must surely be an example of wilful misrepresentation of the proceedings of the Senate of the National University of Ireland. There is only one way of finding out how many people are present.  The minutes are given with the list of people present.  As you go in, you sign your name in a book.  The writer of this Report must have totted up the names.  I accept his tot&mdash;he is probably right.  Twenty-eight is the number.  But he says &ldquo;there were 28 members recorded as being present.&rdquo;  He omits &ldquo;at the meeting&rdquo; for the purpose of giving a particular colour to what happened when the vote was taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>He does not state the fact.  Let me get this clear. Everybody here and everybody who has ever attended a county council meeting or any other meeting knows that the number of people recorded as present at a meeting and the number of people present for a vote are two completely different things.</P>
      <P>Let me repeat, because apparently I have not made myself clear to some of my friends opposite.  The vote is stated.  The motion is carried by 15 votes to 5.  On page 9 of the Report, we read:</P>
      <P>It was agreed by a majority of 15 to 5 (there were 28 members recorded as being present) ...</P>
      <P>The words &ldquo;at the meeting&rdquo; are omitted to convey the impression to the reader that 20 people voted and that eight other people present did not vote.  That interpretation is not true.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>In this view, I am apparently supported by the Reverend Dr. O'Rahilly who says that the Visitors have &ldquo;sorrowfully&rdquo; to admit that the Senate of the University also refused to adopt the board's interpretation. The Visitors are at pains to convey that there were eight people present who did not vote.  All of us who have experience of general elections, by-elections and Seanad elections, know the old story about the people who did not vote.  They were always on my side, were they not?  It is not always true but that is the argument and that is what is meant to be conveyed here&mdash;that eight people who were present did not vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing in the minutes of the Senate of the National University can justify such a conclusion.  I was present and I know the conclusion is not true. Though the conclusion is untrue and indeed misleading, it does show the state of mind of the person who drafted the Report.  He regrets that the Senate passed such a Resolution because his own mind is made up in another <Col N="1327" /> direction.  It is the mind of an anxious advocate rather than a detached investigator.</P>
    <P>On page 4 of the Report, there are two findings, one dealing with the present policy of the Governing Body about which the Report gives no details, no explanations and no reasons. The second finding is with regard to the President of University College, Dublin.  On that finding, an immense outpouring of filth has resulted.</P>
    <P>What is said is that &ldquo;the failure to take the proper and necessary steps to fill vacancies in these &lsquo;statutory offices&rsquo; is a breach of the duties imposed on the President of the College by Statute I, chapter iv, section 17 and chapter xiv, section I.&rdquo;  Not a single word or argument is stated to prove that.  No summary evidence in support of that charge is given.  That is simply left there and the board passes on.  In other words, they take the head of our most important educational institution, accuse him of a breach of duty and pass gaily on to give us disquisitions about whether Professors should be in control of their departments.</P>
    <P>The clear intention here is to imply that when a Professor dies or resigns, his post must be filled and that somewhere in the Statutes there is placed upon the President the duty of taking &ldquo;the proper and necessary steps to fill vacancies in statutory offices.&rdquo;  No such words as the words used in the Report are to be found in the Charter, statute or anywhere else.  They are words invented by the writer of the Report. One would imagine that, in a matter so important as this, words would have been carefully weighed and that the words used would have been the words in the statute but that is not so.</P>
    <P>No such words as these used by the Visitors occur anywhere except in the Report.  As the words stand in the Report, they are incorrect, inaccurate and misleading.  They are certainly unfortunate and far from what one would expect from judicial personages. The Visitors should surely have adverted to the fact that when a Professor or a University Lecturer dies or resigns, there are four different courses open to the College: The first <Col N="1328" /> is that the Governing Body may go ahead and fill the vacancy; the second is that they may alter the Statute governing the office and create new conditions; the third is&mdash;and it is not stated at all here&mdash;they may &ldquo;extinguish the office&rdquo;; and they may adjourn or postpone consideration of the vacancy for any period they please. One would imagine that the Board of Visitors would have adverted to these four choices.  In the light of these provisions, showing that the office could be entirely abolished or extinguished, the implication that the President of the College has the duty to take steps to fill a vacancy must surely be considered to be wrong.  How does anybody have a duty to take proper steps to fill a vacancy when in fact somebody else has a right to keep the vacancy from being filled at all?  That is the position.  It is a well-known position and anybody could have told the Visitors.</P>
    <P>The Visitors, when dealing with the President of our largest and most important educational institution, should surely have sought some evidence from both sides.  They should have inquired and revealed whether the failure was substantial or merely formal.  Everybody has a number of duties imposed on him.  Some are substantial and some are merely formal.  For my own part, I have substantial duties, such as the duties of an examiner, and I have formal duties such as notifying a colleague, perhaps in Cork, of something.  If in a week when I have examinations, as I had last week for four days, I do not write a letter to somebody which I should, that surely could be regarded as a formal breach of duty.  It is quite a different thing from not performing my substantial duties.</P>
    <P>If they concluded after inquiry that there had been failure, surely the Visitors might have found out what was the practice of former Presidents of University College, Dublin, before Dr. Michael Tierney took office, and they surely might have found out what the present practice is in the other Colleges and what it has been in the other Colleges.</P>
    <P>Another point arises on this charge <Col N="1329" /> regarding the President of University College, Dublin.  No notice was ever given to the President of University College, Dublin, of this accusation. No effort was made by the Visitors to hear what the President or any other officer had to say about this accusation. There is no indication on the face of the Report that any evidence was obtained by the Visitors to support the accusation or the finding.  The finding carefully omits to state what precise duty it is in which they find the President has failed.  There is a reference to a College Statute which is not quoted. It states &ldquo;He shall report without delay to the Vice-Chancellor the occurrence of a vacancy in any Professorship or Lectureship of the College to which the University is entitled to appoint.&rdquo;  The Visitors do not advert to the fact, surely a very interesting fact, that for four of the ten years in question the President was himself Vice-Chancellor.  Did he fail in his duty by not notifying Vice-Chancellor Michael Tierney of the existence of a vacancy in the College presided over by President Michael Tierney?  Was he expected to make reports to himself or is there evidence available that he did not give reports to himself?  Is there any evidence from any other Vice-Chancellor?  There is no Vice-Chancellor referred to as giving evidence.</P>
    <P>The second reference is to Chapter XIV, section 1, where it is disclosed&mdash; and it is presumed the Visitors have read that&mdash;that the Governing Body can alter the Statute dealing with the office or can extinguish the office altogether.  I find it difficult to understand how three judicial personages are able to make a finding of this character.  If a schoolboy were accused of not having a light on his bicycle he would get a summons stating what Section of what Act he had contravened.  He could appear before a Court either himself, or his father or solicitor or barrister could represent him.  Evidence would be heard about him but here the President of University College, Dublin, is condemned without any evidence, without notice being given to him, without any evidence being heard from him or on his behalf.  The public position and <Col N="1330" /> the personal reputation of the President of University College, Dublin, are as important as those of any Judge in any Court of the land.  He has been condemned and held up to public odium without notice to him, without being heard and as far as this document shows without any evidence of any kind.  He has been so condemned not by a Court or by any finding which has legal force or effect.  These people were not a Court and their finding unsupportable by evidence and unsupported by any form of justification has been to vilify Dr. Michael Tierney and to decry everyone, whether Professor or County Councillor who has been concerned in the government of University College, Dublin.</P>
    <P>There are other things one could say in regard to notice to the Vice-Chancellor. When a Professor dies, they pass a vote of sympathy in the Academic Council.  Is that notice to the Vice-Chancellor?  One could imagine this President in some rather occult and devious manner preventing University College, Dublin, from knowing there were statutory vacancies. How could he do that?  When a Professor dies a vote of sympathy is passed at the Governing Body.  When a Professor resigns, when he has passed the statutory period and is going out on pension the Governing Body fixes his pension and gratuity.  Perhaps that is not notice.  Mark you, I have never heard of a statutory vacancy about which everybody did not know but yet these people made this accusation lightheartedly and then passed on. It is a matter of great importance and their behaviour in that matter is entirely unworthy of any person holding a judicial position.</P>
    <P>Before I come to the Bill&mdash;and I am sure.  Sir, you are wondering if I am coming to the Bill&mdash;may I make a few other remarks about this Report?  On Page 4 of the Report, the third finding is that &ldquo;The College Lecturers and Assistant Lecturers are paid out of public funds&rdquo;.  Again, there is the suppression of certain information. The funds of the College out of which everybody is paid are a single fund.  It is made up of students' fees and Government <Col N="1331" /> grants and a very small amount of income comes from bequests of one kind or another.  The Government grants at the moment are higher than the students' fees but there is not much difference and it is about fifty-fifty.  One would imagine that the Visitors, if they were to be accurate, would have stated that they were paid out of a mixed fund which consists, for more than half of its income, of an amount from Government grants but they do not say that.</P>
    <P>On page 7&mdash;I have said that they did not grasp some of these things&mdash;there is a paragraph at the end of the page which discusses certain principles of University organisation.  One of them is a principle which I never heard of, but that perhaps is not important. Quite clearly, the Visitors are unaware of the difference between a Department and a Faculty.  I think most educated people know the difference between a Faculty and a Department.</P>
    <P>The paragraph reads: &ldquo;In the third place it was put forward that from the purely administrative point of view&rdquo;&mdash; I am not quite clear what that means here&mdash;&ldquo;it was preferable to have a Faculty or Department headed by a Professor...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister of course knows that there is a difference between the Medical Faculty and a Department of anatomy or physiology or any of these things.  Perhaps it is a small point but the people who wrote this report and made grave charges and who spent a long time reading documents and hearing evidence&mdash;at the end of all their labours they are unable to distinguish the elementary difference between a Faculty and a Department.  They go on to say:</P>
    <P>As against this view it was submitted that it was a bad University principle to have a Professor in absolute charge of his Faculty or Department.</P>
    <P>I do not understand that.  The National University of Ireland is depending on an Act of Parliament, on a Charter and Statutes.  We happen to be bound, as, for example, Trinity College is not bound, to give <Col N="1332" /> lectures, to hold examinations and only to give decrees to people who attend a suitable course of lectures and who have passed examinations. To carry out these duties, we need an organisation and surely organisation implies authority.  Surely the notion that a Professor should not be in charge of his department is a very difficult one to grasp.  I do not understand what it means.  It may be a University principle very much discussed but I do not remember reading of a discussion of it in anything I ever came across.</P>
    <P>Take my own case.  In the month of May, I happen to be responsible for the oral examination of 500 students or between University examinations and College examinations nearly 600 students, I think, and this year, owing to the fact that there is an oral examination in Matriculation Irish, the province of Leinster is also the domain of the Professor in Dublin and that also has to be arranged for.  How could it be done if I did not have a staff and had not control over it?  What is in the Visitors' mind, I wonder, about not having a Professor in control of the staff? It is not apparently on the question of academic freedom.  Apparently the academic freedom is to say: &ldquo;Oh, you are right but I am going home.&rdquo; The Visitors do not understand what they are discussing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>And they are quite right.  But what is the question of principle?  I never heard of the principle that the Professor was not to be in charge of his department. <Col N="1333" /> I never heard that and I do not know how it is to be argued. They had time to tell us that; they had time and room to tell us that they were not going to express any opinion about it but they had no room to tell us what evidence they had against the President of University College, Dublin.</P>
      <P>I know what is wrong about it.  The word &ldquo;control&rdquo; is confused.  They think that the control of staff means that you tell the staff what to do and also tell them, when you are a Professor, what to say.  That is also something I never came across.  I never heard of it.  The first thing I ever did as far back as 1912 was when a Frenchman handed me a syllabus for First Year and said: &ldquo;Go into that class and do that.&rdquo;  And I was never told what to say ever since.  I never told anybody since.  I have been Assistant, Acting Professor, University Lecturer and Professor in charge of a big department and I certainly have never dictated to anybody what they should say and I never heard of anybody in University College, Dublin, giving such dictation.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, we had a particular case of a controversy recently in the new spelling of Irish and when a particular assistant of mine expressed the view to me that he had certain opinions about it, all I said was: &ldquo;Well, you go in and tell the Third Year Honours Class your own opinion.&rdquo; And he did.  That is my idea of University education.  Evidently the Board of Visitors think freedom of expression does not operate in University College, Dublin.  They are quite wrong.</P>
      <P>A final word on this.  This whole arrangement was made or was intended to improve the conditions of the staff concerned.  University Professors and University Lecturers.  They have received increments, pensions and titles as indicated and, as indicated in this report, a five-year contract was offered to a certain number of them recently. It might very well have been that the time spent by the College officers on this visitation might have been more profitably devoted to further improving the general position of the staff.</P>

    <P>University College, Dublin, is carrying <Col N="1334" /> out a very important piece of work under appallingly bad conditions and with a chronic shortage of money.  The Governing Body, various Governing Bodies and various Presidents&mdash;Governing Bodies for the past 12 years and President Michael Tierney&mdash;have worked what must be called literally miracles in the circumstances.  Is it to be expected that we should do our work as a Chartered Body with a lawyer looking over our shoulder parsing and construing the Charter and Statutes and insisting on that construction without any regard to the facts for needs of development?  Such a situation would be intolerable.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, in the Dáil, a very good example of it occurred and I intend to advert to that.  We were threatened with that kind of situation and we did not accept it in the Governing Body of University College, Dublin.  We were told of a legal opinion which declared that we had not power to call certain persons on the staff Lecturers.  We refused to get legal opinion on that and the non-academic members from county councils were most strongly against getting any further legal opinion.  As a matter of fact, as a member of the Governing Body myself, I got a legal opinion through a solicitor from a very eminent counsel and I found that it fortified the view which the Governing Body had.</P>
    <P>But see how futile it would be for us to get legal opinion.  Yesterday we had proceedings in the Dáil and there was a very clear statement from the Taoiseach which illustrates how right University College, Dublin, was not to get entangled in this business of legal opinions.  It was made clear by the Taoiseach, as he said, that over many years a certain meaning had been given by the State, by the officers of State, by various Attorneys General and by the Courts to the words &ldquo;term&rdquo; and &ldquo;sitting&rdquo;.  Now, it appears by a Court decision that the law has been declared to be otherwise.  That is a very interesting commentary on the common-sense displayed by University College, Dublin.</P>
    <P>Three High Court Judges, the Taoiseach said, including the President of the High Court, held that the words <Col N="1335" />&ldquo;term&rdquo; and &ldquo;sitting&rdquo; had always been properly construed.  The Chief Justice and one Supreme Court Judge agreed that the position existing over many years was correct.  Three Supreme Court Judges&mdash;two of whom had been Attorneys General, by the way&mdash;held otherwise and since they constituted a majority of the Supreme Court, that settled the interpretation of the law in 1960.  Five out of eight Superior Judges held one opinion and three others another, so that University College, Dublin, might have got five opinions in favour of what it was doing and three against and still find that, on judicial interpretation, they were wrong.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, if these three gentlemen who were Visitors had been acting in fact as a court and making a judicial decision on this matter they might still have been wrong&mdash;their opinion might be reversed.  In the words of the well-known medieval Irish character Mac Conglinne &ldquo;Is caol an rud an dlí&rdquo;.  That is very hard to translate but it means the law is a difficult, subtle and unpredictable thing. It is all said in one word in Irish. &ldquo;Is caol an rud an dlí&rdquo;.  Thus U.C.D. could have got any number of legal opinions, and we might still in the long run, be proved not to be right according to the letter of the law. What we were doing was giving better conditions to our staff, and what the Department and the State have been doing is keeping people in jail contrary to what is now declared to be the law. That is very interesting.  Is it to be said that they have been acting illegally over all those years?  Speaking for myself, I hope not.</P>
    <P>Is it to be assumed as some overenthusiastic Professor of law stated at Convocation that the Government and those Attorneys General were failing to recognise the rule of law because the Supreme Court decided a few days ago that views held for years were wrong?  Surely not.  Yet all these accusations have been made against University College, Dublin.  I think there was even a photograph in the papers of Doctor Michael Tierney as <Col N="1336" /> the lawbreaker.  They can add to that photograph now, a photograph of a few ex-Attorneys General and various judges.  There would be a great gallery.  All this abuse that has been cast upon us is quite without foundation.</P>
    <P>Charters are not meant to be strait-jackets and have rarely been so interpreted. Very few bodies can work to rule.  As a matter of fact, when busmen start working to rule, is not that the same as a strike?  Is not working to rule something near to chaos?  Does it not mean that people are late for work, for meals and for everything?  I wonder if a careful examination of the rules of court would not disclose that the judges, in the interests of justice and in the interest of the speedy transaction of business, do not always carry out the letter of the rule.  In this House, if all the work were carried out to the letter of the Standing Orders, business would be very considerably slowed up. Certainly in the Dáil, in my experience, if the letter of the law of Standing Orders were carried out, a great many amendments would never appear on the Order Paper in so far as you have to give, or send to Leinster House, the whole matter in writing signed by two Deputies.  Think of what that would mean if it were proposed that the Standing Orders should be rigidly enforced. It is not done.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil, on the conclusion of the Second Reading of a Bill, the rule is that the Ceann Comhairle puts the question at once.  He does not always do that.  If there is a Bill&mdash;and there are a great many such Bills&mdash;on which no political passion has been engendered, the Ceann Comhairle allows people to ask rather elaborate questions because by doing so, the next stage is shortened and he allows the Minister to answer those questions.  I remember shocking a very eminent front bench member of the Opposition in Leinster House when I was in the Chair.  He asked would the Ceann Comhairle read a Standing Order and I said: &ldquo;The Ceann Comhairle has not read the Standing Orders for years.&rdquo;  He was very shocked.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Bill itself which is based on the acceptance of the <Col N="1337" /> Report, it seems to me that Section 3 is unnecessary.  On the argument I have made and which was made to the Visitors, the acts done by University College, Dublin, were not invalid because they were all done in good faith under the Charter for the furtherance of the objects of the Charter. Assistants who had given good service were classified as College Lecturers, as a form of promotion, carrying a higher salary scale and a more acceptable title.  That was done in good faith, with the consent and approval of the Governing Body, for the better performance of the teaching functions of the college.  I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Report carefully avoided saying that the appointments were invalid or that any illegalities were involved.  In our view, they were legal and valid.  The Minister, however, presumably after taking advice, has come to the conclusion that this Bill is necessary and that it is for the benefit of University College, and I accept that view.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill, to which I made some allusion last night, on its face appears to give the College power to appoint college lecturers for limited periods, until such time as a University Commission shall have reported. The Minister, however, has given a different construction.  It seems to him that the College will have power to appoint College Lecturers but not power to create the office of College Lecturer.  I think I am correct in that. He has now brought the University Senate into the picture.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether he has examined the University Charter and the practice of the Senate, but it appears to me that the scheme outlined by the Minister would be difficult to work.  I cannot speak for University College, Dublin, but I presume they will do their best to work it.  It gives to the Senate of the University powers which it has never heretofore enjoyed.  I wonder is it worth the Minister's while to examine the Charter of the University and see whether in fact the Senate of the University has the powers already or <Col N="1338" /> whether the section needs to give the powers.  At the same time, I should like to go on record as not being enthusiastic, to put it in its mildest form, about the notion that the Charter should be amended by a public Bill.</P>
    <P>The Senate of the University has no machinery available to it to make some of the decisions on which the Minister has spoken.  If a college decides it needs a lecturer in a particular subject, the Senate of the University, I think, has no machinery to enable it to decide whether it should be a College Lecturer or a University Lecturer.  However, we can go into all that on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The real lesson from all these proceedings is that the Colleges of the National University and the University itself should have power to suggest to the Government amendments to the various Charters.  It was by the exercise of the Royal prerogative that the Government appointed visitors to the College.  Would it not be possible to exercise the same prerogative to alter or amend the Charters which were framed more than 50 years ago?</P>
    <P>This is the position which obtains in Queen's University, Belfast, and in Dublin University, or Trinity College. Trinity College is a private University which has a Charter and it receives grants from public funds.  The visitors to Trinity College are their own Chancellor and Mr. Justice Kingsmill Moore.  But Trinity College has the right, presumably after certain internal processes, to suggest to the Government an amendment to its Charter and the Government, after consideration, are enabled to make such amendments.  That surely is what should be done in the case of University College, Dublin, and its sister colleges.  We should not be put in an inferior position to another College in Dublin city with regard to the amending of our Charter.</P>
    <P>The Bill and the Report have been made an occasion of gross misrepresentation and venomous personal attacks upon University College, Dublin, as an institution and upon its principal officers.</P>
    <P>The reason for that is not far to <Col N="1339" /> seek.  University College, Dublin, is a success.  Under the guidance of successive Presidents and Governing Bodies and particularly in the past 12 years, with different Governing Bodies and under Dr. Michael Tierney, it has overcome enormous difficulties.  Lack of space is one&mdash;it is as difficult to get a room in University College, Dublin at 7 o'clock in the evening as it is at 10 o'clock in the morning.  That is a fact.  Lack of money; a steadily increasing student body; an ever-changing and widening scope for University work&mdash;as every University man knows, the whole scope of University work is increasing; and the need to fit University College to fill the needs of a modern State.</P>
    <P>When University College was established in 1909, when it came into the National University, there was one Professor of Engineering, Professor Pierce Purcell, who is happily still with us.  Then a Professorship of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering was created.  Then electrical engineering was separated and a Professor of Electrical Engineering was appointed. Then a few years ago, a Professor of Chemical Engineering was appointed. Not being in that particular Faculty and not pretending to special knowledge, I am not sure whether they are finished.</P>
    <P>Obviously there are things which, if we had the money and the space, we ought to do.  For example, there ought to be a Chair of Russian History and there ought to be a Chair of American History.  We are at the present moment teaching a considerable amount of Russian but we have no Lectureship in that subject yet.  May I say that there were proceedings, not the same, but similar to this, a long time ago, in 1917, when a far-seeing President of University College, Cork, thought he would like to have a Lectureship in Russian in University College, Cork? That shows how go ahead they are there.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in the present atomic age, there are all kinds of things we ought to have which we have not got the money to get.  But, in the light of its achievements.  University College has every reason to be proud.  With <Col N="1340" /> the consent and assistance of various Governments, it has acquired a very fine site for its buildings adjacent to the city.  It has received from the Dáil, on the motion of the present Minister for Education, overwhelming approval for the moving of the College to an adequate site and for the beginning of the provision of adequate buildings. It is grateful to those who have helped it.  I think, Sir, it will survive its critics and play an increasingly important rôle in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I deal with some of the matters in the Bill, I should like to compliment Senator Hayes on the very spirited defence he has made of the College authorities.  It is a pity in a way that he did not come to the legal profession because he has used with great skill two devices well known to the legal profession. It is well known that if you have a really bad case, you do two things: you get into a row with the judge, if you can, and, secondly, you put forward submissions which are as irrelevant as possible.  Senator Hayes has done both these things very skilfully but I am confident that when the dust has settled, the facts concerning this matter will be just as clear as they were before Senator Hayes started.</P>
      <P>The Bill before the Seanad is one which must be of considerable interest to every member here but I have no doubt that it is of special interest to any graduate of the University. U.C.D. is entitled to the loyalty of its graduates.  It is entitled to the loyalty of anyone in this country who appreciates the very valuable work which it has done in the building of the nation during the past 50 years.  It has many achievements to its credit.  It has many outstanding graduates.  It has many eminent men on its staff.  But those who have the interests of U.C.D. at heart cannot overlook the situation which has been disclosed by the report of the Visitors appointed by the Government.  It would, be of no service, in my view, to U.C.D. to pretend that nothing was wrong.  The aim of anybody who has the interests of the College at heart should be, not to try to hide what has happened, but to try as far as possible to put the position in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1341" /> It has been suggested that nothing is really wrong at all.  Senator Hayes does not admit that anything was wrong.  The suggestion in letters to the paper, and so on, is that all this has been a storm in a teacup and that it was only a quibble about titles.  Anyone accepting the report of the Visitors cannot agree that the controversial situation that has been disclosed is merely a matter of titles.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that, practically without exception, those who have defended the position that has been disclosed in U.C.D. are people connected with the University.  Many of these people, indeed, have a personal interest in the existing system in the College.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have none, Sir. I am too old.  It is very sad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Consequently, when we are considering whether or not there is anything wrong in U.C.D., we have to decide for ourselves whether we shall get a picture which is more likely to be a correct picture of the situation there from the Visitors who were sent there by the Government or from these interested parties.</P>
      <P>The Board of Visitors consisted of three distinguished and disinterested judges.  They made a report which sets out their findings.  They had no axe to grind in this.  They had no interest.  They can be regarded as detached observers who went in and reported on matters as they found them.  Any reasonable person must take the view that we are more likely to get a true picture of the situation which has existed in the College from these three Visitors than from the people who have been defending the practices who, in almost all cases, are interested parties or, at least, parties connected with the University College.</P>
      <P>Consequently, I have no hesitation whatever in accepting the Visitors' report and their findings and in considering this Bill and in considering the situation which has arisen, in any statements I make and any decisions I come to, I am going on the basis that I accept the Visitors' report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the Visitors deserve the thanks of the Government who <Col N="1342" /> appointed them and of this House for the very clear and very objective report which they gave on the situation they found during their visitation.  Not only do they deserve our thanks but they deserve to be defended against the very clumsy and irrelevant attacks which have been made upon them in the Dáil and in this House and in various other quarters.  They deserve to be defended and they have not been defended up to now.  Anybody in this House who accepts their Report should say, when they are accepting the Report, that the judges are worthy of thanks and of defence.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask Senator Hayes whether he proposes to vote for this Bill or not.  For nine-tenths of his speech, his case seemed to be that there was no reason or no necessity whatever for this Bill.  Consequently, if he is sincere and consistent in his view that this Report is all wrong, that there is no necessity to validate what has happened, that there have been no illegalities or irregularities, he should vote against this Bill. Anyone who is in favour of the Bill cannot, to my mind, consistently reject the Report.  If you are for the Report, you are for the Bill, but if you are not for the Report and if you do not accept it, then, to be consistent, you must also be against the Bill because if the Report is wrong, if the findings of the Report are wrong, if there are no irregularities, then there is no need for this Bill, or to put it another way: it is only because the Report is right that the Bill is necessary. I accept the Report and, consequently, I believe the Bill is necessary.</P>
    <P>I believe it is necessary, in the first place, to validate certain appointments which have been made because otherwise a number of innocent parties might suffer.  If a number of people who were appointed were suddenly to discover that their appointments were invalid, I think it would be quite unfair to them.  For their sake, I think the second part of the Bill is necessary.</P>
    <P>I think it is also necessary because there were certain members of the Governing Body who voted for these appointments and if the appointments <Col N="1343" /> were invalid and if public moneys were wrongly used in paying these people, then it is possible that the members of the Governing Body could be surcharged. There are some members of the Governing Body who can be described as innocent parties.  They were probably given the impression that what was happening was quite all right and that they need not worry about it.  They are all adult people who should have made it their business to make sure that what they were doing was correct.  I am describing them in a loose way as innocent parties in this.  I think they should be given the benefit of the doubt and be protected by the portion of the Bill which validates what has happened.</P>
    <P>The first part of the Bill deals with appointments for a temporary period in the future.  I think that also is necessary, but I also think they should be for a very short time.  The Bill gives power to make certain appointments for two years and possibly for a further two.  Personally, I think that it a bit too long, but I do agree that it is necessary.  While the situation is being remedied and while the Commission on Higher Education is sitting, it is necessary to allow a certain system of appointments to carry on for the moment.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes said that he did not understand what Section 2 meant.  I watched him carefully, when he was saying that, to see if his tongue was in his cheek.  I could not see whether it was or not.  I think it must be quite clear to him exactly what the section means.  Up to now, only the National University of Ireland could make appointments of lecturers, but under the Bill U.C.D. will be given the power to make the actual appointment of College Lecturers, if the National University creates the post of College Lecturer.  That seems to me to be quite clear, and I fail to understand how Senator Hayes, who must have given this matter very considerable thought, could not understand what Section 2 meant.</P>

      <P>Senator Hayes on a number of occasions during his speech rather laboured the point that no illegal acts were committed by the Governing Body.  I suppose in a sense that is correct, because what happened were breaches of the Charters. He may be correct in saying that merely to commit a breach of the Charters is not an illegal act.  I make him a present of that legal quibble.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of what has happened is merely a breach of the Charters but some of what has happened is also an illegal act.  In this sense, it is illegal.  The 1908 University Act laid down in Section 7 that any sums paid under the section shall be applied by the Governing Body in accordance with the Charter or the Statutes.  Accordingly, any appointments which were made and any College Lecturers who were appointed in breach of Charter and were subsequently paid, were paid partly out of public funds.  That was clearly in defiance <Col N="1345" /> of the Act of 1908 and clearly an illegal action.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested, as I said earlier, that it was only a question of title that was involved in this matter, but let us take, for instance, the attempt some years ago to appoint a Professor of Econometrics.  It was proposed to appoint Mr. Geary.  It is quite clear in that case that that was more than a question of title.  It cannot be suggested&mdash;I do not think anybody would attempt to suggest&mdash;that Mr. Geary whom it was proposed to appoint would be merely an Assistant and that he was going to be called Professor. In that case, there was clearly an attempt to appoint somebody, to call him something which was clearly in breach of the Charter.  That was not by any stretch of the imagination merely a question of title because I am quite sure that if he had been appointed, the salary which he would have been paid would be the same as that of any other Professor and not the same as an Assistant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of fact. Let me quote from page 5 of the Board of Visitors' Report in relation to the appointment of Mr. Geary as College Professor in 1956:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  &ldquo;That the Governing Body is of opinion that legal advice in writing be obtained as to the legality of the proposed College Professorship of Econometrics in University College, Dublin in relation to the Charters of the National University of Ireland and University College, Dublin as a Constituent College, respectively;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>(2)  that the proposer told the meeting that he had obtained legal opinion to the effect that the Governing Body would not be legally entitled to make such an appointment, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1346" /> (3)  that after discussion the motion was defeated.</P>
    <P>The Minutes of 26th June, 1956, record:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  that the proposer of the resolution at the earlier meeting stated that a legal opinion by Senior and Junior Counsel had been circulated to all members of the Governing Body and that on the basis thereof he opposed the appointment of Dr. Geary, and</P>
    <P>(2)  that Dr. Geary was appointed by a large majority.</P>
    <P>That was an appointment, or an attempted appointment, which was clearly going far beyond the question of title.  It was an appointment that was made, in spite of the fact that legal opinion had been given that the College was not entitled to make it.</P>
    <P>Of course, legal opinion can be wrong but the Governing Body made no attempt to get any legal opinion or to investigate the matter.  The attitude was that they wanted to make the appointment and, regardless of whether or not they were entitled to make the appointment, they proposed to do it.</P>
    <P>It has been said, as far as the College authorities are concerned, that legal opinions are like impure thoughts: they are things that are no harm to have but you must not entertain them.  It seems clear that the other appointments.  Lectureships, were made in the same spirit as the appointment or purported appointment of Professor Geary.  I do not think there was any difference in the attitude.  I think both were made in breach of Charter.  In neither case was it merely a question of title.</P>
    <P>The Visitors expressly found in connection with the appointment not only of Professors but of Lecturers:</P>
    <P>(1)  That the College Lecturers and Assistant Lecturers are not Assistants whom the College is empowered to appoint and remove by virtue of the College Charter Clause III (5);</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1347" /> (2)  That the College Lecturers and Assistant Lecturers are appointed by the Governing Body to offices so described;</P>
    <P>(3)  That the College Lecturers and Assistant Lecturers are paid out of public funds.</P>
    <P>The Visitors also found, in connection with these appointments, as reported on Page 8 of the Report:</P>
    <P>The question whether or not the College has the power to appoint College Lecturers and Assistant Lecturers depends on the terms of the College Charter.  It is unnecessary to set out in detail the arguments advanced in support of the claim of the College that it has power to appoint not only College Lecturers and Assistant Lecturers but also College Professors, but having given careful consideration to the submissions of Counsel the Board has no doubt but that on the true construction of the College Charter and, in particular, of Clauses III and XII thereof the claim is misconceived.</P>
    <P>In addition to the fact that appointments were made which were in breach of Charter, which is the principal objection raised in this matter, there is also the fact that appointments should have been made which were not made. The Governing Body failed to take the necessary steps to have the statutory appointments made.</P>
    <P>We learn from the Report that at present there are ten vacant Professorships and 29 vacant Lectureships in the College and that this represents more than half the total of such appointments.  That is quite true. What the Report exactly says is this:</P>
    <P>The Board finds:</P>
    <P>1.  That it is part of the present policy of the Governing Body to leave unfilled many &ldquo;statutory&rdquo; Lectureships (approximately 53% are at present unfilled).</P>
    <P>2.  That the failure to take the proper and necessary steps to fill vacancies in these &ldquo;statutory offices&rdquo; is a breach of the duties imposed on the President of the <Col N="1348" /> College by Statute I, chapter iv, section 17, and chapter xiv, section 1.</P>
    <P>It may be said, as it has been said, that the College is not obliged to fill these positions.  Without going into the matter very fully, I am prepared to accept that it is not obligatory immediately to fill every vacancy that takes place.  When we find that more than half of these statutory positions are vacant, it cannot be denied that this is out of all proportion to the true and proper position.  Although some leniency and some reasonable time may be allowed to fill these posts, it is quite unreasonable and beyond all proportion, when the position has been reached that more than half of these posts are vacant and have been vacant for some considerable time.</P>
    <P>One must ask, one must inquire, one must try to find out for oneself, why this situation has been allowed to develop, why these irregular appointments were made and why the regular and statutory appointments were not made.  There must be some reason for this position.  Whether it is a good one or not is another matter but there must be a reason why this situation has developed.  It is not one which suddenly happened.  It is one which apparently has been deliberately allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>On Page 6 of the Report, the Visitors say:</P>
    <P>Counsel appearing on behalf of the College declined to give any reason for the decision to appoint College Lecturers and Assistant Lecturers, and did not attempt to justify these appointments on any meritorious basis.  It was left to individual members of the staff of the College to give to the Board their own personal reasons for supporting and approving of the actions of the Governing Body in this regard.</P>
    <P>The reasons given were four in number. One reason was that it was difficult to get staff unless they were allowed to call themselves &ldquo;Lecturers&rdquo;.  They felt that the title of &ldquo;Assistant&rdquo; did not sound important enough.  Secondly, it was said that the method of appointment was unwieldy.  In that regard the Visitors say:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1349" /> The Board is not satisfied, as at present advised, that the method of appointment laid down by Charter, divorced from the practice referred to is of itself unwieldy.</P>
    <P>They agree the practice which has grown up for statutory appointments is unwieldy but they suggest it is not the fault of the Charter but of the practice which has grown up.</P>
    <P>The third reason given for this system of appointment is that the College authorities have the advantage of being able to offer a job to a suitable person.  If it is a job which they may have some difficulty in filling, they can offer a suitable person the job on the spot and get him in that way, when they might otherwise have difficulty in getting somebody.  That is an understandable reason for appointing people in that way but whether or not it is justified is another matter.</P>
    <P>The fourth reason given was that from an administrative point of view it is better to have staff under the Professor; it is better for discipline and administration.  This reason has many ramifications to which I shall refer later.</P>
    <P>What is clear about all these arguments in favour of the present system of appointment is that they are all based on expediency.  It may be a very much simpler system; it may be a much more workable system to be able to tap a person on the shoulder and say: &ldquo;We want you,&rdquo; and that is the end of it, with no bother about advertising, or competitions, or anything else.  There is a lot to be said for it on the grounds of expediency. But you cannot ignore laws, statutes, charters and so on, merely on the grounds of expediency.  If the system of appointment that existed under the Charter was quite impossible, if it was unwieldy or impracticable, then there were other courses open to the College authorities.  They could have taken the necessary steps to have the necessary professorships or lectureships established and have the vacancy filled in the University by the manner prescribed in the Charter of the University <Col N="1350" /> or they could have, as found by the Board, made representations to the Government that the College Charter was outmoded and unsuitable to meet the demands of the new situation and have sought to have the Charter suitably amended.  There were these courses open to the authorities, if they genuinely found that the Charter system of appointments was unworkable, but instead of adopting one or other of these courses, they merely ignored the Charter and made appointments as it suited them.</P>
    <P>I should like to get back for a moment to the last of the four reasons which were given as to why the present system of appointment was adopted, that it was on the basis of better administration, that it was better to have certain powers for the professor over his Assistants or Lecturers. Senator Hayes did not understand what the Board meant by this.  He said he thought that it meant that the Lecturer, if he did not feel like giving a lecture, could tell the Professor that he intended going home and would not bother to give a lecture.  The Senator is being naive in that because I am sure he knows very well what is intended is that the Lecturer should be free to express opinions about matters of College administration, and not necessarily pertaining to College administration, without the feeling that if he said something of which the Professor disapproved, he would find his appointment as Lecturer terminated at the end of the year.  That certainly leads to very good discipline. It leads to very great power in the hands of the Professors and in the hands of the Governing Body, because if the staff are in the position that they know they can be dropped if they step out of line for saying things which are not approved of officially&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;then they are going to be much more careful about what they say.  That is exactly what the College authorities are doing.  For instance, when one Assistant Lecturer raised a matter which he was quite entitled to raise&mdash;that is, the petitioner in this case&mdash;he got back a letter from <Col N="1351" /> the College authorities which quite bluntly told him that he should mind his own business.  It is a most undesirable position that the majority of the staff&mdash;as is now the position in University College, Dublin&mdash;can be told they should mind their own business and that they may be allowed to mind their own business entirely at the end of the year, unless they stop doing things which are not popular with the College authorities.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Hibernia</i> of 6th May, 1960, has something to say on that subject in a leading article.  It says:</P>
      <P>It is high time, too, for the authorities of U.C.D. to learn that academic freedom cuts both ways. It means freedom for the University to go its own way free from State intervention in ordinary matters, though substantially supported by the State.  But within the College it should also mean toleration of divergent views of College policy and freedom for the academic staff from the least hint of a threat of penalisation.</P>
      <P>That is what is meant by the Board when they talk about the danger of the fourth reason given for the personal appointments.  It is not a question of merely giving freedom to the Lecturer to say that he will not give a lecture if he does not feel like it.</P>
      <P>The disregard by the authorities of University College, Dublin, of their duties and responsibilities has, to my mind, given rise to grave public disquiet. The public expect reputable bodies to behave in a reputable way. The public have a very high respect &mdash;had, anyway, and, I hope, will have again&mdash;for the National University and for University College, Dublin, but they expect reputable bodies for whom they have a high opinion to behave in accordance with their position.  I believe that at the moment the people are disappointed by what has happened in College circles.  I believe that this is something which approaches a public scandal, possibly not a public scandal of alarming proportions, but certainly in its small way it is what possibly can be described as a public scandal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1352" /> Apart from the public, one must consider the effect of what has happened on the students of University College, Dublin.  What is the effect on students who find that the authorities of the College&mdash;the College at which they are being educated, the College which is supposed to inculcate in them the virtues of good citizens, respect for the law and so on&mdash;are disregarding the Charter under which they operate?  I believe that both from the point of view of the public and from the point of view of the students of the College, this is a matter which has caused a great deal of concern and a great deal of disquiet.</P>
    <P>Forgetting for a moment the fact that it is in breach of Charter, the system, as I have already admitted, has some advantages, but on the other hand, it has a number of very serious disadvantages.  It is open to very severe criticism.  The statutory system has been more or less rejected by the College because it is clumsy and took too long to operate.  We are told it took more than a year to appoint a person as a Statutory Professor or Lecturer, but in spite of that, it has advantages.  The statutory system would at least ensure that every person qualified for a post would have a chance to apply for it and a chance to have his credentials and qualifications examined.  The system adopted for some years past errs in the opposite direction: it is too quick, too restricted, and much too smooth.</P>
    <P>Although good men and women probably have been appointed under the College Lecturer system&mdash;I have no doubt a number of them are good people&mdash;it is doubtful that the best possible people were in every case appointed.  It is doubtful in fact whether the best possible persons on many occasions even knew there was a vacancy or an appointment about to be made as Lecturer or Assistant Lecturer.  Consequently, the system, although it has some recommendations on the grounds of expediency, has disadvantages that far outweigh the advantages and although you may get some short-term benefit by getting people quickly, it is extremely doubtful in the end whether you will get <Col N="1353" /> the best possible staff of Professors and Lecturers.</P>
    <P>The Visitors made two comments on the question of the present system of appointments.  They say on page 3:</P>
    <P>In no instance of the appointment of a College Lecturer or Assistant Lecturer has more than one name been before the Academic Council or the Governing Body.  In the majority of instances the post was not advertised, and in some instances the appointment was made by the Governing Body without any recommendation by the Academic Council</P>
    <P>And on page 9, they say:</P>
    <P>The practice of appointing College Lecturers and Assistant Lecturers in the College could, and in the opinion of the Board would, lead to the situation that a large majority of the teaching staff would be appointed by the College from within the College without the posts being advertised.  To date it is not suggested that the standard of the teaching staff in the College has suffered by the method of appointment that has been adopted. On the other hand, it is claimed that the standard is higher than it would have been if the appointments had been made by the University. There is, however, always the danger that the existing system could lend itself to patronage.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt whatever that the existing system can lead to the position where the best possible people are not given an opportunity of showing their credentials and of having their credentials and qualifications examined and judged by an independent tribunal or even given a chance of applying for the post in many cases. Where more than half of the appointments in the College at the moment are made in this way it would be impossible for anyone interested in the well-being and future of U.D.C. to be without serious misgivings.</P>
    <P>If these irregularities, these breaches of Charter&mdash;in deference to Senator Hayes, I shall not describe them as illegalities&mdash;were a mistake or an oversight, <Col N="1354" /> one would be very anxious to overlook them and to help the College in every way to rectify the position, but it is quite clear that there is no question of this being merely an oversight. The Governing Body were warned in 1956 that what they were doing was almost certainly wrong.</P>

      <P>The Governing Body got an opinion in 1956 and again in 1959.  The fact that they got these legal opinions is on the minutes of the Governing Body.  Nothing appears on the minutes, as far as I know, to say that Senator Hayes got another legal opinion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which contradicted the one before the Governing Body but, knowing the situation that there was at least very considerable doubt as to the legality of what they were doing, the Governing Body persisted in making these appointments.  Consequently, there is no question of this being an oversight or a mistake.  This was something done in the knowledge that what was done was almost certainly a breach of Charter.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, these are not the only cases in which the University authorities have ignored the rule of law.  The manner in which the Trust giving the Palles Library to U.C.D. has been abused is well-known. Without going into details, let it suffice to say that the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests have certified to the Attorney General that the manner in which this Trust has been abused would justify an action in the Courts by the Attorney General.  Furthermore, the highhanded way in which the Students' Representative Council and the Literary and Historical Society have been dealt with was hardly a good example to the students of the College of the respect which is due to the principles of justice, liberty and democracy.</P>
      <P>I should also like to comment on the present attitude of the College authorities.  Even at this stage, if the Governing Body accepted that they had made a mistake and undertook to mend their ways, everybody in this House and, I am sure, everybody connected with the College would be anxious to help them, but instead of that, they are trying to justify themselves, still writing letters, making speeches, and so on, attempting to prove that there is nothing wrong with what was done.  We have votes of confidence by Faculties; we have all kinds of speeches and letters and I think I can say&mdash;about votes of confidence in particular&mdash;that it is only when confidence in the President and the Governing Body is very much in doubt that people go to the trouble of passing votes of confidence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been suggested in the Dáil that the Government, by introducing this Bill, showed that they condoned the practices which have been carried on in University College. As I have already said, I take the very opposite view.  I take the view that the Bill shows quite clearly that the Government accept the Report, accept the findings of the Visitors, and that it is only because they accept that Report that they thought it necessary to bring in a Bill to deal with these irregularities.  In case there is any doubt about that position, I believe the Minister should take the opportunity which presents itself to him here, to make the Government's attitude quite clear.  If the Government approve of and condone the practices which have taken place, then, by all means, I believe the Minister should say so and give the Governing Body the moral support of which they so badly stand in need.  If the Government, on the other hand, do not condone what has happened I can think of no good reason why the Minister should not say so.</P>
      <P>Finally, I agree that the University, and Universities in general, should be as free as possible from Government interference.  I deliberately qualify that statement by saying &ldquo;as free as possible&rdquo;, because any body depending for more than 50 per cent.  of its funds on the public and on the Government, must have some regard for the views of the public and the Government, at least, to the extent of complying with the terms of the Charter under which they were established.  They should also have regard to any strong views expressed by the Government or the public as to the manner in which the University is run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Interference in this case was brought on by the action of the College authorities themselves, in disregarding the Charter which gave them that very freedom they would now like to have. <Col N="1357" /> This question of University freedom has been well summed up in the same issue of <i>Hibernia</i>, of Friday, 6th May, 1960, which says:</P>
    <P>For the future this sad story should serve to remind those in authority in the National University that laws, rules and regulations must be either obeyed or amended.  A chartered corporation using public funds ought to be scrupulous in respecting its own charter.  If, as a result of what has happened, the gates are opened to bureaucratic interference in the life of the University, all parties in it will have much to regret; but no one will be so much to blame as the College which, in the words of the Visitors, &ldquo;adopted the course of expediency, and, in doing so, seemed to the Board, to overlook the fact that its action might affect not only the University but the other Constituent Colleges.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister is, I understand, to ask the Commission on Higher Education to consider the system of appointment of staff in University College.  I hope the Commission will be able to recommend a satisfactory system, and if a system is established, I sincerely hope University College will conform to it, and avoid a repetition of the present controversy which has undoubtedly been brought on themselves by themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to confine my remarks in this debate to a rather narrow part of the very wide subject which has developed in the course of the discussions in the Dáil and in this House.  I wish to refer particularly to the issue of academic freedom which has been raised by Senator Ryan and raised in the other House.  I want to deal particularly with that matter because in one speech in the other House, my department was singled out by name, as one of the departments where the principle of academic freedom was liable to be violated because of the insecurity of tenure of members of the staff.  I think that is a slur on my department, and on my behaviour as a Professor in the College.  When remarks of <Col N="1358" /> that kind are made in the Dáil under the shelter of Parliamentary privilege, I am entitled to reply to them in this House.</P>
      <P>I shall not go over the wider issues which have been raised in this debate. They have, I think, been discussed in the other House and will be discussed again in this House before the debate closes.  I do not think I could add anything very new to what has been said.  The legal situation has been described by Senator Hayes, and also with a certain amount of disagreement, by Senator Ryan.  I am prepared to leave discussion on the legal aspect of the Report of the Board of Visitors on the College Charter to the legal members of the Seanad, who are more qualified to discuss the matter than I.</P>
      <P>The impression made on my mind by the debate so far on the Bill, and by the Minister's opening statement, is that confusion will be further confounded and that confusion will continue under this Bill when it becomes an Act, that there will be scope for ample differences of opinion, ample litigation, ample delay and, even possibly, if we are unlucky enough, another visitation.  The new situation arising from the Bill is, to my limited intelligence, decidedly obscure.  As I said, I shall not enter into the general legal question raised by the visitation. There are other members of the Seanad more qualified to do so than I.  I also do not intend to be dragged into the general fracas which surrounds this Bill here and outside.</P>
      <P>Many of the issues which have been raised in this discussion seem to me, at any rate, to be irrelevant to the Bill.  I am not very clear what the reference to the Palles Library this evening had to do with the debate. However, perhaps we shall learn more in the course of the discussion.  There were also various references to Belfield in the discussions on the Bill.  I should have thought that the issue of the Assistant Lecturers and the issue of the location of the College were rather different issues and might possibly be kept apart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the statements made in <Col N="1359" /> the Dáil in the course of the debate on this Bill, were quite irrelevant to the subject of the debate.  Many were definitely malicious.  Many of them consisted of personal attacks on individuals. There was a very generous amount of attribution of ungenerous motives all round and a certain amount of mud-slinging and a certain amount of mud was slung in my direction.  I now propose to try to clean some of it off if, with your permission, Sir I am allowed to refer to the debate in the Dáil, column 355 of 28th April. I wish to quote from the speech made by Deputy Ryan on the subject of academic freedom.  I wish to quote the better part of a column if it is in order because my department, as you will see, has been dragged into this discussion by name.  Deputy Ryan stated:</P>
    <P>The essence of a University system is freedom of thought and action. That is the very reason for my condemnation of the system which has been in operation for the past ten years and which it is sought to continue for another four years under this Bill.  Statutory professors and statutory lecturers had permanency in their time.  Therefore, they were free to think and advise as they thought fit.  The persons appointed to College lectureships, improperly appointed&mdash;in case the word &ldquo;improperly&rdquo; offends, I shall say &ldquo;appointed&rdquo;&mdash;to College lectureships in breach of duty, were appointed from year to year and their reappointment depended on the goodwill of the head of the College and perhaps ultimately on the goodwill of the professor who was the person, in the first instance, who selected him for the position.</P>
    <P>So far, we have been dealing with generalities.  The next paragraph comes nearer home:</P>
    <P>How could you have freedom of thought or freedom of action in such a situation?  You could not possibly have it.  In the first instance, it was almost certain that no person would be appointed unless he and <Col N="1360" /> his potential professor were <i>ad idem</i>, unless he and his prospective professor were going to agree on all-points. Take certain subjects like Economics and Politics.  There are many different trends in such sciences in a changing world, and according to one's outlook on affairs and perhaps according to one's generation, there&mdash;will be different views on these subjects.  A lecturer with progressive views who wished to instruct his class on a certain line could be restricted by a conservative professor from proceeding on those lines.</P>
    <P>I should like this Seanad to listen with particular attention to the last sentence I am going to quote:</P>
    <P>That is the kind of thing which could, and I suspect, did happen under the system which has been condemned in the report of the Board of Visitors.</P>

      <P>I am sorry but I cannot agree with, the Senator's opinion that this is a personal reflection on him.  It says; &ldquo;Economics and Politics&rdquo;.

      <P>I do not wish to pursue the matter, if you think it is out of order.  Two subjects have been chosen out of a very large number of subjects taught in University College for particular mention by a Deputy in the Dáil.  The reference to the conservative professor and the reference to people of the older generation seem to me to be more relevant to me than to a Professor of Politics who is a considerably younger man.  I am not in any sense ashamed of getting on in years or of being conservative but I do certainly object to being told that my staff are not allowed to express their views if they wish.  If I am assured afterwards that the reference was to a Professor of Politics, I shall be only too pleased&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I propose to say very little.  What I wanted to say is that if the reference is to the Professor of Economics or if it is interpreted by any member of the public so to refer, I wish to take this occasion, categorically, without any qualification or any reservation, to deny that I have ever attempted to influence the teaching of any member of my staff.  The majority of my staff are appointed from year to year and I want to make it quite clear that I have never thought of doing <Col N="1362" /> such a thing.  When I read this debate, it shocked me to think that anybody could make such an accusation against me and I wish to take this opportunity categorically to deny that accusation. My subject, together with another subject, was picked out for particular mention and certainly as regards my subject, that allegation is not true.</P>
      <P>I should like to say one more word. In the passage of the Report of the Visitors which is quoted at column. 416 of the same debate, it is stated that when College Lecturers and Assistant Lecturers are notified of appointment, they receive a letter saying, among other things, &ldquo;Your duties will be as laid down by the Professor.&rdquo; That is of course, perfectly reasonable. What it means is that the hours of lecturers, the subjects lectured on, particular titles of lectures, the part played in examinations, are matters to be laid down by the Professor.  There must be some authority in a large department such as mine and to say that the Professor is to lay down the hours of lectures or the duties of his non-statutory staff seems to me to be a very reasonable thing.</P>
      <P>There must be some authority, some discipline, in the College, but, what I want to make clear is that that does not in any sense refer to the contents of the lectures.  They are two quite different things.  It is one thing to say: &ldquo;Your duties consist of lecturing at certain times&rdquo; but to suggest that he should lecture in a particular manner agreeable to one's own aged, conservative, political prejudices, is to me so shocking that it is scarcely necessary to deny it in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I just end up by saying that in the Budget debate, I think, two years ago, the Minister for Finance, Dr. Ryan, stated that it must be a very exciting experience to study Economics in University College, Dublin, because the students are told diametrically opposite things by different members of the staff.  That does not seem to me to suggest control of academic freedom by the Professor and all I can say is that it is very interesting to see Senator Ryan sum up on one side in this debate and Dr. Ryan on the other.</P>

      <P>It was completely unnecessary for Senator O'Brien to say what he has just said about himself. I think the whole House is quite sure in regard to him that no such thoughts could be entertained.  We have had two Professors of the University and a barrister-at-law and now perhaps a representative of that great and amorphous body, the laymen, could say something about this.  I do think somebody should speak for the somewhat mystified public in this matter.</P>
      <P>That mystified public instinctively feels&mdash;I have known it from talking to members of the public&mdash;that some of the considerable exaggeration in some of the charges made in the other House must be discounted but they also feel that there is something wrong.  It is idle to discount the disquiet that has been caused by this matter, although I agree, as most people will agree, that much of the critical comment was ill-informed and in many cases was quite malicious and had taken no survey of the conditions that must obtain in University College, Dublin, when we remember and take note of the extraordinary expansion in student membership there in our lifetime.</P>
      <P>I am, indeed, very reluctant to comment because of the muddy water stirred up elsewhere, stirred up, I am afraid, for the wrong reasons.  I am proud of the eminent position of University College, Dublin, and my reaction to this is irritation, irritation that the College should be injured by this wholly unpleasant controversy.  I realise there are eminent figures from University College, Dublin, in this House and I am sure there is nothing so infuriating as amateur comment in a matter like this.  I must risk the amateur point of view.</P>

      <P>If I say that University College, Dublin, appears to have handled this thing badly, I am only reflecting general public comment.  It is not enough that essentials should be all right&mdash;they should appear to be so. Running a great organisation like this <Col N="1364" /> requires all sorts of abilities and not the least is the ability to maintain good public relations and University College, Dublin, has failed here, I think.  Injury has been done to University College, Dublin, and not only by its critics.  It has, I think, been done by those who profess&mdash;and I do not doubt possess&mdash; devotion to its interests.  I believe it amounts to a kind of incompetence, not a very serious kind of incompetence, and it may injure the proposal that is being made now to expend quite a large sum of money on transferring and rehousing this University.</P>
      <P>Before I come to my main points, I should like to say that I have no time whatever for the despicable washing of dirty linen that took place in the Dáil and still less for any of the suave piety that marked other contributions but I am irritated that an institution of such importance should have to be uneasily defended by those of us who are proud of University education here.</P>
      <P>I should like to examine the implications of this legislation and I submit the following points.  If the Bill goes through without consultation with the Senate of the University, then, in effect, are we not overriding the University Charter?  Would not a precedent be created whereby at any time in the future the Government may peremptorily enact legislation prejudicial to the University and encroaching on its academic autonomy and independence?  Indeed, education at the University level should, as far as is reasonably possible, be free from State and political intervention.  The result of all this legislation is that University College, Dublin, will be in the privileged position of making appointments independent of the Senate of the University, a privilege which will not be enjoyed by the other constituent Colleges.  I should like the Minister to satisfy me on those three points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been irregularities.  The Visitors found so and said so and the future should ensure that these kind of irregularities be abandoned.  I believe that probably the best staff has been obtained and no better would <Col N="1365" /> have been obtained if the irregularities were regularised, but&mdash;and let us not brush this aside&mdash;the appearance of doing things properly is as important as doing them.  If this had been attended to, this opportunity to injure a great Catholic University and thus provide a field day for many shadowy, sheltered attackers, this opportunity for the mud-slingers, would have been denied them.</P>
    <P>The main case for the defence, if I gather it rightly from Senator Hayes, is that the irregularities were small and unimportant.  That may well be but they have paid a very high price for these minor transgressions, if they are minor.  The University has suffered a real injury by the horrible controversy that has arisen.  This is what I find almost inexcusable&mdash;that the punishment the University has suffered greatly exceeds, the offence. I want to know were the misdemeanours indicated in clauses 1 and 2 of the Board of Visitors' findings worth running into all this trouble for?</P>
    <P>If the Minister is quite satisfied that the passing of this legislation will not create a precedent that will injure the other constituent Colleges, he should ensure by conversations with the University that something like this never happens again.  He should ensure that the machinery of this great University is perfected and used&mdash;I stress the word &ldquo;used&rdquo;&mdash;with full regard for high standards, staff rights, student rights and, above all, the rights of the people who actually pay 100 per cent. of the bill.  We should devise a future in which University matters will never again become a field day for all those inside and outside Parliament who would injure the cause of a Catholic University in this country.</P>

      <P>This debate is tending to cover a very wide field which was not indicated, I think, at the start.  We are repeating the discussions that took place in the Dáil.  I have before me the report of the Board of Visitors consisting of three members of the judiciary.  Partial quotations pro and con were given in both Houses. In this House, Senator Hayes applied many references of a despicable nature <Col N="1366" /> to the three Visitors who were acting on this Board.</P>
      <P>I should like to read the Report from beginning to end and have it inserted on the records of this House in its entirety.  If that would be within the rules of order, I would propose having it done.  If there is any means of inserting the Report of the three Visitors in the records of this House without my having to read it from beginning to end, I should be glad to know of it.  If that cannot be done, I would ask permission of the Chair to read the Report from beginning to end.  Before I make any further comment, can I get this Report inserted in the Official Report of this House by means other than reading it out? I should be very glad that the Report would be inserted <i>in toto</i> on the record of this House because we would not have this confusion among the public.</P>

      <P>I know that. I was about to say that in my next statement.  I am a privileged member of the community because I got it free in the Dáil Office.  Interested people can get it by paying 1/- at the Government Publications Sale Office in the G.P.O. Arcade.  Well and good.  However, what about the mass of the people?  There are members of the public whose opinions are of consequence who will not read the contents of the Report <i>in extenso.</i>  I was hoping that the Report, in its entirety would be available for reference some years hence.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach has ruled that that cannot be done now and therefore I close on that point. The fact that it is on sale at the Government Publications Sale Office or from a newsagent&mdash;I do not know if its sale is confined to the Government Publications Sale Office in the G.P.O. Arcade&mdash;is a very limited facility to the public.</P>
      <P>My reason for making the request was that, listening to this debate and hearing the statements made by Senator Hayes, many of which were so ably contradicted by Senator Ryan, it is clear that, without the Report, a person would not realise how a wrong impression was being conveyed.  In one instance, I could not but resent what Senator Hayes was saying.  He quoted part of a statement and stopped without completing the paragraph.  I shall now read from page 7 of the Report of the Board of Visitors, University College, Dublin.  Senator Hayes quoted from the last paragraph on the page, which reads as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the third place, it was put forward that from the purely administrative point of view, it was <Col N="1368" /> preferable to have a Faculty or Department headed by a Professor with all the teaching staff under him subject to his direction, than to have a Professor with a teaching staff which included one or more Lecturers who were independent of the Professor.  It is indisputable that purely from the point of view of administration a Professor would wish to have complete control of the staff under him.  As against this view it was submitted that was a bad University principle to have a Professor in absolute charge of his Faculty or Department. A very big question of principle arises at this point on which the Board does not propose to venture an opinion.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes stopped at about that point.  However, the paragraph continues as follows:</P>
    <P>The appointment of College Lecturers and Assistant Lecturers effected in the College a difference in the status of part of the teaching staff of the grade of Lecturer. Lecturers (who are appointed by the University) are independent of the Professor.  On the other hand, College Lecturers and Assistant Lecturers are, by the terms of their appointment, subject to the Professor. At no time was the possible question of principle involved in the new classification of the teaching staff debated in the Governing Body.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes left out the really important part of that paragraph. Anybody reading the Official Report, a newspaper account or listening to a report of the debate on the radio would take what Senator Hayes mentioned as being the complete paragraph. I was not at all impressed by his remarks.  They were out of his usual mood altogether.  Senator Hayes indulged in a considerable amount of animosity and muck-raking which he attributes to people outside this House.  It is very unfortunate that this has occurred.</P>
    <P>I think the Leas-Chathaoirleach will not rule me out of order for one statement in connection with the discussion <Col N="1369" /> in the Dáil about the siting of University College, Dublin.  If the Government and the Minister had waited until this unfortunate matter was fixed up, the question of the siting of the College as well as the rectification of the errors of one of the colleges of the National University could comprehensively have been examined.  We would probably have found that this matter as well as the siting of the College could be fixed up by the commission which it is now suggested should be appointed to deal with higher education.  It is unfortunate that two separate questions in connection with University College, Dublin, should come up in sequence rather than simultaneously.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes mentioned that the Visitors sought information from the other Colleges of the National University of Ireland&mdash;from Cork and Galway &mdash;and that they got no co-operation. He said the catch was small.  Evidently, then, there was nothing wrong in Cork or Galway.</P>
    <P>The Government bring a Bill to the Oireachtas with the Long Title of &ldquo;An Act to authorise the Governing Body of University College, Dublin, to make, during a limited period, appointments to certain offices and to validate appointments which that Body has made to those offices&rdquo;.  If we indict the Visitors who reported to the Government that invalid decisions had been made, we must equally bear in mind that the Government in consequence brought before the Dáil and Seanad a Bill to validate the appointments. If we must validate appointments something must have been invalid which necessitated this legislation.</P>
    <P>Tremendous play has been made with the question of these statutes. Senator Hayes pointed out that charters are not straitjackets.  If a breach of a Charter is not an invalid act, I do not know what is meant by law or how lawyers can discuss matters.  There used to be Royal Charters which were promulgated by royalty.  Now, necessarily, they are promulgated by the Government.  An amendment of a Charter must, I assume, be executed by the Government.  If the Government institute a new Charter or amend <Col N="1370" /> an existing Charter, surely it is a legal document and law?  Legislation is a straitjacket for every member of the community who tries to abide by the law.  We all break the law sometimes. Even in crossing the street, we may break the law.  But if there is a Charter, it has got to be obeyed.</P>
    <P>I was surprised at Senator Hayes's attitude.  I could understand his defending the Governing Body of University College, Dublin, or the President of University College, Dublin, for the action taken and the argument put up in regard to pressure of circumstances, the increasing number of students, and that such a line of action had to be taken, but the findings of the Board of Visitors are signed by three judges and accepted by the Government who are asking us to validate previously illegal acts.  I do not see why Senator Hayes should have used such vicious language to attack three members of a profession of which he himself, as a barrister, is a member. He said many ugly things about them. On a previous occasion, the Leader of his Party in the other House referred to a member of the Judiciary, whom the Government proposed to elect chairman of a board, as a lickspittle of the Government.  These remarks are unworthy of the dignity of this House. How a distinguished senior counsel and leader of a political Party could call a fellow professional man, and a judge of the courts, a lickspittle I do not know, but I think it is a terrible thing.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the name of the President of the College has been brought in to public disrepute but I fancy it is the protagonists rather than the antagonists who have been the cause of it to a great extent.  I have had experience quite recently in connection with the transfer of the veterinary service from the Department of Agriculture over to the Universities.  Professors who functioned under the State have been appointed, some by Trinity College and some by National University and those appointments went through in something less than two months.  It was amazingly quick, possibly because of the circumstances which existed and possibly again because it was more of <Col N="1371" /> a transfer of existing officers than appointment of new applicants.  It took place very quickly and I cannot understand, even with the crowding of University College, Dublin, why they should depart from the strait-jacket of the Charter and adopt on their own a procedure which did not apply at all.  The disastrous thing is that these appointments were never advertised.</P>
    <P>A lot of the invective has been caused by this over-enthusiastic defence of the Governing Body of University College, Dublin.  The Governing Body consists of something like 30 members &mdash;ten or 12 of whom are appointed by the General Council of County Councils&mdash;having a democratic interest in the governing of the University, but many of the things put up at a meeting would be taken as the considered opinion of the bodies reporting to it.</P>
    <P>I understand that in the case of an appointment of a person to a Statutory Lectureship, a name is put up by the Faculty.  The Faculty recommends that name to the Academic Council.  That is the second step.  The Academic Council recommends it to the Governing Body of the College, which is the third step and the final step is that the ratification and selection of the Lecturer or Professor is in the hands of the Senate and he must be elected by the Senate to the appointment.  Therefore he has four fences to clear and it is amazing to me that those four fences could be cleared so quickly when the occasion arises.  This hold-up should not be of such a nature that people will say it will take two years to establish a new lectureship, or something less than two years for the ordinary routine appointment.</P>
    <P>The argument has been put up that a Lecturer has to present 150 odd copies of his application form and testimonials to the various members of the Academic Council, the Governing Body and the Senate.  It is not such a terrible imposition on them. Under the statutory position of the Universities at present, the members of the Senate have not much connection with the Colleges&mdash;Dublin, Cork <Col N="1372" /> and Galway&mdash;and they must have some knowledge of the person they intend to support.  That is why this visitation and canvassing has come about and why the air of place hunting attaches to it.</P>
    <P>I only wish there could be some less ambiguous, less difficult, procedure than having these four fences to surmount. It could be a body comparable with the Civil Service Appointments Commission.  It is a difficult problem but I repeat that it is a pity that these two questions, the siting of the College and the rectification and validating now of the invalid acts of the past ten years, did not come together.  The Commission to be appointed by the Minister could then deal with both of them.  This matter could be settled in five years&mdash;the validating of the invalid acts&mdash;but what has been done in connection with the siting of the College will last 500 or 1,000 years, if atomic energy or nuclear fission does not kill us in the meantime.  It is legislation for 500 years and even if there were only one voice in the Dáil against it, I would probably join in.  It is a pity that the Government did it, a pity that Labour and the Opposition supported them. It is a pity that the whole thing was not reviewed collectively by the-new Commission which to a great extent must review what has been done.</P>

      <P>I find myself very much in agreement with the sentiments so well expressed by Senator Barry, especially as regards our abhorrence of the grossly unfair personal attacks that have been made, particularly in the other House and in the <Col N="1373" /> public Press, on the President of U.C.D. and many of the senior members of the Faculties.  I think we should all condemn these attacks.  We should all endeavour to segregate those who are muckraking from those who have a genuine interest in the University and its problems or, I might say, in the nation and its problems because undoubtedly some of the mud that has been thrown will stick.  It is unfortunate that in the case of an institution which has meant so much in this country and for which our forefathers fought so hard and long the public should grasp at an opportunity of belittling and throwing mud.</P>
      <P>Like many other members of our Faculty in Cork, I was shocked by the action of a couple of our members in coming up to lend further support to that campaign last week.  I think I am speaking for the vast majority of my colleagues in Cork when I say that we disassociate ourselves, one and all, from such actions.</P>
      <P>To come to the matters at issue, despite all the unpleasantness, I think it will be worth while if we seriously begin to think of University education and begin to grasp its problems.  Personally I am not happy about the approach made by the Government to this problem.  I think there is a fundamental error there of which we should all take cognisance, that is in regard to the position of chartered bodies in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have taken over many Charters from the British Government but we do not seem to have a clear-cut policy on how these Charters are to be handled or, in particular, on their amendment.  I should have thought that in the present case surely the chartered bodies concerned, U.C.D. and the National University of Ireland, should both have been consulted first.  They should have been given the Report of the Board of Visitors and allowed to decide what action should be taken in the light of that Report. They could then petition the Government if they thought some change in the Charter was necessary, because it is highly conceiveable that the Senate of the National University. after reading that Report, if it agreed <Col N="1374" /> that there were irregularities, could easily have put them right.</P>
    <P>It does not require any great stretch of the imagination to see how that could be done.  In fact, the Petitioner himself in his Petition gave the answer because he said that if the Governing Body were prepared to give up making those appointments and calling them Assistants, he would be satisfied or, in other words, that a change of name was all he was asking.  At least, he brought the difference down that much. Alternatively, the Senate of the National University of Ireland might have seen that some changes in the Charter were necessary and as a chartered body, if a Charter means anything, it had the right to take the initiative in asking the Government who have taken over as successor of His Majesty in this respect, to carry through whatever change was necessary.</P>
    <P>We have been a little too hesitant in our approach to the Charter in that it seems as though all responsible national opinion was so delighted with the very excellent settlement that was given to the problem of higher education for Catholics in 1908 that they have been loath to change that Charter in any way ever since or even to open the Charter so that other bodies in other times might make changes which might introduce more State control and less University autonomy.  That is a legitimate point of view that has been championed down the years, especially by Reverend Dr. O'Rahilly who, perhaps, would rank as the foremost of the University leaders in the past 25 years.</P>
    <P>It was a rather negative approach because times change and Charters, like other legislation, should, on the initiative of the bodies concerned, be reviewed at long intervals and fitted for the next period.  I think it is one of the real regrets of the present situation that, shortly after the war, I would say, it was not recognised that we had moved into a new era, that there was a great expansion resulting from the war in technological and scientific demands on University training and that consequently the time had come to see whether we <Col N="1375" /> needed changes for the future.</P>
    <P>If we take the analogue of Queen's University, Belfast&mdash;which got an almost identical Charter to that which the National University got in 1908 &mdash;they have moved ahead very far since then in making changes and they have the right of initiative which is not explicitly given to the National University but which I presume the Government, nevertheless, would be quite willing to concede in practice.</P>
    <P>Actually, much of our present difficulty arises from an omission in the Charter in failing to define the term &ldquo;Lecturer.&rdquo; Many other much less important terms are defined, but not the word &ldquo;Lecturer&rdquo;.  While perhaps College Lecturers should move up towards the other end of the scale, they would undoubtedly come into the classification that was in the mind of those who created the Charter in 1908. I do not for one moment think that Assistant Lecturers would do so.</P>
    <P>Actually, that is how it has developed in Queen's University, where the Assistant Lecturers are appointed on a year to year basis for a maximum of three years.  After that period, they either leave the University or become Lecturers.  They then continue on with security of tenure, and with annual increments, for about six years.  At the end of that six-year period, there is an efficiency barrier, that is, unless the Professors in their departments, certify that they have been satisfactory, that their output of research work has been what was expected from young scientists, no further increments are granted, which is another way of saying: &ldquo;You are not wanted; move on somewhere else.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On passing the efficiency barrier, a Lecturer then continues on to the end of the scale.  Above, there are the Senior Lecturers which are separate posts, and above that to Professors, so that the whole spectrum is widened considerably.  Consequently, that is one of the many problems that will be present to the minds of the new Commission when it holds its sittings.</P>
    <P>In the American University system, they have gone so far as to create three grades of Professors: Professors, <Col N="1376" /> Associate Professors and Assistant Professors; followed by Lecturers, Instructors, Assistants, and so on.  In modem times, modern needs call for a new appraisal of our system.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan and others have commented very heavily on the four bodies concerned, on the various work such as interviewing, or whatever other name you wish to call it, and the hardship that imposes.  I admit it is a most cumbersome system, but, on the other hand, I should like to go on the records of this House as saying that I do not believe there is any other system which we shall evolve that will succeed in giving better results, so far as the personnel appointed, the maintenance of a high level of intellectual activity, and of a high academic standard in our staff are concerned.</P>

      <P>I said the system of appointment by the National University involving four bodies.  It is much too cumbersome at present, and I have the doubtful privilege of having been on the four bodies at various times, including the Senate of National University.  We are called on to put far too much of our time into making those appointments, in our anxiety to get the best possible staff for the university.  There is no other consideration motivating us and those who disagree with us will fully concede that our motives are the best.  You get people of equal standards going for a position, and then it is very easy to see how different people can arrive at a different conclusion&mdash;that A is better than B.  You have to try to judge a candidate's past, and also his future, how he will develop and expand, the leadership he will give to the department, and the research output he can produce.  All these are imponderables in the future.  Whatever other charge may be levelled against the present system, it should not be inferred that the persons concerned are motivated by patronage or any other consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, the same obstacles hold in many other Universities where there <Col N="1377" /> are three or four appointing Bodies. The only difference is that, at the very start, you have what are called the Board of curators, or a selection committee, who go through the candidates and select the one they consider best fitted for the appointment.  Only one name is sent up to the other bodies. They have only one choice.  They have the choice only of saying they accept this nomination or will refer it back to the original body if they want to get some better nomination.  That is the system actually prevailing in Queen's University at the present and in most Universities.  I hope it is one of the problems we may be able to tackle and solve in the forthcoming Commission.  I must congratulate the Minister on the fact that it is one of the major items listed in the terms of reference.</P>
    <P>In connection with that Commission, I must ask the Minister and the Government, before proceeding with this matter which may eventually involve amendment of the Charter, to have full consultation with the Charter body concerned.  Otherwise, the Charter is not worth the paper on which it is written.  I feel confident the Minister will take that approach and that the final headings and terms of reference of the Commission will not be drawn up until full discussions have taken place.  There is a very grave fear, which has been expressed by Senator Barry and others, that the Bill now before the House does, in effect, amend the Charter, that it does, in effect, make a compulsory amendment, without in any way being either initiated by the body concerned or even in consultation with the body concerned.  I should like to feel that the Government do not share our apprehension in that respect.</P>
    <P>Of all the charges that have been levelled, the charge of patronage is by far the worst.  Certainly any University professor who is worth his place in the University would not, for one moment, think of patronage.  If he appoints a staff member, who is not able to pull his weight, he is penalising his Department and himself, and no professor worthy of the name would <Col N="1378" /> subscribe to that.  I was a little amused by the reference to patronage which was so ably put by Senator Ryan and I hope that Senator Ryan and others will now join with us in eliminating the greatest source of patronage in this country at present, the political appointment of judges.  That is a &ldquo;must&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>In the present debate, and in discussions that will take place over the next few years on University education, culminating in the Report of the Commission, I would appeal to all to preserve a very critical and open mind, to examine the issues as they come, because many things that appear very plausible on the surface are not so.  One is, in particular, this question of advertising of posts.  Personally, I may say, I am in favour of full advertising in that it is associated with democracy, but in respect of University appointments, it is almost valueless, because in the modern era, developing as we hope like other scientific and modern Universities, the position of a bachelor's degree or even a master's degree is nothing more than a Matriculation certificate to a University post.  Our difficulty is to get candidates who will be suitably qualified for the post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1379" /> We have to take prudent steps to encourage promising candidates at all times; we must try to get them to stay back to post-graduate degrees, to get them to compete for travelling scholarships and to get them into some of the best international centres for training. It is among these students that our material for future staff has to be found.  At the moment you could count on the fingers of two hands the number of those people you are likely to get.  In fact, I would say, you are lucky if you could get sufficient of them to count on the fingers of one hand.</P>
    <P>Consequently, the Professors concerned know exactly where those students are.  We know the promising students in the other colleges throughout the country and I doubt whether, because a post is not advertised, or because it is advertised skimpily, some worthwhile candidates will not hear of it.  Such a contention is exceedingly far-fetched.  That is one concept of our need for care&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Government did not advertise the Chairmanship of C.I.E. or of Radio Éireann or any of those appointments.  Where your field is very limited and where you know the candidates&mdash;where it is restricted and you are delighted to have a few candidates who are qualified for the post&mdash;a very different position arises from that referred to by Senator Ó Maoláin.  In that position, there was a special category&mdash; musicians&mdash;who are too temperamental to reply to advertising, anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another fallacy that has been very much abroad is one in regard to control of thought.  There are certain groups of people who seem to be <Col N="1380" /> always seeking skeletons as to who is controlling whom, as to whether freedom of action should be given to students to tear down the University, for the Assistant Lecturer or Assistant to do exactly what he likes.  That is essentially a principle of anarchy and the answer has been given very well by Senator O'Brien and if one wanted a practical illustration of it, one might take the way in which Senator O'Brien's lecturer ruled on Senator O'Brien.  That was a very practical demonstration of the freedom of action and expression&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;you get in the University staff.  I hope it is realised here also that our young men who go abroad, equip themselves in the top graduate schools of the world and come back here are coming back because they have a sense of patriotism. They are coming back to do a job and we ought at least to respect their intentions and their motives in coming back There is not one of these young men who have come back since the war who could not earn two, three or four times as much in America or elsewhere, if he chose.  We have people as assistants in our department who could grace University chairs in other countries but they feel they have a contribution to make to us.  It can be said, without fear or favour, of our professorial staff that they can compete with similiar staffs anywhere in the world.  Every day they are getting offers and invitations to accept similiar or higher posts elsewhere and I hope their patriotism in doing the job well without regard to time or effort will be recognised by the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our University system is unique. The lifeblood of any University system is interchange of staff and personnel and in our University it is especially difficult to combat what is called inbreeding, that is, building on your own staff who have not been away. Our sister University in Belfast which is part and parcel of the British system where the staff move around the whole system has no such problems.  Our difficulty is: what system do we move <Col N="1381" /> in because if we were to move in the British system&mdash;remember we are a University system that deals with a Christian and 95 per cent.  Catholic Republic&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just pointed out a few of the pitfalls, that should be guarded against in grappling with these problems.  Once the Bill leaves this House to-day, the end has come for newspaper controversy and the grossly unfair attacks on U.C.D. and its members.  As Senator Barry has so ably expressed it, these attacks are, and I quote his words, &ldquo;a field day for those both within and without this House who could injure the cause <Col N="1382" /> of Catholic education in this country.&rdquo; Those who have a genuine contribution to make from this on would be far better employed in getting together in groups, studying the problem and preparing their submissions for the forthcoming Commission rather than in dissipating their energies in less useful directions.  The Commission will be the ideal place in which to air views.  Appearing before the Commission will be at once the rational and the true approach and we hope that that will be the test applied in the case of those who are merely destructive rather than constructive in their criticism. On the other hand, those who are constructive have a real desire to ensure that we shall get going in the next 25 years on a course which will lead our Universities to even greater heights in the future.</P>
      <P>I should like to think that, as a result of deliberations, the Charter will be changed as infrequently as possible. Any changes necessary should be made now and should evolve out of the deliberations of the Commission.  The Senate of the National University and the Constituent Colleges would, of course, be in a position to make further recommendations, if necessary, on points the Commission might not touch on in order to ensure that the composite result will be that the chartered body will effect such essential amendments to the constitution as will enable us to go forward in our time assured in the knowledge that the National University will remain, as it has always been, Ollscoil na hÉireann.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>My reasons for speaking on this Bill are several. First and foremost, the matter is one of public interest, because we are all agreed, I think, that the Universities here in Ireland are in a situation of public trust.  Not all the funds of the Universities are supplied by the community, but quite a proportion of them are.  Consequently, those of us who have anything to do with the Universities are holding, as it were, a public trust for the sake of the community. Matters touching the Universities then necessarily are of public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take pride in the fact that the <Col N="1383" /> first lay Registrar of University College, St. Stephen's Green, was my own father, Francis Sheehy Skeffington in 1903.  My family has had quite a number of other connections with U.C.D.  I can claim to know something of it myself.  I have been an external examiner to the National University on two different occasions, to the three Constituent Colleges.  I know something about the working of Universities.  I feel, therefore, entitled to speak on the subject.</P>
    <P>The concept of a vocational Seanad is an odd one, and not one, I think, which should be overstressed.  I do not think any of us would accept the view (a) that Senators should never talk off their own subject because there are others more fit to talk, and (b) that they must never talk on their own subject for fear of hurting their colleagues' feelings.  As Senators, we are entitled, and indeed it is our duty, to speak on all subjects in relation to which we think we can contribute something.</P>
    <P>It is, then, indeed, with a sense of something like a double duty that I rise to speak on this Bill because I am convinced that in much of what I shall say, I shall be speaking for the vast majority of the graduates of the National University of Ireland as well as for a considerable section of the public.</P>
    <P>I think that the two speakers today who expressed as nearly as possible the views I should like to put forward were Senator Ryan, who spoke admirably, very much to the point, and without heat, and Senator Barry, who spoke from the public point of view, and mentioned matters which I think should be mentioned.</P>
    <P>I am strengthened in my conviction that I speak for a large number of the graduates of the University by reason of the resolution passed after a comprehensive and conclusive discussion at a Convocation of the graduates of the National University on 24th of last month.  That increases my certainty and I feel that Convocation has provided, if such were needed, a full vindication of the National University, as a <Col N="1384" /> body eminently competent to look after its own affairs and to be concerned about such matters as have arisen.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that the resolution passed by Convocation on 24th May read as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Convocation noted with regret the violation of the rule of law in University College, Dublin, revealed by the Report of the Board of Visitors, and also noted the failure of the Senate of the National University of Ireland to investigate properly the legality of certain appointments when their legality was responsibly questioned.</P>
    <P>Now that resolution, as the House will know, was passed by 355 votes to 55. It should, I think, be put on record here as representing the responsible view of a large and representative body of the graduates of the National University on the matter about which we are concerned today.  What I find so heartening, and what makes me say that Convocation represents a vindication, is the fact that these graduates thus assembled, drawn from various age groups, were unafraid to tackle the problems and to discuss them freely; they were likewise not to be silenced or cowed by any thunderous intimations to Convocation that to express, by resolution, an opinion on the administration of University College, Dublin, would be arrogating functions to Convocation which it did not possess.</P>
    <P>Surely, we must recognise that graduates of National University, Ireland, above all people, have the right to have and publicly express opinions on the way in which any, or all, of the Constituent Colleges are being run. To suggest that they have no such right is, I submit, a betrayal of the proper view of the results and functions of University education, which, in my opinion, is not for the purpose of producing cowed and frightened people, afraid to offer opinions, but rather men and women of the world, with minds and opinions of their own and the courage publicly to proclaim them. That is part of the function of a university. There is no question in my mind about University College, Dublin, <Col N="1385" /> or the other constituent Colleges of National University not having fulfilled that most useful function.  That is demonstrated by the discussion at Convocation.</P>
    <P>I should like, furthermore, in support of my view, that such is part of the function of a University, to quote Cardinal Newman, who was the first Rector of the Catholic University of Ireland, and who was quoted as follows by Archbishop Walsh, who was the first Chancellor of the National University of Ireland.  This is the quotation in <i>The Irish University Question</i> by His Grace, Archbishop W.J. Walsh, in 1897, the quotation being from Cardinal Newman:</P>
    <P>Why do we educate except to prepare for the world ...?  If then a University is a direct preparation for this world, let it be what it professes.  It is not a Convent; it is not a Seminary; it is a place to fit men of the world for the world.  We cannot possibly keep them from plunging into the world, with all its ways, and principles, and maxims; but we can prepare them against what is inevitable; and it is not the way to learn to swim in troubled waters, never to have gone into them.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, that is a very true assessment of the duty of the University, and I feel that the National University has demonstrated, by the responsible voicing of opinions by the Graduates, that it has clearly been fulfilling that function well.  Convocation, as I say, expresses the Graduates' view, and, indeed, the public's view on this matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to say at this juncture that none of us can afford to be too touchy about this matter.  It would be absurd for somebody from Trinity College to stand up in a kind of patronising way to say to the National University of Ireland: &ldquo;You are jolly good.  Your standards are high,&rdquo; and so on.  All of us are vulnerable; we are all standing in the same kind of situation; we are all open to public criticism.  I hope that if a similar situation were to be revealed at Trinity College nobody would feel <Col N="1386" /> inhibited from voicing an opinion on the matter in the public interest, for fear of hurting the feelings of the Board of Trinity College, or of its Graduates, or even of its Senators.</P>
    <P>Let us recognise that the kind of situation that arose in U.C.D. could happen to any chartered body.  As has been suggested, it could happen to any institution, in fact, any school, any hospital, working particularly under an ancient Act or Charter.  Let us, therefore, not have any suggestion that it could not.  I speak here as a representative of the graduates of Trinity College, but let me make it quite clear that I speak in no &ldquo;holier-than-thou&rdquo; attitude.  I fully recognise that this kind of thing can happen, with the best intentions in the world, under an ancient Charter, which may well have fallen out of harmony with the exigencies of a modern situation.</P>
    <P>It is quite possible inadvertently to exceed one's powers in such a situation under a Charter, although as has been suggested&mdash;I think Senator Ryan made that clear&mdash;one would like to have the right to expect when that does happen, a certain expression of contrition, a certain expression of regret.  I cannot help saying at this juncture that I feel that Senator Hayes, in making his case and speaking as he did, saying there is nothing wrong, that nothing has been illegal, that the only thing that is all wrong is the Report of the three judges, &ldquo;we have acted absolutely regularly&rdquo;&mdash;Deputy McGilligan made the same kind of speech&mdash;I cannot help feeling that Senator Hayes and such people speaking or claiming to speak for University College, Dublin, are doing their case a serious injustice.  It would have been far better and it would have given rise to far less discussion if the official attitude had been to say: &ldquo;We now see we have made a mistake.  We submit there were very considerable extenuating circumstances.  Please make it easy for us now to repair the situation&rdquo;.  That is precisely what the Government are trying to do.  In that way, I think a good deal of fuss would have been avoided.</P>
    <P>But that is not the attitude.  The attitude is: &ldquo;we have done no wrong: <Col N="1387" /> we can do no wrong; there is nothing irregular; only the Judges are wrong.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I notice that when a student transgresses he must apologise and apologise in public; and he will even be told that if he apologies then, the matter of his proceeding for his degree will be &ldquo;considered.&rdquo;  He is not told &ldquo;You can go up for your Degree if you apologise.&rdquo;  He is told &ldquo;Apologise first.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The demand for an apology after a transgression is not that a student is told &ldquo;Apologise and then you may proceed.&rdquo;  He is told &ldquo;apologise and then we may consider whether you may proceed.&rdquo;  Now, I am not a great person for demanding apologies and so on, but I think at least some few marks of contrition should have been observable in the attitude of those who presented the case for the present administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How did the present case arise?  It arose in U.C.D. for three principal reasons.  The first is the immense growth in numbers.  They have got something like 5,000 students now in U.C.D.  I might be right in saying in parenthesis that, in my opinion, looking forward, they will one day be looking back upon that as a small number.  I think the National University of Ireland and U.C.D. can look forward to the day confidently when there will be 10,000 or 20,000 students in U.C.D.  I do not want to go into the Belfield question&mdash;it would not be in order&mdash;but I think that conviction of mine is relevant to the necessity for moving the College.  The fact is that the numbers have so grown that the numbers required on the staff are <Col N="1388" /> very, very big, and consequently fresh appointments, fresh staff, are needed.</P>
    <P>That is the first reason for the situation which arose.  The second is that the mechanism for filling certain teaching posts was cumbrous and unwieldy.  The third reason was that a certain reclassification of the teaching staff was considered to be necessary. What might have been legitimate 50 years ago, no differentiation between lecturers and assistants and so on, as Senator Hayes has said is no longer acceptable but the whole pattern has changed, and some reclassification was necessary.  I shall come to reasons one and two in a moment&mdash;the growth in numbers and the unwieldy mechanism&mdash;but on the third point, on the necessity for reclassification, a change in the nomenclature, a change in the status of large numbers of these lecturers, I should like to quote from the Report of the Visitors at page 2.  It says:</P>
    <P>So far as the Minutes disclose there was no discussion about the change involved in the reclassification of the teaching staff and no reason is recorded for the change, nor is there any record of a decision to make the change.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary to pause on that, but just to notice that that comment is made.  I think a reclassification was necessary.  That is the only reference to it.  Apparently, there is no record of it having been duly discussed and decided, but it was carried out.</P>
    <P>The other two points are both fully recognised as valid by the Report.  I feel that Senator Hayes, Deputy McGilligan and others do far less than justice to these three men, these Judges, these Visitors, in failing to recognise that time and again in their Report the Visitors recognised that there was much to be said for the case made by those who supported the College and the case that is being made now.</P>
    <P>I would just like to quote in support of that from the report.  On page 7 it states:</P>
    <P>The Board</P>
    <P>meaning the Board of Visitors</P>
    <P>was also told that the existing practice in relation to these appointments <Col N="1389" /> required an applicant to furnish 150 copies of his application, testimonials, etc., and in addition, in order to have any chance of success, that he should conduct a personal canvass of the individual members of the Governing Body and of the Senate.</P>
    <P>I think it is quite clear that the mechanism was cumbrous and is recognised as having being such, because the Board goes on to comment on that:</P>
    <P>The Board accepts that this costly, undignified and undesirable practice exists, and further accepts that it tends to make it impossible for any successful application to be made by a person resident outside the country. The Board also accepts that the existing practice would have made it difficult and unwieldy to have had Lecturers appointed by the University in the numbers which the College considered it necessary to have appointed in the past 10 years.  The Board considers that the existing practice may also have the effect of deterring a suitable person from becoming an applicant.</P>
    <P>I feel justified in saying that the Board of Visitors have, by the comments I have just quoted, fully conceded that the mechanism was unwieldy, that owing to the growth of numbers and the necessity for large numbers of teachers it was virtually impossible to recruit under the old method&mdash;in other words, it recognises quite specifically the necessity for some change in the method, but the final sentence in that paragraph on page 7 is this:</P>
    <P>The Board is not satisfied, as at present advised, that the method of appointment laid down by Charter, divorced from the practice referred to, is of itself unwieldy.</P>
    <P>I think that is quite important because the suggestion there is that much of what has grown up by way of unwieldiness, canvassing, furnishing 150 copies of testimonials and so on, is an accretion after the Charter, and is not implicit in the Charter.  That may or may not be true, acceptable, or sufficient in itself, but it is certainly not <Col N="1390" /> irrelevant when one is wondering what kind of change might be made.</P>
    <P>I think those comments, and the further ones I am about to quote, are most judicial and scrupulously fair; and yet Senator Hayes has seen fit to attack the whole Report of the three Judges who were doing their duty in making it.  I may say here that I, and I think many people in the country, are far more disturbed by the attitude of the defenders of &ldquo;the establishment&rdquo; in U.C.D., than by what is revealed in the Report.  I think what is revealed in the Report pales into insignificance beside the fact that people like Senator Hayes, and Deputy McGilligan, are so absolutely intransigent in saying that they have an absolute right to do all that they did, that the Bill is &ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo;, and that the Report is a bad one.  I suggest that that kind of speech and that kind of approach have a lamentable effect, not only in the House but in the country, and do damage to the cause they seek to defend.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes permitted himself to say yesterday that all this arose because &ldquo;a small group of persons&rdquo; opposed to the Governing Body, and in particular to the person of the President had been hostile and worked up the agitation.  He really does not do his cause any good by suggesting that.  He cannot really ask us to believe that the whole Report and conclusive vote in Convocation are the result of some fiendishly clever, appallingly hostile little group of people.  I do not accept that, and I do not think that many people could accept it.  He said not merely was the Report &ldquo;unsatisfactory&rdquo;, and &ldquo;devoid of the calm analytical approach&rdquo; and so on, but he even said that the findings &ldquo;have no legal force or effect&rdquo;.  I am quite sure Senator Hayes said that knowing precisely what he meant, and convinced of its truth&mdash;that the finding of the Report have no legal force or effect, but where did they spring from?  After all, under the 1908 Act, the Government are the Visitors.  They had the right to delegate their powers and they appointed three Visitors.  It does not matter whether or not they were judges.  By so appointing them <Col N="1391" /> there is no reason to think but that the findings of the Report have a very strongly compelling effect upon the Government, and I could quite imagine the Government being very bitterly criticised if, having such a Report in their hands, they took no action.  Yet Senator Hayes said that the Report has no legal force.  He went further than that.  He said that a certain statement in this Report&mdash;and I took down the phrase&mdash;&ldquo;is entirely unworthy of any person holding judicial office.&rdquo;  What kind of slanging match is that?  What kind of damage does Senator Hayes think he does to the Judiciary by that kind of abuse?</P>

      <P>I do not think he does the Judiciary any harm, and I have sufficient affection for Senator Hayes to say I am sorry, but I think it does Senator Hayes harm. I cannot believe it does good to the public interest.  I think it is a grossly improper remark.  I protest, and I think my view is shared by many Senators, against that kind of vilification of the three Judges here who were doing their duty and, in my opinion, doing it well, in difficult circumstances.</P>
      <P>I should like to quote further from page 7 of the Report in support of my view that the Board has behaved very judicially and scrupulously fair. This is the paragraph I want to quote next:</P>
      <P>In the second place, it was urged, in particular in relation to the Faculties of Science and Engineering, that it was difficult to get teaching staff, and that it was necessary to be able to approach a desirable Lecturer and offer him a lectureship, subject on his acceptance, merely to the formal approval of the Governing Body.</P>
      <P>What does the Report say on that?</P>
      <P>It says:</P>
      <P>The Board accepts that difficulties do exist in Faculties such as Science and Engineering in particular, in obtaining suitable teaching staff.</P>
      <P>That seems to me to be sound and true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1392" /> Again, in the paragraph at the end of page 7, the Board says:</P>
    <P>In the third place, it was put forward that from the purely administrative point of view it was preferable to have a Faculty or Department headed by a Professor with all the teaching staff under him....</P>
    <P>I do not want to quote that at length but I do want to quote the sentence which I think, in all justice.  Senator Hayes might have had adverted to when they say:</P>
    <P>A very big question of principle arises at this point on which the Board does not propose to venture an opinion.</P>
    <P>I think Senator Hayes attacked the judges most unfairly on this point, for even conceding that there might legitimately be discussion about this principle. There is, of course, a point of principle involved&mdash;it has been recognised as perfectly just by Senator Hayes and by everybody on both sides, and I do not see why the judges have to be hit with it&mdash;that, from the point of view of administration, it may be necessary for a Professor to have complete control, but that, of course, from the point of view of teaching and research, the Professor does not want absolute control.  Therefore, we are all agreed that any kind of such absolute departmental dictatorship would have a stultifying effect, and I do not think anybody has been asking for it.</P>
    <P>Again, on a further point, the Board concedes the point of view put by the College and says, at page 8:</P>
    <P>It was stated that the present system of appointing College Lecturers and Assistant Lecturers gives a flexibility in the running of Faculties and Departments which would not exist if all Lecturers were appointed by the University and, in particular, permitted of leave of absence being easily granted to suitable persons for the purpose of study abroad.</P>
    <P>Upon that the Board says:</P>
    <P>The Board accepts that the system has these advantages.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1393" /> The Board again concedes, but it does say towards the end of the following paragraph:</P>
    <P>It is unnecessary to set out in detail the arguments advanced in support of the claim of the College that it has power to appoint not only College Lecturers and Assistant Lecturers but also College Professors, but having given careful consideration to the submissions of Counsel the Board has no doubt but that on the true construction of the College Charter and, in particular, of Clauses III and XII thereof the claim is misconceived.</P>
    <P>I do not think they could put their findings in a more judicial and scrupulously fair way.  They concede the advantages but they say that under the present Charter the College has not got these powers.  It is entirely fair and very definite.</P>
    <P>What is the result of all this?  What is the result of the situation as it was found?  That is expressed as follows:</P>
    <P>When it was faced with the necessity of providing</P>
    <P>&mdash;and this necessity is something that they recognised and that we all recognise&mdash;</P>
    <P>a greatly increased teaching staff the College, if it wished to have additional Professors or Lecturers appointed, had two courses open to it:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  to take the necessary steps to have the necessary Professorships and Lecturerships established, and to have the vacancies therein filled by the University, in the manner prescribed by the Charters of the College and the University, or</P>
    <P>(2)  to make representations to the Government that the College Charter was outmoded and unsuitable to meet the demands of the new situation and to seek to have the Charter suitably amended.</P>
    <P>Can anybody really say that that is unfair comment or an unfair suggestion on the part of the Board of Visitors? Why should we get all hot under the collar at such an entirely unexceptional <Col N="1394" /> statement of the position? I think it is recognised by everybody that the Charter must be altered.  It is perfectly true, as Deputy McGilligan said, that other Universities, Queen's University, Trinity College, have got powers that the University Colleges have not got.  The sooner the University Colleges get those powers to make internal changes, the better, but in order to get them they must be acquired legally.  It is, in other words, perfectly legitimate to ask for greater autonomy, with whatever safeguards Parliament decides, but it is not legitimate to seize such autonomous power without asking, without putting it through the ordinary legal channels.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say, therefore, that if such power is required&mdash;I think it is required and we all agree that it is required&mdash;the College or the University should have asked for it.  The answer to that suggestion is astonishing.  The answer is that they did ask for it.  I quote from the Dáil debates.  Volume 181, No. 8, Columns 1106 and 1107. The speech is that of Deputy McGilligan. He says these things:</P>
    <P>I know as a member of the Government that in the year 1948 ...</P>
    <P>twelve years ago</P>
    <P>... a deputation</P>
    <P>not just a letter</P>
    <P>... from U.C.D. put that question of amendment of the Charter as one of their demands before the Government of that time.</P>
    <P>So that, in saying they should have asked for it, I am not condemning the University or the College.  They did ask for it, and they asked for it of the Government in 1948 of which Deputy McGilligan was a powerful and influential member for the three following years, 1948 to 1951.</P>
    <P>What is the answer they got?  He says:</P>
    <P>I am instructed that they made a similar approach to a later Government. They got the same answer on both occasions&mdash;that it was a very big question and that it was better to carry on as they were.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1395" /> He adds at the end of that paragraph:</P>
    <P>But the amendment of the Charter was sought.</P>
    <P>Further down in the same column Deputy McGilligan says:</P>
    <P>It is strange that it is, so to speak, only the Catholic University system that should not have the freedom which the other systems have in this country and which many of the English Universities have and which has been very generously granted to many of the English Universities.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Anyhow, a request was made and the request will be made again and I suggest to the Minister that the only way he can couple University freedom with an easier situation is to give the University authorities, the College authorities who appreciate the difficulties of running an institution under that old document, the power they require, subject, of course to its being put here to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Surely that is the rational and intelligent way of doing it, but why on earth does Deputy McGilligan get up in 1960 and say this is the only just way to treat the Catholic University in Ireland and, in the same breath practically, admit that he was asked officially by a deputation from University College, Dublin, to do that very thing at the beginning of a three-year tenure of office of the Coalition Government in 1948, and say that they refused it because it was a big question?</P>
    <P>He was also in power for a further three-year period from 1954 to 1957, during all of which time and even while he was in Opposition in between, he could have been musing, or the Government could have been musing, upon the kind of changes in the Charter which he regarded as absolutely necessary in order to give justice to the Catholic University system of this country.  It is absolutely inconceivable that he should recognise so blatantly there the necessity for altering the Charter and admit that they were asked to alter it 12 years <Col N="1396" /> ago, and then get up and bleat because the Government have now discovered a situation under the 1908 Act upon which they had to appoint Visitors and upon which it is now absolutely mandatory for the Government to act.</P>
    <P>I have quoted from the Report, I hope at not too great length, but the Report, in my opinion, makes this Bill absolutely necessary.  I have tried to show, and I think have shown successfully, that the Report is fair, that it is discriminating, that it is judicial, comprehensive and decisive, and yet Deputy McGilligan in the Dáil and Senator Hayes today criticised it. Deputy McGilligan, for instance, as reported in Volume 181, says of it that it is a bad Report and says of the Bill, at Column 1091:</P>
    <P>... this is a very doubtful piece of legislation.  It is an interference with University freedom.</P>
    <P>Really, what does Deputy McGilligan want?  He wants the Charter amended.  When the Government try to do it or, at any rate, to hold the ring, as it were, until such time as a judicial change of the Charter may be brought about, he says, &ldquo;... this is a very doubtful piece of legislation.  It is an interference with University freedom.&rdquo; He permits himself, at Column 1095, to say that the Report is only &ldquo;a series of three opinions,&rdquo; that it is &ldquo;not a judicial determination,&rdquo; and it is not a judicial finding.</P>
    <P>I am not a lawyer but I beg to differ from Deputy McGilligan on that.  It is a judicial finding, and it is mandatory upon the Government to take action upon it.  It is legally binding until it is tested and set aside by the Courts, and if the Government were not to act upon it they would be acting extremely improperly and would be open to the gravest criticism.  It is so binding, until it has been tested and set aside by the Courts.  No such test has been asked for and unless the findings of the Report are binding, this Bill is quite unnecessary and would be a gross waste of the time of both Houses, and of money also, and should be thrown out forthwith.</P>
    <P>I notice that on the Second Stage in the Dáil Deputy McGilligan voted for <Col N="1397" /> the Bill, and I am quite convinced that Senator Hayes will be voting for the Bill presently.  He certainly gave no indication that he intended to vote against this Bill which he says is quite unnecessary.  Therefore, the passing of unnecessary legislation is apparently part of the Fine Gael policy at this moment.</P>

      <P>Yes.  As a matter of fact, I was dealing actually with Senator Hayes, who is a member of this House.  In fact, the suggestion, which was made here as well as in the other House, that the Bill is unnecessary, is nonsense, they all know it is nonsense and that is why they vote for it, though they say it is unnecessary.</P>
      <P>Now, on the ninth page of the Report, the Board says, towards the last paragraph:</P>
      <P>The practice of appointing College Lecturers and Assistant Lecturers in the College could, and in the opinion of the Board would, lead to the situation that a large majority of the teaching staff would be appointed by the College from within the College without the posts being advertised.</P>
      <P>There was a suggestion in the Dáil by Deputy McGilligan also on that point at Column 110 where he said:</P>
      <P>I rather think there will be a cynical smile on the faces of a number of people when they discover that members of the judiciary have some apprehension about a system of patronage and a fear that there might be a deterioration in some part of the public life of the country, if patronage were allowed to creep in&mdash;patronage being the filling of posts which fall vacant not through the medium of advertisement and not by some external method of selection.</P>
      <P>The only reference to patronage in the Report is that at the end of the paragraph I have quoted.  It says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1398" /> On the other hand, it is claimed that the standard is higher than it would have been if the appointments had been made by the University. There is, however, always the danger that the existing system could lend itself to patronage.</P>
    <P>I feel that Deputy McGilligan's remark and the suggestion made here today by Senator Quinlan who referred to the judges in contemptuous terms on this question of patronage constitute unwarranted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What I have quoted from the printed Dáil debates seems to me to constitute a disreputable attack upon three most distinguished members of the Judiciary who were doing their simple duty scrupulously, courageously and well, in circumstances which for them, as graduates of the National University, must have been difficult and even at times painful.</P>
      <P>I am strengthened in my view that this sort of attack is resented by the public when I read in <i>Hibernia</i> of May 20th the following comment on page 6:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all the more regrettable therefore that Mr. McGilligan should have, in the Dáil Debate on the U.C.D. Bill, launched such an irresponsible attack on the Judiciary. <Col N="1399" /> This is not the first time that Mr. McGilligan has attacked the Judiciary in this way.  In the debate on the P.R. Bill, together with Mr. John A. Costello, he made an even more violent attack on the judges.</P>
    <P>We wonder if Mr. McGilligan and Mr. Costello have any idea of the effect which this kind of talk can have on the general public.  How can ordinary people have any respect for the judges and the Law Courts if leading public men are prepared to speak of them in this way?  It is extraordinary conduct from men who are not only political leaders but former Attorneys General and in the front rank of the legal profession. Surely they should have more respect for the institutions of the State which they themselves helped to build?</P>
    <P>We are quite aware that the system of appointing judges, based on preferment for lawyers who have supported the Party in power, is a bad one, and we hope that, one day, it will be changed.  But, despite this bad system of appointment, Ireland has been very fortunate in the judges who have served her since the foundation of the State.  The highest standards have been maintained. Judges, once appointed, have always been above politics, and we know no case where any judge has left himself open to a charge of political bias.</P>
    <P>On the contrary we know of several cases where judges have given decisions which have been embarrassing to the Government of the day.  If the rest of us lived up to the standards of integrity and impartiality which the Judiciary has set for us, the community would be in a much healthier state.</P>
    <P>I felt justified in reading that extract from the editorial comment, because I feel in writing that way, <i>Hibernia</i> speaks for the majority in this country and in this House, in relation to that kind of attack.</P>
    <P>On this question of advertising posts, I feel that there is a good deal of <Col N="1400" /> truth in what Senator Quinlan says, and I should like to quote from an article by a person who is in a position to comment, I think very judically, on this question, about which, I think, there are misapprehensions.  I should like to add my support to the view that is stated here.  This is an article in <i>Hibernia</i> of May 27th by Dr. P. G. Walsh, Lecturer in Classics in the University of Edinburgh, and sometime of University College, Dublin. This is what he says about Lecturerships and advertisement:</P>
    <P>The new system of College Lectureships was a tremendous advance.  The charges made in the Dáil or elsewhere to the effect that they were reserved for sycophants, are infuriatingly unfair.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that these posts should have been advertised is a misleading one.</P>
    <P>That is the point Senator Quinlan was rightly making.  The quotation continues:</P>
    <P>Most of them were awarded to members of the Staff who had served for a probationary period as Assistants (in my case, for five years) and who had given tangible evidence of their value as teachers and researchers.</P>
    <P>It would indeed be a very desirable practice if all <i>initial</i> appointments in all the Constituent Colleges were advertised.</P>
    <P>That seems to be the point.  The quotation goes on:</P>
    <P>But an Assistant, once the probationary period has been served, has every right to expect that satisfactory service will be rewarded by a permanent Lectureship.</P>
    <P>Again, that seems to me to be the truth.  My experience of a University makes me see that is certainly a true, valid and constitutes a legitimate defence for the non-advertising of certain lectureship posts.  I would not go all the way with Senator Quinlan.  He seemed to think that where the field was very small, to advertise would in some way do harm.  I do not think <Col N="1401" /> so.  If there is only one candidate, it is better to advertise.  There might be some competition.  It would be better for the successful candidate to be able to say it was advertised.  I think it is fairer to the candidate appointed, where there are invitations outside, for the post also to be advertised.  It is not universally necessary, but it ought to be the rule rather than the exception, and certainly, in the initial stages.</P>
    <P>In page 6 of the Report, reference is made to the statutory posts being sometimes not filled and this comment is made:</P>
    <P>Counsel appearing on behalf of the College declined to give any reason for the decision to appoint College Lecturers and Assistant Lecturers, and did not attempt to justify these appointments on any meritorious basis.</P>
    <P>I do not understand that.  I do not see why the practice was not even defended.  It is quite clear that not all statutory posts need to be filled, but the point should be made, I think, that if in the administration of the College, the pool of talent, as it were, the group of holders of statutory posts, is too small, then the actual day-to-day administration of the College may suffer, because if the pool of talent from which the administrators are to be chosen, these holders of statutory posts, gets smaller and smaller and older and older, the result may eventually have a stultifying effect.  It has been said, and I have not really seen it denied, that the academic standards of University College, Dublin, are extremely high.  I do not think anybody wants me to add my word to that. It is beyond question that the academic standards in the National University and in each of the Colleges, and notably I think in University College, Dublin, are of the highest.</P>
    <P>I should like, however, to make one comment on the sort of defence made of, shall we say, administrative aberrations, on the grounds that scholarship is high.  It is perfectly possible to be a very great scholar and a poor administrator.  Anybody who knows anything about a University <Col N="1402" /> can think of a dozen examples of that.  Scholarship is not enough.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote Cardinal Newman on that very point.  He is quoted again by Archbishop Walsh in the book I have referred to, on page 8:</P>
    <P>There are men who embrace in their minds a vast multitude of ideas, but with little sensibility about their real relations towards each other.  These may be antiquarians, annalists, naturalists; they may be learned in the law; they may be versed in statistics; they are most useful in their own place; I should shrink from speaking disrespectfully of them; still, there is nothing in such attainments to guarantee the absence of narrowness of mind.  If they are nothing but well-read men, or men of information, they have not what specially deserves the name of culture of mind, or fulfils the type of Liberal Education.</P>
    <P>That seems to me to be worth quoting in relation to the defence sometimes put forward that these administrators are all distinguished scholars.  Scholarship is not enough.</P>
    <P>I should like to come now specifically to what has been the result of the Report&mdash;the Bill, which I have already said is absolutely necessary.  I think we must all recognise that, if we have read the Report.  I sympathise with Senator Seán Ó Donnabháin when he says he would like to get it on the record, but it is all available, and it was printed <i>in extenso</i> in one of the papers, and large extracts appeared in the others.</P>
    <P>I should like to make the point that it is really necessary to read the Report, to be acquainted with it, in order to see the full necessity for the Bill.  I would make this one criticism of the Government&mdash;that it did not at once fully realise that: it did not make the Report available sufficiently early, well before the Dáil debate.  My conviction is that if Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy McQuillan had not intervened in the debate, the whole Bill might have gone through the Dáil in four and a half minutes.  That would have been tragic, because if the Report <Col N="1403" /> is not read the whole necessity for the Bill would not be thoroughly understood, and the Government's attitude would be open to wide misinterpretation. However, the Minister has repaired that error and has now made the Report freely available.</P>
    <P>At least we have had an opportunity of reading the Report: I hope most of us have read it.  We can then see the necessity for the Bill.  Without having read the Report, one might imagine that the Government were trying to force something on an unwilling University College.  That view would have been strengthened by the kind of speeches made&mdash;talking about &ldquo;interfering with University freedom&rdquo;. When we read the Report, we fully understand the necessity for the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill has two separate objects. One is to validate the past, arising out of these errors, these aberrations.  The other is to validate the future up to a period of four years.  I see these as two separate objects.  The first object is unexceptionable.  It is absolutely certain that we must validate the past. Senator Hayes says there is nothing to it, but I disagree, the Government disagrees, and I think the majority of Senators disagree.  It is absolutely necessary to validate these past actions.  I am not so happy about the lengthy validation of the future.  As I understand the Minister, his attitude is: &ldquo;Clearly, until such time as we know how we ought to alter the Charter, it is only fair to let the University carry on as before; and as many of these posts are filled on a year to year basis it would be frightfully cumbersome now suddenly to ask the University Senate to fill I do not know how many posts.  Therefore, unless we give them some time in the future we should not say: &lsquo;We validate the past, but you must now work the Charter until we have changed it&rsquo;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Government say in effect: &ldquo;We will set up a commission.  We have not yet decided on its terms of reference. We do not yet know who will sit on it.  We assume that when we have done all these things, it will deliberate and report and perhaps make recommendations and the <Col N="1404" /> Government will consider these recommendations, and may decide to act upon them.&rdquo;  How many years does that make?  I do not know.  I think it was in 1954 that the Council of Education produced its report as yet unacted on.  I would be afraid it might be 10 years before the recommendations of this University Commission were acted upon.</P>
    <P>Now, I do welcome the idea of the Commission, and I feel it is legitimate to validate the past; it is also legitimate to make things easy for University College in this coming year.  We do not want to rush it and say: &ldquo;You must now validate all the posts for the coming year by passing them to the University Senate, and so on.&rdquo; Therefore, a year's grace or possibly two years' is justifiable.  Nobody wants to make it unnecessarily difficult. Surely it is reasonable, however, to ask that if the Charter has not been altered by the end of two years, then it could provisionally be followed again by University College, as it is by University College, Cork, and University College, Galway, and as it was followed by University College, Dublin, from 1908 to 1948.</P>
    <P>Would it be imposing an intolerable burden to say: &ldquo;If we have not altered the Charter by the end of two years would you mind making your appointments, until such time as we do alter it, under the Charter?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would be inclined to move amendments on the Committee Stage for the deletion of paragraphs (c) and (d) of section 2, sub-section (3) of the Bill, which would have the effect of allowing two years' grace and not four years'.</P>
    <P>I hope it has been possible for me, as I have striven to do, to comment in this way without being accused of hostility to University College, Dublin, which I think it is quite clear I have not got.  It should be clear also that in fact it is the friends of University College, Dublin, and of the National University who welcome the new wind of change that is blowing therein.  It is not people who are hostile who welcome the change therein, but, within the College and within the University as well as outside it, it is the friends of the National University <Col N="1405" /> who welcome the coming changes.</P>
    <P>Yet, we find, at column 1118 of the Official Report of Dáil Éireann, this kind of thing being said by Deputy McGilligan:</P>
    <P>The Catholic University system, as proposed for this country, has withstood many attacks.  Those who founded it got the help of the Irish people after the Famine period, as the Minister for Education mentioned in the Belfield debate.  The pennies of the famine-stricken poor of Ireland were collected to help Newman found the Catholic University, but the opposition to it has continued, and the lines of this debate have given great comfort to those who have been traditionally opposed to higher education for Irish Catholics.</P>
    <P>Further down, he says:</P>
    <P>But I do object to finding decent people in University College, Dublin, being dragged in by people following a lowdown tradition of opposition in regard to higher education for Irish Catholic people.</P>
    <P>That sort of comment, I feel, is simply balderdash.</P>

      <P>It is not made easy for me by that kind of illnatured interruption, persistent and repetitive interruption.  I am not attempting to use imagination.  I quoted something and I am letting it go at that, but I should like to make the comment that those who are endeavouring to encourage a new wind of change in the whole University situation, and it applies to Trinity College as well as to the National University, have higher ideals than those who are unashamedly trying to use the bludgeon of various types of emotional appeal to hit people who are sincerely criticising those who are opposed to any change. Even the judges themselves are being dragged in the mud because they have done their duty as Visitors.  I do feel that that kind of defence tactic is not legitimate.</P>
      <P>Finally, I should like to quote some remarks which won the approval of Archbishop Walsh in 1897, and were made by a representative of Trinity College in the British House of Commons.  I refer to Professor Lecky. On page xxviii of his introduction to &ldquo;The Irish University Question&rdquo; Archbishop Walsh refers in terms of eulogy to these remarks, recognising the validity and the representative character of these declarations by Mr. Lecky.  What Lecky said, speaking in Parliament in January, 1897, was:</P>
      <P>He hoped that in the course of the present Parliament the Government would see their way to gratify the desire of Irish Catholics to have either a University of their own, or else an endowed College connected with the Royal University....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1407" /> It was an incontestable fact that the number of Catholic students enjoying a University education was smaller than it should be ... Trinity College regretted that Catholic students did not come to it more freely....  But it recognised clearly the time had come for some modification in the University system of Ireland, and it only wished well to the Government in the action they might take....</P>
    <P>He would conclude, as he began, by saying he thought the time had come for some change in the University system of Ireland, and that as long as they in Trinity College were left unmolested in their own work, were allowed to keep their own unsectarian basis, and were not obliged to refuse anybody on account of religion, they would certainly not play the part of the dog in the manger, or be hostile to anything that might be set up for the benefit of the Catholics of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Archbishop Walsh paid high tribute to the expression of those sentiments on that occasion, and said he regarded them as fully representative of the Trinity College of that day.  I would regard those sentiments as being as true and as representative today as they were then.  All of us recognise the Government's desire to make it as easy as possible for University College, Dublin, and National University to remove cumbersome obstacles to progress which exist at present.  Therefore, I welcome the promise of a University Commission to go into the whole University question and I look forward to its being set up.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by complimenting the Minister and the Government on their persistent patience and strong and justifiable determination to save University College, Dublin, from the dangerous and anomalous position into which some of its oldest, and loudest, friends have allowed it to drift, and are apparently content to allow it to remain.  I compliment the Minister and the Government for endeavouring to save them from that danger, and it is in that spirit that I heartily support this Bill, which I consider essential as a temporary remedial measure.</P>

      <P>Some people feel obliged to support the Government on this measure, but at the same time they are anxious to have a smack at University College for various reasons into which I shall not go.  Senator Ryan referred to Senator Hayes and said that he wanted to see if Senator Hayes had his tongue in his cheek.  If ever a person spoke with his tongue in his cheek, certainly it was Senator Ryan in his contribution this evening.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to follow people down the various lanes they have gone because, as I see the position, this Bill arises out of a Petition made to the Government by Mr. John Kenny.  My view of his action is this: that Mr. John Kenny had a right to make a Petition and if so, he was perfectly entitled to use it.  Some people may say that those who do that kind of thing are cranks.  I am always on the side of the crank because&mdash;that may be some consolation to a certain Senator&mdash;the crank keeps everybody on their toes.  He has a particular point of view and no matter who likes it, he expresses it.  I think there would be many more abuses in our society, were it not for the fear people have that a crank will rear his head and raise his voice at a particular time.  I am sure that Mr. Kenny, whom I know, will not, I am sure, take exception to the suggestion that he might come within that category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He made a Petition and the Government, in exercise of its powers, set up the Committee consisting of three judges.  They found certain facts or, at least, they have given a particular construction of the Charter upon certain facts which they say they found. As far as this House is concerned, it is bound by that Report.  This House is not a court of appeal from the Visitors' Report; if it were, it might <Col N="1410" /> very well take a different view, as courts of appeal frequently do.  We have had one outstanding instance of that in recent times.</P>
    <P>There is a notion abroad, and it has been expressed frequently here this evening, that there is something very wrong in criticising the Report because the three people who made it were judges.  There is something to be said for the lawyers when all is said and done, because lawyers could criticise the same kind of report in court and express the selfsame views upon it as have been expressed here, but nobody would ever suggest that lawyers were in contempt or were disparaging members of judiciary.  If, in referring to the judges in the course of this debate, the epithet &ldquo;learned&rdquo; had been used as is done in the courts &mdash;&ldquo;the learned judge was wrong in law&rdquo;; &ldquo;the learned judge misdirected himself upon the facts&rdquo;&mdash;that is being said every day in courts of appeal and nobody takes exception to it, least of all the judges.  If the critics of the Report had proceeded on the basis that this Report could be challenged in the same way as a judgment of the High Court or of a divisional court is challenged, I do not think we would have people suggesting that because some Senators cannot accept the views of some judges, they are disparaging the judges.  Every other day litigants find themselves in a position where they do not accept the judgment of a court in the first instance and very often they are proved right and the judge wrong.  That merely means that the whole system is fallible.</P>
    <P>Since the Government have decided and found themselves bound to introduce this Bill and since there is no remedy available, it seems there is no option for the House in the circumstances but to accept the Bill.  My view of the controversy for what it is worth&mdash;I want to state it quite clearly &mdash;is that I believe that whatever the law is for the time being it should be observed by the Government, by Ministers, Departments of State, local authorities, statutory bodies, chartered bodies and individuals.  Therefore, I have no sympathy with anybody who finds himself wilfully in breach of the law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1411" /> A great deal of play has been made of the fact that the Governing Body of U.C.D. has been adjudged guilty of a breach of its Charter.  It is not at all uncommon here to find bodies with much more expert legal advice available to them being guilty of breaches of the law.  I want to call attention to the outstanding example of that that prevailed, not for ten years but from the very foundation of the State until 1956 in the Office of the Attorney General.  I should like to refer the House to the Civil Service Regulation Act of 1956, Section 19, where we have an indemnifying section to cover what was done from 1922 up to 1956.</P>
    <P>The reason was simply this&mdash;from 1922 until 1956, there was no statutory or other authority except the law of necessity for the making of appointments by any Minister of State to the Civil Service staff of the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, the Parliamentary Draftsman's office or in the office of the Attorney General.  Likewise, there was no power vested in anybody in the State to make any appointments to the various offices in the Houses of the Oireachtas since 1922.  And there was no visitation.  It was merely a private individual, a citizen who felt that in a particular situation in which he found himself, he should have this whole matter ventilated.  He went to the High Court and lost.  He then went to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court established beyond question that his contentions were correct.  The net result of that case was to establish that there was no power vested in anybody in this country to make the appointments which were made from 1922 until 1956.  Those appointed were people who were paid out of public funds, salaries, allowances and pensions and there was not a shred of legal authority for making these payments. Nobody says anything about that.  It was a mistake and that is all that is in it.  People can misconstrue constitutions and charters and instruments of that kind.</P>
    <P>At this stage I shall read the section for the benefit of the House.  It is Section 19 of the 1956 Civil Service Regulation Act.</P>

      <P>It is hereby declared that the power of appointing a person to be a member of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas or to be an officer of the Attorney General is vested in the Taoiseach and was, as respects any such appointment made before the coming into operation of the Constitution, vested in the President of the Executive Council and, as respects any such appointment made after the coming into operation of the Constitution and before the commencement of this Act, vested in the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>Of course, millions of pounds must have been spent without any legal or statutory authority, until that section was enacted.  That is not the only example.  These things are slipped into a section of a Bill which goes through and no one raises any objection.</P>
      <P>The Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1956 &mdash;and it was similar to this Bill&mdash; amended the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926.  Up to that time, people were being charged and being prosecuted&mdash;I do not know but, certainly charged&mdash; for licences for wireless receiving apparatus in motor vehicles.  It was found, after someone challenged it in the Courts, that there was no authority whatever for charging people for licences for wireless receiving apparatus in motor vehicles.  Consequently, we had the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1956 &mdash;which I do not propose to read to the House.</P>

      <P>If Senator Ó Maoláin did not interrupt, he would not be erupting like that.  It is repellent to find people, so to speak, in the same household, when a controversy of this kind arises, washing all the family linen in public.  That is extremely repellent and I entirely deprecate it. There is a good deal to be said for the attitude Senator Sheehy Skeffington adopted here this evening&mdash;except that he spoiled it towards the end&mdash;coming from another College that might possibly, but not always, feel itself to be entitled for one reason or another, to gloat over the errors of U.C.D.  We did not find that, but we found people from U.C.C. entering into this controversy in a most unwholesome fashion.</P>
      <P>The remarkable thing about all this is the fact that over all those years there was a Governing Body which apparently sat mute of malice while all these things were done.  That must remain one of the great mysteries associated with this matter&mdash;that there was a Governing Body, consisting of people of very high intelligence, some from the highest intellectual level and others with great practical experience, who did not apparently think that anything was wrong.  Perhaps the position may be that they believed that there was nothing wrong and, therefore, did not feel obliged to do anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is remarkable that the Senate of the National University who were presented with this problem, according to the Report, were not convinced of the necessity for obtaining legal opinion.  We all know that the person who presided over the Senate was the <Col N="1416" /> former Taoiseach, now the President. These are the remarkable mysteries about this controversy to which there has not been very much reference so far in the debate.  I do not intend to labour them further, but I must confess that the whole thing puzzles me.</P>
    <P>One other point about this Bill and this whole controversy is that, if the position has developed to the stage where this practice of appointing people on a year-to-year basis ceases, then some tangible good will have come of the whole controversy.  It is most objectionable, when posts which could be filled on a full-time basis, or any rate, for the duration of a person's life or until he reaches the age of 60 or 65, are not filled.  That is not doing any good to anyone, and I doubt if it effects any saving in money.  It certainly does not increase efficiency.</P>
    <P>The practice of appointing people on a year-to-year basis has all but disappeared in the public services. Recently, there were unfortunate people in the employment exchanges who found themselves in an awkward position because they were employed temporarily.  I would be glad if, as a result of this Visitation, the practice of making these temporary appointments ceased.  As far as I am concerned, in view of the way things are at present, in view of the fact that the Government considers this Bill necessary, I have no hesitation in supporting it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think most of what can be said on this matter has been said.  One admirable feature which now appears to be the case is that the one body associated with all this which has emerged with full credit is the Government in introducing this Bill. I was glad to see that all members of the House, with the exception of Senator Hayes, welcomed the measure as a good one.  So Senator Hayes is in a minority of one.  Everybody else, no matter what particular slant he had, agreed on the fact that it was necessary to regularise the appointments made and to continue to make appointments as they become necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to remember that Senator Hayes finds himself in the same company, in disagreement with <Col N="1417" /> this measure, as Deputy Dr. Browne, Deputy McQuillan and some Labour members when the measure came up for debate in the Lower House.  I deplore very much the sort of bitterness that was introduced by those Deputies in the Dáil, and by Senator Hayes here.  We had the members of the N.P.D. Party on the one hand, and Deputies McGilligan and Dillon on the other.  These two extremes in the Dáil, and Senator Hayes here, have brought an atmosphere of spleen into what could have been a very agreeable debate.  I deplore the extremes to which Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy McQuillan went in the Dáil in discussing the Governing Body of the College.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The attitude of the N.P.D. Party in the Dáil in muckraking and slandering a reputable institution and dragging it into the mud by making a personal attack on a respected individual in our society is to be greatly deplored.  Those irresponsible people have caused the standard of the debate to degenerate. We had responsible Deputies of the Fine Gael Party and the Leader of that Party in this House acting in this most irresponsible and deplorable way, bringing unnecessary bitterness into the debate.</P>
      <P>The Government, at any rate, have put the matter in order by bringing this measure before us and they are to be congratulated.  In regard to the report of the matters that have arisen, I think certain truths have emerged here and in the other House.  First of all, everybody, with the exception of the irresponsible people I have mentioned, must agree that the Report of the Board of Visitors is a well-argued and well-presented document. Following it, it was incumbent on the Government to pass it on to legislation. The Charter of the University was unwieldy in regard to the system of appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1418" /> In fairness to the College, it can be said that they often got good appointments, particularly in the technical sections of the College.  The standard of the appointments did not go down: in fact it went up in the Engineering and Science faculties.  I therefore deplore the irresponsible attitude taken up by the Governing Body of the College, and pursued by the Fine Gael spokesmen in the other House and by Senator Hayes here. Their tactical incompetence has brought a lot of trouble on themselves. An example is to be found on page 6 of the Report, to which Senator Sheehy Skeffington has referred.  It says:</P>
    <P>Counsel appearing on behalf of the College&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>That was Deputy McGilligan&mdash;</P>
    <P>declined to give any reason for the decision to appoint College Lecturers and Assistant Lecturers and did not attempt to justify these appointments on any meritorious basis.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan did not even argue the case.  I believe he walked out.  The Report continues by paying this tribute:</P>
    <P>It was left to individual members of the staff of the College to give to the Board their own personal reasons for supporting and approving of the actions of the Governing Body in this regard.  The Board wishes at this stage to place on record its appreciation of the candid manner in which the Dean of the Faculty of Science disclosed his reasons for advocating the continuation of the practice of appointing College Lecturers and Assistant Lecturers and for the trouble he took in obtaining information for the Board on the manner of appointment of teaching staff in the Science Department, and generally, in other University institutions.</P>
    <P>In other words, in that paragraph it is quite clear that the Board of Visitors appreciated the fact that it was necessary for the College in many cases to make these appointments, owing to the <Col N="1419" /> cumbersome nature of the Charter, but at no stage did Deputy McGilligan, when acting for the College, and at no stage later did any of the Governing Body spokesmen place their case on that candid basis.</P>
    <P>Instead, they blew hot and cold and came to us with the ridiculous assertion that the Bill was not necessary and was all nonsense.  If the Governing Body or the President came out with a statement that the appointments were not in accordance with the Charter, but that they regarded them as necessary and that they now thought the Charter should be amended and that an academic committee should be set up to do so, everything would have been all right.  All this hot air would have been completely unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Instead of this attitude of outraged innocence that there was no need for this Bill, they could have told us they were prepared to set up a committee that would change the Charter.  A committee of four or five academic people, with representation from outside, could sit and make recommendations and appointments as the Appointments Commission do for public appointments.</P>
    <P>I would agree with Senator Sheehy Skeffington on another important matter in this Bill.  I think it would be useful if the Commission on Higher Education were asked to present an interim report on the particular changes they might think necessary in the Charter to allow for a proper system of appointment.  That might meet Senator Sheehy Skeffington's point.  Four years is too long to wait.</P>
    <P>In regard to the remarks made about the judiciary, they, too, showed an irresponsible attitude.  The judicial system as developed here is the principal institution in the State guaranteed to protect our lives and our liberties.  It has served the State well and it ill behoves men prominent in public life in this country to criticise judges of repute.  That has been the approach recently.  It is a recent Fine Gael slant.  We had it from Deputy Costello and Deputy McGilligan during the debates on the Proportional Representation measure. <Col N="1420" /> We are now having it again from Deputy McGilligan and from Senator Hayes.</P>
    <P>The Government have properly abided by the recommendations in the Report and this Bill is presented as a result of the deliberations of three responsible members of the judiciary. I deplore the attitude, of those who repeated what the spokesmen of the N.P.D. Party had said.  One would have expected a more rational attitude and that they would have accepted this as a perfectly legitimate mechanical Bill to regularise the position in regard to University appointments. That reasonable approach was entirely lacking.  Instead of that, we had this arrogant and assertive attitude adopted by Senator Hayes, an attitude insensitive to reason and constructive criticism.  We had more constructive speeches in the Seanad than in the Dáil.  We had constructive speeches by Senator Barry and Senator Sheehy Skeffington and by Senator Ryan on this side of the House.  If there were an approach on those lines by the Fine Gael Party and by the N.P.D. Party, we would have had less carping and greater service might have been done to university education.</P>
    <P>It is important, if public opinion is to co-operate with and to have regard for our institutions, that our institutions should behave in a responsible way.  Our University, our Judiciary, our local authorities, our Parliament and our Civil Service are our major institutions and the public have a right to expect these institutions to behave responsibly and in a rational way.  The Government have behaved in a responsible way in regard to this Bill.  The members of the judiciary who acted on this Board of Visitors and presented this Report have behaved in a responsible way.  I would suggest there has been a certain  of responsibility on the part of the Governing Body of U.C.D., on the part of their spokesman and on the part particularly of Fine Gael spokesmen who made contributions in the other House.  I did not expect anything else from the N.P.D. Party.</P>

      <P>Táim an-bhuíoch de na Seanadoirí as ucht an cur chuige a bhí acu nuair a bhíodar ag cur síos ar an mBille seo. Dhein an díospóireacht a lán chun an scéal a shoiléiriú.</P>
      <P>I am indebted to Senators for their contributions which have helped very much to make the background of this legislation clearer in our minds.  They also, in their contributions, made it quite clear that there are many other problems in the realms of higher education which face the Government and I think that the expression of strong, diametrically opposing opinions on particular matters also makes it quite clear that this Bill was the only responsible action the Government could take.</P>
      <P>I hope the Seanad will have patience with me if I deal with the Bill again as I feel that to understand it sufficiently, and to understand what will be the machinery during this interim period, if the Bill becomes an Act, is to allay a lot of the anxiety which still remains in people's minds. I feel it necessary to emphasise what I said in relation to Section 2 when moving the Second Stage of the Bill and in order to make the position crystal clear, if I can, I propose to use a different form of words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 gives power of appointment to posts as Assistant Lecturers and College Lecturers, but an appointment cannot be made to a post that does not exist.  In order that such a post would exist, it would have to be created by a Statute of University College, Dublin, provided that the Senate of the National University agrees to the institution of the post. An Seanadoir Ó hAodha made the point that then these would be statutory posts and that is right.  They would be grades of lectureship posts, <Col N="1424" /> differing from the ordinary University lectureships that exist now, in so far as the Governing Body of University College, Dublin, would, for the limited period provided for in the Bill, be entitled to fill the posts.  There would be no difference in the nature of the posts so created as compared with the ordinary University Lecturer post.  The difference would be in the fact that the power of making the appointments thereto would be given to U.C.D.  The title is somewhat different.  It is still Lecturer but it is an Assistant Lecturer or College Lecturer, and I suppose the salary scale would be different.</P>
    <P>I think if people do understand how this Bill, with the Charter of the University College and the Charter of the National University&mdash;how those three together will work&mdash;it will make my problem much easier.  The Charter of the National University of Ireland reads in relation to the institution and filling of posts:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  To institute Professorships and Lectureships and any offices required by the University, and, subject to the provisions of the Irish Universities Act, 1908, and of this Our Charter, to appoint and remove the holders of such offices.</P>
    <P>(ii)  To appoint and remove the Presidents, Professors and Lecturers of the Constituent Colleges, subject to the Irish Universities Act, 1908, and to the provisions of this Our Charter and the Charters of the Constituent Colleges</P>
    <P>so that the appointment of Lecturers is the function of the Senate.  The institution of the post of Lecturer is the function of the Senate.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, the posts would be created by Statute in the same way as an ordinary lectureship but once they are called Assistant or College Lecturers the power to fill the posts would be given to the Governing Body of University College, Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Statutes are worded in a way which shows where the Senate comes in.  This is an example of the Statutes:</P>
    <P>There shall be established in the College in the event of its institution by the Senate of the National University of Ireland....</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1425" /> it goes on to state what the post would be.  That is what this Bill proposes to do and I think what I have said also covers what it does not do.</P>
    <P>The question arises why introduce a Bill and, as I said, and I think it was clear from what Senator Sheehy Skeffington said, it is the only responsible action the Government could take to deal with a situation which has arisen, and which requires to be dealt with urgently.  It is possible, as somebody mentioned, that the problem could be dealt with by an approach by the University to the Government to change the Charter and while I do not want to go too far into what has happened I should like to deal with Senator Sheehy Skeffington's quotation of Deputy McGilligan's speech &ldquo;that in the year 1948 a deputation from U.C.D. put that question of amendment as one of their demands before the Government of that time.&rdquo; I cannot deny that as the Deputy was a member of that Government.  He went on to say: &ldquo;I am instructed that they made a similar approach to a later Government.&rdquo;  I should like to say now that there is no record in my Department of any approach made by the University College in that regard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Barry mentioned the possibility of this being an interference which might come to be regarded as a precedent.  In reply to that, I should like to repeat what I said in the Dáil. This is a temporary measure.  It does <Col N="1426" /> not show, and it is not meant to show. any desire on the part of the Government to interfere with the autonomy of the University.  I should like to reassure Senators who are worried about that that, in my opinion, it does not raise any question of the creation of a precedent.  It is an urgent interim measure to meet an urgent situation.</P>

It has not been the practice to publish the Reports of Boards of Visitors but I did not think I could ask the Houses of the Oireachtas to legislate on something if they did not know the reason for the legislation. There was never any doubt in my mind but that I would have to make the Report available to both the Dáil and the Seanad.  Otherwise, I could not ask the Dáil and Seanad to legislate.</P>
    <P>On the question of not publicising the publication, it was never intended to keep the background information from the members of the Oireachtas and the procedure followed in making the Report available was the normal procedure followed in these matters. There was certainly no intention on my part of keeping Deputies and Senators unaware of the Report.</P>
    <P>The only other question raised was how long will the Bill continue in operation when it becomes an Act? It is given two years.  It should be quite clear now that it is not a question of two years' continuation of an existing practice.  The Bill creates a new type of practice and, far from being an interference with the University, it is enabling legislation to permit the authorities to meet the urgent needs which exist in relation to proper staffing, particularly in the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine.  The method envisages the co-operation of both bodies in its utilisation.  Its utilisation is dependent upon the co-operation of the Senate and the Governing Body and the period during which it can be used will be two years.</P>
    <P>The other two years mentioned arise in relation to giving the Government power, by Order, to renew <Col N="1427" /> the period.  I think that is necessary because the Commission would be bound to be influenced if we took very positive action and I should like the Commission on Higher Education to deliberate on all the different problems without there being any feeling that the Government had prejudged any particular issues&mdash; issues upon which they will have to make recommendations.  It is desirable, therefore, to keep the situation, as I am keeping it, until the Commission decide, among other things, on the method of appointments to the University.</P>
    <P>I do not think, as was suggested by one speaker, that the Commission will report early on a particular problem.  It would not be reasonable to expect them to study one particular aspect of higher education in isolation.</P>

      <P>They would possibly be better able, after covering a wide field, to decide on the particular problem of the method of making appointments.  I think, therefore, that matter should be left to the Commission. I do not think it would be fair to ask them to study one problem in isolation.</P>
      <P>I have in the course of my remarks answered Senator Ryan's question as to whether or not the Government condone the practices.  Whilst accepting the Report of the Board of Visitors, the Government are not, for the reasons I have given, expressedly pronouncing on what happened. The whole machinery of making academic appointments will be examined by the Commission and I do not want to hamper their deliberations now or prejudge anything they might recommend.</P>

      <P>It was my intention to table amendments to delete the clauses relating to the 3rd and 4th year.  I have no objection to the Committee Stage being taken now, but I think some further attention might be given to the matter with which the Minister has just dealt as to whether it is necessary to give these powers simply for two years, or whether it is really necessary to give them also for a 3rd and a 4th year.  It is my conviction still that if, at the end of two years, the Charter has not been amended, it might be reverted to, until it is amended on recommendation from the Commission.  I should like, therefore, to be allowed to put down amendments to delete clauses (c) and (d).</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>In subsection (3) of Section 2 to delete paragraph (c).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have two amendments and I take it they can be discussed together.  They are the same in intent.  What they mean is this.  The &ldquo;specified day&rdquo; up to which these powers are given is the 31st day of March, 1962, as mentioned in paragraph (b).  It may be extended under paragraph (c) to the 31st March, 1963, or further extended by a further year to the 31st day of <Col N="1429" /> March, 1964, under paragraph (d).  I am moving the deletion of these two paragraphs on the following grounds. Although I have followed attentively the Minister's remarks, and I realise that the intention is not to permit the continuance of exactly the same process in the interim period as obtained in the recent past, nevertheless it seems to me that it would not be unreasonable to ask that if by the end of March, 1962, the Charter has not been amended, the Authorities in U.C.D. might provisionally revert to the Charter, as it has been observed, and will have to be observed in the coming years, by both University College, Cork, and University College, Galway.</P>
    <P>I cannot feel that it would place a great disability upon the College to ask them to do this, particularly when it has been made clear that at least some of the cumbersome and unwieldy features of appointments by the University Senate are not in fact implicit in the Charter and are capable of quite simple amendment.  Such matters as the personal interview of 150 people, the printing of 150 copies of applications and so on, are not necessary under the Charter, as I understand the Report of the Visitors. Therefore, it seems to me that in the two years during which the Bill will be operative, it ought to be possible to find ways and means to operate the Charter more simply.  If that did not turn out to be possible I think it would not be unreasonable to ask the Government to come to the Oireachtas in two years' time and tell us that, and ask that the powers in this Bill be continued.  I feel, in other words, that to allow the Bill to continue for four years is rather putting it on the long finger.</P>
    <P>Although I grant that all the Government are asking is the right, if necessary, to extend it to the third year and, if necessary, to extend it to the fourth year, I feel the Government really do not need those powers. Although I have every sympathy with the necessity for them for a year or two, two years seem to me to be enough.  I do not think it would be unreasonable to ask, as I say, that after that, the procedure under the Charter <Col N="1430" /> might be reverted to, until such time as the Charter is amended.  For those reasons I beg to move the deletion of paragraphs (c) and (d) of subsection (3) of Section 2.</P>

      <P>Members should realise that it is always the practice to deal with amendments before dealing with the section itself.  I thought that was understood.</P>
      <P>I rise to oppose the amendment.  I have not already spoken on this Bill and I think it desirable that any further discussion should be confined to people who have not already spoken.  I think sufficient heat has already been engendered.  I oppose this amendment because I think it would do damage to the Bill.  I hope the mover of the amendment will realise that the period of indemnification, if I might call it that, is only two years and not four years.  If it is found necessary to lengthen that period, that will be done by Government Order.  That has been deliberately provided for in the hope of ensuring that a better scheme of things will exist at the end of two years.  I think that is reasonable and I hope Senator Sheehy Skeffington will have regard to it.</P>
      <P>This is not a question of the University authorities getting their Charter amended and their house put in order, so to speak.  As the Minister said, the Government are not anxious to do anything in this matter until the Report of the Commission on Higher Education is available.  After consideration of that Report, the Government may see fit to do something. For that reason I hope Senator Sheehy Skeffington will withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <P>I am speaking of the amendment and the damage it would do to the whole Bill.  I regard this section which it is sought to amend, and in the fact the whole Bill, as really only an indulgence.  It is not a pardon for past sin or a licence to commit sin in the future.  It is not condoning sin, as has been suggested by different people.  I think the simple definition of an indulgence, which I am sure the Senator and other Senators have learned, is really the best definition of the Bill I can think of.  I hope the Senator will not press the amendment because I think it would damage the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I think what is in the Senator's mind is that the Oireachtas should have a chance to deal with the matter again if the extensions were being made after two years.  The extensions would be made by Government Order which will lie on the Table of the House and be open for discussion.  As I said, this gives power to the Government and not to the University.  Such an Order would be open to discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to waste the time of the House and I shall not speak at further length. I quite see that these would all be Government Orders which would lie on the Table of the House and that we would be entitled to challenge them.  My feeling was not so much that the Government could come back and ask us again, but that it would not really be necessary for the Government to do so, because, if these two years are given, that will surely afford time enough to find ways and means of working the Charter which would no longer be unwieldy.  Such a method could certainly be worked out by University College, Dublin.</P>
      <P>I am encouraged in that view by the sentence on page 7 of the Report, which says:</P>
      <P>The Board...</P>
      <P>meaning the Board of Visitors&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1432" /> ... is not satisfied as at present advised that the method of appointment laid down by the Charter, divorced from the practice referred to, is of itself unwieldy.</P>
    <P>The Board, in other words, does not think that the method of appointment laid down by the Charter is of itself unwieldy and, therefore,' I do not think it unreasonable to ask University College, Dublin, to revert to the implementation of the Charter, like its sister Colleges, until the Charter is changed. The Board of Visitors do not think that the method of itself is unwieldy. The unwieldy method is not implicit in the Charter.  Therefore, I do not think it unreasonable to say: &ldquo;Right&mdash;two years in which to carry on as at present, and under the new scheme&rdquo;, but by the end of that time I do not think it unreasonable to say: &ldquo;Would you mind applying the Charter until it is duly and legally amended, rather than carry on this provisional method, which the Board do not think is necessary, beyond this interim period of two years?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I find it very difficult to understand what Senator Sheehy Skeffington is trying to achieve because if it should happen that it became necessary for the Government to come back to the Oireachtas in two years' time, as a result of his amendment, we would have an even hotter debate as a result of all the material that had been assembled in the two year period than we have had upon this Bill.  I do not think that would do any good to the cause of higher education in this country.</P>

      <P>What the Senator now has in mind is that the practice which has grown up in U.C.D. for the past 50 years, or very nearly, should cease, that we should go back to the <Col N="1433" /> letter of the Charter.  It is unreasonable to expect that a practice which has grown up should, on the <i>ipse dixit</i> of Senator Sheehy Skeffington or anybody else, cease.  The practice is there &mdash;it may be very difficult, perhaps, to defend it&mdash;but there it is and, probably, there it will remain.</P>
      <P>I find it extremely difficult, as I say, to reconcile Senator Sheehy Skeffington's interest and friendship towards University College, Dublin, with this amendment which he has moved and I also find it very difficult to understand the philosophy that lies behind some of the things Senator Sheehy Skeffington says in this House.  Here, yesterday, upon the Hire-Purchase Bill, we had an amendment under which we asked that the Minister for Industry and Commerce in making regulations should consult certain people and Senator Sheehy Skeffington opposed that amendment and said the power should vest in the Minister, where it is safe.  The Minister for Education is proposing in this Bill, not to vest a given power in the Minister for Education, but in the Government and Senator Sheehy Skeffington is not satisfied with that.</P>

      <P>What Senator Sheehy Skeffington had in mind when he spoke last was that it might be interpreted that the Government are giving four years.  That is not my fault.  That is the fault of the people who interpret me as saying things I did not say&mdash;not the Senator but other persons.  What is being given to the University College in this Bill is two years.  Having named it as two years, it makes obvious my hope that the problem will be solved in two years but I have to be realistic and take into account that it may not be solved and that the Government will have to do something about it.  It is quite possible that by that time the Commission will be sitting and deliberating and it might be just an awkward time for sudden reversal, sudden change.  The intention is to give two years, hoping and considering that two years will be <Col N="1434" /> adequate, but giving the Government power to extend by Order, which can be discussed by the Oireachtas.  It does not give as much as it has been declared to give.</P>

I think it was worthwhile raising the question as to whether it would not be legitimate to say: &ldquo;At the end of these two years of grace, work the Charter until it is changed&rdquo; but I see that the Government, in fact, are in a position where it will be for them to decide whether to renew this or not and, in view of what the Minister says, I am quite content with that, and I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.</P>

      <P>It does seem to me that the Senate of the University and University College, Dublin, have an alternative to this section which may be much more workable.  I do not know that it is a matter of debate.  First of all, the Statutes for these posts have to be created in the normal way.  That takes up most of the time.  Then, of course, they have to be advertised and the appointment has to be made by the Governing Body.  When you reach that stage, it does seem that the time involved in having the appointment go on from the Governing Body to the Senate is only a matter of a week or two.  In other words, there may be special meetings of the Senate, if necessary, and then the appointment can be of any duration, up to whatever the period is prescribed in the Statute. It does seem to me that that is an alternative which both University College, Dublin, and the Senate will be able to bear in mind when they are considering how to work this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is, of course, absolutely correct, that Section 2 is an enabling section.  The position about it is that it creates a new type of University Lecturer under special conditions.  In spite of what has been said here, it may not be quite so easy to work and, particularly, perhaps, it would be impossible to work it with great celerity.  For example, the Governing Body of University College, Dublin, or any of the University Colleges cannot meet in July or August.  That is what is in the Statutes, or somewhere or other.  I think it is in the Act, as a matter of fact.  But what I would like to say is that I appreciate the approach of the Minister to this.  He is doing his best to solve the problem according to his lights and he is quite right in saying that this is an enabling section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate what the Minister is doing and he will on his side appreciate that University College, Dublin, may have some difficulty with this. Particularly, they may have difficulty <Col N="1436" /> with people who are now called College Lecturers and whose appointments must be renewed this month and who could not possibly be renewed, on the Minister's showing, as Lecturers until a Statute had been passed and that Statute will take some time to pass. There is, therefore, bound to be an interim period in which the titles cannot be bestowed.  The matter is one of some complication but I realise that the Minister is making provision for an interim period.  I understand what he is doing by making it two years, plus two years by Government Order.  Certainly this is an enabling section and certainly it must be looked into and, if possible, I suppose, it must be made work but there may be difficulties in it despite what is drafted actually at the moment.</P>
