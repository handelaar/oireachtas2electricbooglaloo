      <P>I notice that sub-section (1) says:</P>
      <P>On the operative date, the property in all petroleum which is not State petroleum shall vest in the Minister and his successors.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) reads:</P>
      <P>Compensation shall be payable by the Minister in respect of all petroleum vested in the Minister and his successors....</P>
      <P>I wonder what is the reason for excluding the words &ldquo;and his successors&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; in the first part of subsection (2)?  What is the reason for the differential between vesting the right to property in the Minister and his successors and not also vesting the liability in the Minister and his successors?</P>

      <P>The Minister is a corporation sole, as the Senator knows, and so far as the liability is concerned, it will be on a particular Minister at a particular time.  Once the property is vested in the Minister, the section makes it clear that it is also vested in his successors.  No matter what Minister is in office at a particular time, he is the person on whom will devolve the liability for payment of compensation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the fact that the Minister is a corporation sole, and for that reason I thought the words &ldquo;and his successors&rdquo; in Section 4 and again in subsection (1) of Section 5 were unnecessary. Apparently there is some idea of a necessity to be able to continue the right in the Minister and his successors to hold petroleum and it would also seem to me that liability to pay compensation should also devolve on the successors of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be on the Minister for the time being when the liability comes to be discharged.  That would equally apply in relation to the right to hold property since the Minister is Minister for the time being. There is a distinction which I am sure the Senator will see.  When this Bill becomes law, the right will be vested in me and also in my successors when appointed.  When the time comes that somebody makes an application for compensation, that application will be met and the compensation will be payable by the Minister for the time being.  There is that distinction.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 6 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the kind of legislation that does not have any particular appeal for me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section provides that no person, other than the Minister, shall search for petroleum in any area in the State unless he is the licensee under an exploration licence, a petroleum <Col N="683" /> prospecting licence or a reserved area licence which is for the time being in force and includes that area, or he is the lessee under a petroleum lease which has not expired and which includes that area.  Then, under sub-section (2), it will be an offence for any person other than the Minister to get, raise, take or carry away petroleum found in any area in the State, unless he is the lessee under a petroleum lease which has not expired and which includes that area, according to the provisions of sub-section (3).</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) is merely a procedural device to dispense with certain difficulties in proving offences in court.  I can understand the necessity from an administrative point of view of not requiring officers of the Minister to attend in court to certify that particular offences have been committed or to prove that a particular person is not the holder of a licence where a great number of licences are issued, as happens in the case of road transport legislation.  I submit, however, that the number of persons likely to hold an exploration licence, a petroleum prospecting licence or a reserved area licence will be very few.  The number of offences which might be committed under this section will be relatively few.</P>
    <P>I do not see that the same necessity exists for a certificate signed by an officer of the Minister in this kind of prosecution as would exist in a prosecution under the Road Transport Acts, where hundreds of people have licences for road haulage purposes.  I think this kind of legislation is undesirable and places the State, in a court of justice, in a relatively higher position than that in which it should be placed.  I should think the proper attitude towards prosecutions between the State and any citizen or any corporation should be to put both upon an equal footing.</P>
    <P>In this case, we have merely a certificate signed by an officer of the Minister and no proof will be allowed that any of the matters in the certificate are incorrect.  That seems to be <Col N="684" /> taking an unnecessarily wide power in a case where there are likely to be very few offences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The section as it stands was redrafted to meet an objection raised in the Dáil to the existing legislation.  That existing legislation is contained in Section 74 (2) (b) which provides that the onus of proof that he had lawful authority shall rest on the defendant.  I thought it reasonable to meet the objections raised in the Dáil and I shifted the onus of proof, by wording the section as it now stands, on to the State.</P>
      <P>It will be within the peculiar knowledge of the State whether any person had or had not a prospecting licence or any other right to work minerals and the State will, on bringing its prosecution, have to be represented in court.  They will have to produce necessary proofs, one of which will be a certificate signed by an officer of the Minister.  I think there is in that sufficient protection for anybody who is charged to rebut, if he can, the authenticity of the certificate or, if he has a licence or other authority, to produce it in court.  I do not think any undue hardship is created for any defendant by the section as it stands and it is a tremendous improvement on the original section in the 1940 Act.</P>

      <P>What is the significance of subsection (1) which reads:</P>
      <P>The Minister may enter into an undertaking with any person to grant to him an exploration licence or a petroleum prospecting licence or both those licences.</P>
      <P>Why can we not have a provision reading somewhat like this?  &ldquo;The Minister may grant an exploration licence?&rdquo;  Why must we have &ldquo;undertaking&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;grant&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can never understand the way laws are drafted.  I <Col N="685" /> cannot see the necessity, in relation to an undertaking, for instance, to state that it shall be lawful for a Minister to carry out the undertaking.  Surely the other thing follows as a corollary? I think the two points are different aspects of the same thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Cole's point is slightly different, with due respect to Senator O'Donovan.  In reply to Senator Cole, first, I would say that the provision here enables the Minister to carry out an agreement with an oil prospecting or oil producing company.  It is particularly in point here, inasmuch as an agreement has been entered into by the Minister with Ambassador Oil of the United States.  This section authorises the Minister, <i>post factum</i>, to enter into such an agreement.  The agreement envisaged with Ambassador Oil will come into effect only on the passage of this legislation.</P>
      <P>In reply to Senator O'Donovan, I can only say that, in matters such as this, I am in the hands of the Parliamentary Draftsman.  I assume his desire is to make assurance doubly sure.</P>

      <P>At least it is not as bad as something we had in another Bill that came from the Department of Industry and Commerce a while ago.  At least it means something.  I think it could have been got over by saying that the Minister is now deemed and always shall have been deemed to make undertakings.  I can see now that in the first one it is <i>post factum</i> and therefore the other matter follows on.  It is tying up the <i>post factum</i> end of it with two knots.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (1) of this section provides:</P>
      <P>The Minister may grant to any person such licence (in this Part referred to as an exploration licence) as it authorised by this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that &ldquo;person&rdquo; comprehends <Col N="686" /> an individual and company.  I wonder whether the Minister would grant a licence to a partnership, for instance, to two persons working as a partnership?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The word &ldquo;person&rdquo; envisages all types and groups of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would relate that to a later section on what happens upon death.  For instance, an individual of a partnership may become bankrupt, whereas all the other people may remain solvent.  One individual in a partnership may die.  The partnership agreement may provide that despite the death of one of the partners, the partnership shall continue to operate. However, if the Minister is right&mdash;we shall come to it later on&mdash;that &ldquo;person&rdquo; means an individual, corporation or group of persons, it does not seem that in the later section adequate provision is made in respect of what might happen in the event of the ending of a partnership on the death of an individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be impossible in the Bill to provide for a particular contingency in relation to the personnel that would enter into an agreement.  No agreement could provide for all the possibilities that might arise in the case of persons or partnerships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. I thought what is envisaged in this Bill was that the Minister would grant licences, either to a company or an individual, but that when it came to a partnership or co-operative society, they would be qualified to get a licence.  But from what the Minister now says, it seems that there are other provisions in the Bill which prohibit the Minister from making the arrangements of the kind he refers to.  However, that can always be got over by the Minister refusing to treat with the partnership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Deputy say &ldquo;refusing to treat with the partnership&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, by refusing licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="687" />
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that the only way to get over the difficulty might be to refuse a licence to people acting as a partnership, which might be undesirable.</P>
      <P>There is another matter arising on the section.  Subsection (6) provides that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Every exploration licence shall contain an indemnity clause whereby the licensee indemnifies the Minister against any claim arising out of the exercise by the licensee of his rights under the licence.</P>
      <P>I wonder what form the indemnity would take?  If the indemnity were merely a charge on the assets of the licensee, and as contemplated in the Bill, the licensee may go bankrupt, what would happen to the claims for compensation by the owners of the land which they might have against the licensee?  Will they have rights against the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In some respects they will and we shall come to a later section which will illustrate that point. If I may revert to the Senator's point about a partnership, if an agreement is entered into in a partnership, it is inherent that it will last only so long as the partnership lasts.  If an agreement is entered into by a person who subsequently becomes a unit in a partnership, it will be obvious that the person has responsibility to comply with the agreement.  If by reason of this change of status, he ends the partnership or his part of the partnership it will alter his obligation.  That must be taken into account.  He will have certain obligations to seek an amendment of his agreement in such circumstances.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 9.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 9 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in subsection (2), is to give 21 days' notice of the intention to grant a <Col N="688" /> petroleum licence in respect of a particular area.  The statutory requirement is 21 days and people have a habit of complying with the statute in giving the minimum requirement.  I wonder if 21 days will be sufficient to alert people to what is involved in the granting of a licence for prospecting in a particular area?</P>
      <P>The second point that arises on the section is that the Minister will publish notice of his intention to grant a licence in newspapers circulating the area.  I wonder if the Minister will publish in any other way.  Not everybody in country areas gets newspapers, or reads them, and it could well happen that the area which was the subject of a licence would be one of the more backward places where people might not be in the habit of getting newspapers and possibly they might know nothing, until it was too late, about the issue of the licence which would affect their property.  I suggest that the Minister might, in particular cases, go outside the statute and use posters or handbills, without incurring any obligations, to inform people who might not become aware of notices in the newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, this is a departure from the type of notice required under the 1940 Act, because under the 1940 Act, the amount of land which would be affected was comparatively limited and the number of owners involved would be equally limited.  In the case of petroleum, the area envisaged would be much more far flung and therefore there might be a great variety of owners and it was found impracticable to notify people directly by way of notice served, through the post or otherwise, on them.  It is for that reason that this method of notifying them by publication in a newspaper circulating in the area was decided upon in the case of petroleum and it was generally acceptable to all those who spoke on the subject in the Dáil.  I think no point was raised about the inadequacy of notice through the newspaper circulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was some question about the length of the period in which objection may be raised.  That was a case <Col N="689" /> in which as a result of the points raised in the Dáil, the period was extended to 21 days.  Originally, it was 14.  I think 21 days is a reasonable period.  However, there is no desire, I am sure, to be autocratic in the matter of giving notice of the issue of a prospecting licence and if there were a case which would justify it, I am sure there would be no difficulty in bringing it to the notice of the particular person that a prospecting licence was to be issued.  It is not in the Bill but I think the Senator has asked me to ensure that nobody will suffer hardship.  I am sure that point could be met.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have in mind is where a prospecting licence is to be given in a particular area and under that licence people are to be entitled to enter upon land.  These people affected should be in such position as would enable them to take steps to recover any losses that might result from that entry on their land by the owners of the licence. The longer the period that can be given to these people to reduce losses, which would also be to the benefit of the holders of the prospecting licence, the better it would be.  I am glad the Minister will see that avoidable hardship will not result from the length of the period.</P>
      <P>There is only one other matter to which I should like to refer.  The Minister referred to what was done in the Dáil and what was agreed in the Dáil and I am quite certain it was the proper thing to do.  I want to make the point that this House is ofttimes denigrated and held up to contempt because it is a pattern or reproduction of the Dáil.  I must confess that I did not read the Dáil Debates on this Bill and my general view is not to do so because I think if we are to have a useful debate here, we ought not be an echo of the Dáil. I do not think it is an answer to any question here to be told that certain things were done in the Dáil and that therefore we should be content with them.</P>

      <P>It is not my intention to chase every hare the Senator <Col N="690" /> raises, but I should like to say this in respect of my remarks about the Dáil.  The Bill was debated very extensively and examined in Committee very minutely, following on the submission of a great number of amendments by the Opposition and myself.  This Bill was introduced here two or three weeks ago and the only amendments here are my amendments. I am not suggesting that the Senator might have had amendments, but in so far as there are no amendments, it is reasonable for me to assume that there is no fundamental objection on behalf of Senators to the provisions of the Bill as they appear now.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider a small amendment on the lines that any owner of land the subject of a licence will be entitled to obtain from the Minister more detailed particulars of his rights?  Would the Minister consider allowing any person who may see a note by the Minister in the local paper and who knows that his land is the subject of that licence to apply to the Minister and get a more detailed description of his rights in connection with the licence?  It would be of great help to the land owners who are entitled to know their <Col N="691" /> rights.  The notice in the papers would, of necessity, be very short.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator refers to subsection (2), he will see that the requirement in relation to publication in the newspapers is only one part of the obligation.  There is also the requirement to deposit a map in the Geological Survey Office and also in one or two places in the locality, showing the boundaries of the land which is the subject matter of the licence. The type of office will be a post office, a Garda Síochána barracks or some suitable place in the locality to which the owners will have access.</P>

      <P>The point which I am about to make applies to a number of other sections in a different way. Subsection (2) states that every undertaking shall be in such form as the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, shall determine. I cannot understand why the form of the undertaking should require the consent of the Minister for Finance. It would be all right if it were something in relation to some financial point or other.  This relates to the form of the undertaking.  I am not suggesting that the Minister is not competent to determine the form of the undertaking, as I take it he will have legal advice on that, but I cannot understand why the consent of the Minister for Finance should be required.  Did this just come from a clerk attached to the Department of Finance as a <Col N="692" /> suggestion for an amendment to the original draft of the Bill?</P>

      <P>I fully appreciate the Minister's point that this Bill was thoroughly threshed out in the Dáil. There were roughly 45 amendments on Committee Stage and 30 on Report.  I <Col N="693" /> think the Minister is entitled to make that point and I agree with him.  At the same time I want to ask him a specific question about this section.  Is there any time limit here?  We could take Section 28 with this as they are linked up with each other.  There are a number of points, many of which were threshed out in the Dáil. Suppose subsidence takes place long after the workings are completed, as does happen.  The section speaks about &ldquo;whenever damage is caused&rdquo;.  I cannot construe that phrase legally.  I shall, therefore, construe it logically. &ldquo;Whatever damage is caused&rdquo; means, I take it, in the present.  I should imagine, in view of the manner in which other parts of this Bill have been tied up, that such liability on the part of the licensees will continue for 20 years or for any period you like.  I take it that that is the intention.  If somebody's house is undermined and drops down 200 feet ten years afterwards, as might happen, I take it that the person will at that stage have a claim for compensation.  It seems to me that this is certainly not provided for at this point in Section 12.  Is it provided for in Chapter 7?</P>

      <P>This section concerns damage which may be done to the surface of land or to water supplies or the causing of a nuisance.  That, I take it, applies to somebody who is the owner of land or, in the case of water supplies, who is an adjacent owner and may be entitled to water supplies passing across the land of a farm which has been acquired but there are a great many other things besides water supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, there is the ordinary right of way for, say, beasts, horses and carts which one farmer enjoys over the land of his neighbour.  His neighbour's land may be acquired and in those circumstances, the right of way of an adjoining owner of land may be completely destroyed.  I do not see any provision in this or any other section of the Bill to compensate a continuous owner of the land in <Col N="694" /> respect of the loss of any easement which he has over land acquired by a licensee.  Perhaps the Minister when he inserted &ldquo;nuisance&rdquo; on the Committee Stage in the Dáil should have also considered whether he should not extend the right to compensation to all classes of easements which any property owner may have over property which has been acquired and is being used by a licensee.</P>

      <P>The Minister will be aware from his experience in other regions that there are circumstances in which it will be very difficult to give such a sum as would compensate people for the loss of rights of way. If a man has a right to go over another man's land in order to enter a field belonging to himself and that right is destroyed, involving a journey around by road of a mile or a mile and a half, which is not uncommon, I cannot see any court giving him the right kind of compensation under the existing common law, and it seems that special provision should be inserted in this Bill.  Perhaps the Minister is satisfied that the common law is available and is sufficient, but if so, I wonder why the Minister bothered to put in &ldquo;nuisance&rdquo; or &ldquo;water supplies&rdquo; in this section.</P>

      <P>In this section, there is merely provision that the lease will contain a description of the land and so on.  Later on, we come to provisions providing for compensation for petroleum.  It is purely an administrative matter.  The suggestion I make, which may be of help, is that when land is being taken over for the purpose of being assigned to a petroleum lessee, it would save a great deal of trouble and uncertainty in assessing compensation, if the areas belonging to different people were precisely noted at the time they were being taken over.  That may seem to be a very obvious thing to do, but obvious things are often neglected, and there is a great deal of speculation at a later stage as to what were the rights of different people at a particular point of time.  It would also seem to be desirable that when land is being taken over by a lessee, the different estates of the owners of the land at that time should also be officially noted so that again when it comes to assessing compensation, difficulties would not arise.</P>

Do I understand that it is the Mining Board that fixes that rent or royalty?  If the Mining Board has power to fix the rent or royalty, should not the Board have power to fix compensation by way of lump sum, if necessary, if it were thought right or reasonable to do so?  I see no reference in this subsection to compensation by way of lump sum, and I should like to know who fixes the compensation. Does the Minister fix it himself, or must it be by royalty, or royalty rent, or rent, instead of compensation by way of lump sum?</P>

Surely the greater includes the less, and I can see no reason at all for this business of putting tautological clauses in the Bill.  Nobody can compel a man to be a party to anything, unless he is in agreement with it and therefore this is just a piece of nonsense.  There is similar nonsense in the next section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Since we are talking about the Minister for Finance being a party to a lease, and the Minister has quoted the motto <i>nollumus mutari</i>, I wish to point out that since the Minister is being made a party to the lease under sub-paragraph (d) of subsection (2) of Section 13, it seems more than strange that the man who is a party to the lease will not, under Section 20, be a party to the consent to an assignment of the lease. The Minister for Finance is being pushed in here and pushed out there.</P>
      <P>This is the kind of thing that creates confusion in the minds of people trying to understand what in fact is the position of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to leases that may be made under this Bill.  If the Minister for Finance is a necessary party to the lease, then surely he should also be a party to giving consent, under Section 20, to an assignment of the lease.  That seems to be sound common sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of bringing the Minister for Finance in originally is to ensure that he will be familiar with the term of the lease, but, so far as Section 20 is concerned, it would be an assignment without altering the terms of the lease and, therefore, there would be no question of changing the conditions to which the <Col N="697" /> Minister for Finance has committed himself in the original lease.</P>
      <P>In reply to Senator O'Sullivan, I should like to say that the section we deal with now relates to the payment of royalties by the person to whom a petroleum lease is given by the State. That arrangement is usually made mutually between the State and the person working the minerals, using the word &ldquo;minerals&rdquo; in the broadest sense. The Mining Board comes in only when somebody else's rights are infringed and he is not satisfied with the offer of compensation.</P>
      <P>In that event compensation is in fact fixed by way of royalties, for this reason, that if it were paid by lump sum and if the mine did not prove to be as productive as anticipated, there would be paid perhaps a sum which would be far in excess of the value of the minerals involved to the owners of the land.  The payment by way of royalty is to ensure that compensation will be paid <i>pari passu</i> with the value of the working of the minerals concerned. Therefore, in the long run, it would be more equitable to the persons in whose ownership the minerals originally were and to the persons working the minerals over a period.</P>

I know there are cases of payments by fee stamps, or cheques, or occasionally other roundabout ways, where the Minister may decide by Order how the amounts should be paid, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and so on.

      <P>This is the section which enables the Minister to decide to work petroleum in a particular area and he is obliged by the section to specify the area in which he proposes to exercise all his powers.  Then we have this fiction which is contained in this legislation of giving notice by publishing the notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> stating the locality and the extent of the area.  The Minister earlier indicated that he was prepared to facilitate to the maximum extent persons who might be affected by any workings or prospecting for petroleum by these licensees.  Is it not merely a fiction to say that you are giving notice to people down in Leenore by publishing a notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, which they never heard of, never saw, and which the vast majority of them never will see?  It seems ridiculous to me to say that people will be bound by a notice, a copy of which they never saw, and had no facilities for seeing. In publishing this notice, the Minister <Col N="699" /> should extra-statutorily undertake to publish it in all the local newspapers circulated in the area.</P>

      <P>This is the very desirable section in which the Minister takes power to compel the licensees to cover in bore holes and shafts.  If they do not do so, the Minister may get somebody else to do it and charge the amount to the person who should have done it.  In this type of case, where there are bore holes and shafts and so on, power should be vested in the Minister to compel licensees to take all precautions specified by the Minister to prevent accidents to children and young people.  Too often we read of inquests on young children who have fallen into sewers or manholes. We are all aware of the fact that there may be some liability upon the persons responsible in common law, but that is not good enough for the child who has lost his life through the failure of people responsible to take reasonable precautions.  I should like the Minister to see to it that it will be a condition in leases that all these openings will be covered and safeguarded to his satisfaction and that his officers will be entitled to enter upon these premises from time to time to see that all safety measures designed to protect the young are adequately provided by the people prospecting for or working petroleum.</P>

I have no doubt that anyone advising a proposed assignee of any such lease would advise that it was unnecessary to have the consent of the Minister for Finance.  It is the commonest thing, as the Minister must be aware, that where there are different parties to any document, if there is any assignment of rights, all should join in the assignment.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section to which I referred when speaking on Section 8 where the Minister may grant a licence to &ldquo;any person.&rdquo;  Here, we are providing in relation to what will <Col N="701" /> happen to the three different kinds of licences in the event of death.  The first point that arises is that it is not at all clear from paragraph (a) of subsection (3) by whom the rights conferred by a licence may be exercised on, say, an intestacy.  That seems to create an extraordinary lacuna.  Nobody will know who is the person, for instance, in the case of intestacy, who will be administrator.  If the operation is carried on and somebody receives an injury which entitles him to compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Acts, who will be the employer? That it may be exercised until certain things happen, as set out in this section, seems to be extraordinarily vague and is the kind of thing which could give rise to a great deal of difficulty.</P>
      <P>If the section were drafted so as to provide that the right would vest from the grant of probate in the executor or from the grant of administration in the person who is administrator, then perhaps the section might mean something. I do not see at present how the business can continue to be carried on in the event of an individual dying who is the owner of a licence, unless some provision is made that the rights will vest <i>ipso facto</i> upon his death in whomever will be appointed his executor or administrator.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that no difficulty will arise in the case of an executor because he will be named in the will.  In the event of intestacy, he will at some stage be a legal personal representative.  If there is no such, the property ultimately rests in the State.  Therefore, to the extent that anybody will continue to operate under the lease when there is in fact no person responsible, any obligations will ultimately vest in the State.  That can be proved in court.  I assume that, in the event the Senator envisages, if there is no legal personal representative available, the State will be responsible for workmen's compensation proceedings. That is my opinion and I think that is what will happen.</P>

      <P>I dissent from the Minister's view that in the case of a will, the right to the licence will vest in the executor.  The executor may well disclaim, in which event it will vest presumably in the residuary legatee who will possibly then get the grant of administration.  That seems to leave the matter altogether too vague.  I should prefer if the section were drafted in such a way as to provide that the licence will vest in whomever will ultimately be appointed the executor or the administrator.  It would then be perfectly clear who would be deemed to be the employer in such circumstances.</P>
      <P>Again, it may happen that the licence will revest in the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  If, in the interim, a workman who suffered injury became liable to compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Acts, would the Minister, through his representatives, in a clear case go into court and say: &ldquo;Yes, I admit I was the employer of this person on the specified date&rdquo;?  Knowing the ingenuity of counsel and solicitors, I very much doubt if that would be the case.  It seems that this is a section on which the Minister might have second thoughts, with a view to bridging the gap between the death of a person and the raising of representation as to his estate.</P>

Will that be the position&mdash;or will the Minister for Industry and Commerce take the obligation of providing these people with some form of interim accommodation until such time as they get compensation and are enabled to purchase a lease or in some other way to provide a house for themselves?</P>

      <P>The four months provided for here would be very much a minimum period.  In practice, it is believed it would be much longer than the four months before drilling operations, <Col N="704" /> and so on, would be undertaken. In the event of anybody being displaced, full compensation will be payable.  If a person has to get temporary accommodation in the meantime, that will be taken into account. Even if a person has to live in an hotel for the time being, it will be taken into account.  The fact that compensation is payable should relieve the Minister of any further obligation such as finding alternative accommodation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Chapter 5, Chapter 6 and Chapter 7 are, in my view, some of the most important in the Bill.  We have had a good deal of discussion as to the circumstances in which people may find themselves displaced from the lands on which they and their families have been living over a long period, and in which their way of life is changed by the compulsory acquisition of the land for petroleum exploration, and petroleum working purposes.  The means by which compensation is to be given to these people is by the Mining Board established under the Act of 1940.</P>
      <P>First of all, I want to make a comment that if anybody who has property rights is injured in these rights by any other person, whether that person is an individual, a corporation or the State, the proper authority to decide the rights, between the person whose property is injured and the person injuring it, are the courts of justice.  That seems to be an elementary and simple concept which is acceptable to everybody, and that is what the courts of justice are established for, to do justice between man and man and between man and the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will not attempt to justify this section, and the power contained in the Bill, by reference to other bad legislation, because the 1940 Act, in so far as it provides <Col N="705" /> similar provisions to this, is bad legislation. I do not think something should be justified by something which is demonstrably and clearly bad.  In this section and in the following subsections, if I may take them altogether, in order to avoid repetition, we are establishing a board to mete out compensation as between the Minister and the person affected.</P>
    <P>I have a fundamental objection to displacing the courts of justice which are established for the purpose of doing justice as between man and man and between man and the State, by an <i>ad hoc</i> body such as the board.  I have a fundamental objection to that, but when that board is the kind of board established under the Minerals Development Act, 1940, my objection must become a great deal stronger.  I would refer the House to the kind of board which is to adjudicate, mark you, between, say a farmer in Mayo, or in Donegal, or Kildare or Wicklow, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or a great petroleum corporation which has come in and damaged his property and has acquired compulsorily his property and upset his whole way of life.  That is to be left to the determination not of the courts of justice, which are dealing with matters of far less significance, but merely a board set up <i>ad hoc</i>, which need have no regard to the great principles which have been applied to doing justice between man and man.</P>
    <P>What is the constitution of the board?  It is a three man <i>ad hoc</i> committee dignified by the appellation &ldquo;the board&rdquo;.  The chairman is to be a practising barrister, or a practising solicitor of at least ten years' standing. So far so good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>However, if Senator Sheehy Skeffington does not agree with me, I am quite prepared to say I have a fundamental objection to substituting a barrister in this way for a judge of the High Court, with all the independence and authority that belongs to his high office.  The next ordinary member of the board is to be a person from the panel of the official arbitrator <Col N="706" /> appointed under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919.  Here we are running into the officials.  It is perfectly clear that in the ordinary course of nature and affairs of life, a person who is an official arbitrator is never likely in general to have the same degree of independence as a person who is not an official arbitrator, and certainly would have nothing like the independence of a judge of the Circuit Court or the High Court.  But at any rate he has some claim, although a very tenuous and shadowy one, for sitting on the board to judge between an individual and the Minister.</P>
      <P>The third ordinary member is an official of the Minister.  We have often-times heard of going to court with the devil in hand, and all right-minded people reject that as not giving reasonable treatment to the litigants, but here the farmer from Mayo or Galway is to go to the board and expect to get justice from an official of the Minister. I have always understood it to be a fundamental principle of the natural laws and a principle observed even by people who are, in our view, uncivilised, that no man shall be a judge in his own cause and neither should his brother or his officer.  I had the experience where, under a similar board established under the Social Welfare Act, an appeals officer was appointed to adjudicate upon a question of whether a person was liable to pay insurance under the Social Welfare Act, where the person claimed that he was not so liable.  He went to the appeals officer and pressed his case and this, mind you, was an appeals officer of some standing and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not pursue it in any detail but I want to alert the House to the inherent dangers in legislation of this kind.  I do not intend to make any personal references to the case in question.  The appeals officer who was to do justice according to law went about collecting the evidence for the Minister for Social Welfare which was no function of his.  He was to act <Col N="707" /> as judge and prosecutor and to better that, when the appellant had made his case before the appeals officer, saying that he was not liable to pay contributions to social welfare, the officer said: &ldquo;Well, I have a letter here from the Minister for Finance which states that you are liable because of certain circumstances mentioned in the letter and I am bound by that.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the kind of thing that is liable to happen and it is liable to happen in the nature of things because no man can serve two masters, no man can serve the interests of justice and at the same time, the interests of the Minister, if he is an official of the Minister.  He must have loyalty to the Minister and in any event, his views will be coloured by his associations with the whole working of his Department and will be likely to find in favour of the Minister and against everybody opposed to the Minister. That, I think, is not being unfair.  Even the most conscientious person will be influenced by the views of the workings of his Department and by his position in the Department and his relations with the Department as a whole.</P>
      <P>This, then, is the kind of board which people are being given to assess compensation instead of the courts of justice which were established for this very purpose.  I wonder, indeed, why it is this device that is used rather than to permit people to go to open court to ascertain what the compensation payable should be.  I give the reason to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the Land Acquisition (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919 apply to compensation in cases of this kind.  The House will probably recollect that, in 1946 or 1947, there was a court case fought by an ex-judge of the Circuit Court against the then Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I do not say it was necessarily against the particular person but against his legal advisers. The whole burden of that case was whether the ex-judge was entitled to be paid compensation by the court as he claimed or in accordance with the Land Acquisition Assessment of Compensation) <Col N="708" /> Act, 1919.  The case went on for weeks in the High Court and for weeks in the Supreme Court.  The only reason there was for contesting the ex-judge's claim for compensation was that if he was entitled to compensation by the courts of justice, he would get a great deal more compensation than he would get under the Land Acquisition (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919.</P>
    <P>Here we have quite clearly in this Bill an attempt to pretend that people are getting compensation for rights which are being taken from them, in the public interest granted, but nonetheless rights which are being taken from them.  They are getting compensation, but, in fact, they are not getting anything like the compensation they would be entitled to.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I have the strongest objection to the procedure of handing over the rights of the citizens of this country to an <i>ad hoc</i> Board such as is constituted under the Minerals Development Act, 1940.  The Minister may say: &ldquo;Well, if you feel so deeply about it, why have you not put down amendments?&rdquo;  I could not see any way in which this Bill could be amended except to delete Chapters 5, 6, 7 and 8 in the first Part of the Bill and then it would require extensive amendment in the earlier Chapters of Part I.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of this House to the fact that in legislation of this kind, we are not doing justice to the plain and poorer people of this country.  Let there be no mistake at all about that.  A judge of the High Court in the case to which I have referred said:</P>
    <P>It seems to me that common law, common sense and common decency speak with one voice and lay down the overriding principle that when a man has been compulsorily dispossessed of his property, whether by individual, corporation or State, he shall receive in exchange whatever the property was worth to him.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that under the provisions for compensation in this Bill, the united voice of common law, common sense and common decency <Col N="709" /> is being stifled and the poorer people &mdash;as I imagine it will be the small farmers who will be concerned&mdash;will not receive under the provisions of this Bill and the related provisions of the Land Acquisition (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, anything like the compensation they are entitled to.  I am not proud of legislation of this kind and I do not like to be here having to speak on it and apparently acquiesce in its passage through this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to say that the Mining Board will not be dealing with the compulsory acquisition of property.  Their main function will be the assessment of compensation for mineral rights, rights which the average individual would never, or almost certainly, could never have worked himself.  The assessment of such compensation, which will be paid by way of royalties, is a highly technical matter.  It is one which the courts in the ordinary course of their business could not very well undertake.</P>
      <P>I do not for one moment agree with the statement which the Senator has just read out by a judge of the High Court.  I do not agree at all with its terms.  I should like to say that the Mining Board has, over the years, given good satisfaction to those who come before it and there has not been any complaint as far as I know, about the assessment of compensation it has made from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not a sacrosanct principle that a body other than the courts will adjudicate on a matter that might otherwise be proper to the courts.  As the Senator knows well, in certain circumstances, where there is an arbitration clause in an agreement, if a person who is sued under that agreement pleads that arbitration clause and complies with certain formalities, the court will remit to this arbitrator provided for in the agreement the examination of whatever problem is involved, so that even the courts themselves will, in these circumstances, hand over to a body which is non-judicial, to the extent that the Mining Board is non-judicial, the examination <Col N="710" /> and solution of the problem and the giving of justice as between the parties.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that justice is generally met by the Mining Board in the manner in which it hears the applications for compensation which come before it.  As I have said, there have not been any complaints either as to the impartiality of the board or the extent to which there has been compensation in particular cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I am very much impressed by what Senator O'Quigley has just said.  The Minister told us about the parallel of an agreement but is there not a very great distinction there?  In an agreement, the individual chooses whether he will or will not have an arbitration clause.  If he does not want such a clause, he can stand on his rights before the courts.  Here we are writing into legislation something which from what I have heard from Senator O'Quigley seems to be right against the general principles of law in the country.</P>
      <P>I am unhappy that we should acquiesce in such a situation as this. The best kind of legislation is an agreement amongst all the people or at least amongst the representatives of the people.  I am not inclined to agree that this is a reasonable way of assessing any kind of compensation, in view of the example which Senator O'Quigley gave.  I would support Senator O'Quigley in this matter.</P>

      <P>I recognise that.  We are <i>ad idem</i>, and I have not said anything that suggests that land must not be taken in the public interest for the purpose of exploring mines and minerals and prospective petroleum. What I am saying is that if land is taken, people should be adequately compensated for it, and this board being set up, as I so clearly demonstrated, is no proper body for the job, for the reason that however well intentioned and capable it may be, it would be bound by the provisions of the Land Acquisition (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919.  As the Minister knows, very well, that Act will give owners far less justice than they would have got if they were entitled to go into a court of law.</P>
      <P>So far as the courts are concerned, if the Minister thought there would be any difficulty in regard to assessment of compensation, there would be nothing to prevent him providing for an assessor to sit with the judge of the High Court or the Circuit Court, as is done in relation to workmen's compensation cases or an air disaster, where a judge presides over an inquiry. That is quite regular, but there has been no disposition on the part of the Minister to give people a right to compensation which the law of this country and the justice of the case demand for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to return to a few aspects of this matter which I enlarged on in my objection to compensation being determined by the board rather than by the court.</P>
      <P>Section 42, subsection (2), provides that the provisions of the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, shall apply in the determination of the amount of compensation. Section 2 of the Act of 1919 provides:</P>
      <P>(1)  No allowance shall be made on account of the acquisition being compulsory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The value of land shall, subject as hereinafter provided, be taken to be the amount which the land if sold in the open market by a willing seller might be expected to realise: provided always that the arbitrator shall be entitled to consider all returns and assessments of <Col N="714" /> capital value for taxation made or acquiesced in by the claimant.</P>
    <P>There is in subsection (6) of Section 2 of the 1919 Act some provision for the assessment of compensation.  I want to come to the question of market value.  Suppose a farmer with 35 acres of land in county Mayo or Donegal, Galway or Wicklow has a rateable valuation of, say, £7 10s. When the land is being taken over for the purpose of working petroleum, the only compensation which the board is entitled to give is the market value of that land.  Let us suppose that on that land there was a dwelling-house which, in the purchase price by a willing buyer, was worth only about £200 and that the whole property is sold for £2,700.  Will the Minister tell me that it is fair to give that person only £2,700, if, after having got that compensation, he has to build a house which may cost £800, £900 or £1,000?  The £200 house may be perfectly sufficient for the farmer who is the occupant, for the rest of his days.  He may be satisfied that the house is perfectly comfortable and provides him with adequate accommodation. All the board is to be entitled to give is what a willing buyer will pay for that house and the willing buyer may be prepared to pay only £200.</P>
    <P>Is it not demonstrably clear that the compensation which is being given under the provisions of this Act falls far short of what is necessary to reinstate in the same position, and condition of affairs in life, a person who has been displaced from the position he was in before the petroleum people came along?  I cannot understand how the Minister can conceive it to be fair and equitable, where land is taken over in the public interest, that people should be subjected to what might result in their being pauperised for the rest of their days.  There is to be compensation&mdash;if my interpretation of the Act is correct and it has been generous so far as this Act is concerned&mdash;for disturbance.  I wonder what that means?  My understanding of that compensation is that the interpretation to date of what compensation should be afforded for disturbance is nothing like adequate to meet the out-of-pocket <Col N="715" /> expenses, the expenses which people have been put to, and which they have incurred, by reason of being displaced or dispossessed by compulsory acquisition.  I want to ask the Minister is it his view that, if a man has to remove stock from his farm and sell it quickly before it is fit to be sold and, therefore, gets less for it he will be entitled to compensation for that loss of profit?  If an old man decides to give up farming altogether and has to sell certain farm implements and things of that kind at a lower price than their worth, does that come into the category of disturbance?  I do not think it does.  It seems to me to be right and proper that where people suffer losses of that kind, compensation should be given.</P>
    <P>If a farmer has a particular value on land because he happens to use it for a particular purpose&mdash;let us say, growing strawberry plants, young fruit trees as can happen if he is poor and lives in a place where the soil is suitable for that purpose&mdash;will he get compensation based upon the peculiar and particular loss to him or based merely on the value of the land which a willing purchaser might be expected to pay to a willing seller?  Unless the Minister is prepared to give some direction as to the interpretation to be put upon the 1919 Act, it seems to me that a gross injustice will be done to people who have to apply to this board whose composition is bad and whose hands and judgment are completely fettered by the inadequate and ungenerous provisions of the 1919 Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator must be aware that it is not open to me, in any circumstances, to give directions as to how an Act must be interpreted and certainly not the 1919 Act.  As the Senator is already aware, the legalistic interpretation of legislation is that it means what it says.  Nevertheless, Section 2, Rule 2 of the 1919 Act lays down, as the Senator says, that the value of land shall be taken to be the amount which the land, if sold in the open market by a willing seller, might be expected to realise. Rule 6 adds the provision:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of Rule (2) shall not affect the assessment of compensation <Col N="716" /> for disturbance or any other matter not directly based on the value of land.</P>
    <P>I take it that gives scope to any assessor to take into account other features which are of some value to the person whose land has been acquired.  The Senator knows that in the measuring of compensation for damage done to a person's property, that person is not entitled to be put in a better position than he occupied before the damage was done.</P>
    <P>The function of a court or an arbitrator&mdash;if the person cannot be restored to his original position, whether it is a question of occupancy of land or a house or restoration of a chattel which has been damaged beyond restoring&mdash;is to assess the damage done in money value as closely as possible and in no circumstances is the assessment of damages to be in excess of the actual value.  Therefore, there are certain aspects of a person owning land or property which he might hold very dear but which even in a court of law, cannot be provided for in money value.  An old motor car for which the owner had a sentimental attachment might be damaged beyond repair.  If a court, as the result of an action he brings for damage to that car, assesses the compensation, the court can give compensation related only to the money value of the motor car.  It cannot take the sentimental value into account.</P>
    <P>That, I agree, has been an unfortunate feature of compensation for land acquisition but it is something which is impossible to assess in money value and, therefore, it is reasonable to come down to the ordinary basis of giving compensation: what a willing purchaser will give to a willing seller. There is, on top of that, the provision whereby Rule 2 shall not affect the assessment of compensation for disturbance or any other matter not directly based on the value of the land. The Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, has gone a very long distance in trying to provide, so far as is humanly possible, for the giving of reasonable compensation based on taking into account all the value of the land and other assessable <Col N="717" /> amenities of which the owner may have been deprived.</P>

      <P>I do not want to enter into a discussion which might bore the House, but I do not for a moment accept some of the propositions put forward by the Minister.  It may be all right for the Minister to say that a person should not be put in a better position after some damage to his property than he was in before it was damaged.  That may be all right in the exceptional circumstances of negligence and assault, but here we have an Act of the Oireachtas which, I trust, is not negligent, but it does appear to be something of an assault on people's private rights, with a pretence of giving protection.  Here we have a deliberate Act of the Oireachtas which gives a Minister power to take over the land, the home and the dwelling-house of a citizen.</P>
      <P>The language of the Constitution on the dwelling of a citizen is very clear. It says the dwelling of every citizen is inviolable.  We propose now to violate the rights of citizens in relation to their dwellings by decreeing that they shall be demolished in the public interest.</P>

He will not get a grant to build such a house from the local authority because it has to have a minimum area.

      <P>I want to refer to the last part of subsection (6) and to say again that this is going too far in facilitating the giving of evidence in courts.  Here we have, according to the Minister, an ephemeral body such as the Mining Board, which has not, we understand, sat for years.  This Bill does not portray that set of facts. Here, we are given the idea that there is such a thing as a permanent secretary of the board in the same way as there is a secretary of C.I.E. or of the E.S.B.  There is a secretary of the board.  I understand there is a distinction between a secretary to a board and a secretary of a board.  A secretary of a board is an officer of some permanent status, whereas a secretary to a board is a person of ephemeral character.  The court is to be obliged to receive in evidence a certificate signed by this person who may indeed have gone out of the Department of Industry and Commerce altogether at the time the certificate comes before the court and there is to be no question whatever as to whether the person who signs it was in fact the secretary of the board.

    <P>Before section 47 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1) (a) Where compensation is assessed by the Board in respect of land which is subject, but not in conjunction with other land, to a land purchase annuity, the Land Commission may, if they so think fit, request the Board&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  if the amount of such compensation is equal to or less than the redemption price of such annuity and the arrears (if any) of such annuity&mdash;to order by its award payment to the Land Commission of the whole or such part of the compensation as the Land Commission request, or</P>

    <P>(b)  Where any award in relation to land which is subject, but not in conjunction with other land, to a land purchase annuity provides under paragraph (a) of this subsection for the payment of any moneys to the Land Commission, such moneys shall upon receipt thereof be applied by the Land Commission in accordance with the following provisions, that is to say&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  in case there are any arrears of such annuity and the amount of such moneys does not exceed such arrears&mdash;in or towards discharge of such arrears,</P>
    <P>(ii)  in case there are any arrears of such annuity and the amount of such moneys exceeds such arrears&mdash;</P>
    <P>(I)  so much of such moneys <Col N="722" /> as is equal to such arrears shall be applied in discharge of such arrears, and</P>
    <P>(II)  the balance of such moneys shall be applied in or towards redemption of such annuity,</P>
    <P>(iii)  in case there are no arrears of such annuity&mdash;in or towards redemption of such annuity,</P>
    <P>(2)  (a) Where compensation is assessed by the board in respect of land (in this paragraph referred to as the affected land) which is subject, in conjunction with other land, to a land purchase annuity and the Land Commission apportion the annuity between the affected land and the other land, the Land Commission, may, if they so think fit, request the board&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  if the amount of such compensation is equal to or less than the redemption price of so much of such annuity as is apportioned to the affected land and the arrears (if any) of such annuity&mdash;to order by its award payment to the Land Commission of the whole or such part of the compensation as the Land Commission request, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  if the amount of such compensation exceeds the said redemption price and the arrears (if any) of such annuity&mdash;to order by its award payment to the Land Commission of so much of the compensation, not exceeding the amount of the said redemption price and the arrears (if any) of the annuity, as the Land Commission request,</P>
    <P>and the Board shall comply with such request.</P>
    <P>(b)  Where an award in relation to land (in this paragraph referred to as the affected land) which is subject, in conjunction with other land, to a land purchase annuity provides for the payment under paragraph (a) of this subsection of any moneys to the Land Commission, such moneys shall upon receipt thereof be applied by the Land Commission as follows&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 47 of the Bill as it stands, the Land Commission would be entitled to recover from the tenant as much of the compensation as would be required to discharge the total arrears of annuity and to redeem the annuity, even though only part of the holding had been acquired or damaged, and the claim for compensation was, therefore, limited to that part of the holding.  It is felt that this is an inequitable arrangement. It is reasonable enough that the full arrears of the annuity relating to the complete holding should be recoverable by the Land Commission but it is not fair that the Commission should be able to recover the full value of the redemption of the annuity attributable to the entire holding if the claim for compensation were limited only to portion of the holding. The effect of the amendment is that in the type of case where only part of a holding has been acquired or damaged, the Land Commission will be authorised to recover compensation payable to the holder at the instance of the Mining Board only to the extent of the redemption value of the portion of the annuity which relates <Col N="724" /> to the part of the holding which has been acquired or damaged.  The Land Commission would it is proposed continue to be empowered to claim the full amount of arrears of annuity attributable to the entire holding of the tenant.</P>
      <P>The expression &ldquo;land which is subject but not in conjunction with other land to a land purchase annuity&rdquo; which appears in Section (1) (a) of the amended Section means that the land which is the subject matter of the application for compensation comprises the entire holding of the tenant.  Where that is the case, the Land Commission are being authorised to recover the full arrears of annuity and also the full redemption value of the annuity attributable to the entire holding.  This is only reasonable in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>There is a second amendment, amendment No. 3, which is designed to provide similarly in substituting a new Section 84.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister and with the amendment because it is in ease of holders of land from the Land Commission. As the Minister has rightly stated, the original provisions in the Bill were somewhat inequitable and this is more in accordance with what is equitable and fair as between the Land Commission and one of its tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only thing on the amendment that strikes me as strange is the provision that where there is an annuity payable, the Land Commission may make a request to the board that the arrears of the annuity or the redemption value of the annuity shall be paid out of the compensation.  It seems strange to say that anybody can go to a seemingly independent body such as this body is and say that he wanted to do so and so and that the board has no option but to do so, that they are required to do it.  It certainly shakes any remaining faith I have in the board that, merely upon the request of the Land Commission, this has to be done.  I pay no more attention to the fact that it is the Land Commission than if it were Patsy Murphy who says: &ldquo;This fellow <Col N="725" /> owes me £40.  He is getting compensation and I want to be paid.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Land Commission may come and say such and such an amount is payable and the board is not even authorised to inquire whether it is payable or not.  If the board is satisfied that so much arrears of annuity are owed by the claimant and that the redemption value of the land is so much, then it should be paid out of the compensation.  I am merely making a comment that it is more than strange that some outside body can come to a seemingly judicial body and make this request and that it has no option but to comply with the request.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Dwyer Mr. O'Dwyer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dwyer</NameTxt>
      <P>It strikes me that the system of redeeming the land annuity out of the purchase price acts very unfairly against the owner of the land.  For example, the present market value of land is £100 per statute acre.  The purchaser of a farm pays £100 and continues to pay the land annuities as they fall due.  In the case of land taken up under this Bill, if the price is fixed at the market rate of £100 and out of the £100, the land annuities are redeemed, the result is that the owner gets actually less than the market value.  I am assuming it would be based on the market value, but I think it only right that in fixing the amount of compensation in the case of land compulsorily acquired, there should be some sum over and above the market value as compensation.  In any case, it should be quite clear that the owners will get the actual market value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator O'Quigley said, this section is specifically designed to ensure that compensation is payable only in respect of part of the holding.  The power of the Land Commission to require redemption must be limited to compensation payable in respect of that part of the holding only.  If a person is aggrieved as a result of a request of the Land Commission being complied with by the Mining Board in the payment of moneys to the Commission, the person will have a remedy against the Land Commission.  The Land Commission <Col N="726" /> will obviously be conscious of such a remedy and I think the possibility of the Land Commission requesting payment of compensation money from the Mining Board over and above what would be due under this section is so remote as hardly likely to arise.  But, as I said, in any case, the person who may be aggrieved has a remedy over the Land Commission to the extent that the Land Commission do not only have to pay moneys for example under the legal phrase, &ldquo;money had and received&rdquo;, but also costs for any amount of money that is requested in excess of any amount they should have received under the section.</P>

      <P>May we take it that in subsection (a), in all these new sections, the words &ldquo;Land Commission, if they so think fit&rdquo; is a saving clause to a certain extent?  I could conceive a position where land which had been used for petroleum mining was then abandoned and given back to the owner, all the minerals having been extracted, and where an expenditure of a capital sum would be necessary to put that land in the position it was in before it can be used.  Perhaps some of this money would be more valuable and helpful to the owner of the land than if it were handed over for the purpose of reducing the annuity.  This capital expenditure might be necessary. Would it be possible that it would come under &ldquo;the Land Commission, if they so think fit&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first place, the compensation payable will be presumed to be far in excess of any annuity payable.  The value of the property always takes into account that the property is there in itself and is a certain outgoing of an annuity.  Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that any compensation given for the acquisition of or damage to a holding or portion of a holding will be far in excess of the annuity payable in respect of that holding or that portion of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, the discretion given in this section to the Land Commission is obviously given to enable the Land Commission to use it in circumstances where a particular land holder has <Col N="727" /> been meticulous about the repayment of his annuities.  The Land Commission might say that, having regard to the possible greater use of the land by that particular person, it would be better that he should be allowed to keep whatever compensation he has and allowed to pay his annuities in the ordinary way.  I think the discretion, is wide enough to enable the Land Commission to take that situation into account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the claim for compensation has its right over against the Land Commission. I wonder if that is correct.  First of all, we find in Section 46 that &ldquo;every award shall be conclusive evidence of all matters purported to be certified therein.&rdquo;  Secondly, we find in this amendment that the order of payment to the Land Commission is part of the award so that, therefore, once the Land Commission requests the payment of X pounds in respect of arrears of the annuity or redemption value, then by reference to subsection (4), which I have read, that is conclusive evidence that that was the amount of the award. That is conclusive evidence that it was the amount which was payable to the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we go further than that.  In Section 49, we find a most obnoxious position, having regard to the constitution of this board.  &ldquo;The decision of the Board on any question of fact arising in the course of proceedings under Chapters VI and VII shall be final, conclusive and unappealable and such decisions shall be binding on all parties to such proceedings and their privies as if it were a judgment <i>in personam.</i>&rdquo;  You may find a person going into court saying he made an overpayment of £50 to the Land Commission. He will be faced with the certificate signed by the ephemeral secretary and then the question as to appeal will be argued, but the decision of the Mining Board in Section 49 is final, conclusive and unappealable.  I do not think that the Minister is at all correct that the board should not enter upon some form of adjudication as to whether or not the amount claimed by the Land Commission is properly <Col N="728" /> payable out of the compensation money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether the matter contained in this amendment is an innovation in regard to these matters or is it common form.  In regard to the position of registered land, the Land Commission have a first charge in connection with the collection of annuities. You will have people who are in such a financial position that they may seek to raise capital and thereby institute a second charge against a particular parcel of land or part of the land acquired.  The Land Commission, where a person is getting it hard to pay, will, if this board should make an award in regard to compensation, come in for their pound of flesh.  Very probably, they may have no regard to the claims that other people might have.</P>
      <P>The fact that land or portion of land could be acquired might make the remaining portion uneconomic and render the person unable to make a reasonable effort to repay either the Land Commission for the first charge or any other party who would have a charge against those lands.  The fact that part of the land is acquired could easily damage the capacity of the person to repay either the Land Commission or any other party which might have a charge.  I should like to know if this is a common thing or an innovation in legislation to protect the Land Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Senator O'Quigley, I was, perhaps, wrong to suggest that there was a right over against the Land Commission in respect of money over and above arrears or the buying out of annuities.  Nevertheless, the Land Commission will have to appear before the board and prove as a matter of fact that there are certain arrears due for what the redemption value of that part of the holding is before the board will be entitled to make an award in respect of that amount in favour of the Land Commission.  The Land Commission, under Section 44, will have the right to appear before the board and that right <Col N="729" /> is inserted in order to enable the Land Commission to prove its claim.</P>
      <P>In reply to the point made by Senator O'Reilly, I would say that, in the main, this is common form. The Land Commission will have to prove arrears in respect of the payment of land annuities and prove the amount required to redeem annuities in respect of a particular holding. What is new about this section is that where only part of the holding is the subject matter of compensation, while any arrears that may be outstanding in respect of the entire holding will still be payable, the power of the Land Commission will be limited to that part of the holding in respect of which compensation is paid and not to the entire holding. It is an innovation to that extent.  In other words, the entire holding is saved from the obligation to redeem the annuity in the event of the Land Commission looking for it.  They are limited only to the part of the holding in respect of which compensation is payable.</P>

      <P>In view of the statement made by the Minister as regards the right of a person over against the Land Commission, would the Minister consider exercising the powers he has under paragraph (d) of Section 30, whereby he is authorised to make regulations in relation to the practice and procedure of the board, to provide that in fact the Land Commission will under these regulations have to establish the amount of arrears and the amount of the redemption value to the satisfaction of the board.  I do not imagine that that will ever create any great difficulty in practice, but it certainly derogates from any status this board might have as an independent, semi-judicial body to say that it has to take the word of the Land Commission and make an Order on the Land Commission's request.  The Minister might <Col N="730" /> consider making regulations which will do something to relieve people of that sense of grievance they might have if they are not entitled to challenge the Land Commission in regard to the assessment they make of arrears or the amount of the redemption value of the annuity.</P>

      <P>It seems difficult to understand how the amount of compensation could at any time be less than the redemptive price of the annuity.  I should like on this section to make an appeal for generous compensation. The notion of market value is very misleading, especially seeing that the market value is always reckoned without redemption of the annuity.  A just price should be, at the very minimum, market value plus redemption, but certainly market value by itself is unjust.</P>

      <P>The section deals with compensation for ancillary rights rather than for land, so that the Senator's remarks are not quite to the point.

      <P>In paragraph (b) of subsection (2), the Minister is authorised to prevent people from conducting their operations in the working of petroleum in such a manner as is likely to cause damage.  I wonder if the Minister has in mind damage to the property itself or to the use of ancillary rights, or damage covered by the creation of nuisances to owners of contiguous property, or does the damage embrace damage to the amenities of the locality?  It seems to me that the wording of the subsection would enable the Minister to serve notice on the licensee to cease causing damage in all the different respects I have mentioned, particularly in relation to the amenities of the locality.  It might be very desirable to vest that power in the Minister.</P>
      <P>There is another point, that the Minister may require remedial action to be taken.  I am wondering if that power will be something in the nature of an injunction which he may issue by notice to the people to desist from that kind of action in the future.  Does the Minister envisage himself having sufficient powers to issue orders in the nature of injunctions to lessees to prohibit them permanently from causing the damage which is contemplated in the paragraph?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <P>The subsection does not give any powers of injunction to the Minister, but the Senator will notice that there are powers of prosecution in the event of a person causing unnecessary damage.  The Minister also has power in the event of a person refusing to take remedial action to take the necessary action and charge the cost of it against the operation. Any agreement will be subject to the requirements of good oilfield practice, and therefore to the extent that such wasteful operations or operations causing unnecessary damage will be contrary to the regulations as defined and against good oilfield practice, the entire operation of the person <Col N="732" /> involved is liable to be prevented or stopped.</P>

      <P>This is a section which moves me to congratulate the Minister.  Perhaps that is a change from what I said earlier to-day.  I think it is a very desirable change of direction that regulations will be available in draft form to be inspected by members of the public before being finally made.  Perhaps that is an innovation. If it is, it certainly is a very desirable one.</P>
      <P>The only thing which left me slightly dissatisfied with this section was, that having gone so far and done so well, it goes on to say that the Minister will publish in one or more newspapers circulating in the State a notice that draft regulations have been made&mdash; then this is the defect&mdash;and they &ldquo;may be inspected at the office of the Minister in Dublin at specified times&rdquo;.  It is a pity to see such a welcome change being made of less value by reason of the fact that these regulations will be available for inspection in Dublin.  If a solicitor in west Cork wants to see them, he will have to come to town, or send his agent to inspect them in the office of the Minister.  I wonder would the Minister go the distance of extra-statutorily announcing that copies may be obtained on application to his office, even at a nominal charge.</P>

    <P>Tá súil agam go bhfaighidh Seanadóirí sa ghearr-chuntas seo ar théarmaí an Bhille, léargas ginearálta ar a bhfuil sa Bhille ar fad.</P>
    <P>The main object of the Bill is to give statutory effect to the increases in wound, disability and married pensions and in certain allowances to dependants of deceased persons which were granted from 1st August, 1959, on the authority of a Supplementary Estimate for pensions passed in Dáil Éireann on 22nd July, 1959.</P>
    <P>The increases, which are dealt with in Sections 2 to 25 inclusive are broadly in accordance with the increases for State pensioners, generally, authorised by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement in April, 1959, except that where qualifying dates of discharge are mentioned, 1st September, 1949 and 1st April, 1950, being dates associated with Army pay changes, are considered to be more appropriate than 1st November, 1948, and 1st November, 1952, the dates mentioned in the Budget Statement for other State pensioners. Officer pensioners whose pensions are related to pay are receiving 6 % or 4% increases (depending on date of discharge) subject to the limitation, however, that a pension must not increase beyond the amount which would be payable if the recipient had been discharged on 2nd November, 1952, with similar rank, service and degree of disablement.  Other pensioners under the Acts, whose pensions are not related to Army pay are receiving an increase of 6%.  In the case, however, of the widow of a Signatory of the 1916 Proclamation <Col N="740" /> who did not receive an increase in her annual allowance when State pensions were increased in 1956, the amount of the allowance payable to her under Part II of the Army Pensions Act, 1937, is being increased (in Section 17) to the level which it would have reached if both the 1956 and 1959 increases applied (6% in each case). The estimated annual cost of the increases provided in the Bill is £11,500.</P>
    <P>When the removal from the Second and Third Schedules to the Act of 1923 of the dependency requirement in respect of the widows and children of deceased persons to whom the Schedules applied was being effected in Section 2 of the Act of 1959, one of the enabling Sections associated with these Schedules (Section 2 of the Army Pensions Act, 1946) was not cited.  This is now being done in Section 26 of this Bill&mdash;with effect from the date on which the Act of 1959 was passed.</P>
    <P>It was intended that the extended time limit afforded by Section 9 of the Act of 1959 should operate in respect of an application for an allowance under Part II of the Act of 1953 from a surviving relative of a deceased person with pre-Truce service who becomes entitled to the allowance after the death of the relative to whom it was first paid.  Section 27 of this Bill gives effect to that intention.</P>
    <P>Section 37 of the Army Pensions Act, 1953, imposed a restriction on the increase of certain &ldquo;further&rdquo; or &ldquo;married&rdquo; pensions where they formed part of disablement pensions which, alone or when aggregated with Defence Force pensions, exceeded £450 per annum.  The purpose of Section 28 is to remove that restriction in the cases of pensioners discharged after 1st January, 1953, so that from 1st August, 1959, the increases applicable to &ldquo;further&rdquo; or &ldquo;married&rdquo; pensions will be enabled to take effect in such cases.</P>
    <P>Sections 29 and 30 were introduced (by way of amendments on the Committee stage of the Bill in Dáil Éireann) in response to representations which were made by a number of Deputies.  The sections are designed <Col N="741" /> to enable persons with pre-Truce service to qualify for married pensions&mdash; and their dependants for allowances&mdash; if the marriage took place before 5th August, 1953, and if, of course, all the other requirements of the Acts are complied with as well.  The 5th August, 1953, was the date of enactment of the Army Pensions Act, 1953 (under which the qualifying date had already been extended to 10th December, 1932).</P>
    <P>I trust that this précis of the terms of the Bill will have furnished Seanadóiri with an outline of what is contained in the measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say in relation to this Bill, and what I say really applies to all the Bills before us now in relation to the raising of pensions, that I do not quite understand why it is that such a small percentage, in most of the cases in this Bill a percentage of from 4 to 6, is considered adequate as an increase in pension, whether it be a disability pension or otherwise, in order to cope with a rise in the cost of living since 1953 of 15 per cent.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that pensions, by their very nature, are less in amount than salaries.  Being less in amount they are, as it were, less resilient under the impact of a rise in the cost of living. There is less slack to be taken in.  In other words, a pensioner living on a small amount of money will be squeezed even more by such a rise than a person living on a relatively small salary, which however small is nevertheless larger than a pension.</P>
      <P>In Bill after Bill introduced by Minister after Minister dealing with pensions, we find a miserable percentage increase, as in this Bill, compared even with the increases, not always adequate, proposed in relation to salaries.  It is generally recognised that the cost of living has gone up.  It was considered necessary, and the Government came in and told us so, to increase the salaries of Supreme Court Judges, High Court Judges and other judges by 10 per cent., to allow for differences in the cost of living since 1953.</P>
      <P>It was considered necessary to raise the salary of the Comptroller and Auditor General by over 18 per cent. owing to similar considerations.  These percentage increases related to salaries, consequently to amounts of money considerably in excess of the amounts upon which the people affected by this Bill have to live, people on disability and wound pensions.  Yet, for these people, living on these much smaller amounts, the Minister comes here and asks us to allow him to increase them only by amounts ranging from 4 to 6 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="743" /> In the Dáil, talking about the Bill on the increase of salaries for Judges, the Taoiseach himself in the debate admitted that the cost of living had gone up since 1953 by approximately 15 per cent.  He admitted that the 10 per cent. they were then suggesting in relation to Judges' salaries was in fact not quite enough.  Nevertheless, that 10 per cent. was quite considerably in excess of what we are to-night being asked to grant under this Bill. In other words, as I read them&mdash;I should like to hear the Minister's opinion&mdash;these increases are grossly inadequate.  It is easy for us to stand up here and say that, I know, but it is our duty to draw attention to the fact that a different practice is being applied by the Government as between people on relatively high salary scales and people out on pension by reason of disability or some other reason.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ted O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister stated, these increases have been paid since last August.  That being so, this is merely a Bill to legalise the payments now being made. Undoubtedly, like Senator Sheehy Skeffington, every one of us would like these increases to be much bigger, but we have to be grateful for small mercies and appreciate concessions when given.  Indeed, we do appreciate them and we hope that, when the time is opportune, the points made by Senator Sheehy Skeffington will be remembered.</P>
      <P>This is a Bill to legalise increases already given.  As Senators will see, the increases come under about 18 different headings.  I suppose it is a Bill on which there can be no controversy, seeing that the persons concerned are enjoying the increases already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last July on the occasion of the debate on the Army Pensions Bill, 1959, I requested the Minister, at Col. 253 of Vol. 51 of the Official Debates to consider further matters which I thought should be included in the Bill. The Minister was good enough to tell the House that he could not consider those points at that time, but that he <Col N="744" /> would consider them for further amendments on the first opportunity. He has done that in this Bill and I am very glad to be able to thank him very sincerely for this concession which he has given to a number of people who required it very much.</P>
    <P>It will have far reaching effects in so far as it will apply to widows of men who lost their health and who because of being in poor health, went to early graves, as a result of their activities in the fight for freedom.  This Bill will have far reaching effects in providing for the widows and, in many cases, orphans, of those men.  I certainly congratulate the Minister on the success that he has had in dealing with this matter, and he will have the thanks of many widows and orphans of men who deserve well of this country.</P>
    <P>In connection with that, I want to refer to the removal of the marriage ban or, if you like, the extension of the marriage date, because it was rather strange that over the years we stood over the fact that if a man married on a certain day, he would be entitled to a further married pension, but if he married the day after, he would not be so entitled.  I think that was not morally sound.  On that occasion I advocated, and I should like to advocate again, the entire abolition of a marriage date.  At the same time, we are grateful indeed that the Minister and the Government have seen their way to extend the marriage date to 5th August, 1953.  But it certainly appears to me that that is not quite right.  If a man married on 6th August, 1953, he should still be entitled to a marriage pension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VictorCarton" hpid="Mr. Carton Mr. Carton">

      <P>He is the same man and the circumstances are the <Col N="745" /> same and it would be the same woman, too, if she did not turn up on the 5th.  At any rate, I think that is still the marriage ban and I have no doubt that the day will come when somebody will stand up in this House and ask for the removal of that ban sometime after 1953.  However, we are grateful indeed, and I am anxious to know whether or not an application must be made in each case.  I understand that the numbers are not large, but I can quite understand the case of a widow in some part of the country who might not be in touch with what has been happening in this House and when this Bill becomes an Act, will she know that she is entitled to apply for this widow's pension?  How will she know that?  How will it be advertised?</P>
      <P>In previous Acts, there were advertisements in the daily and weekly Press, but I think that, in addition to that, notices should be displayed in every post office and sub-post office. In that way, word will get around and the people entitled to this pension will have an opportunity of hearing about it and making application for it.  I am satisfied that the Minister has done a good job and I shall conclude by offering him the thanks of the House and our sincere appreciation of the work he has put into this since the last occasion when he appeared here with an Army Pensions Bill.  I assure him I am speaking on behalf of many of the people concerned when I say that we are grateful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion, there is very little to congratulate the Minister on or thank him for in this Bill.  I suppose some people must be thankful for small mercies.  I remember the occasion when a 50 per cent. increase was given to some of these people, and those who gave the increase were assailed and attacked by the people now in Government.  Senator Ted O'Sullivan said that he would have liked the pensions to be much bigger.  There is little use in saying those things in the Seanad.  He is a member of the Government Party and I dare say he attended the Party's meetings at which they agreed to give £10 per week, or £500 a year, to High <Col N="746" /> Court judges already in receipt of salaries of over £4,000.  That was the time when he should have put up the arguments he is now putting up and have said: &ldquo;If we can give £500 per year to people in secure positions, surely we can give a better increase than 1/- or 1/6 per week as we are giving to certain people under this Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill is supposed to mitigate the hardship caused through the continued uprise in prices.  Those people are incapable of working or of adding to their pensions in any way.  The majority of the husbands gave service to this country in the past and helped to build up this State.  These people retired on pensions in days and circumstances which were easier and when the cost of living was much less than it is to-day.  They looked forward to security in their old age.  Now it cannot be denied that hardship exists and that in the majority of cases, it is severe.  There is very little being done in this Bill to give those people security, to give them justice, or to give them fair play.</P>
      <P>We can all criticise this Bill on the grounds that the increases to be given are very meagre.  In the Dáil recently, when the Taoiseach spoke about judges' salaries, he said that they should get a salary sufficient to put them in a position in which they would be as far as possible immune from improper influence of any kind.  It is a pity the Taoiseach, the Minister for Defence who is here tonight and the Government did not give those pensioners increases to keep them as far as possible immune from hunger and want.  They are not getting any such increases in this Bill.  In spite of the increases they are getting, grave hardships will still exist amongst those unfortunate people who were led to expect so much from the Government when they were in Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was on Budget Day last year that these people got the first indication from the Minister for Finance that it was proposed to introduce Pension Bills during the year to cushion them against increases in the cost of living.  Many of the increases <Col N="747" /> were brought about by deliberate Government policy and deliberate action on the part of the Government.  High hopes were again raised in the breasts of those people when they saw the increases which the district justices and the judges got.  The lowest increase granted by the Government to these people was £175 per year.  They ranged up to £500 per year.  When those people saw those increases being given, they were entitled to say to themselves that if the Government had this money to expand, they could expect something worthwhile.  Fianna Fáil have been in labour for almost a year and they have definitely produced a mouse.  Some of these people are getting increases as low as 1/- and 1/6 per week.</P>
    <P>I think it is a disgrace especially coming from a Party who claim to represent the poor and who brag so much at times about all they are doing for the poor of this country.  They have made many people poor but they have done very little afterwards to relieve the hardships which they themselves, through deliberate budgetary policy, imposed on those people.</P>
    <P>We can bring our minds back to 1956.  The people who were then in Opposition are now in Government. Increases were given to some people ranging up to 50 per cent.</P>

      <P>The Senator is relating his speech to the Bill, Sir.  I think the 1957 Budget increased the price of the loaf from 9d. to 1/2d. The people who were getting those pensions have to buy the loaf.  They have to pay 5d. more for it.  They are even paying ½d. more for it since the day before yesterday.  The Budget increased the price of butter from 3/9d. to 4/4d.  Those pensioners have to buy butter to put on their bread and it is costing 7d. per lb. more. The least they have to use is six loaves or two pounds of butter a week making an increase of 4/- per week.</P>
      <P>We have, as the Minister stated, granted those unfortunate people an increase which in some cases is as low as 9d. per week.  I think it is a disgrace. We all know in this country that it is the poor man, the man with the very small pension of £2 or £3 per week, who has to depend on bread and butter alone.  Such a pensioner cannot go to an hotel.  The cost of living has hit the pensioners mentioned in this Bill harder than anybody else and there is very little being done in the Bill to alleviate their hardships.</P>

      <P>I must thank Senators generally for the manner in which this measure was received.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington mentioned that the judges got a 10 per cent. increase but, of course, these Army pensioners, under the Army Pensions Acts, got an increase in 1956 in conjunction with State pensioners generally.  This is a further increase now in 1959.</P>
      <P>Senator L'Estrange suggests apparently that these disability pensions should be something of the same order as judges' salaries.  No doubt, we would all like it if that could be done.  It is not done and never has been done.  The fact of the matter is that judges and people of that nature everywhere are, in fact, paid large salaries.  It is not possible to provide similar amounts for disability pensioners.</P>

      <P>The Senator was not referring to the Army Pensions Acts at all.  He was talking about people who have retired on pension. There is nobody dealt with under the Army Pensions Acts by way of retirement pension as such.  I explained in my opening address that this Bill deals with disability pensions generally. I shall repeat what I said for the benefit of the Senator&mdash;wounds, disability and marriage pensions and certain allowances to dependants of deceased persons.  I am not surprised that Senator L'Estrange knows nothing about these Bills.  They refer to people who received wounds or contracted disability during the period 1916 to 1923.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Ted O'Sullivan for his remarks in relation to the extension of the married date for further married pensions.  I cannot agree to his suggestion that the latest date for marriage should be abolished altogether.  I am definitely of the opinion that there must be some time limit laid down in this respect.  I can see no case whatever for removing it. If you have no time limit, then you can possibly have, as occurred, I believe, in other countries, even deathbed marriages for the sake of getting this further married pension which continues on to the widow.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It happened in other countries, at any rate.  I think the latest date for marriage that is laid down now in this Bill is very reasonable. It is about 30 years after the date on which the wound was received or the disability contracted, and that is a reasonable period.  It is practically inconceivable that anybody affected would be under the age of 50 years, at any rate, by 5th August, 1953, so that I think this date will inflict no hardship on anybody.  As I said here before, even to extend it as far as it was done before, to 1932, was a considerable concession, but now that we have extended it to 30 years after the date on which the disability could have been contracted, we have done <Col N="750" /> all that anybody could reasonably expect.</P>
      <P>With regard to making applications for these pensions which are affected by the extension of the marriage date, we shall do everything we possibly can to make sure that everybody concerned will know what the position is.  Anybody we know of who is affected will be notified.  In addition, we shall advertise the provisions of the Act in the Press and on the radio.  People who are affected generally are in touch with the various Old I.R.A. organisations, and the provisions of the Act will be fairly widely known among them.  It is unlikely that there will be anybody left out through not applying. Certainly, everything we can do to make this new concession known to the people concerned will be done.</P>

Are there many people in that category? I would be particularly interested in the average age of the people in that category, and also of the people who will be covered by the pensions to be granted in Column 3 of the Second Schedule.  It does not appear that a sum of £4 per annum to somebody enjoying a pension of £69 at the present time will go any distance to alleviate the hardship they will undoubtedly suffer from, and neither will the sum of 9d. per week make any appreciable difference whatever to a person in receipt of 14/6 a week.  I should like to know what kind of people will be in receipt of these pensions, particularly in the lower ranges set out in Column 3.</P>

      <P>The different rates of pension are proportionate to the degree of disability assessed by the Army Pensions Board, and the Senator may take it that those at the lower rates would have comparatively slight degrees of disability.  With regard to the average ages, in the case of a wound or disability incurred in the period 1916-1923, we could assume that there would be very few of the people concerned under the age of 20 in 1923, so that the average age would be about 60.  Naturally enough, on the lower rates of pensions, the amount based on the figure of 6 per cent. works out smaller than it does at the higher rates of pension, but the people on the lower rates have very small degrees of disability.</P>

      <P>I think the House is entitled to some more certain knowledge that that.  However, there is another matter I want to refer to, that is, the allowances to dependants. There is provision for repayment of the amount proved to be expended on educational fees not exceeding £60 in any year, in respect of any one child. I wonder would the Minister indicate upon what the judgment will be based as to what are fees properly and necessarily incurred to provide education. Is it merely related, say, to fees that would be payable for a child attending a vocational school or a secondary school where fees have to be paid or does it also include an allowance while the children are attending school?</P>

They could take it to include what might be regarded as board and lodging.  The narrow interpretation could be taken as meaning tuition fees only.  In that case, if the children went to boarding school, perhaps only a small proportion of that £60 could be allowed under the terms of the Bill as drafted.</P>

The Minister might well consider that educational fees embrace a good deal more than mere tuition, and stretch the interpretation to enable payments to be made in respect of school-going children up to the age of 18 years who are maintained at home.

    <P>Section 1 of the Bill gives statutory authority for the increases in pensions under the Military Service Pensions Acts 1924 to 1953 in respect of active service in the period 1916 to 1923 which were granted with effect from 1st August 1959, on the authority of a Supplementary Estimate for pensions <Col N="757" /> passed in Dáil Éireann on 22nd July 1959.  The annual cost is estimated at £34,000 and the increases are in accordance with those for State pensioners, generally, authorised by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement in April 1959.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill provides for the correction of negative reports made by the Referee in two cases where it was clearly his intention to make affirmative reports which would have resulted in the award of service certificates and pensions under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934. Both cases were dealt with in the last week of the Referee's tenure of office when he was ill at his home and when the normal working of the Advisory Committee with the Referee was, therefore, disorganised.  The Referee has since died and the original proposal in the Bill was that these two errors should be corrected by the Minister with the concurrence of two of the members of the Advisory Committee who assisted the Referee in the investigation of the cases.  In deference, however, to representations which were made on the Second Reading in Dáil Éireann, I have agreed to a provision that the corrections may be made by a judge of the Circuit Court or a practising barrister of at least ten years' standing.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister one question. He said, in defence of the smallness of the increase in disability pensions, 6 per cent., that those people had in fact got an increase in, I think, 1956. I think I am right in saying that these people, under this Bill, who also get an increase of 6 per cent. have had no increase since 1953.  Should this 6 per cent. therefore not be greater?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>They were left out in 1956.  Of course, these pensions are not and never were intended to be subsistence pensions at all.  In many cases, they are very small, purely nominal amounts, purely a recognition of service.  They do not by any means <Col N="758" /> pretend to be pensions that would maintain the people or have any significant effect on their standard of living.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said on the previous Bill would apply to this one.  The Minister's explanation of the point raised is a trifle strange.  Say a person were given £20 a year in 1949.  Whether that is merely a recognition or whatever it is, it is £20 a year Is the Minister suggesting that because the amount of the pension is small, the Government are not obliged to maintain the purchasing power of the pension as already fixed?  That is what I understood the Minister to say and if it is, it is a most pernicious idea that will not be accepted by anyone in this country.</P>

      <P>As in the case of the other Bill, these increases have been payable since last August.  Again, I must say that we would certainly like these increases to be more.  We are told that they cost £34,000.  A case was made in this House for an increase in pensions and it had no effect.  I do not mind what Government is in power or who gets the credit, provided these people are dealt with as generously as possible.  For every concession they get, I assure you we are grateful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the matter of Section 2, I remember making a previous case here that there should be no time limit for <Col N="759" /> a man or woman applying for a service pension to which he or she was entitled beyond yea or nay.  If they were entitled to it in 1924, 1934 or 1954, they are still entitled to it in 1964.  They have rendered pensionable service and they are therefore entitled to a pension according to that service.  If it should happen that a man or woman turned up in this country from foreign parts at any time, there should be some machinery by which that person could claim the pension to which he or she was entitled. Now such people are completely shut out.  I know I should be very embarrassed if a pal of mine who is entitled to pensionable service turned up here and said: &ldquo;Can I now get my pension?&rdquo;  There is no machinery whatever in the Department of Defence by which it could be done.</P>
    <P>I know of a couple who have not turned up in this country yet to look for them and Section 2 reminds me of them again.  I see that the Minister has agreed that, in correcting errors, in two cases mentioned, a circuit court judge or barrister of 10 years' standing with two members of the advisory board can decide the matter. In the event of any of those people I mentioned turning up, they should not be locked out completely and some arrangement could be made similar to that suggested here to deal with such cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of my remarks on the Courts of Justice Bill, it would not be right for me to let this Bill, or certainly this group of Bills, pass without saying something. Broadly, the cost of living has gone up by 20 per cent. since 1953.  I do not hold myself out as being gifted with prescience when I say that it will go up another 6 per cent. this year, 1960.  The whole of the increase therefore will be wiped out this year so that these men are left with a back-log of 20 per cent. which is not to be made up to them at all.  I do not know why the ordinary social method is not applied: when the pension is a very small, a bigger increase should be given than when it <Col N="760" /> is comparatively large.  I know that it puts a heavier burden on the Exchequer but the Exchequer has ways of defending itself.  I do not think we need weep too many bitter tears for it.  In a year when it is as certain as any matter can be in economics that the cost of living will rise by 6 per cent.&mdash;in the year 1960&mdash; we are giving them an increase now which will absolutely be wiped out by the end of the year and we shall leave them with this back-log which, if my recollection is correct, was fixed up in part in 1956.  My recollection is that the Bill was under consideration: I remember discussions about it.  I am quite certain it was under consideration in relation to this matter at the time.  In other words, this group of people will be in a position in which their pensions will in fact be cut by 20 per cent.</P>

      <P>They are now, particularly Senator L'Estrange, apparently under the impression that very large increases should be given to military service pensioners.  It is in very striking contrast with the attitude of the Government which was supported by those Senators and which, when increases were given to State pensioners generally in 1956, deliberately excluded military service pensioners.</P>
      <P>Now, military service pensioners are being given the increase given to State pensioners generally in the Budget of 1959.  That is in distinct contrast with what happened in 1956 when they were, despite appeals from those members of the Oireachtas who were interested in the matter, excluded from the increase given to other pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ted O'Sullivan raised the question of the time limit for applications for military service pensions. <Col N="761" /> It is very reasonable that there should be a definite time limit.  It is difficult to verify the facts in these applications. If we have not the applications in by a reasonable period, we shall reach the stage when it will be impossible to verify them.</P>
    <P>This matter has been reopened on a number of occasions already.  I think everybody with the service has had a reasonable opportunity to apply. I cannot see that there is any good case for reopening the whole question of these applications again.  In this Bill we are merely taking steps to correct two clerical errors which were made in the last week of the Referee's tenure of office.  The Bill specifies these two cases and applies to them and to them only.  There is no question of reopening applications for military service pensions generally.</P>

      <P>I do not want to repeat what I said, and others have said, about the rate of pension here.  It is obvious that what we say about the others applies here, too.

      <Col N="764" /> The Bill provides statutory authority for an increase of £61. 16s. (which is being paid since 1st August 1959, on the authority of a Supplementary Estimate for pensions passed in Dáil Éireann on 22nd July 1959) in the pension of £500 per annum payable to the widow of Terence MacSwiney.</P>

Surely a State like this, which proposes to raise and spend £140,000,000 in the current year, could offer a greater pension increase than 24/- per week to the widow of Terence MacSwiney.  The Minister should take this away and amend it, so that the conscience of this House and its sense of history will not be affronted by so meagre and miserable an offer. If he insists on this Bill to-night, he should get a photostat of it and send it to the producers of the film <i>Mise Eire</i> to be included as a 1960 epilogue.</P>

      <P>I should like to support what Senator Barry has said and to relate it also&mdash;and I think he would agree with me&mdash;to the next Bill that will be before us, and which relates to two specific widows. I should first like to ask the Minister one question, that is, whether I am right in thinking that these pensions are not subject to income-tax?  It is not quite clear in this Bill, and perhaps the Minister, when replying, will answer that question, for it makes quite a considerable difference.  I think I am right in saying that this is not subject to income tax, but that point does not become apparent in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Barry has made the point that we might feel a certain shame about the amount.  I agree.  We can also feel a certain sense of bewilderment at the fact that it was not until 1950 that anything at all was given to Terence MacSwiney's widow, Mrs. <Col N="765" /> Muriel MacSwiney.  This is an amendment of the very first MacSwiney Bill, which came only in December, 1950.  That is quite a long time after the death of Terence MacSwiney!  In 1950, and I looked up the Dáil Debates, in Vol. 123, Col. 1826, the then Minister, the late Dr. O'Higgins, introduced the Bill&mdash;which, incidentally, stated, and I quote &ldquo;The pension shall be deemed to have commenced on 21st day of September, 1950&rdquo;&mdash;that was the measure of the back-dating of this pension.  From December, 1950, it went back only to September of that year.  The Minister said that this lady, Mrs. Muriel MacSwiney, and I quote&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;could have had a pension for the last 26 years.  At the time she was well blessed with the world's goods. She did not apply.  Times have changed.  Her circumstances are different.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is what the Minister said, in justification, if you like, of the lateness of the award.  &ldquo;She did not apply,&rdquo; so she had got nothing till 1950.</P>
    <P>Before I go on, I should like to ask whether, then or earlier, if the Minister knows the answer, any award was given, or annuity, or sum, for the education of the daughter of Terence MacSwiney and Muriel MacSwiney? Of course 1950 would have been too late for a grant for her education. Therefore, I should like to know now if any such grant had been given long before?</P>
    <P>I do feel that it was up to us all, and I do not think it is right to speak just about one Government in this connection, to do something about all of this long before 1950.  As Senator Barry has suggested, I think that all this sounds terrible: &ldquo;She did not apply.&rdquo;&ldquo;She was well blessed with the world's goods&rdquo; and so on.</P>
    <P>In actual fact Mrs. Muriel MacSwiney, Terence MacSwiney's widow, had lived in ill-health and considerable misery since 1932.  She had had a serious break-down in health due to the kidnapping of her daughter Maura in Germany.  The daughter was brought back to Ireland, and concealed <Col N="766" /> from her mother, and the mother, when she appealed and pleaded was given no redress by the State, by the Courts, or by other authorities, all of whom connived in this robbing of a mother of her natural rights in regard to her own child, the only daughter of Terence MacSwiney.</P>
    <P>I am not saying this out of my own head; though I do know something of the facts, personally, because I saw the girl in my own home, in my mother's home, after she was brought back from Germany where she had been kidnapped.  Mrs. MacSwiney herself as recently as last October wrote as follows to the newspapers, and I quote from a copy of a letter written in her own hand:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I was forced to apply for a pension in 1950, owing to an eighteen year long serious illness, caused by the kidnapping of my daughter, and subsequent taking from my guardianship because I am not a Roman Catholic; this as with many other parents was my only crime. You published the similar case of Mrs. Corcoran in 1950.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I was never offered&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and the word is underlined</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;a pension by the Irish Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I feel, and I must say it on this occasion, when we are increasing this pension in a rather niggardly way, that I consequently regard this whole pension and this increase, as a form of reparation, a form of conscience-money, to try to compensate, to a very small degree, for the very great wrong done to the widow of Terence MacSwiney.  This was a grave injury, and one which, alas!  was subsequently condoned by the Irish powers-that-were, both temporal and spiritual, condoned by action and inaction, and by shameful silence on the part of all those who remained deaf at that time to the pleadings of Mrs. Muriel MacSwiney in relation to her daughter, and I feel in duty bound to say these things, as we now pass this Bill to increase her very small pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very clear case of the inadequacy of the increase which is being given.  The pension, as fixed in 1950, was £500.  The increase given at present is £61. 16s., an increase of the order of 12 per cent.  The cost of living has risen by about 40 per cent. since 1950.  The Minister has made no attempt to justify his failure to increase this pension by 40 per cent. or to bring the increase in pension up to 40 per cent. higher than the £500.</P>
      <P>From the earlier part of what Senator Sheehy Skeffington had to say, it is clear that the State has a certain obligation, late as that obligation is discharged, but once a pension has been fixed at £500 in 1950, I think it is clearly the duty of the Government to ensure that this pension keeps pace with the rise in the cost of living.</P>
      <P>This case does not fall into the Minister's beloved category of 6 per cent. This is <i>sui generis.</i>  The Minister has made no case for bringing it up only to £561. 16s.  I think it is absurd.  The mean, miserable and narrow approach of the Minister to this matter is shown when you find that in a statute of this House increasing a pension it was not found possible to bring the 16/- to the round pound.  That is a fair indication of the Minister's attitude.</P>

      <P>The Minister harped on the fact that the previous Government did not give the increase to these people in 1956 which they gave to other pensioners.  The Minister knows as well as anybody else that Rome was not built in a day. The Minister for Defence at that time had a Bill on the file.  He was preparing a Bill which was not only to give an increase in pensions but also to provide pensions for the widows of the people who died from disease contracted on service.

      <P>The main criticism here again is what is called the inadequate amount of the increase.  It was stated that I gave no explanation of how this increase was arrived at and that it did not, in fact, come within the category of the 6 per cent. increase granted by the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement last year.  In fact, I did, of course, give that explanation on the first Bill I introduced here&mdash;the Army Pensions Bill.  I mentioned that in the case of a widow of a Signatory of the Proclamation of 1916, we were applying not only the 6 per cent. increase granted in 1959 but also the 6 per cent. increase granted in 1956 to other State pensioners but which was not granted in this case.  In introducing this Bill, I said that the aim is the same as that which I mentioned in the case of the widow of a Signatory of the Proclamation of 1916 covered by Section 17 of the Army Pensions Bill.</P>
      <P>In this Bill, we are giving, first of all, the 6 per cent. increase given to other State pensioners in 1956 but which was not given to these people. We are giving that and we are then applying the present 6 per cent. increase to the pension so increased. That is the explanation of how the amount is £61. 16s.  We are now giving the two increases in these cases.  I should have liked to have done it in the other cases also but the financial situation would not allow of that.</P>
      <P>With regard to the statement that a Bill was being prepared to do all the things that Senator L'Estrange says there is no truth whatever in that and Senator L'Estrange knows that well. It is just the product of his imagination. There was no such Bill whatever in preparation.</P>

      <P>I raised a point on Second Reading which the Minister has not dealt with.  I referred to the cost of living having risen by 40 per cent. since 1950, while this Bill provides for only a 12 per cent. increase. I take it to have been accepted by the Government in relation to the increases in judicial salaries that where the cost of living had risen by 15 per cent., the salaries should also be increased by 15 per cent. That was the view expressed by the Minister for Justice and, consequently, I presume that principle should be applied in the case of this pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to be quite specific about this.  The Minister for Justice stated in the Dáil that from the last occasion on which the judges' salaries had been increased, the cost of living had risen by 15 per cent. and the only reason he saw for not increasing judges' salaries by 15 per cent. was that under the Constitution the salaries could not be reduced and therefore it was fair that there should <Col N="772" /> be a lag between a rise in the cost of living and the giving to the judges of full compensation.</P>
    <P>That was the principle accepted by the Minister for Justice in relation to judicial salaries.  The Taoiseach spoke to the same effect in relation to these increases in the Dáil.  I cannot see any reason, therefore, for the decision in this case, nor has the Minister furnished any explanation why this pension has not been increased by 40 per cent. as it should be.</P>

Is the Minister telling the House that the Budget of 1959 was so finely cut that there was not even 4/-, to bring £500 up to £562, available in the Budget calculated by the Minister for Finance?  That is the kind of thing of which the Minister is trying to convince us.  Of course, the Government could have increased this pension and other pensions a good deal more if they had wanted to do it.  The fact is that the money was there and they have not done it and the Minister has given us no explanation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is to provide a definition of unladen weight of vehicles for motor tax purposes which will prevent a leakage of revenue.  The previous definition was contained in section 18 of the Road Traffic Act, 1933.  Read with section 2 of the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act, 1952, this section had been interpreted as requiring the inclusion for tax purposes in the unladen weight of a vehicle of all parts and bodies, including containers, used with the vehicle, the heaviest combination used at any time to be reckoned.</P>
      <P>In general, this interpretation had been accepted and applied without question up to recent years.  Developments in recent years have encouraged efforts to circumvent this interpretation, particularly the growth in the number and variety of attachments used with the vehicles, as part of the growing complexity and importance of road traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1958 and 1959 a number of court cases were taken.  In two, the District Courts found in favour of the official interpretation of the definition.  In another case the District Court found against the definition.  A fourth case was not decided.  It was not possible to get an authoritative decision from a higher court before 1st January, 1960. This would put local authorities in an impossible position when dealing with the licensing of vehicles for 1960.  It also meant that the majority of owners who taxed on a proper basis could claim to be unfairly treated in relation to those who did not include all parts and fittings for tax purposes.  Accordingly it was necessary to introduce the present Bill, and under the Financial Resolution procedure to give effect <Col N="776" /> from 1st January to the definition of unladen weight which it contains.</P>
    <P>Here I may say that my <i>bona fides</i> in the matter have been questioned.  I have been accused of seeking to get extra taxation by a subterfuge, of seeking to build up C.I.E. at the expense of private hauliers, of seeking to circumvent the courts by a specious plea. I wish to assure the Seanad, as I did the Dáil, that my intentions in this matter are absolutely above board.  I am not seeking new taxation by a subterfuge.  I am seeking to prevent a growing leak of taxation by affirming in better terms a definition of unladen weight which we always regarded as the proper and, I might add, the fair and practicable one.  It was estimated that this leak could amount to £50,000 to £100,000 per annum, a serious loss of revenue to the Road Fund, money badly needed for the improvement and maintenance of the road system used by the lorries concerned.</P>
    <P>Again, I wish to repeat that I am not seeking to set the Courts aside.  There were genuine difficulties which prevented us from getting a decision from a higher court before the 1st January. The logical thing to do then was to ask the Legislature to put the matter beyond doubt for the future.  In any event, if the higher courts had given an adverse decision, the usual practice would have been followed of introducing legislation to restate the law.  The Bill in no way interferes with the Courts' jurisdiction to deal with cases arising prior to 1960 on the basis of the 1933 definition.</P>
    <P>The new definition is contained in sections 1 and 2 of the Bill.  All bodies, parts, fittings and receptacles will be included for unladen weight purposes.  Where different parts etc. are used from time to time, the heaviest combination will be taken.  Receptacles, or containers as they are more commonly called, are a particular problem.  Their use varies considerably. In some cases, a container is attached permanently to a vehicle and is indistinguishable from a built-on body.  In other cases a container is attached in such a way that it can be removed but it rarely if ever is.  Again, <Col N="777" /> a container can be placed on a vehicle, not attached to it, but left there as if it were a permanent part of the vehicle. Then there are containers which are occasionally taken on and off.  Finally, there is the genuine container which is invariably put on and taken off with the load in it.  A line has to be drawn somewhere, between the genuine container which forms part of the load and the container which forms part of the carrying capacity of the vehicle. Experience indicates that the only workable principle to follow, if more doubtful cases and more varying interpretations are to be avoided, is that set out in subsection (4) of Section 2 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>For most vehicle owners the new definition will involve no increase in duty.  For some, who previously adopted their own&mdash;and in our opinion, a mistaken&mdash;view of the law, it may involve some increase but not necessarily. In general the increase will be light, but in no case should it form a substantial fraction of the cost of operating a lorry.  The heavier lorries would carry heavier attachments and would be more affected, but these are the very vehicles which make most demand on the road system.  Attachments of various kinds add to their carrying capacity, and that means greater loads and greater impacts on the roads.  It is only fair that their contribution to the cost of road work should take account of the total damage they do and the total benefits they derive.</P>
    <P>The definition of unladen weight affects licensed hauliers in two ways, on the motor tax side and in regard to road transport licences, the latter being checked by reference to the unladen weight for motor tax purposes. The Government took account of this and the Transport (No. 2) Act, 1959, provided for the flat increase of 7 cwts. for licensed hauliers, besides which special cases can be dealt with under a hardship clause.</P>
    <P>The Seanad will recollect that, during the passage of the Transport Act, the Minister for Transport and Power stated that he is prepared to consider under this clause any individual case of genuine and deserving hardship <Col N="778" /> brought to his attention.  He has advised the hauliers of the steps to be taken to secure the 7 cwt. increase, which is granted automatically on application, and what information they should furnish when applying for special consideration under the hardship clause.  I think the licensed hauliers have been very fairly met in the matter of Road Transport licences.</P>
    <P>I now come to the question of enforcement.  Any measure of this type must be accompanied by sufficient powers of enforcement, and these are set out in sections 3 and 4 of the Bill.  They have been drafted on the principle that the powers must be effective but must also take account of the need to treat vehicle owners fairly. Furthermore, I wish to repeat what I said in the Dáil, that over and above the statutory provisions regarding proper notice of requirements etc., provision will be made by instructions to the enforcing authorities to have the statutory powers operated in a reasonable and understanding way.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 4 will enable the Garda Síochána and the local authorities to deal with the case where a vehicle is taxed at a certain weight and later used at a higher weight.  The present powers to deal with this are contained in the Road Traffic Act, 1933, but are defective in certain respects so far as motor taxation is concerned.</P>
    <P>Under subsection (1) of Section 3, a member of the Garda Síochána will be empowered to require a person in charge of a vehicle which he, the Guard, suspects to be infringing motor tax law, to bring the vehicle to an appointed weighbridge not more than 5 miles distant and there have its unladen weight checked.  Even if the vehicle is lightly laden, the Guard may make such a requirement.  This provision is necessary to meet a case where a driver could claim the vehicle was laden even if it contained a sack or two of goods that could easily be removed and later replaced on it; at present a vehicle must be completely unladen before it can be required to be weighed for motor tax purposes.</P>
    <P>Again, under existing law, a Guard <Col N="779" /> can require a vehicle to be weighed for tax purposes only if it also infringes road traffic law on weights of vehicles. The weighbridge must be not more than 2 miles distant, and it must be a Road Traffic weighbridge, of which there are only about one per county. Section 4 of the Bill enables local authorities to &ldquo;appoint&rdquo; for motor tax purposes a number of weighbridges in or adjacent to their functional area, and this should get over the shortage of official Road Traffic Act weighbridges without putting local authorities to the expense of providing more.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of Section 3 of the Bill will enable a local authority to call in a vehicle for reweighing after it has been taxed.  A general power to do so is given in subparagraph (1) of paragraph (a) of the subsection.  A local authority would use this power where they had reason to believe that a vehicle had been altered during the licensing period or where for some other good reason they felt the weight should be checked.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (ii) gives power to a local authority to call in a vehicle for weighing in the specific condition in which it was observed in use on a particular occasion.  This could be employed where a Guard had seen a vehicle used with additions not included in the unladen weight for tax purposes, but could not have it reweighed at the time for various reasons, e.g., there was no appointed weighbridge near enough, the vehicle was laden, and so on.</P>
    <P>Certain conditions are attached to the power to call in a vehicle for reweighing. Under subsection (6) of Section 3, at least seven days' notice must be given to the registered owner of the vehicle.  Subsection (5) requires that where a reweighing is required of a vehicle in a specific condition observed in use, notice must be given either at the time it was observed or within 14 days.  This is to ensure that the vehicle owner will be warned near enough to the occasion his vehicle was observed to warrant his remembering what &ldquo;additions&rdquo; were used with it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="780" /> Under Section 4, fees for the reweighing of vehicles will be met by the local authority, not by the vehicle owner.  Local authorities' expenses will ultimately be met from the Road Fund.</P>
    <P>A maximum penalty of £50 is provided in subsection (7) of Section 3 for failure to bring in a vehicle for reweighing.  The existing penalty under the Road Traffic Act is £10, a figure which bears no relation to present-day money values and rates of motor taxation.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that the definition of unladen weight operates as from 1st January, 1960, in accordance with the financial resolution.  The other provisions will come into force on the passing of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill have been very fully debated in the Dáil, on the two stages of the Financial Resolution and on the various stages of the Bill. On the whole, the Bill was accepted. Some suggestions were made for amendment, and, while I gave them full consideration, I found I could not accept them without defeating the whole purpose of the Bill.  On one point, I was able to meet the representations made without sacrificing necessary principles.  This was in regard to containers and other additions of a substantial nature used for only part of the year.  I indicated my intention to make regulations under separate statutory powers, which would allow refunds in such cases.  In effect, the containers would be charged with tax for part of the year only. The regulations require careful consideration and are still in the process of preparation.  I advised the Dáil that they would probably be subject to limitations of a kind which already apply in the cases where refunds are allowed.</P>
    <P>I conclude by recommending the Bill to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with much interest to the Minister.  One would imagine that every owner of a vehicle, whether a commercial owner or a licensed haulier, is a sort of buccaneer roving around the country for <Col N="781" /> the purpose of defrauding the State of legitimate taxation.  It is a complete travesty of the facts to make such a suggestion.  The Minister says he wants to stop leakage.  He mentioned that four cases were brought before the courts in 1958-59, that the decisions in two were in favour of the Government contention, that one was against it and that the other case was not heard before the introduction of the Financial Resolution last December.  He said this Bill is introduced for the purpose of overcoming evasions.  If I were as uniformed as the Minister is on this measure, I should feel that the owners of commercial vehicles and licensed hauliers are the sort of people we should not know, that a brand of some sort ought to be put on them all for not having the civil virtues which people ought to possess.  However, such is far from the truth.</P>
      <P>I understand that commercial vehicles bear a higher rate of taxation in this country than in any country in the world.  In itself, that is one of the reasons for this being in the form of a penal tax.  During recent years, many of us have been asked to read various papers emanating from Government and semi-Government sources.  The most famous and the most fashionable one to-day is <i>Economic Development</i> and one of the conclusions drawn in that paper, referring to what is necessary to help this economy to develop, in Chapter 3, paragraph 14 is that &ldquo;the opportunity for the expansion of industrial production and employment will not be fully realised unless labour costs per unit of output are low enough to make the price of the product competitive in world markets.&rdquo;  But the imposition of a further £100,000 on the transport of goods and services is not considered something that would impede economic progress at all.  I believe that not alone would it impede it to the extent that all the industrial sections of the community would have to provide that £100,000, but it would have a worse psychological effect on anyone who wishes to do anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole of this measure bristles with minimum fines and it all savours of a sort of witch hunt.  It reminds me <Col N="782" /> of the old Star Chamber justice that we had in the days of the Charles's in the 17th century.  The suggestion that the Minister and the Government are coming in here to stop something which is wrong, some terrible evasion is so wide of the truth that I cannot find words strong enough to express my disagreement with this measure.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that it is brought in to remove doubts.  The draftsmen, if they were instructed by the Minister, could have removed doubts effectively without placing an additional £100,000 tax on the most industrious and hard-working section of this community. The Minister could just as easily have instructed his draftsmen how to remove the £100,000 tax as to increase it.  In a way, this is only one of these burdens that have been piling up on our economy through the years, particularly since 1932.  Today we find ourselves in an appallingly uncompetitive position in the world markets but hoping that some uncle from America will come over and start industries which will pay us and in which we do not have to work, or that we will be brought into some of the trade associations which are starting in Europe, instead of being given the opportunity by the Government to stand on our own feet.</P>
    <P>One of the important things in modern development is transport and it is a pity that the Government have come here to put another obstacle in the way of transport and in the way of people who want to do something for themselves.  This measure will increase the cost of hauling beet, turf, hay, straw and fodder of all kinds.  It will increase the cost of removing furniture, of meat, of carrying all forms of livestock, sheep, lambs, pigs, cattle or horses.  It will affect the dairying industry.  It will place a burden on the carriage of milk and cream.  It will bear heavily on the cost of carrying fish and seaweed and it will even increase the difficulty the farmer will have, perhaps for several months, in a year like last year, in the carriage of water.</P>
    <P>It will also effect the rates because <Col N="783" /> county councils who use tar pots on their lorries will have to pay the additional tax because the pot will be weighed with the lorry.  I know of an instance where the tax on a local authority lorry will be increased from £78 to £126 because they have a tar pot on the lorry.</P>
    <P>I want now to come to the kernel of the whole matter and to tell the House where I believe the case made by the Minister falls to the ground.  Generally speaking, a flat bodied truck weighed at 3 tons, used prudently by the owner, will carry about 6 tons.  If the owner decides that he would like to carry sheep on that truck, then in order to work it economically not alone will he have to put on creels but a second deck which will weigh at least one ton. Therefore the carrying capacity of that lorry is reduced by one ton.  The whole notion in this Bill is that if he puts these creels on that truck he can carry more when the actual effect is that he can carry less.  The same applies in the carriage of turf.</P>
    <P>A man who has an ordinary lorry can carry a good deal of coal because it is a very dense commodity, but if he wishes to carry turf, he has to put on creels and has to pay more tax because he does so.  The maximum weight capacity of that truck is then reduced by the addition of these creels.  The same thing applies to carrying milk in containers and more so in the case of meat.  It is now required by regulation that when fresh meat is being carried from one abattoir to another for processing or anything of that sort it must be carried in insulated containers. That means these containers will have to be weighed in with the vehicle with the result that the truck will carry less meat but the tax will be increased.</P>
    <P>The whole basis of assumption behind this Bill is wrong in the extreme and must create a bad impression in the mind of every man who has a truck and who must feel that the Government are out to make him put his hand in his pocket.  If a man wants to carry sheep, calves or cattle in a truck with <Col N="784" /> a carrying capacity of 6 tons, he will find that in order to hold these animals on the lorry, the maximum carrying capacity is reduced, while the Minister says that they are putting these additions on the truck for the purpose of carrying more weight.</P>
    <P>The manager of every creamery committee will say to his committee that he had to pay additional tax on his truck because he had to put up two tanks to carry skim milk to Rathmore, or Dungarvan or Carrick-on-Suir or any other place.  Every member of these committees and every share-holder in a creamery society will say: &ldquo;How are the Government so ill advised? How could the Minister get up and say that we would be able to carry more milk?  If we put two tons weight of containers on the truck, surely in commonsense, the vehicle's carrying capacity is reduced by the amount put on.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This sort of legislation brings Governments into disrepute.  The ordinary man in the street who has to pay this extra taxation says: &ldquo;Why do the Government not try to make it easy for us to earn our living?&rdquo;  There is nothing as disconcerting as bad laws and this is a thoroughly bad law which will have very ill effects.  It is said that an unjust war sows dragon's teeth. This sort of legislation creates discontent among the people.  It makes for bad citizenship and it should not be pressed by the Government.  I feel so concerned about this measure that, with a full sense of my responsibilities, I want to ask the Minister to withdraw the measure and have it re-drafted in a more realistic way.</P>
    <P>The maximum load carrying weight of the vehicle should be the criterion rather than the unladen weight of the vehicle with the containers.  I think that everyone here has no difficulty whatever in understanding that the so-called implications of the Bill are wide of the mark.</P>
    <P>There is another matter I want to mention, that is, the introduction of minimum fines.  The maximum fine that could be imposed under the previous legislation relating to these matters was £10.  The maximum fine has now been increased to £50.  There <Col N="785" /> are too many provisions in the Bill of a kind permitting a Garda to stop a lorry on the road and bring it to the nearest weighbridge.  There is an elaborate system of making it easy for the Garda to prosecute, if not, in fact, to persecute, the ordinary citizen.</P>
    <P>The citizen suffers from a sense of grievance.  He has a just grievance because any of these containers which he puts on his truck reduces the maximum weight-carrying capacity of the vehicle.  Therefore, I hold that the case made by the Minister falls to the ground.  The Minister should adopt no other course but that of withdrawing this measure and having it re-drafted in its entirety.  If the legislation in connection with the collection of road taxation is not up to date, there is no reason why the matter could not be dealt with and a new measure drafted.</P>
    <P>In many of the cases I have mentioned, a new type of traffic is growing up.  Meat is carried and milk is carried to the various processing factories.  That type of development is going to grow in the country.  If our dairying industry is to be made a success, milk, instead of being made into butter, which is the traditional method, will be made into chocolate crumb in one place and processed at other places.  Every creamery in the country will feel the burden of this and so will every meat factory.  To-day, instead of processing the products in their own factory, meat factories have some of their fresh meat removed for further processing in specialised industries. In fact, everything that can be done in relation to our economy here will be hindered or restricted under this measure.</P>
    <P>That is why I believe the measure should be withdrawn and redrafted in order to ensure that it will not impose a hardship or be an impediment to the progress of our economy.  That is what this measure will do.  I know it was not brought in with that intention by the Minister.  The Minister was informed that cases were before the court.  The decisions in two of them were for him and another against, while another case was left in abeyance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="786" /> He also said in the Dáil that he was trying to have a case stated in the High Court.  That would not do any good but what is wrong is that the whole of the law dealing with this matter is archaic.  New laws should be drafted in order to allow progress to be made in the carrying of goods in vehicles on the roads.  The whole system of motor taxation is out of date and is an impediment to the economy.  Therefore, the Minister should withdraw the Bill and have it re-drafted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>In introducing this Bill, the Minister said his intentions were honourable.  Might I be facetious for a moment?  I attended a pantomime once which showed a pirate who had raided a village.  He was a very swarthy, efficient and ebullient type of pirate.  He moved up the gangplank with a fair maiden saying that once aboard the lugger, the girl was his.  The Minister said his intentions were honourable.  If the pirate had said that, I would have been more inclined to believe him.</P>
      <P>All this legislation is bound up with developments that have been taking place ever since the Government decided that in 5 years' time C.I.E. must pay its way.  The first development occurred when young Guards, picked men, were brought to Dublin and given a course in road traffic legislation.  They sent out policemen for the first time&mdash;not men of sergeants rank or higher&mdash;equipped with cars to see to it that road traffic legislation as far as lorries were concerned was complied with absolutely and in accordance with the strict letter of the law. That was never the spirit and never the intention up to that time.</P>
      <P>As a result of this activity, the Minister got into the trouble he has told us about tonight in three court cases. Immediately, as he admitted himself, he said the normal thing to do was to put through legislation to see to it that this could not happen again.  I think that is the big stick attitude.  It is true to say that over the years there was a liberal approach to road traffic legislation in all its facets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Slightly outside the ambit of this <Col N="787" /> Bill is a case I know of, of a lorry purchased on the never-never system standing in a farmer's yard.  The second son had purchased this lorry and was not in a position to use it for the movement of cattle.  He has been contravening the law but so had hundreds of other young country lads all over the Republic of Ireland.  Just because the Government decided that they would produce the big stick and see to it that C.I.E. would pay in 5 years, we got this sort of thing, starting with the training of young Guards, the sending of these men in motor cars to catch people and finishing with two parallel Acts, the one dealing with licensed hauliers and the other, the Bill now before the House.</P>
    <P>The trend of modern transport is towards tanks and containers.  It is quite obvious that that must have an effect on the movement of cereals. There are all sorts of things that go in a sack.  The weight of a hundred sacks normally holding 10 tons of material would be 3 cwt., certainly not more. The weight of a bulk container to hold the same amount of grain, cereals or other material which is put in sacks would be 13 cwt.  That is what I know from my own experience of the trade. Therefore, this is penal legislation.</P>
    <P>I made this case on the other Bill and I want to make it again.  Everything in this country has increased over the past 30 years except the cost of the movement of goods.  I want to make it quite clear that about the time when the first lorries started in this country, if you wanted to move goods by lorry from Louth, where I live, to Dublin, you could pay 30/- per ton. If you want to do it to-day, you will pay far less.  Depending on where you live, you will probably pay about £1 a ton.  This, of course, is because of the greater efficiency of the lorries, the fact that they are bigger and heavier, and the development to the point where the helper is dispensed with and you have bulk containers with an arrangement at one end for filling them without man-handling and at the other end for unloading them, again without man-handling.</P>
    <P>Almost every flour mill that accepts <Col N="788" /> native wheat has moved into this stage. At the moment they have moved as far as the acceptance of dry wheat in such a way, but the day is not far distant when they will move into the acceptance of green or untreated wheat in a similar way.  Of course, the result is that everybody who is in this trade in order to compete has to dispense with the helper and get his goods through, not perhaps for the £1 per ton in the journey I mentioned but for 15/- or some lower figure, and he must use containers.</P>
    <P>Even if the financial aspect did not enter into it, he will have to use containers because people at the other end do not want to have man-handling of goods.  They want a hopper into which material running is mechanically conveyed to its destination within the mill or the point of processing.</P>
    <P>I hold that the only reason for this legislation, which does deliberately cut across the present application of the law, is to catch out all those decent non-protected firms who have to engage in this trade and have to compete, and to make them say that they will be more prepared to go to C.I.E. and make a package deal than to keep their own transport.</P>
    <P>Again, perhaps the Minister or people here might say that that would be a good thing.  I should like to say a word for the driver of the lorry who lives in a small country area, for the fellow working for the firm which has one or two or three lorries.  He is as much entitled to his opportunity of a job, to avoid emigration and to keep his family together, as his counterpart in C.I.E. and the livelihoods of these people are definitely being seriously endangered by this legislation.</P>
    <P>Somebody might say: &ldquo;Do C.I.E. not have to pay this tax also?&rdquo;  I submit that that is a cheap joke.  Anybody who looks at the last report of C.I.E. will see two separate sums written off&mdash;one of £1,000,000 and the other of £800,000 &mdash; by the Government. In that sort of context, is it not true that whether or not C.I.E. pay the Government £100,000 or £500,000 in motor taxation does not matter two hoots because &mdash; let us face it &mdash; the <Col N="789" /> system of Government accounting that must enter into a semi-state body like C.I.E. in such a large measure can see to it that this is in fact written-off.  If so, the unfortunate driver of a lorry down the country who wants to keep his job and maintain his family is most certainly at a disadvantage, because his employer must pay increases of £10 or £70 or £80 on a normal lorry because of this legislation which he did not have to pay before now.</P>
    <P>I could give instances of several firms who have the ordinary hand-operated crane, and have containers which they put on the normal lorries with these cranes.  Those containers fit directly above the body of a long wheelbased lorry, which allows the grain to run in to the hopper at the other end.  They also have an arrangement for mechanically filling the grain. Up to now, they have had not to pay tax based on the weight of those containers.  Now they will have to pay and the Government fiddle can enter in the case of C.I.E.  Do you wonder if in a light mood I say to the Minister that I would sooner take the word of the pirate in the play than his word that his intentions in this case are honourable?</P>
    <P>Is there any parallel legislation in any other country in Europe?  Can the Minister give me any instance in which there is parallel legislation?  He certainly cannot quote a parallel case in Great Britain, and that is where the comparison lies, because our economy, whether people like it or not, is integrated with Britain's, and there is not the slightest doubt that any difference in taxation here on the wrong side, any figures higher as compared with Britain, will fall heavily on our people, because our people have lower incomes than those in Britain, and these things must be paid for.  This £10 or £70 or £80 which is to go on to the normal lorry will fall eventually on the poorer sections of the community in one way or the other, either in the form of increased charges by C.I.E. or increased costs on the ordinary small business which has to pay this tax.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to refer to the question of the parallel legislation previously passed.  There was there a <Col N="790" /> hardship clause, but here there is no hardship clause.  There is no clause whereby, if there is a case that should be met by the Minister, he can deal with it.  The only case he tells us of is of a container being used only for portion of the year, and he says that the same provision will apply as in the case of a person who wishes to get a refund of ordinary road tax.  Anybody who knows anything about the taxation of vehicles will say that the stringent regulations with regard to the refund of road tax are such that very few people ever succeed in getting it back.  If this applies also in the case of a container used for only two or three months of the year, in my view, 90% of such refunds, which under the statement of the Minister would be fair, will never be made because nobody will ever succeed in complying with all the stringent regulations.</P>
    <P>There is no hardship clause whereby anybody can make a case to the Minister on any of his operations.  I could imagine a small non-protected business which might have to use containers because of the fact that the people receiving the goods at the other end, who might be a very much larger firm, would insist upon their using them.  These people might not have the resources or the money to instal the very expensive machinery at their end to load mechanically the goods into the containers.  In such a situation, there would, of course, be a hardship on the small non-protected business.</P>
    <P>The Minister is taking no power under this Act to do anything about such a case.  He is leaving the situation just as it is.  These people may find that a small profit on that load will be converted into a loss, and if that continues, they must find themselves going out of business.</P>
    <P>This is dreadful legislation and, above all, it is parallel legislation.  It is parallel to the lectures given to those young Gardaí who were sent out to change the law, because anybody who seeks to enforce a law which had not been complied with, for 10, 20 or 30 years is changing it.  It is legislation which is comparable with the infamous <Col N="791" /> Act passed here giving the unfortunate hauliers an increase of 7½ cwts., and insisting that these attachments, weighing as much as 2 tons 15 cwts. be counted in the weight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a retrograde step which will further increase the burden on the most industrious section of the community, the farmers, traders and industrialists who have their own lorries, and the licensed hauliers.  Those people have had to meet, for a long number of years now, an increase in the cost of living, an increase in the price of petrol, and an increase in the price of oil, spare parts, and garage services.  Now they must grapple with a new imposition which will further increase the cost of production, both agricultural and industrial.  Indeed, it may help to price us out of some of the markets in which we have a foothold at the present time.</P>
      <P>This legislation has a three-fold object.  The first, undoubtedly, is to counteract decisions given by the Courts and this legislation will annul the decisions of various district justices without having to state a case for the High Court.  Secondly, and this may be the primary object, another £100,000 will be gathered from an already overtaxed hard-working section of our people.  Thirdly, it may drive the private lorry owners off the road&mdash;perhaps that is what is intended &mdash;and give a further monopoly to C.I.E.  It might be no harm to say in passing that C.I.E. have a costly monopoly which definitely has increased, and is helping to increase, the cost of production of what we have to export.</P>
      <P>The Minister must know that he is imposing a hardship and that there are many private hauliers who are barely able to carry on at the moment and that many of those people may be put off the road by this new legislation. Despite that, the Minister said, as reported at Column 1060, Volume 178, of the Dáil Official Debates:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hauliers so affected would be unable to continue to use their present lorries and in the absence of an increase in standard lorry weight <Col N="792" /> would either have to replace their lorries with lighter vehicles or operate them without the attachments or additions which might be essential to their business.</P>
    <P>If those people are already almost taxed out of existence, I should like to know where the Minister thinks they will get the money to buy new lorries or replace the existing lorries.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the House that many of those licensed hauliers were good enterprising farmers, farmers' sons, labourers, and, in some cases, garage workers and others, with a little initiative and a little faith in their own country.  Instead of taking the emigrant ship and looking for work in England, they had faith in their own country and stayed at home. They collected a few hundred pounds and put down a deposit on a lorry and went into haulage work.  The majority of these lorries are perhaps not paid for yet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The majority of them were doing quite legal work. Perhaps some of them might at times break the law.  This Bill will sound the death knell of the little businesses which many of these road hauliers have built up through hard work during a long number of years.  I maintain that they are as much entitled to earn their living in their own country as any other section of our people.  We should do all we can to encourage private enterprise but, instead, we are dealing it a mortal blow from which it may never recover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that furniture removers and livestock hauliers&mdash;Senator Burke gave a full list and I shall not go further into it&mdash;will be severely hit.  It is a further tax on agricultural and industrial production.  We have often been told it is the last straw which breaks the camel's back.  The Government should be concerned at the present time with the appalling death rate on our roads and should be concerned with prosecuting and persecuting the drunken drivers, instead of prosecuting and persecuting the unfortunate road hauliers.  Our laws have gone haywire when drivers, drunk in charge of cars, can kill people, and <Col N="793" /> get off scot free, but if the people with lorries do not pay the full tax, they can be fined £50 or £100 or get three or six months in jail.  Our laws have gone haywire and it would be better if the Government spent some time amending the existing laws with regard to driving in an effort to reduce the appalling death toll on the roads.  Our time would be much better taken up in doing that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLOSullivan" hpid="Mr. J.L. O'Sullivan Mr. J.L. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.L. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one other section of the community who will be severely hit by this Bill.  I refer to the small farmer with the 10 cwt. pick-up truck.  These men who have put their whole earnings into buying these trucks to do their ordinary business will have to put certain crates on to the vehicles to carry livestock or other merchandise. I have been informed by these small farmers whose pick-up trucks are the only vehicles they have on the farm that their taxation has been increased considerably under this new legislation.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister at least to deal easily with this section of our people, the poorer section, whose pick-up trucks are their only means of transport and which carry their families to Mass and to the towns.  These trucks are the only mode of conveyance they have.  I have been informed, as I said, that these people will have to find large amounts of money in addition to the already considerable burden of taxation they are carrying.</P>
      <P>I shall not go into what Senator Burke and Senator Donegan said about the big lorries.  We all know of the meat in containers that is shifted from one factory to another for processing and when there is no crane to take off that container at the end of the journey, the container is charged in the assessment of the tax.  Whereas, if they take it to a railway station equipped with big cranes to handle these containers and take them away, they get off scot free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister at least to consider the claims of these people, the owners of the half-ton pick-up trucks which are used to carry merchandise for the farming community, for the small farmers.  There is no doubt that if the owners of these <Col N="794" /> lorries throughout the country are put out of business, the farming community will suffer a grievous loss. They are there, available in the locality, living in the rural areas.  They are easily communicated with, always ready to do the job no matter what hour of the day or night they are called upon.  These are men who are not afraid of work.  They are men who will put their shoulder behind the wheel and they have been found very reasonable in their charges.  If they are to be put off the road, the people of the country will suffer a very grievous loss.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">

      <P>In the same way, they are encouraging evasion of the existing law.  The practice of stripping lorries is becoming widespread throughout the country.  Vehicles going along to be taxed are stripped to their floorboards and the people concerned are not paying the tax laid down in legislation. The purpose of this Bill is to tighten things up and to provide that these people pay the proper tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>What our friends in Fine Gael said is that the Minister should tighten up legislation and allow lorry owners, at the same time, to continue the existing practice of stripping lorries.  We are up against the problem that lorries are becoming bigger and heavier, with consequent heavier damage to the public roads. I am sure that my colleagues will raise a howl in the local authorities when they have an increase in rates to provide for the repair of the roads. We all have had experience of seeing heavy vehicles in effect crumbling the road on which they are moving. Many of these, with the practice of stripping lorries, have not been paying the tax they should be paying for the upkeep and repair of the roads they are using.</P>
      <P>We are told this is a drive against private enterprise.  In fact, the legislation is there all the time and the only people licensed to carry for reward are the nationalised public transport undertaking and the licensed haulier.  That is the position maintained and apparently advocated by Fine Gael up to now.  Now we are told that the purpose of this legislation is to put off the road the small concerns, which, on the face of it, have been carrying illegally up to now and breaking the law.</P>

They have spoken previously on behalf of the licensed hauliers whose livelihood in turn is affected by the illegal operations in the same way as C.I.E. is affected by the illegal operations, but in any case they seem to want it on every side.  I support this measure and I think the arguments put forward here to-night were largely ridiculous, ill-founded, and bore no relation to the actual road transport position throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am urged to speak on this Bill only for a moment &mdash;like Senator Murphy&mdash;by reason of the Minister's statement.  One thing he was accused of was trying to help C.I.E.  Up to a year or so ago&mdash;perhaps when I had more time on my hands &mdash; I was one of the people strongest in the feeling that it was essential to have a body like C.I.E. in existence.  Now I feel that you do not necessarily in a country like this have to have a body like C.I.E.  You could do it entirely by means of a system of private transport.  The trouble up to now has been that Governments have not made up their minds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is attempting to help C.I.E. by this method, he will have his work cut out.  I have looked at the figures.  I was urged to look at the economics stencil that they send round to us and I saw what the rates for the railways were like.  We are all told what a dreadful year for C.I.E. 1958-9 was, that it was terrible, the worst ever.  In 1959, up to the <Col N="797" /> new financial year, railway receipts dropped by £25,000 a week and by the end of the year, they had dropped by a million pounds.  Where do you get anything out of your package deal?  What has happened to your package deal?  Where has it gone? It has gone through the roof.</P>

      <P>I have another point also, another major point I want to ask the Minister&mdash;since the point has been introduced&mdash;what is the use when, the capital of the railways having been halved in the 1933 Transport Act, C.I.E. cannot approach paying its way, even with a huge increase in road passenger receipts? Senator Murphy spoke of the practice of stripping lorries.  I know very little of the stripping of lorries, but as I understood it, lorries have always been stripped, for 30 or 40 years.  This Bill proposes saying it is time to comply with legislation.  Now we are changing the law and that is all right of course, provided we have no doubt about the practice on which we are changing the law.  Any attempt to raise a smokescreen and to pretend we are not changing the law is all my eye, all humbug and rot, especially, as was stated here, as there were three decisions in the courts on this matter. I do not know how anybody can say people were breaking the law.  They <Col N="798" /> may have been doing so in certain respects.  We all know what happened under the 1933 Transport Act and the legislation of that time.  I know it as well as the Senator does.</P>

      <P>The fact is that the people against whom the cases were brought were upheld in the courts.  That is a fact.  The Government are obviously changing the law. No talk of stripping or of covering or of piling lorries has any bearing on the fact that the law is being changed and that it is being made tougher.  The Minister may have had mixed motives in dealing with it.  I do not think he came into the Seanad with quite as clean hands as he sought to suggest here tonight</P>

      <P>Listening to the speakers here tonight, it is rather difficult to realise where one has been for the past hour because more irrelevancies, more unrelated conclusions drawn from non-existent cases stated, I have never heard in my life.  As just one Senator has spoken, Senator Murphy, has put it, there seems to be an all-out effort to have it both ways.  In fact, if there are many ways, you just do not stop at both because there seems to be an all-out effort to have it every way.  In every way that the Senators who have spoken can have it, it is always a case of having a swipe at the Government.  We are now presenting to this House for its considered and, we had hoped, well-informed opinion, the Bill we have found to be necessary, not in order to penalise or persecute any person in this State, but in order that our laws will properly, fairly and justly be administered in respect of all those who may come under this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been alleged by Senator Burke that the whole context of my approach to this matter was that I regarded the owners of lorries in this country as buccaneers, setting out with the prime object in their daily lives of defrauding the State of tax.  If Senator Burke listened to my introductory speech&mdash;and, indeed, if he did <Col N="799" /> not listen or did not quite appreciate what I said here tonight, he should read and fully appreciate what is therein contained&mdash;he would realise that the approach he has alleged as my approach falls entirely to the ground. I have made it quite clear that this Bill has been brought before the Oireachtas with the intention of stopping a leak that is there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill was introduced with the intention of making the few who are defrauding the State, whether wittingly or unwittingly, pay their just share to the Road Fund to which all these taxes go in order that the roads may be of the calibre of the type and of the nature that will carry the large improved modern transport about which Senator Donegan talked so volubly to-night.  It has brought about a situation that, as he said, is practically unique to-day and, in relation to freight and transport, the cost has not increased over the years. Far from increasing, cases may be instanced where in fact this cost has decreased substantially.  I agree entirely with Senator Donegan that that is the case.</P>
      <P>If we had not the roads, we could not have the trucks of modern design and dimensions that would bring about that happy situation and, without the road tax moneys which are the funds from which our roads are improved, made and maintained, we just could not have those roads for those trucks that are such an asset to our economy to-day and will be in the future.</P>
      <P>It was said by practically all of the speakers, with the exception of Senator Murphy, that the prime intention is to get £100,000 more in the tax from the public.  My prime intention is to retain within the Road Fund to-day by way of this tax anything from £50,000 to £100,000 that we in my Department estimate we are likely to lose by the law being violated by a few within our ranks throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need that money in our Road Fund.  That Road Fund is the only <Col N="800" /> real fund from which our local authorities secure their grants annually to undertake the road-making and maintenance of the road networks we have.  If we are to continue in that very laudable direction, then we must ensure that the money that should go into that Fund does in fact get to that Fund and that any loophole that may recently have appeared or may have been created should be stopped as fast as possible.</P>
    <P>I advert then to Senator O'Donovan's assertion that the loophole was always there, that this practice of stripping trucks is a traditional practice.  In other words, in common with some of the other speakers, Senator O'Donovan is of the belief that stripping these trucks to evade the law, because it is traditional, is something that in itself must be right and just and that, far from trying to stop that effort, we should in fact allow it to go unnoticed.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Senator O'Donovan in regard to his assertion that over the past 30 years this stripping of trucks has gone on unabated, without let or hinderance.  All down the years, under our tax laws, this very item has been attended to continuously.  To ask that we should, now that a crack appears in our laws, allow that crack to become a permanent feature of our tax code is surely rather ridiculous in the situation in which we find ourselves and would be entirely and uncompletely unjust to those members of our community, our lorry-owners and our vehicle-owners, who have been paying the tax fairly and squarely over the years up to and including last year.  We want to make the few who have been evading the law conform to the law that is serving many within the State.</P>
    <P>Then a plea was made by Senator Burke that this increase in tax, as he put it, would increase the cost of haulage to all.  It will not increase the cost of haulage to anyone who has been conforming with the law in the past.  If it does in fact increase the cost of any particular cases, then it will be only in cases in which the owners of those vehicles have been evading the law and not paying their just tax in the past.</P>
    <P>Even in those cases, the impact of <Col N="801" /> the liability that may now be added to those people who did evade the laws in the past will be of such slight significance that it would scarcely be possible to calculate it in regard to the running of the truck for a year, even on a daily charge, let alone to relate it to the cost per ton per mile, or the cost per ton mile as it is described by those people in the haulage business. It is really making a mountain out of a very tiny molehill for speakers here to raise such a hue and cry about the added cost of transport which will ensue from this measure, forgetting and ignoring completely that it will fall only on those who have in fact not borne their full share of the tax costs over the years.</P>
    <P>It has been said that this Bill should not become law, that it should be taken away and should be properly drafted and that it would be a bad law, if it became law.  Surely the essence of a bad law is that it has made itself felt in the existing tax code in that it has not been adhered to and was being evaded and was likely to be evaded in greater measure in the future.  A very true test of any law is that it cannot be administered, regardless of its other merits.  That in itself must, of necessity, make it a bad law.  Our present tax code has had these crevices and holes punched in it of late which make it rather difficult, if not wellnigh impossible, to administer it in the future as it was administered in the past.  That in itself brought about a situation wherein there could be tagged on to our present tax code the label that it was a bad law, in regard to the vehicle tax, because of the difficulty, and increasing difficulty, of administration.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke also made the complaint that there was something wrong with making it easy to persecute, as he said, rather than prosecute.  Surely the members of this House, Senator Burke included, do not advocate that we should ask our Guards not to administer the law, that we should in fact make it so difficult for them that they are not likely to administer it. Again, the same application of the law to all our people really makes for good law and if it is alleged that we are making it easy for the Guards to prosecute <Col N="802" /> and persecute, as the Senator said, if that is bad, then conversely, we must take it that it is a good thing to make the law so difficult that the Guards cannot administer it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I prefaced my remarks by saying that I was being facetious.  The Minister has not so prefaced his remarks.  We always had a row in a good-humoured way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>However, there is another matter I want to bring to the notice of Senators who have gone to great pains to make play with the circumstances <Col N="803" /> of C.I.E.  I am not here to defend C.I.E.  I am bringing in a law that will be administered in respect of C.I.E. as it will be administered in respect of every other lorry owner in the country.  In fact, we know that C.I.E. will be made to toe the line the same as everybody else.  That is as it should be.  I would ask the members of the House to rest easy in their minds if they think that C.I.E. will be allowed to get away with a certain tax while other members of the community will be asked to bear a heavier tax. That is not part of my intention or that of the Department and the Government, in framing this Bill.</P>
      <P>We also had Senator Donegan being very knowledgeable in regard to the uses of modern transport, modern containers and the emptying and filling of these containers with the various commodities carried on those trucks. He spoke about how those modernisations have brought about the elimination of the traditional helper on the truck.  At the same time, we have the same Senator shedding tears that this tax imposition, as he regards it, will bring about a situation wherein the driver will be taken off, too, and poor fellows down the country will lose their jobs because it will no longer be economic to run the trucks.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask Senator Donegan if that is his concern&mdash;the employment of the driver of the lorry&mdash;why was it not also his concern when it came to the question of displacing the helper from the truck by adding this mechanical device of modern design?  Surely the helper is as important as the driver from the point of view of everyday life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is modern business.  That has to happen all the time.  A man loses a job in one place and gets one somewhere else.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the helper being displaced by mechanisation, that helper does not find a job somewhere else, but in the case of <Col N="804" /> C.I.E. displacing the driver of a truck, they must, of necessity, employ a driver to drive the truck to do his business and therefore there is no loss of actual employment.  There has been grave loss of employment through this mechanisation which the Senator has mentioned, in doing away with the helper, but I am merely making those two contradictory points to bring to the notice of the House just how ridiculous can be the arguments put forward by persons who seem to have no real interest in trying to make this Bill the best we can make it.  We shall try to do the best we can.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Then we had some more rather illogical arguments and conclusions.  Senator Donegan excelled himself, I thought, in his last argument, when he talked about the small man with the truck being obliged, if he wished, to engage in the new container traffic, to instal costly machinery for loading the container into the truck.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That, I must admit, is the latest argument.  I must say it is an original one, but I am afraid that, like many of the other arguments, it is not a very telling one, so far as this Bill is concerned.  Senator L'Estrange quoted me.  There is a possibility that he may have quoted the Minister for Transport and Power but I took it that it was the Minister for Local Government he was quoting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all I wanted to know.  I have not the record before me now, but without any check on that quotation whatever, there is no doubt that it has been taken so completely out of its context that it could scarcely be other than deliberate.  It was absolutely and completely irrelevant in the manner in which it was used.  I would ask the Senator for his own <Col N="805" /> edification to read a little before and after the quotation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator L'Estrange started off to sum up.  There were three points which this Bill really brought to the forefront, according to him.  The first was that we counteracted the decisions of the courts.  I think, in my opening speech, I pointed out that we were not in any way contemplating counteracting the courts' decisions in so far as the cases with which they have been dealing or which have arisen under the existing law are concerned.</P>
      <P>The second point was that it would add £100,000 to the &ldquo;kitty.&rdquo;  Again, I want to refute <i>in toto</i> that assertion by Senator L'Estrange and to say that it is designed to ensure that the £100,000, if it does amount to £100,000, will not be taken from our Road Fund so that it may get back into a good healthy state and so enable us to bring our roads up and keep them in a proper state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Manna from Heaven.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Not quite, but it is very necessary, just the same.  The third point made was that it was designed to drive private lorry owners off the roads, the implication there, of course, being that the private lorry owners were the offenders in this matter of evasion of tax.  I do not agree with Senator L'Estrange that they had a monopoly of this offence.  In fact, I should rather be inclined to think that they did not have any such monopoly and that while within their ranks, there may have been those who did not <Col N="806" /> conform to our taxing code, there would be no greater proportion of them in that section of the community than among any other of the vehicle owners who might be concerned.</P>
      <P>Many of the private lorry owners who particularly use their lorries or trucks possibly for the carriage of farm produce, market garden produce or such like, take their cattle to and from the markets or fairs.  Their trucks, in the main, are not of the largest variety that we now see so much of on the roads.  As such, the impact, if any, will be proportionately less than it will be on the bigger trucks, if these people have been evading the law.  In a case where they have not been evading the law, no impost of any size or dimension will fall upon them.</P>
      <P>There was a very strong plea made by the Senator, with many little heartrending strings attached, that the whole trouble with us here was that we did not do something to improve our road traffic legislation.  Regardless of how that came into the House to be discussed as any part of this measure, I want to assure the House that steps are in fact being taken and the White Paper outlining what we hope to do, provided the public want it and the two Houses of the Oireachtas want it, will be in evidence within the next week.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Sullivan made a very special plea for the 10 cwt. pick-up truck.  I have not got the unladen weight of a 10 cwt. pick-up truck here, but I think it will be of some use to the Senator to hear the following table that applies to this small weighted vehicle.  If it is under 12 cwts. unladen weight, the tax is £15; if it is between 12 cwt. and 16 cwt. unladen; it is £20.  I think it is within that weight range that the 10 cwt. pick-up truck falls, but I am not quite sure. If, as I have said of all the others, it is within that category the 10 cwt. pick-up truck falls and if the owner has in the past been using creels or any sort of attachment for which he has been paying his proper amount in road tax, then nothing will be added to the £20.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, if his pick-up truck is 17 cwt. and he puts on these small light creels which are quite <Col N="807" /> common on the little pick-ups, the chances that they will exceed the ton, which is the next measure taken, are quite remote.  Because of the smallness of the creel and the light construction, I do not think they would run beyond 2½ cwts. or 3 cwts.  If his vehicle at the moment is just over 12 cwts, he could add anything up to 3 cwts. or almost 4 cwts. and it would still not alter his tax, even if he had not been conforming with the law in the past.  If it is 16½ cwts., he can add 3½ cwts. almost and it will not alter the, tax he will now pay on the 16½ cwts.  From a ton to 2 tons, weight unladen, the tax is £30.</P>
    <P>I have, not got the actual category into which the 10-cwt. pick-up truck falls but it is somewhere within the range I have mentioned.  If a person had been paying his proper tax in the past, nothing whatever will be added to his tax.  If he is just above the 12-cwt. or 16-cwt., he still has 4 cwts. to play around with in the addition of these creels without additional taxation. I think Senator O'Sullivan may have been misinformed as to the impact this could possibly have on the farmers who own these small vehicles.</P>

      <P>That would not lighten his burden.  I recommend this measure to the House.  I want to restate and reiterate fully with as much emphasis as I can command that the Bill and the Financial Resolution which preceded it through the Dáil were brought forward purely and simply for the reason that a leakage had developed a short while ago in the Road Fund and it was likely to increase in the future to the possible tune of from £50,000 to £100,000.  The Road Fund could not afford that sort of leak.  We hope that by stopping the leak, the Road Fund will continue to show healthy signs in the future so that we in turn from that Fund can distribute to our local authorities money by way of grant in sufficient quantities to enable our roads to be made better, safer and more economical for use by the vehicle owners who are contributing this money in road tax.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>Bill considered in Committee.</P>
      <P>Section 1 agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 deals with the addition of a body, a part, a fitting and a receptacle.  The additional tax will be paid on the additional weight of this receptacle, body, part and so forth.  This is the major point I made when speaking on the Second Stage. The Minister carefully avoided that because it is the kernel of the whole Bill.  I said that a lorry taxed at 3 tons could prudently carry a load of 6 tons. The Minister understands what I want to get at.  I never mentioned C.I.E. The point I made was that a lorry which is taxed at 3 tons can prudently carry about twice its weight and that any container, creel, body or part will <Col N="809" /> reduce the maximum carrying capacity of the lorry.  If the maximum capacity of the lorry is 6 tons and you put 5 tons weight of a container on that lorry, it will be able to carry only 2 tons of goods.  That lorry will carry an enormous tax.</P>
      <P>The Minister studiously avoided that point which is the whole kernel of the Bill.  He spoke about tax evasion. I felt we were getting almost a lecture on good citizenship.  There is neither justice nor equity in a section which states that a man, by putting on a container, will have the maximum carrying capacity of his vehicle reduced.</P>
      <P>I am talking about private business. I think the Government should be well aware of the fact.  People are being encouraged to handle goods in the modern way.  We speak about packaging and the mechanical handling of goods.  Everything in the modern set-up is being carried in some form of container.  Salt for factories is being dry pumped from the salt works into containers.  That container may weigh, as Senator Donegan said, 13 cwt.  It reduces the carrying capacity of the truck.</P>
      <P>I mentioned a case where the tax would be increased from £78 to £126. I do not think the people concerned had any desire to start any form of evasion.  Neither do I think that the creameries which have a crane at the filling end for their milk cans and another crane at the other side are anxious to attempt evasion.  If the creameries can provide a crane to lift the full milk cans on to the trucks and provide another crane at the other end to lift off the full milk cans, they will not be guilty of any evasion.  The whole thing does not add up and make sense and the Minister has not answered this point which is the whole basis of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister wanted more money for the Road Fund, if he wanted to add one, two or three per cent. or whatever is required to give him the correct amount of money, instead of bringing in a Bill which is bristling with absurdities and injustices and which will impede the handling of all sorts of goods, he should have done it in a modern way.  This Bill relates to the time when a man with a red <Col N="810" /> flag had to walk in front of lorries and other road vehicles.  Instead of trying to continue on the basis of that legislation, a new Bill should have been brought in to deal with the situation in a proper, modern and realistic manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has talked about absurdities.  One of the reasons I studiously avoided the case made by the Senator in regard to this question of the reduction of the carrying capacity of trucks with certain containers and appliances was that I felt the case made was ridiculous.  Now that I have been prompted into the belief that it may not be ridiculous, or may still be held not to be ridiculous, let me put to the House how it strikes me.</P>
      <P>It was said earlier that the additional weight of creels reduced the carrying capacity of the vehicle.  It was further said that six-ton sheep trucks with creels would be able to carry fewer sheep.  I wonder would the Senator think of trying to carry sheep without creels and see how many he would carry.  What is the point? Are the creels not for the transport of the sheep?  If there were no creels on the truck, the sheep could not be carried.  Far from reducing the carrying capacity of the truck, the creels make it possible to carry sheep and without the creels, they could not be carried, unless they were trained sheep or sheep from a circus, capable of piling up and hanging on by themselves.</P>

      <P>I could tell the Minister a little more about milking sheep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator knows which side to milk a sheep from, I take it.  If the suggestion is that a three-ton unladen weight truck could carry six tons and that a container added would reduce the maximum carrying capacity, I entirely agree with it.  I am sure Senator Donegan is well aware&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>A three-ton or thereabouts, unladen truck, is usually operated as a 5/7-ton truck and nine times out of ten, if it is so desired, up to ten tons can, and have been, carried <Col N="811" /> on such trucks.  It is not the truck I would advocate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I used the word &ldquo;prudently.&rdquo; Otherwise, you would have no tyres or back axles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator would be over-prudent if he had a three ton unladen weight lorry which would normally carry six tons but which, with a one ton weight container, carried only five tons.  That would be more than highly imprudent; it would be bordering on the ridiculous.</P>
      <P>In so far as the approach to this question of transport is concerned, let me put this question in answer to all the cases that can be, have been and will be made, with regard to the decreasing of the carrying capacity of the truck by adding a container, a creel or an attachment.  Why are these containers, creels or additions put on, if the effect is to render that truck less attractive from the carrying capacity or economic point of view?  Why should they put them on?  Why do the owners put them on, if they are in fact a disadvantage?  That really is the answer to the cases made with regard to this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister talked a lot about the three tons and the six tons.  I agree that in the case of a truck with an ordinary body weight of three tons or three tons, five cwts., normally, the trailer on such a truck will be 10 tons, but these figures do not enter into the matter at all.  The point is that if the carrying capacity of that truck is 10 tons and a container weighing 13 cwts. is added then in fact the carrying capacity, the payload is reduced to about 8½ tons.  The Minister agrees with me on that.  If that three ton five cwt. truck carries 10 tons of payload material and if a 13 cwt. container is added, the effect on the road is the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I wanted to be biting about the matter, I could tell the Minister that it was none of his business whether the container was payloaded or not.  If a man is paying for 10 ton capacity and if he chooses to use a container, that is his own business.  The Minister has <Col N="812" /> stepped outside what is the realm of his business and has entered the realm of the lorry owner's business.  Of course, he is seeking to get extra taxation for extra container weight which reduces the pay-load.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister could tell me if a cover on a truck to protect goods and merchandise against the weather, which is not normally part of the vehicle, will be regarded as part of the vehicle for taxation purposes?  I do not know if the Minister is prepared to state if the cover will be so regarded but I suggest to him that it would be unfair to regard a cover on an open vehicle as part of the vehicle for taxation purposes, in view of the fact that it would be necessary only in inclement weather.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister when he says that trucks of an unladen weight of three tons are asked and made to carry weights up to 10 tons.  I have received information from the Leitrim County Council and the county engineer that the Leitrim roads are broken up by the continuous traffic of the Donegal trucks from Malin Head. They are travelling on roads which were not designed to carry the volume of traffic they are being asked to carry since the closing of the railways.  I want to tell the Minister that he will hear much about the damage that is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is the maximum weight on the wheels that is the criterion in this matter.  There has been much talk about damage to the roads and the Minister spoke about creels for the purpose of carrying sheep.  These 5/7 ton trucks carry about 80 sheep and they have to use creels and decking for that purpose. The total weight of the sheep will be about four tons and the creels and decking will be one ton, which is a far jump from the 9/10 tons mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not answer the question about the county councils and what the position of a vehicle with a tar pot would be.  For the five or six months of the year in which they <Col N="813" /> would be operating the tax would increase from £78 to £126 and they would not be doing any damage to the roads.  I feel that no case has been made for not recasting the whole of this measure and bringing in a system of charging for the weight on the wheels of the lorries which are using and destroying the roads, rather than creating a lot of inequities and encouraging people to seek to evade the law.  We should make good laws and people would not want to evade them.  There is a Bill going through the other House, the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, and everyone in the country knows that when it is enacted, it will be evaded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I say very briefly in reply to Senator Burke that this Bill is introduced to remove the inequities existing in the present law and it will do that, we sincerely hope, in that there will be one law for all and we hope it will be possible so to administer it.  In so far as the wheels question is concerned, I did not mention the matter of the local authorities, and the adding of a tar pot, as he described it, to a truck that has the effect of bringing its tax from £78 to £126.  If this truck with the tar pot was in fact in existence in the past, it should have been paying what is now claimed.  It should have been paying £126, if £126 is the proper duty to-day.  To that local authority, might I say they should not have made such a mistake?  Excuses could be advanced for the ordinary individual, but for a <Col N="814" /> local authority, there is no such excuse, not even of ignorance of the law, because the Tax Office administers these laws in the application to the various vehicles of the tax disc which is rightly theirs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Burke also said something about using this truck with a tar pot on it for only six months.  That can give rise to a rebate. Where a container attached to a machine is used for only part of the year, it is possible and will be possible under regulations which we hope to make and have promised to make, to relieve the tax for the part of the year during which the container actually is not attached to the lorry or in use.</P>
      <P>Very little new was raised.  Senator O'Reilly asked whether covers used on a truck would be included in the weight for taxation purposes.  Senator O'Reilly can be quite happy in the knowledge that these covers are definitely not included in the unladen weight or weighing of any such truck.</P>
