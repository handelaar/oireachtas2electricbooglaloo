      <P>Go ndéanfar, faoi réir chomhthoiliú na Dála, Coiste an tSeanaid um Nós Imeachta agus Pribhléidí a chónascadh le Coiste na Dála um Nós Imeachta agus, Pribhléidí chun breithniú a dhéanamh i dtaobh scéim pinsean ranníocach do chomhaltaí den Oireachtas faoi alt 6A d'Acht an Oireachtais (Liúntais do Chomhaltaí), 1938 (alt a cuireadh isteach le halt 5 den Acht um an Oireachtas (Liúntais do Chomhaltaí) agus Oifigí Aireachta agus Parlaiminte (Leasú), 1960) agus, más cuí leis an gComhchoiste é, faoi réir an choinníll nach gcuirfear aon mhuirear ar chistí poiblí dá chionn sin, scéim dá samhail a dhéanamh.</P>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That, subject to the concurrence of the Dáil, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of the Seanad be joined with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of the Dáil to consider the matter of a scheme for contributory pensions for members of the Oireachtas under section 6A of the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) Act, 1938 (inserted by section 5 of the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices (Amendment) Act, 1960) and, if the Joint Committee so thinks fit, subject to the proviso that no charge on public funds may be imposed thereby, to make such a scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As members are aware, the question of a scheme of pensions for members has been under consideration by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges <Col N="124" /> of both Houses for some time and a tentative scheme has been prepared. This motion is necessary to meet the statutory requirements.  Members will note that the terms of reference provide that no charge may be imposed on public funds.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Ordered: That a message be sent to the Dáil accordingly.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Local Government (No. 2) Bill, 1960:" RHead="Second Stage">
    <Title>Local Government (No. 2) Bill, 1960: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is almost wholly procedural.  In its main provisions, it proposes to improve and simplify procedures relating to the raising of money for local capital projects and to the compulsory acquisition of land by local authorities for the purposes of their powers and duties.</P>
      <P>In Part I of the Bill, the definition of &ldquo;appropriate Minister&rdquo; will have the effect that control of borrowing, lending or compulsory land acquisition will be exercised by the Minister charged with the supervision of the functions of the local authority to which the particular borrowing, lending or acquisition relates, or, in the case of a project involving more than one Minister, the Minister for Local Government, if he is concerned, and in other cases the Minister having the major interest in the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part II represents a considerable measure of consolidation combined with amendment of the existing law. It will substitute a few simple statutory provisions relating to borrowing and lending for the numerous and complex enactments, spread over more than sixty statutes, dealing with the control of these functions.  Among the proposals is one to remove the remaining statutory limitations on borrowing, in the realisation that the effective control of local indebtedness must be exercised by Ministers in the light of national economic and social policies, rather than by rigid statutory <Col N="125" /> limits which may have become out-of-date. Statutory limits have never proved either effective or useful, and have already been discarded for a wide range of services.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the making by the Minister for Local Government of general regulations relating to borrowing.  It also introduces some new provisions which should prove of value.  Among these may be mentioned the power to de-control certain borrowings by Ministerial directions, that is, to exempt them from the need for specific Ministerial sanction.  Local authorities are also being empowered to borrow on behalf of the other local authorities.  Contributions towards loan charges, which is the form taken by Exchequer assistance to local authority housing and some other services, may moreover, under the Bill, be paid direct by the Department concerned to the lenders.  Since the lenders are in the majority of cases the Commissioners of Public Works, this provision should enable a greatly simplified procedure to be introduced in relation to the subsidising of loan repayments.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that this Part of the Bill does not affect the purposes for which local authorities may borrow money.  A decision to raise a particular loan is taken in the light of local needs whether they be housing, health, sanitary services, bridges or any other local authority service.  The Bill merely provides a better mechanism for the implementation of decisions to borrow already taken on the merits of the projects in question.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill is concerned mainly with the procedure for the compulsory acquisition of land.  It also seeks to clarify the powers of local authorities to provide office accommodation for their staffs.</P>
    <P>The principal object of this Part is to substitute what is known as compulsory purchase order procedure for provisional orders in the acquisition of land for certain services.  At present, land may be acquired by compulsory purchase order for housing purposes, health services, public assistance and mental hospitals.  These powers of compulsory acquisition extend to the <Col N="126" /> provision of office accommodation for local staffs engaged on these services. Land may also be acquired compulsorily for sanitary services, roads, bridges, the fire service and certain other purposes, including the provision of offices and places of meeting for the local authorities concerned with these services, but in these cases the procedure to be employed is known as the provisional order procedure.  What the Bill proposes to do is to extend compulsory purchase order procedure to all those services for which land may now be acquired compusorily by way of provisional orders.  The principle of compulsory acquisition of land is not being extended to any new services or purposes.  Section 10 of the Bill merely provides that where a compulsory power of acquisition of land already exists it may be exercised by means of a compulsory purchase order.</P>
    <P>Some local authorities, and in particular the Dublin Corporation, have been faced with the problem of what to do when they wish to acquire land compulsorily for two or more purposes, where the compulsory acquisition procedure for one of those purposes is by provisional order and for the other of those purposes by compulsory purchase order.  In such cases the Bill provides that compulsory purchase procedure should apply.</P>
    <P>Apart from the legal difficulty in regard to acquisition for multiple purposes involving two different procedures, it is generally desirable that in matters of administrative procedure, uniformity and simplicity should replace diversity and complexity. There are no good reasons why two procedures should exist side by side for purposes which are of equal public importance.  Land required for a dispensary may be acquired by compulsory purchase order, while land for a reservoir or fire station or a bridge must be acquired by provisional order.  Land for offices for staff engaged on health services may be acquired by compulsory purchase order, while a site for offices for, say, engineers engaged on road works, would have to be acquired by provisional order in default of agreement.</P>
    <P>In view of the considerations <Col N="127" /> favouring the adoption of a single procedure, the Bill proposes that compulsory purchase order procedure should apply generally.</P>
    <P>Provisional order procedure is more cumbersome, and involves everybody concerned in more procedural steps than are really necessary for the proper consideration and protection of all the interests involved.</P>
    <P>It involves public advertisement of the proposal, service of notice, in a succeeding month on all affected interests, a petition to the Minister, a public inquiry by the Minister, unless all served with notice have signified assent to the local authority's proposal, public notice by the Minister before making the provisional order, followed by advertisement of that order by the local authority, with five weeks allowed for appeals, either to the Minister or the Circuit Court. Finally the Minister must give further public notice before proceeding to confirm the provisional order.</P>
    <P>Compulsory purchase order procedure involves the making of a compulsory purchase order by the local authority concerned, advertisement and invitation of objections, public local inquiry, ordered by the Minister, to consider any valid objections received, and rejection or confirmation of the order by the Minister after considering the report of the inquiry.  Any person aggrieved by the confirmation of an order may appeal to the High Court on a point of law.</P>
    <P>The substitution of compulsory purchase orders for provisional orders will not therefore weigh the scales against property owners and in favour of local authorities.  It will merely enable the issues to be sorted out, dealt with and decided as speedily as may be consistent with equitable treatment for all concerned.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions of the Bill are of a minor nature.  Section 11 of the Bill will clarify the position in relation to land acquisition for office purposes.  Section 12 confers certain ancillary powers where one local authority performs functions on behalf of another.  Section 13 confers a power <Col N="128" /> of entry on land to determine its suitability for a particular purpose of the local authority, prior to initiating arrangements for acquisition.  It contains due safeguards for the owners, including compensation for any damage that may be caused.  Section 14 will enable county councils to increase their contributions towards the expenses of the County Councils General Council, if they wish to do so.</P>
    <P>Senators will have seen, from what I have stated, that the Bill is almost wholly procedural, or technical; it is directed towards the machinery, rather than the substance of local government. I have no doubt that, with the help of the Bill, this machinery will function with greater smoothness, and that the Bill will facilitate local authorities in the discharge of their business.  I therefore commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>When I read this Bill before coming here I confess that I was perturbed by some of the provisions in Part III, the &ldquo;miscellaneous&rdquo; section.  It looked to me as if the safeguards against unjustly penalising landowners were not strong enough.  Now the Minister has assured us, and I welcome his assurance, that these safeguards are not being weakened.  There is a risk when we are giving extra powers to the county councils that these powers may sometimes be abused, just as our own parliamentary powers occasionally may be abused.  I have reason to say that in the light of two recent incidents in which these powers have been abused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, we have seen in the newspapers and elsewhere references to the recent building on the main lake of Killarney.  The local authority gave permission to people from another country to put these large and spectacular buildings right on the lake shore.  There was considerable local indignation&mdash;justifiable, to my mind, for I inspected the site&mdash;and yet nothing could be done.  The shore of the lake had been protected as a beauty spot for many years.  Then suddenly the local residents' view there was handed over not to Irish people <Col N="129" /> but to people from another country. The result is that the scenic value of these lakes has been impaired.  That is one example of the wrong use of powers of granting or acquiring land.</P>
    <P>There is another example which ought to be referred to, in Westport. An estate there was developed for local housing in such a way as very much to damage the amenities of that estate.  Although the owner of the estate protested and did his best, he was overruled.  I know that there are clashes of interest here, and naturally in this country the instinct is to support the small holder or the poorer man against the landlord or property owner.  That is a perfectly natural historic tendency, but we are beginning to realise that if we allow powers of this kind to damage places of great beauty which have been preserved in a civilised way for many hundreds of years, we are ultimately damaging the nation. If you destroy the appearance of a fine estate, it can never be restored.  Our tourist board wants to send tourists from other countries to see these places, so the country is going to lose if these local powers have been abused.</P>
    <P>It seems to me also that if we give too great powers to the county councils and other local authorities, occasionally there is a risk, and a greater risk than in a parliament, of vindictive action.  However, the Minister has assured us that the safeguards against rash or unjust acquisitions have not been weakened.  But I should like further assurance.  As one reads the Bill, it almost looks as if, should a local group decide that such and such a person deserves to be punished, they can say: &ldquo;We want your house for a building site.&rdquo;  It could happen through ill feeling in a country town if a clique got control of the county council.  I know there are many county councillors here and they do not like what I am saying, but we have to face this risk.  Such a thing can be done in a small area when it cannot be done in the national Parliament. People could decide to use their powers to punish a certain individual in the district, and one of the best ways would be to move him out of <Col N="130" /> the house he has been living in for perhaps two or three generations.</P>
    <P>I should like an assurance as to whether the Minister ultimately or the High Court can protect that person in circumstances of that kind.  I remember Senator McGuire some years ago saying a very significant thing in this House&mdash;he has said many significant things&mdash;that we were giving such strong powers in this country by Act of Parliament, such strong powers of compulsory acquisition, that if a hostile communistic government were to take over, they would not have any need to bring in a further single Act of Parliament, since all the powers are there, if misused.  We want an assurance on this Bill that such powers as we are giving will be ultimately under the control of the Minister and of the Oireachtas, because we can see in the papers from time to time that in local government things can be done which could not be done in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Committee rather than a Second Reading Bill.  It is a Bill which needs much examination. I am glad that Senator Stanford has looked at the problem of protecting the people from powers that may be abused for misused, whether they be used by bureaucrats or by malicious or uninformed county councillors.  I should be much more inclined to believe that county councillors were uninformed rather than malicious. They would be guided in large measure by their managers and leading officials.  I sometimes wonder are their managers and leading officials as wise, in the wide context of the word, as they ought to be.  Do they see where they are going in regard to the building up of debt?  That is one of the matters we can deal with by amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is giving far wider powers to local authorities with regard to borrowing for purposes for which it was not so easy to borrow in the past.  In fact, the building of county council offices and other amenities would look very well, but there is undoubtedly in public affairs a certain amount of what is known on the other side of the water as &ldquo;log <Col N="131" /> rolling.&rdquo;  It might be a great advantage to a town to have large county council offices built in that it would give an amount of short-term employment but the expenditure will go on the rates.</P>
    <P>I should also like to suggest that when these inquiries are being held, they should be conducted by someone trained in the law, such as a district justice, an acting circuit court judge, or some person of that rank. With regard to these inquiries, I feel that the men who are trained as officials in the Department of Local Government are meeting the managers and are all speaking the same language. One gets the impression that dog does not eat dog.  The same thing applies to the selection boards. Generally, the farmers have to pay the men who are appointed, but it would be rank heresy to suggest the Minister should put a few farmers on those boards, most of which are stacked with officials.  It is the common view that they are overburdened by the official view.  If some one with some legal experience were on these boards, some fresh air might be let in, and a new approach might be found, because they would have a more liberal and less restricted view of what was required.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I wish to say that there is too much legislation by reference in this Bill as there is in most of the Bills which come before us.  Some years ago, a committee was set up of which I was a member.  I think Senator Fitzsimons and one or two other members of this House sat on that committee.  We met every other week, I think, for about 12 months and tried to codify the law.  A great deal of codification is necessary with regard to the borrowing powers of the county councils.  I suggest to the Minister&mdash;he cannot do it in this Bill &mdash;that he should have the position examined with a view to setting up a committee of both Houses to deal with the question of bringing some order into methods of borrowing and other local government affairs.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to say anything further on this measure at the <Col N="132" /> moment.  It may be necessary to put down some amendments on Committee Stage, if not to amend the Bill, at least to seek further information on specific points from the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill appears to be necessary in some respects and, as the Minister says, it will probably do a good deal of streamlining.  I am not at all too sure that streamlining as an objective is altogether desirable, particularly when it relates to the rights of individual citizens and to property owners.  Senator Stanford derived some comfort from the assurance given by the Minister that the rights of property owners will be protected. I must confess that I do not derive any such comfort from any assurance given by any Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because this Bill will be passed into law and the Minister will know very little about it afterwards.  If the matter were for determination by him, his assurance might be of some value or if it were his business from day to day to deal with the matters dealt with in the Bill, but once the Minister has given a general direction, I am afraid that is the end of the assurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Standford Professor Standford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Standford</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did say there were legal safeguards. He made that clear.  It was not his opinion but it was the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to the legal safeguards and when we examine them, I think we shall find they are very trifling indeed.  I notice again one of the protections that is incorporated in every piece of legislation that comes before the House&mdash;the usual one dealing with the laying of regulations before each House of the Oireachtas.  Frankly, it sometimes amazes me that this House, which has so little power in some respects, does not seize upon its right to examine and criticise regulations which are laid before it and that it does not have a committee or a sub-committee of the House as a subsidiary Parliament, to deal with subsidiary legislation.  The sooner Seanad Éireann realises that <Col N="133" /> when it passes a law containing provisions it has a right to review and indeed to annul regulations, and it makes adequate provision for the exercise of that right, the better.</P>
      <P>The borrowing authority of the local authorities will be subject to regulations to be made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance and when regulations are laid before either House of the Oireachtas, we all lay our hands on our hearts and say that the control of Parliament is being maintained.  In fact the control of Parliament does not exist, because, I regret to say, so far as this House is concerned, we are not sufficiently alert to examine these regulations to see whether in fact they should be annulled or modified in some way.  I hope that, at some future date, before this House ceases to be a House of the Oireachtas, that is, before the next general election, we will take some steps to see that these regulations are critically examined by some committee analogous to the Statutory Instruments Committee.</P>
      <P>The Minister was not very specific about the extension of the compulsory powers of acquisition and as to what the object in mind was.  The powers of acquiring land for the building of public offices and the provision of halls by local authorities are clear, but I am not clear as to when the special circumstances contained in subsection (1) of Section 10 will be used.  In far too many towns and villages, there are inadequate playground facilities for the children, and if the local authorities were to use those powers for the provisions of playgrounds, that would be very desirable and I would go a great distance in giving the necessary powers to provide such facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not at all sure about the legal safeguards contained in the Bill with regard to a variety of matters, one of which is the extinguishing of public rights of way merely by a decision of the local authority confirmed by order, presumably made by the Minister.  A right of way generally means a short cut, and in the case of old or infirm people, it might be a great hardship if it were taken away.  Is there any provision in mind whereby some other <Col N="134" /> short cut will be provided by the local authority on the extinguishing of a right of way?</P>
    <P>On occasion it may be inconvenient for a local authority to have a right of way through a property it requires. That inconvenience had to be borne by private builders when acquiring property from time to time.  They had either to maintain the public right of way or provide some substitute which eventually became acceptable to the people.  I wonder has the Minister in mind that the local authorities will maintain existing public rights of way as far as that can be done?  The Minister has not given any indication as to what will happen in that regard.  I grant the matter is one to be dealt with on Committee Stage, but we may avoid unnecessary amendments if we are given some indication by the Minister as to what the policy will be.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides power for local authorities to inspect lands and as a piece of drafting, it strikes me as being odd that the section which not alone provides power to inspect land but also provides very necessary safeguards for the very necessary sections dealing with compensation for damage done in the course of an inspection and compensation to the owners of property for acquisition, should be included under the marginal note:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Power of local authority to inspect land.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It would seem to me that in the ordinary course of events, one would expect to find this compensation for damage or for compulsory acquisition in a separate section.</P>
    <P>It may be indicative of the outlook on this matter, but it strikes me as odd that the district court is used for the purpose of fixing the amount of compensation in default of agreement where land is acquired, but if the amount happens to be over the district court jurisdiction, £50, then the whole costly machinery of the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, is brought into operation.</P>
    <P>The reason for that is clear.  I referred to it on the Oils and Minerals <Col N="135" /> Act when it was passing through the House.  The Land Acquisition Act of 1919 gives to the owners of land far less compensation than they would get if they went into court.  I made that case so strongly at the time that I have the clearest recollection that Senator Stanford, who, I think, heard it for the first time, was so impressed that he thought the Minister should have another look at the matter.  I regard this as a mischievous derogation of the rights of property owners that in the case of land, where the value claimed is under £50, then the district court is all right but where the land is more valuable and likely to be more costly to the local authority, then you use the tribunal which is bound to provide a lower price than would be fixed if the Circuit Court or the High Court, as the case may be, were asked to determine it.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the reason why all this costly machinery of the arbitrator under this Act should be brought into action when the courts are there to do justice between a local authority and a private individual.  It is significant also that in relation to damage done in the course of inspection for the purpose of acquisition the court is the ordinary court of competent jurisdiction, which means £50, £600 and above £600.  If damage is done to the extent of, say, between £50 and £600, you can go to the Circuit Court to assess the damage, but if you want to have the value of your land assessed, you go to this Phoenix-like institution, the arbitrator under the Land Acquisition Act, 1919.  Some explanation should be forthcoming as to why there is that difference.  I do not think there is any good reason except that, in my view, it is designed principally to give the small farmer, or the landowner, or even the big landowner less compensation than he would get if he went to the ordinary courts.</P>
    <P>I notice that the inspector of the local authority, having served notice on the landowner that he intends to inspect the lands, may not be restrained and if he is obstructed, the person so obstructing him is liable to <Col N="136" /> a fine.  There is provision, however, for compensation for damage done to growing crops or anything else that may be on the land.  I know of people who have suffered quite severe hardship where Electricity Supply Board people went into fields of corn and I hope in the exercise of these powers, local authority officials will carry out these inspections with the minimum of inconvenience.  It has been my experience that where damage is done to growing crops, the people concerned never get adequate recompense for all their loss and annoyance, even in a court of justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, when concluding his statement, said that this Bill was more concerned with the machinery of local government than with the format of local government. It is on that particular aspect that I wish to speak.  I do not speak as a person with experience in local government. I am not a member of a local authority and my only experience of local government or local authorities is from the receiving end, or the customer's end, if I might call it such.  From the experience I have had, I feel there is need to improve the efficiency of local government and of the local authorities.  It could be that the attitude of the people dealing with the customers of local authorities is affected by the lack of facilities.  On the other hand, it might be affected by the attitude that the people approaching local authorities are regarded as the poorer section of the community, coming with their caps in their hands and not coming with rights they certainly have.  Most of us have had the experience of dealing with local authorities in regard to the payment of rates or the payment of housing loans, and from the attitude adopted, it strikes me that the reception you get is completely different from what you would get if you walked into an ordinary business as an ordinary customer.  The attitude is all wrong.  As I said, it could be that the facilities available to the staff are not adequate and the Bill sets out to give the local authorities more power to acquire land and to provide office buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="137" /> The other experience I have of local government is in relation to the services provided by local authorities under various Acts, such as the Health Act and the dental treatment provided and such matters as dispensary services.  I am aghast at the way the ordinary people are treated by some of the people concerned when they go for services to which they are entitled.  The people, no matter if they are rich or poor, are going for what they are entitled to and for what they pay.  I think the attitude that because people who come from the poorer sections are going there as beggars is all wrong. In fact, these people, as Senators will realise, are helping to pay the rates in their own small way in the rents they have to pay to local authorities.  The rates affect them as well as everybody else.  The rates would affect them more if they were better off and were able to live in better accommodation.</P>
    <P>They are in a sense ratepayers.  They are entitled to be treated properly and certainly entitled to be treated as human beings.  There is too much of this attitude.  Perhaps, it is related to lack of facilities but sometimes it is related to the idea that these people are regarded more as paupers than as people entitled to services and entitled to a decent reception and treatment.</P>
    <P>I hope that the efficiency of the local authority machinery for dealing with people going for services, going with their custom, in other words, will be improved.  I feel from the little experience I have that there is need for that improved and increased efficiency which we are told we must have throughout the economy.  I think that local authority services could equally have regard to that aspect of the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this Bill.  It seems, if I read it right and if I understand the Minister, to represent an attempt to simplify the workings of certain powers which it is thought wise, in the community interest, to give to local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said about the necessity for protecting the individual landowner.  One would sympathise with that, but one must realise, I think, that in such cases as the compulsory <Col N="138" /> acquisition of land, ample compensation is paid and the prime interest ought to be the community interest. These acquisitions are carried out for the sake of the common good.  I think we recognise in our modern system that the common good must take first place, and that no individual, however technically influential by reason of his ownership of property, should be allowed to place obstacles in the path of progress in local government.</P>
    <P>A lot has been said about damage to land and the unfortunate landowner who might have his land taken from him and so on.  In my experience, if such a situation arises, there is an outcry, plenty of fight, and every opportunity for the landowner to defend his case and his ownership; but no mention is made, as a rule, of the fact that in many cases the actual market value of the land to be acquired has already been increased tenfold by reason of community effort.</P>
    <P>We have seen in all the towns in Ireland where the local authority has increased the amenities, roads, drainage, and so so, the result is a rise in the money value of sites which were simply fields in the country before these amenities were brought about by community effort, and which gradually become building sites of increasing value.  You can see it all around Dublin.  It is, I would suggest, too readily accepted in our form of society that we must compensate owners, taking into account the market value, so-called, of these sites on the edges of cities, when, in fact, an enormous proportion of that market value is due to the effort not of the owner but of the community, the local authority.  In other words, a great amount of the compensation given to the owner of land represents entirely unearned increment.</P>
    <P>As we are talking about the injustice of the acquisition of land in certain circumstances, I should like to talk about the injustice of such compensation, of paying amounts grossly in excess of what has been added to the land by the owner of that land. Furthermore, and in the same connection, we have in Dublin, I think more <Col N="139" /> than is adverted to sufficiently, derelict sites all over the place.  Some of them have been acquired and not developed, but great numbers of them remain in private hands&mdash;derelict sites which have not yet been acquired&mdash;and when they are acquired by the local authorities, they will probably have a very high price paid for them in &ldquo;compensation&rdquo;. The fact that they have been derelict for years and have been of no use to the owners or the community will not be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>I should have liked the Minister perhaps under this Bill, to have shown some awareness of the merit of the system long ago suggested in this city, of rating all site values and not just buildings, because it is at present in the interest of many owners of tumbledown city property to let it tumble down, whereas if they had to pay rates on site values, it would be in their own interest to develop the sites.</P>
    <P>Looking around Dublin, we can see that all kinds of things could be done by local authorities with the help of these simplified powers, perhaps, but also with heightened imagination. Those who have seen anything of cities in Britain after the war, the bomb sites in London, for instance, are struck by the fact that even a few square yards have been transformed into beautiful gardens or havens of rest and beauty.  In Dublin, we allow them to lie derelict even where large firms are prepared to do something about them.  We remember the gasometer which appeared out of the pavement, so to speak, in front of Jacob's Factory during the war.  There is nothing on the site now and nothing is being done about it, although I understand that the local authority has persistently been approached with a view to its using its powers for the creation of real amenities for the city on this site.  I do not want to speak further on that but merely to direct attention to the necessity for this type of intelligent use of such derelict sites. I should like to wind up, therefore, with an expression of hope that the simplification in the use of the powers of local authorities granted by this <Col N="140" /> Bill will result in a more active and imaginative use of those powers by our local authorities in future.</P>

      <P>With regard to Sections 2 and 4, is a new principle more or less brought in the use of the term &ldquo;the appropriate Minister&rdquo;?  It seems to me, as a member of a local authority, that this will leave us at times in a very complicated position and will lead to a great deal of delay.  For instance, in subsection (2) of Section 2, you could get two Ministers concerned and the third Minister, the Minister for Local Government, would have to come in to make a decision.  In Section 4 we have the Minister for Local Government making arrangements for borrowing, after consultation with the Minister for Finance.  Incidentally, &ldquo;after consultation&rdquo; seems to be unnecessary. It seems to have no meaning in the Bill, a point which I mentioned previously.  If borrowing and acquisition by a local authority were left with the Department of Local Government, it would be a much more simple approach.  I can envisage the local authority trying to get a decision in a short time from possibly four different Departments.  I do not know whether it is a new principle, but surely it could much more beneficially be left completely with the Department of Local Government.</P>
      <P>I should like to support Senator O'Quigley's suggestion about adding the word &ldquo;park&rdquo; or &ldquo;playground&rdquo; in Section 10.  I do not know whether the local authority have power to acquire land adjacent to a town for a park or playground.  There was a small park in the centre of my own town but it has now been built upon. I have always thought it a great pity that it was never acquired by the local authority and kept an open space.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Stanford referred to the position in Westport.  I am familiar with that town as I go there quite often.  I think the owner offered the land in dispute to the town as a park rather than have it built on adjacent to his private house.  It is a pity other sites are not got for houses in towns where land is available quite close to <Col N="141" /> the centre of the town.  The same can be said in relation to many towns and villages.  Such plots can be a great asset when the town begins to expand. They can be used as parks, as playgrounds or even as gardens.  Therefore, I should like to see the inclusion of the word &ldquo;park&rdquo; or &ldquo;playground&rdquo; in the section.</P>
    <P>When land is acquired by a local authority for building, say, labourers cottages, it frequently happens that it is acquired and the project completed before the county councils hear very much about it.  I strongly object to the taking of plots out of the corner of a very good arable field.  I know two owners of land on which cottages were built.  They told me they did not know how it could have been avoided.  Anybody who ploughs or tills land realises that a good square field is a great asset.  In two instances, it has happened that a plot was taken out of the corner of such fields in my neighbourhood.  I must say with sorrow that, from what I see, almost 50 per cent. of the plots added to labourers cottages are left idle most of the year round.  I know of instances in County Meath where good land was taken for such purposes. Some of the persons concerned cut the hay on their portion of it and some do not even do that.  It is a pity to take good land for that purpose especially when so many three-cornered plots can be acquired.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has told us that one of the objects of this Bill is to standardise the present procedures for compulsory purchase. Apparently there are two different procedures (1) in relation to land required for housing, health, public assistance and mental hospitals and (2) in relation to land required for roads, and so on.  Now there will be one standard procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On occasions such as this, I always feel it is necessary that somebody should speak on behalf of the ordinary citizen.  In both the Dáil and this House, there is a very strong representation of county councillors.  We are aware of the good work done by the councils and the councillors. <Col N="142" /> There are certain points on which the councillors are in agreement, although there may be some slight or some strong political difference of one kind or another.  Generally, they are in agreement on housing, the widening of roads, the acquisition of land, and so on.  There is a tendency to want to get on with the job.  There may be a danger to the individual who happens to stand in the way, whether reasonably or unreasonably, because they will want to deal with him in the most expenditious way.  That raises the question of justice or injustice in the taking of property and in payment for it.</P>
    <P>As Senators have pointed out, there have been cases where land has rather arbitrarily been looked at and taken over, in so far as it may have been good agricultural land, when possibly alternative sites were available.  There is also an aesthetic consideration.  It is quite wrong and sometimes it is overlooked in this country&mdash;decreasingly so, I should say&mdash;that a certain type of building should be erected in juxtaposition with another type of residence already there.  Take for instance, a Georgian house to which is attached a beautiful estate.  It is not often realised that the community at large is very much concerned with a beautiful estate or a beautiful house. I know of cases where unsightly or unsuitable houses were erected in juxtaposition to a beautiful house with a beautiful parkland attached.</P>
    <P>There is a hangover from the days when it was felt that some people were living in luxury in big houses while others were living in squalor in small houses.  That position does not obtain today and such feelings are not justified nowadays.</P>
    <P>I have in mind a very beautiful house with a nice parkland attached. There was a proposal to erect county council houses right beside it.  When the case was brought before the county council, I am glad to say they agreed not to proceed with the scheme on that site and moved it to another site.  An interesting feature which transpired from the inquiry is that people already living alongside that beautiful house in council houses said they themselves would not like to see <Col N="143" /> council houses erected on the proposed site as they would interfere with the amenities which, living alongside that beautiful house and the parkland attached to it, they were able to enjoy. It constituted a nice green belt.  If the site were used for houses, the view from the existing council houses would be of concrete buildings rather than of a delightful wooded parkland.  That is a case where aesthetic considerations were in fact practical ones even for the people who were going to live in the county council houses.</P>
    <P>We all realise that we are living in a world where both Governments and States could be described as acquisitive, inquisitive and disposing of people's lives.  We accept that for the general good, but what we must be careful about is to see that we do not push the powers of the State too fast or too far over the rights of individuals. So long as we constantly keep in mind the importance of individual rights, at the same time, by education, if by no other way, or even by force, the individual must be made to realise that he has a duty to the general good of the community at large.  If we could only balance these two considerations one against the other, we would have an ideal State, but I suppose we shall never have an ideal State in a natural world; but if when considering acquisition orders or compulsory acquisition, we always keep these considerations in view and if somebody brings them into a debate on this subject, at least we shall always be able to hold back from unfair or unjust advances on the rights of citizens through this form of compulsory acquisition.</P>
    <P>The only matter about which I should like to ask the Minister is his statement in reply to the second Reading debate in the Dáil that in the last analysis, the old method did not give any further or greater protection to those from whom land is to be acquired than does the present more speedy form of compulsory acquisition order.  I should like to know if it gives less protection.  I hope the position of the property owner is not being worsened.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="144" /> I should like to add that in my own residence, I have had three compulsory acquisition orders on my property in the past 15 years, and in all cases I must pay tribute to the county council and the officials.  I was dealt with in a most enlightened, tactful and just manner.  For my own part, therefore, my experience of compulsory acquisition has been a very happy one.  I hope the experiences of others will be the same.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill which I hope will clear up a problem such as that of a health authority wishing to erect a dispensary on land owned by a county council, which cannot sell them the land.  Another very important point is that brought out by Senator Sheehy Skeffington regarding the acquisition and development of land and what it means to certain people in south County Dublin particularly and in certain portions of north County Dublin, where the local authority provided water and sewerage facilities.  The ordinary value of the land previous to that would be, say, £100 or £150 at the outside, but because water and sewerage facilities were provided, certain quacks whose idea was to get rich quick acquired this land and sold it at £250 per site, with a ground rent of £12 at least.  That is something the Government should not allow, for it is nothing but robbery.  I would be in favour of reasonable payment but that is ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Murphy dealt with the very important matter of the borrower, the ordinary person making an honest effort to provide his own home and get the deposit ready and then get a loan from the local authority. Great difficulties and obstacles are sometimes put in his way.  I know of one case where a person was 2/6d. below a certain figure and the manager refused him a loan, and another case where because he was 5/- over, he was refused.  Managers should have more consideration for those people.  As Senator Murphy pointed out, one would imagine they were getting something for nothing, but if they get a loan of £1,500, they repay something over £3,000, so they <Col N="145" /> ought to be treated as customers would be treated in a shop.</P>
    <P>The Bill aims at getting better office accommodation for the officials of local authorities.  I am concerned with better accommodation being provided for the people who provide their own homes by getting a loan which they repay in full, plus big interest, over the years, and who are ratepayers.  It is a shame the way they are treated.  Go into any local office and you will see them being treated as so many inferior beings.  I am sorry I have to say that, speaking as a member of a local authority for 30 years.  A woman comes in with a child in her arms at five minutes past four and is told: &ldquo;We are not taking any money after four o'clock.&rdquo;  So she has to go back the six or seven miles she has travelled and come again.  The borrower should be given more consideration.</P>
    <P>There is one important point on which I should like to appeal to the Minister and to every member listening to me, that is, that the Government should take action against certain building societies in this city which gave loans to people at, say, 6 per cent and when the people had been a year or two in the houses, increased the loan charges to 7 per cent., the result being that if they got a loan of £1,400 or £1,500, they are unexpectedly being made to pay an extra £15.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if I am, because Part II deals with the borrowing and lending of money and I should be inclined to say that the small borrower should be considered. I would make a special appeal to the Minister, though it may be outside the scope of this Bill, to take some action to ensure that during the time of repayment of a loan, the rate of interest cannot be increased.  Many of these people are now going to lose their homes through being unable to pay the extra charges.  As a public man dealing with housing for a long number of years, I feel that the action of a building society in treating its <Col N="146" /> customers in this fashion should not be tolerated in a Christian country.</P>
      <P>The point with which I am principally concerned is that the Bill must deal with exorbitant charges made for land acquired and developed by a local authority and then taken over by some of these people who want to get rich quick.  Again, I hope that when these new offices are provided, the ordinary public, the people helping to keep the officials and management in their places, will be treated with more respect than they are now receiving.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deals with a number of matters which are mainly technical and which, as other speakers have pointed out, it would be much better to discuss in Committee. Part II of the Bill is definitely open to criticism.  It gives the Minister power to do things by ministerial order which should more properly be done by legislation.</P>
      <P>I object to that procedure.  I do not blame the Minister for it.  It has been done by this Government and other Governments in the past.  As has been pointed out by Senator Stanford and other Senators, taking action by regulation rather than legislation leaves us open to certain dangers.  That should be remembered and we should guard against this procedure as we are legislating for the future.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the work of local authorities is increasing each year and indeed will increase further in the years to come.  We must have some concern for the ratepayers and for those who foot the bill.  All Governments are equally to blame in that regard.  Governments are very fond of bringing in legislation in order to get credit for it, and they then pass the baby on to the local authorities and ask the local ratepayers to foot the bill.  We all know that happens very often.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago, before we got our freedom, there was an outcry because it was costing £11 million to run the country.  If we look at the figures, we find that over £25 million is being collected in rates at the present time <Col N="147" /> and if we take in grants from the central authority for housing, health, sanitary services, etc., we find that the local authorities are now spending over £55 million per annum in this country, that is, over £1 million per week.  That is a huge sum, and it is time the Minister woke up to the burden the ratepayers are now carrying.</P>
    <P>I should like to sound a note of warning with regard to the granting of these extra powers of borrowing, powers which may be abused.  There is no doubt they will be abused by certain county councils, by irresponsible county councils, because some county councils have no respect for other people's money.  The Minister will agree that, at the present time, the total indebtedness of the county councils is something between £150 million and £160 million and that a large portion of the rates has to go each year to service that debt.  The Minister knows, I suppose, of the flight from the land and of the dwindling numbers in small villages and towns, especially in the west of Ireland.  There is no doubt that situation is contributed to by increasing rates and increasing taxation.  For example, the income of the farmer, and especially the small farmer, has dropped by 10 per cent. in the past seven years, while his rates have increased by over 20 per cent.  If incentive is given to borrow more, they will increase further in the years ahead.  That is very bad business.</P>
    <P>In 1953, the index figure for the income of farmers was 100.  It went up as high as 106 in 1957 and today it stands at a little less than 96.  That represents a 10 per cent. drop in income, while, as I said, their rates have increased by 20 per cent.  Their cost of living has increased and that probably represents another 10 or 12 per cent.  I think it only right to sound a note of warning that those people are unable to bear any further burdens. The Minister should remember that it was the last straw that broke the camel's back.</P>
    <P>There are many people who claim that a curb should be put on borrowing rather than giving the county <Col N="148" /> councils authority to borrow more money.  As I stated, a substantial portion of the rates has to be paid in bank interest.  There are many people who claim, too, that moneys lent by the banks to the local authorities for house building, hospital building, sewerage schemes, water schemes, etc., should be lent at a lower rate of interest. I do not know whether the Minister can do anything about that.</P>
    <P>As I said a few moments ago, the total indebtedness of the local authorities is in the region of £150 million or £160 million.  Once this Bill becomes law, the tendency will be to borrow more money and to increase that indebtedness. Posterity will have a difficult time when the day of reckoning comes.  The day of reckoning comes to each and every one of us, if we borrow money.  It will certainly come to our county councils in years to come and many of them may curse some of us who are on local bodies at the present time for the load we left them to carry.  If that debt has to be liquidated in the future, it can be liquidated only by increasing the rates still further.  In my opinion, there has already been a justifiable outcry against the increase that has taken place year after year in the rates collected by the local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of a local authority, my view on this Bill is that it is a sign of the times.  When Senator L'Estrange mentioned the mounting burden of rates, he was, of course, really talking about the fact that so much more is now placed as a load on the backs of the ratepayer and so much less is placed as a charge on central expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall relate that general remark to Part II, Sections 4, 5 and 6 of the Bill.  I know quite well that some machinery is necessary whereby one local authority can lend to another local authority, particularly when they are interlaced, but I can understand the worry and the fear which Senator L'Estrange has expressed.  This is merely an enabling Part whereby local authorities, who are not perhaps as responsible as the Oireachtas, can lead their people into greater expenditure. The only good thing I can say about <Col N="149" /> this Part of the Bill&mdash;and mark you, I am the first to say that something of this nature was necessary&mdash;is that the sanction of the Minister must be sought.  Sanction must be sought if the local authority is to borrow, lend or issue stock.  That really is the only justification for those sections because, in my view, that brings everything back to Oireachtas Éireann.  If that is a defence, it is the only defence I can see.</P>
    <P>When I come to Part III, Section 10, the borrowing section, I find myself in disagreement with the Bill. As a person who had experience not so long ago in relation to the acquisition of land for a road for which the Minister gave a 100 per cent. grant, I would express myself as entirely dissatisfied with the awards under the provisional orders.  I believe that the procedure for the acquisition of land is in fact expedited and accelerated if there is hanging over these people's heads, not a provisional order but a compulsory acquisition order.</P>
    <P>I think the procedure outlined by the Minister whereby there was a much longer road to travel, and many more things to be done under the provisional order where land is to be acquired for roads, bridges, sanitary services, and office accommodation, under the old situation, was a good thing because it gave an opportunity to people to voice their claims.  It gave further opportunity to people to make their case and it gave time for local feeling to develop and for people to make their case known to officials, to county managers.  Those people who under the compulsory purchase order would have to go through a lesser number of operations to get the land with that hanging over the land-owner's head, would in fact be far less likely to listen to the landowner and to seek agreement than if the only weapon that could be used were a provisional order.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford said that county councillors here would not be very pleased when he said that there was danger of a clique getting power in the county councils and doing something unjust, a clique of people with <Col N="150" /> one object in view.  I am a county councillor and I am an alderman of Drogheda like my colleague opposite, Senator Walsh, and I did not disagree with Senator Stanford.  I would draw the attention of the Seanad to the fact that except in rural areas where apparently there is still a keen interest in politics, local authority elections have been largely neglected.  One has only to look at the percentage poll in the city of Dublin, or in the cities of Waterford, Galway, Cork and Limerick, or the percentage poll in places like Drogheda, to see that the local elections there did not catch the interest of the populace.  The local elections did not produce a good poll. For that reason, the elected representatives are not really representative of the wishes of the people.  If the people have not awakened to the fact that local authorities are bodies which can exert an influence for good on their lives and do not bother to vote, then the wrong people can be elected.  In my view, Senator Stanford is quite right when he says that there is no danger in the Oireachtas of a clique taking over which would be irresponsible.  In fact, in the Oireachtas, it is true to say that the result of an election is generally indicative of the wishes of the people but I believe that in many areas the results of the local elections are not indicative of the wishes of the people.  In such a situation, any widening of powers is dangerous and I feel that Section 10 and the succeeding sections in Part III which extend the powers of the local authorities and makes office accommodation, sanitary services, roads and bridges the subjects of compulsory acquisition order is a bad thing.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the point that the old provisional order did not give any greater protection.  I do not agree, for the reason that I have already outlined. The old provisional order ensured that there was a longer period, more procedures to be gone through, and during that period cases could be made, public opinion could be sought&mdash;and everybody, even the Oireachtas, must be subject in some measure to public opinion.  For that reason, I believe the old provisional <Col N="151" /> order did give a better chance to the landowner to get a fairer compensation.</P>
    <P>I would draw attention, particularly the attention of Senator Sheehy Skeffington, to the fact that there are such people as poor landowners.  I have referred already to the acquisition of some land near where I live and my reason for saying this is merely as a contrast to the contribution made by Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  All the people concerned were poor, small farmers and in one case a man's three best fields and six paddocks were affected.  For that, he is to get £1,100.  He is a man of 70 years or thereabouts, living with his two sisters.  In my opinion, that man's livelihood has been interfered with and his future life will in fact be changed.  No recompense such as £1,100 will compensate him for the inconvenience he has been caused, with the road now passing within a few feet of his front door, on which cars travel at 70 to 80 miles per hour. The same would apply to seven or eight different holdings.  Therefore, I should like to make that case in this instance against Senator Sheehy Skeffington for the poor landowners, because, let us face it, there are plenty of them today.</P>
    <P>I always seem to be taking the side here of the person who has property, probably because I have the greatest respect for ownership of property and I feel that the only approach anyone can have to property is that it takes its chances.  If, in fact, there is what is termed over-compensation for property which was worth a small amount and is now worth a greater amount because a watermain or sewerage main has been put alongside it, then that is the chance the owner takes, just as if on the opposite side of the road, a factory building which might be regarded as obnoxious by a house-owner were erected, the owner of the property would have suffered a reduction of the value of his holding.  There is only one way we can approach property, that is, on the basis of risk value.  When a man pays his rates, he takes his chances of some operation <Col N="152" /> of the county council interfering with his future enjoyment of the property. Similarly, he takes the chance of that local authority enhancing the value of his property by some operation.</P>
    <P>I did take particular exception to a phrase used by Senator Sheehy Skeffington when he referred to &ldquo;technical&rdquo; ownership.  I want to assure him that there is no such thing as a technical ownership of property.  The laws of the State are quite clear.  There is nothing technical about it.  It is quite clear and explicit: ownership of property is direct and absolute ownership of property is direct and absolute ownership.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would say that on the Committee Stage the Opposition in the Seanad will have to examine this Bill analytically and table some amendments. I believe that while there are the obvious reasons why something in the nature of the provision in Part II, Sections 4, 5, 6, had to be made, I do not for a moment concede that the ideal was achieved.  On Committee Stage, which I hope will be somewhat delayed, I feel that the members of the Seanad in general and the Opposition in particular should look analytically and generally at this Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to say very much on this measure because my view is that it is a measure which is restricted in its nature.  Many of the things we listened to from some of the speakers were not within the scope of the Bill at all.  We had a rather comprehensive discussion on local government in connection with this measure.  One would imagine by the observations made by certain speakers here that revolutionary powers were being sought by the Minister through the medium of this measure.  Such, of course, is not the case.  All the Minister proposes to do in this case is to widen the powers local authorities already have to borrow money for the good of the community.  That is a principle that has been recognised here throughout the years.  As I said, there is nothing strange or revolutionary in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I can follow the provisions of the Bill, the Minister is giving <Col N="153" /> powers to local authorities to borrow money for certain additional services which did not come within the scope of their functions before.  I think we should have no qualms of conscience in giving local authorities these widened powers because it has been said already, if not here, elsewhere, that the members of these local authorities are responsible people.  They have a sense of responsibility to the community&mdash;a much greater sense of responsibility than many people seem to be inclined to give them credit for.</P>
    <P>An instance of that is the attitude of these local authorities when the annual estimates come up for examination and scrutiny.  These local authorities spend days and sometimes weeks going over these estimates to see where they can be pruned to keep down public expense.  They do that for the benefit of the ratepayers to whom they consider they are responsible, so that when people say that local authorities should not get powers to do this or that, they seem to lose sight of the fact that the members of the local authorities have a sense of responsibility in accordance with the importance of their position.</P>
    <P>As regards the indebtedness of local authorities to which Senators referred, no doubt the figure is rather large, but at the same time, there is another side to that picture, that is, that those people who refer to the heavy indebtedness of the local authorities should also advert to the fact that this indebtedness has been brought about because of all the improvements that have been effected all over the country.  We have roads second to none.  We have new houses all over the place, fine houses.  We have built bridges and provided other amenities that would not have been considered in bygone days.  All these things cost money.  They cannot be done without money and if there is indebtedness, there is something to show for it.  There is a corresponding result to be seen.</P>
    <P>We are living in a progressive age and if we are to keep pace with the times, we have to do many things that would not have been considered in the <Col N="154" /> past.  People nowadays, ratepayers and others, are more exacting in their demands and in their expectations than was the case some years ago. You now have very often deputations coming to county council meetings about this, that and the other thing, but sometimes the things which these deputations look for cannot be granted or cannot be done because of the lack of money or because the local authorities concerned lack the power to take the necessary action.</P>
    <P>I think Senator Sheehy Skeffington was right when he said that our most important consideration is the good of the community as a whole and if individual rights have to be abrogated sometimes for the community good, I think there is nothing wrong with that. I am in favour of this Bill.  I am prepared to support it and give the widest powers to the local authorities which the Minister has in mind.  I do not think they will abuse these powers. They have not abused them in the past.  I do not think it can be said that our local authorities have abused any powers they had in the past.  They have been careful and circumspect about the spending of public money&mdash; as careful, perhaps, as we would be ourselves.  That being so, I am supporting this Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill, which, in my view, will help to simplify matters.  Some people consider that the word &ldquo;compulsory&rdquo; will be applied drastically.  When the drive for housing, for water schemes and sewerage schemes and other such projects started, it cannot be denied that if the county councils had not compulsory powers, they would have met with obstacles at every turn.  Like Senator Ó Cíosáin, I want to see these powers used with great care.  In my experience, very few hardships have been inflicted. As far as I can recall, any property acquired for county council work was adequately compensated for.  Nobody can deny that the moment a county council became interested in land or anything else, its value went up about 500 per cent. overnight.</P>

      <P>I am glad to see this Bill.  It will help to simplify matters very much for the local authorities. I agree with what Senator Ó Cíosáin said about indebtedness.  The important thing is that we have provided housing, water, sewerage, hospitals and other services for our community. Every day, organisations such as Muintir na Tíre, the National Farmers' Association, the Irish Countrywomen's Association, and so on, come to county councils with demands for this, that and the other.  The only way the people can have these services is by paying for them and the only people who can pay for them are the ratepayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Donegan spoke about local authorities not being representative because the people did not go out to vote.  I have never heard such a statement in a democratic Assembly.  If they did not consider it worth their while to exercise the franchise, what grievance have they?  Probably they had too much contempt for the people who were going forward.  However, if there were people going forward who represented other interests or external interests, they would probably come out and vote and no doubt they would be representative of the people. If they did not exercise the franchise when they were asked to elect representatives to local authorities, they have absolutely no grievance.  The people who were elected were elected by the ballot box and can claim to <Col N="156" /> be fully-elected representatives of the people.</P>

      <P>Because this Bill does some simplifying and some tidying-up, I welcome it.  The great increase in local government expenditure over the past 20 years is attributable to two very clear causes: (1) the great extension of social services, the provision of housing and public amenities and (2) the extraordinary deterioration in the value of money.  What we could do for £1,000,000 in 1938 would cost about £2½ million now.  There is a silver lining to that inasmuch as we started the work in the intervening years with borrowed money and are now repaying with less valuable money.  The only people who suffer are those who owned the money in the first place.  We have the houses, the roads, the hospitals and the bridges.  Despite Senator Sheehy Skeffington, social revolution is being accomplished in that matter.</P>
      <P>The only point I do not like in this Bill is that it gives room to accommodate the desire of the central Government to transfer more of its functions, its spending and its activity to the shoulders of local government.  We should resist that trend; possibly we have found it impossible to do so up to this.</P>
      <P>Lack of power to stop the great increase in the cost of local government may be one reason why there has been so little interest in the recent local elections.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it is and perhaps it is not.  While there have been some excellent expositions of various cases that may arise under this Bill or under Bills in relation to such matters, there has also been quite a lot of wandering from the points we have been discussing.  That places me in somewhat of a difficulty.  A great deal of what might be called Committee discussion has taken place on the details of sections and subsections. If I were to do full justice to the points raised and reply to them in detail now, it would be tantamount to usurping the functions of this House when we reach Committee Stage. I hope not to dwell so long on these matters that have been brought up here tonight, and to leave them to the appropriate stage as the occasion arises.</P>
      <P>Senator Stanford asked in the very initial stages of the debate what are the safeguards in connection with compulsory purchase orders.  The best thing I might do is to read a prepared document giving information in that aspect so that there will be no doubt in any Senator's mind as to the actual position under the Bill when we come to the later stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Compulsory purchase orders made by the local authority, and confirmed by the Minister, are the means used to effect compulsory acquisition of land under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts.  The procedure is contained in Section 37 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1931, and the Second Schedule to that Act. A compulsory purchase order must be in the prescribed form and describe by reference to a map the land to which it applies.  Before it is submitted to the Minister, it must be published in one or more newspapers circulating within the district of the local authority; and notices must be served on every owner, lessee and occupier&mdash;except monthly or lesser tenants&mdash;of the land to which the order relates.  Two or three weeks are allowed for objecting, at the local authority's discretion.  If no objections are made to the order, or if any objections <Col N="158" /> made are withdrawn, the Minister may confirm the order without inquiry, but in any other case, unless the Minister is satisfied that the order should be annulled, a public local inquiry must be held.  After consideration of the report of the inquiry, the order may be confirmed with or without modifications.  Notice of the confirming order is published and circulated by the local authority and the order becomes operative three weeks afterwards.  There is an appeal to the High Court on points of law only.</P>
    <P>This document should give the House and opportunity of knowing the safeguards that exist for the land and property owner, lest there might be any fear that in this Bill his rights or the rights of those classes may in any way be lessened.</P>
    <P>A point was made about the building in Killarney, that because such building was allowed to take place, the values of property and the national value of Killarney lakes have been reduced, and that while there were widespread objections at the time, nothing could be done.  The situation is that in that case nothing could then be done, but for this very good reason, that the Planning Acts were not brought into force in Kerry, and when these buildings came to be put up, the permission of the local authority had not necessarily to be got, and no appeal lay to any quarter by any aggrieved party.</P>
    <P>That is the first lesson to be learned from the situation in Killarney.  The lesson has got home, because I believe since then Kerry County Council have brought the Planning Acts into operation, so that, in relation to the like happening again, the steps necessary to protect the interests of the public have now been taken, and if any such matter should in future arise in the functional area of Kerry County Council, objectors may have the right of appeal to the Minister, if they so wish.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford also asked, and the same point can be found as I read through the notes I have made of other speakers, what additional powers of acquisition were being given under this Bill.  I want to say that it confers <Col N="159" /> no additional powers.  This is the kernel of the arguments we may have here and have had in the Dáil.  We are not dealing with additional powers being conferred under this Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely pointing out that no additional powers of acquisition are being conferred on local authorities under this Bill.  The power they now have derives from an Act of 1898 which governed the method whereby compulsory acquisition may take place.  The procedure is being changed in these cases we are talking about.  Let me say again just to allay the fears of Senators who may feel that the change in procedure means a change in the powers&mdash;lest they may have fears in that direction that I cannot allay regardless of how many times I may repeat myself&mdash;that the procedure we are now seeking to have brought into being for reasons I have already enumerated is already in existence, and has been in existence since as far back as 1931, in relation to land for housing purposes, for health services, public assistance and mental hospitals; and if we are to go even further, we might also point out that land might be compulsorily acquired for office accommodation to serve the staffs for any of those purposes or services, and that it could, and can also at the present time, be acquired by the compulsory purchase order procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might put it this way, by asking a question: is there any difference between the use of compulsory purchase order procedure to acquire land to house the health services staff in a county, and acquiring land to house some of the general working staffs of the same county council?  That in fact is an analogy that is very clearly seen, that staffs of the health services can <Col N="160" /> have land compulsorily acquired, so that a building may be provided to give them office accommodation, under the compulsory purchase order procedure as at present, but objection is being taken to the same thing if we want to house their colleagues from the general county council service, on the plea that we should use the cumbersome and outdated provisional order procedure in acquiring land for such people.</P>
    <P>If we wanted to build offices for both categories together&mdash;and it might be very difficult to differentiate as to which part of the building should be, and had for all time to be, used by either of those categories; or indeed we might have three or four categories of people for multiple purposes &mdash;we had one procedure, that of compulsory purchase order, available to us on the one hand, and on the other side of the corridor in the same building, we should have provisional orders.  I cannot see where any new fears can be raised in the mind of any reasonable person approaching this matter when I put before this House the proposition that the compulsory purchase order procedure should in fact operate in all of these cases, and not just in one, two, three or four of them as it does at present.</P>
    <P>To those who feel that by virtue of a change in procedure, the power of acquisition seems to be greater I would say that I do not agree with them.  I leave the case to the House as I have put it, for consideration between now and Committee Stage.  When it comes to that stage, I think Senators will agree that it is better to have a uniform procedure in so far as it is compatible with the general good.  I see no reason which would indicate that this uniformity is in any way incompatible with the common good, and I think it is better that we should have uniformity wherever possible.  I believe it is not only possible, in this instance, but that it is very desirable.  The experience of a number of local authorities has shown&mdash;by their inability to get certain things done for office buildings which would make for better services to the public, particularly in Dublin&mdash; that the procedure under the provisional <Col N="161" /> orders is prolonged, cumbersome and faulty.</P>
    <P>There is a need for change but what I am suggesting is not new.  We are not doing something which has never before been tried.  There is no radical change.  We are, in fact, bringing these cases into line with a procedure which has existed as far back as 1931 in regard to the various services I have mentioned, and which has operated, I suppose, in thousands of cases, due to the housing drive.  This procedure has operated in the past in far more cases on housing and such matters than it is ever likely to be used for in the foreseeable future.  It has not proved to be objectionable, unconstitutional or incompatible with the general good through the years of its operation.  I put it to the House that there can be no reason why the future will show a difference.</P>
    <P>The new procedure will enable jobs to be done which up to the moment have been stultified by poor procedure and poor law.  If it means better office buildings for Dublin city, through vacating the 20 odd premises rented throughout the city and centralising the staffs, it should mean an economy and a saving on the operation of those staffs.  It should mean very greatly improved services to the community in Dublin.  It should make for an improvement when a person going to the city building, if and when it is erected, will be at the fountainhead.  At the moment he has to go from one address to another and, possibly, having spent the entire day at it, will finish in the evening still not having reached the fountainhead he wanted to reach in regard to his problem or business.</P>
    <P>It has been said&mdash;I regret that I heard it and I add my voice to the condemnation poured on it by Senator Tunney, if it is true&mdash;that public officials in corporations and county councils are inclined to treat the public, regardless of whether they are poor or rich, in an offhand way, in an insulting manner and in a manner which does not give service and courtesy to those people.  I would say immediately that I condemn that fully, and I ask members of all local authorities, <Col N="162" /> in so far as it lies within their power to do so, to ascertain if such is the case in any part of their local service and if it is, to communicate with me.  I do not know what our powers jointly would be, but I am sure that if such is the case, between us, we will be able to see that those people who are supposed to be the public servants of local authorities treat the populace, and particularly the poorer element, with the respect due to them.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke mentioned that we were giving wider powers of borrowing to local authorities and he felt the ultimate good of such widening of borrowing powers was questionable. I for one&mdash;I have said this many times but I had better say it again&mdash;believe that the local authorities are elected by the people.  I do not agree with Senator Donegan that they are not representative of the people, because they have been elected by the voters. I believe&mdash;and until the contrary is proved, I shall continue to believe&mdash; that the local authorities are composed of responsible people, who, in their actions in matters such as the spending or the borrowing of money, will have regard to the good of the people they represent.  I believe that their actions in general represent the wishes of the people who put them there. I have no fears about that and, as I say, until it is proved otherwise, I shall continue to believe that local authority members are, in the main, a conservative group rather than a group to which it would be dangerous to extend borrowing powers.  I have the fullest belief that in regard to the spending of money which will immediately or ultimately lead to an increase in the rates, the conservative view is far more likely to prevail in these elected groups of people than the radical view, or the view that you can spend all you wish and let someone else pay for it.</P>
    <P>I do not at all agree with the views expressed and apart from what I have said about the conservatism of councils in matters of finance I do not see any danger even if there is, in any sense, a widening of the borrowing powers.  In the main, these powers are <Col N="163" /> subject, and will continue to be subject, to the Minister for Local Government, who, in turn, will be in accord with the Minister for Finance, and in accord with general Government policy.  If the Government are not agreeable, the Minister for Finance cannot give money, so the Minister for Local Government has not got it, and the councils cannot avail of it. That surely is a sufficient safeguard. If it appears in the Bill that there is a widening of these powers, the general history of local authorities in their borrowing and in their approach to borrowing, added to the safeguards which I have mentioned, appears so secure that I do not think any member of this or the other House, or any member of the public need have any qualms whatsoever that wasteful and unnecessary spending of the ratepayers' money will be perpetrated by an elected representative on any council in the country.</P>
    <P>The first thing of significance&mdash;if it is of significance &mdash; which Senator O'Quigley said was that he took no comfort from any assurance by any Minister on any matter.  All I can say for the Senator is that if that is so, uneasy must rest his head every night he goes to bed.  He must accept these assurances, because otherwise he must be in a mentally strained condition for practically all of his life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely hope you do.  However, in so far as these fears of his are concerned, or rather his lack of comfort in the assurances given by me, the Senator went on to say that he believed that after regulations were made by the Minister, the Minister knew nothing about what was going on.  Sometimes as Minister, I might feel that I would like to agree with the Senator, but I can tell the Senator that in matters such as these, all Ministers of Local Government will be aware of what is going on.  It is the Minister's job to be aware of what is going on, and when it comes to a question of the rights of the individual versus the demands of a body of power, such as a corporation or county council, then, <Col N="164" /> despite the fact that a Minister might be held in many other ways to have leanings towards the local authorities, it has been my own experience, and I think the experience of all other Ministers, that the individual's right is the right which he feels he must lean towards. For some reason&mdash;I have never tried to analyse it&mdash;one feels, as a Minister, on a matter which requires adjudication and which comes before him, as do these matters of acquisition, that one's sympathy lies with the individual; one's sympathy is with the one or two people against the corporation or the corporate body.  Far from the procedure being in any way loaded against the rights of the individual, the procedure as we have been using it, and as we hope to use it in the future, has, if anything, been leaning towards the right of the individual as against the demands of any other large body.</P>
      <P>In regard to Section 13, it was suggested there was something wrong in that, up to £50, compensation claims may be dealt with by the courts, but that the same facility was not given for larger claimants, who are brought before a tribunal in order that they will not get as good a deal or as good a payment by way of compensation as would the claimant who made his claim to the courts.  The fact is, in regard to this section, that it has been brought from a previous statute, the Health Act of 1947, and by way of amendment in the Dáil, we changed one word in the whole section.  It is a very lengthy section as Senators will find when we come to it and the one word changed was the word &ldquo;twenty&rdquo; which was changed to &ldquo;fifty&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The jurisdiction in the 1947 Act of the district court was confined to a payment not exceeding £20.  In the light of general changes with regard to the jurisdiction of the district court and other courts of law, and also to bring the £20 value up to a more realistic present-day figure, we agreed, on the Report Stage in the Dáil, to change that figure to £50.  It is not an innovation and more sizable claims than £50 can be dealt with as we have been dealing with them since the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919.  We have transferred <Col N="165" /> the section from the 1947 Act but in fact the power in the form in which we are now regarding it derives from the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, and we believe that it is as reasonable now as it has proved itself to be over the years.</P>
    <P>We believe on its own merits it is a reasonable method of approach and that the matter of large claims can in fact be a job requiring very skilled personal knowledge of property values. It is possibly for that reason that at the outset the particular view was taken, but we feel it is as valid today as then, and I do not see any objection to it.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington indicated that in general he supported the Bill. He had a word to say about protecting the rights of the community, as against the general feeling about protecting the rights of the individual property owner.  He pointed out that in so far as acquisitions and compensation for land is concerned, in many instances, through no effort whatsoever by the landowner but rather from the community effort through the local councils, the market value of lands is enhanced very considerably.</P>
    <P>When it comes to the question of compensation for such lands when acquired, it is fixed at the market value enhanced by community effort without any effort on the part of the owner, and there is really a gratuitous payment, as it were, brought about by the mere accident of where the property to be acquired happens to be situated.  I agree that that is so.  I agree still further that there seems to be something wrong, but what may be the remedy for it and whether we can remedy it I do not know.</P>
    <P>No effort is made in this Bill to provide any remedy in so far as derelict sites are concerned which had nothing done to them by the owner to enhance their value but which because of what has been done by the community acquired an enhanced value even though otherwise remaining static.  Not only has nothing been done by the owner but, through his lack of care and attention, a site may <Col N="166" /> become an offence to the public and an eyesore; but despite that it can happen and will no doubt in the future happen that a derelict site may, as it becomes derelict, appreciate in value through the efforts of the community who, in turn, will come to acquire it at some future date, at its market value, by way of compensation. That anomaly exists.  I have no remedy for it.</P>
    <P>I have a view in the matter something similar to that of Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  I am aware of it but I do not see that, without some very radical change which is not proposed in this Bill, we can do very much about it.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that the rateable valuation should be on site value rather than on building value is undoubtedly one that would appeal.  The question of rateable valuation is not before us and does not come within the terms of this Bill.  I join with the Senator in his hopes for more activity and imaginative effort by our local authorities in doing the necessary works and clearing up the unsightly neglected sites that are all too evident throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Senator Cole asked in regard to the section that deals with the appropriate Minister for any of the particular matters raised in this Bill, whether the principle of designating the appropriate Minister in regard to these functions is new.  It is in so far as these functions are concerned. However, far from the new departure causing the trouble that the Senator has mentioned&mdash;that of there being difficulty because two or three Ministers are now introduced&mdash;the idea is that in so far as the local authority is concerned they will have but one Minister to deal with.  The manner in which that is proposed to be worked in the future is that where two or more Ministers are concerned in the functions for which the local authority propose to acquire land on which to build, the Minister with the greater function&mdash; measured in a sense of value I presume&mdash;would become the appropriate Minister and it is with that Minister and that Minister alone that the local authority would henceforth have to <Col N="167" /> negotiate, rather than with various Ministers and Departments.  that arises where the functions do not include any functions relating to the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>Where, however, the Minister for Local Government is concerned, and irrespective of whether his function is greater or less than that of any of the other Ministers concerned in a joint effort or for multiple purposes, it will be the Minister for Local Government with whom the local authority will in all cases deal.  The idea is to bring matters to the situation that, regardless of how many interests may be involved, one Minister will become the appropriate and operative Minister, in so far as the local authority is concerned, in any acquisition for these purposes or borrowing as the case may be.  That provision is inserted there to simplify and does not in any way raise the question that has been feared by Senator Cole that it may make matters more cumbersome, awkward and difficult.</P>
    <P>A suggestion was raised also by Senator Cole, and by an earlier speaker, that they would like to see in this Bill power to acquire land compulsorily for parks or playgrounds. Such power already exists under the Sanitary Services Acts.  This Bill does change that position.  In other words, while the power exists to acquire land for playgrounds or parks under existing legislation, we are now bringing the procedure to acquire into line with the compulsory purchase orders procedure&mdash;thus the wish expressed by both Senators about playgrounds is already met, but at present under provisional order procedure.  From the passing of this Bill&mdash;if it becomes an Act in the form in which it now is&mdash; the uniform approach of compulsory purchase order procedure will apply and this should make it more feasible for local authorities to acquire for those very useful and laudable purposes of children's playgrounds or public parks as local amenities.</P>
    <P>Senator Cole also mentioned the spoiling of good arable fields, square or rectangular, by taking a bit out of them.  He pointed out that the loss <Col N="168" /> to the farmer is far greater than is the loss of the actual acreage or number of roods or perches of land which is acquired.  If the field is a square or a rectangle or reasonably so and a portion is acquired out of a corner, undoubtedly the loss is greater than the actual acreage.  The field becomes awkward and costly to work and, for that matter, it is inconvenient to work for all future time.  I do not know what the real answer to this is. It certainly is not the answer that was immediately suggested, that of taking the corners of badly-shaped fields or three-cornered fields and in that way reducing the impact of loss on the farmer concerned.  In all cases where a portion is taken out of a field it is taken because it may be the only suitable available land that could be built upon.  You cannot expect to find in every locality where land may be acquired a misshapen field or a three-cornered field.  Even though you may find useless land, very often it is uneconomic to build on, and it may not be situated in a suitable place. I agree with Senator Cole that where small parcels of land of a rood or two are being acquired, if a good square or rectangular field is marred by a corner being taken away, it is a much more serious handicap than the loss of an acre to the farmer.  A commonsense approach by the officials and the engineers concerned, and the inspectors, in due course, with the guidance and good sense of local members of the councils throughout the country, should in so far as it is possible, avoid that situation.  I believe that in general it is so, and where it does happen, in the great majority of cases it happens because the particular bit of land is the only available piece of land in the locality suitable to serve the particular purpose.</P>
    <P>Senator Tunney referred to land speculators and the enhanced value which I have dealt with already, as mentioned by some other speaker.  He instanced County Dublin, north and south, and south in particular, where land became immensely valuable almost simultaneously with a gravity feed water supply being made available to the land.  What seems to have happened is that it was not the original <Col N="169" /> owners who gained the benefit&mdash;that apparently would be tolerated&mdash;but somebody with an eye to the future jumped in hurriedly, bought the land at an enhanced rate even at that time, and as a result of its being enhanced further in value by public services being made available, he eventually reaped a very lucrative profit by dividing up the land and selling it as serviced site blocks to the public.</P>
    <P>It is difficult and almost impossible to prevent that type of speculation, and while that type of speculation might be regarded as reaping undue profits, nevertheless, the fact is that if there were no speculators in any field, over the years a great deal of good that they have brought about would still not be done, which has in fact been done as a result of their eye for a quick return in the future on money spent.  That does not in any way indicate that we condone this type of speculator and particularly if, in the speculator's mind, there is an idea of screwing the last penny out of the public, especially if the public have not got very much option.  At the same time, it is one of those things for which I do not think the Oireachtas can legislate, and which, while we might not like all aspects of it, we can scarcely condemn roundly.  If we do, I cannot readily see how we would prevent it.</P>
    <P>Senator Tunney also mentioned that certain building societies which provide loans have been increasing their interest rates over the years, over and above the original rates to the purchasers. That is a matter which in the first instance was within the competence of the purchasers who have entered into an agreement.  If it has taken place, it is a pity that it should take place, if it is a case of profiteering on the part of these builders and building societies.  On the other hand, when one comes to sign away the price of a house, or any amount such as that, one usually signs only after due consideration of the terms of the particular contract.  If this is now happening, apparently it is because the contracts signed in the past were contracts that should not have been signed but, having been signed, undoubtedly must now be accepted in all their various aspects.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="170" /> Senator L'Estrange objects to ministerial orders and legislation by order &mdash;I scarcely ever come into this or any other place where he is that he has not objected.  If Senator L'Estrange examines his mind and his conscience for a little way back in regard to other recent matters in which he has participated, he will likely find that he took an extremely different view in regard to these other matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that Senator L'Estrange, in his assumption that that to which he objects is being perpetrated to an unduly large degree in this Bill, is entirely wrong.  The amount of legislation by order, as he calls it, is quite limited in this Bill, and the limitation on the amount that is by order is of such a nature that it is fair; and when it comes to be discussed in detail on Committee Stage, the Senator will agree that the matters which will be subject to ministerial order are matters relating to points which can undergo changes as time goes on and in respect of which circumstances will have changed, and therefore it would mean that if we were to write all and everything into the Act instead of a statutory instrument, in fact we would likely find that we would be back here in six months or every year to change it and bring it up to date.  There are, however, some laws which can usefully and without any danger to anybody be carried out quite as well by ministerial order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator L'Estrange mentioned many <Col N="171" /> things, but it will become evident that they do not all add up to the same conclusion; but again I am not blaming Senator L'Estrange for that.  I have come to expect it.  He mentioned that, under a foreign Government, our rates contribution was £11 million and that they have now risen to £25 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  That was the inference which I would have drawn from what was said later by the Senator on these increases from £11 million to £25 million, regardless of whether it is for local authority affairs or the whole country.  I take his view that he is taking the whole country in these figures, and we must draw a certain conclusion from these rising figures, that the rise would indicate over-borrowing and over-spending.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, we are being very careful.  What I want to point out is that when we relate these figures to other figures given by the Senator, we see a picture which I have taken up in a manner disputed by the Senator and from which I cannot be blamed for drawing a comparison between the £11 million and £25 million for running the country.  Then he went on to say that the farmers' income was ten per cent. higher in 1957 than it is to-day and that rates have gone up, while income has come down.  I cannot quite get the point of the Senator's argument except to say this, that the inference that may be drawn from all he has said, if any inference can be drawn, is that the more that is spent by local authorities, the less it costs in general taxation.  Here is a rather strange situation.  In 1939 &mdash;without going back too far&mdash;of the total receipts of local authorities on Revenue Account, receipts from rates exceeded by 33½ per cent. receipts by way of grant from the <Col N="172" /> Central Fund, excluding other receipts. In other words, excluding other receipts, it would have been 57 per cent. rates contribution towards the cost of our local authority services and spending, with 43 per cent. from Government sources, whereas to-day instead of its being to the disadvantage of the local authorities, eight per cent. more is paid by way of grants from the central Exchequer towards local authority costs than is now paid out of the rates.  The percentages of the aggregate to-day are 52 to 48 as against 43 to 57 going back just 20 years.</P>

      <P>We heard talk here to-day and inferences drawn by various speakers that we kept shoving these things on to the burden of the local ratepayer in order to relieve the central Exchequer because the Government are responsible for finding the money to fund the central Exchequer. The facts are that instead of 43 per cent. of the local authorities' net costs being paid as was the case in 1939, the position to-day is that up to 54 per cent. of these costs are subscribed out of the Central Fund.  That entirely belies the assertions made here that the Government keeps shoving costs on to the local ratepayers in order to relieve the central Exchequer.</P>

      <P>Whether the Senator alleges it or not does not much matter, because if as much weight is to be given to that suggestion as is given to other views of the Senator, no one will believe him.  However, the Senator said that we should lower interest rates&mdash; we are now told that the banks could do it&mdash;and that we should curb borrowing.  Then he goes on to say that borrowing will be increased under this Bill.  I simply do not know what he meant.  Perhaps we shall find out from the Senator at a later stage, since he has disputed my interpretation of what he said, what in fact he did intend to say and perhaps we shall get a clear picture as to whether or not we should cut off the services which are <Col N="174" /> being enjoyed by a number of people to-day, such as improvement of our roads, building houses, improving and reconstructing houses or farm buildings, water schemes, sewerage schemes and so on and are we to stand still and say: &ldquo;Those who have the services at the moment being paid for by all the people are the only people who will have them?&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, there should be a realistic approach to borrowing by local authorities for the purpose of improving the services to more people so that all the people in their functional areas may enjoy the same facilities at the same cost rather than as is the case at the moment, that some of the people should have those services at the expense of others.  That is the situation.  If we are to cease borrowing, to close down, and not to add to the debt of our local authorities for essential purposes&mdash;if we are to follow that line of restrictive conservatism&mdash;then we are saying: &ldquo;We do not want any better or any more services for any more of our people and those who have not got them will have to do without them.&rdquo;  Those who maintain the view that there should be a hold up in regard to borrowing are saying that, whether they like it or not.</P>

      <P>(i)&nbsp; to authorise the increase to £120 m. of the present statutory limit of £100 m. on the expenditure which the Electricity Supply Board may incur for capital purposes other than the electrification of rural areas;</P>

      <P>(v) establishment of a superannuation scheme for whole-time members of the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Bill, 1953, details were <Col N="178" /> given of the Board's programme for the increase of their generating capacity from 629 megawatts to 1042.5 megawatts by 31st March, 1961.  The cost of completing that programme, including ancillary transmission and distribution equipment, but excluding work chargeable to rural electrification, was then estimated at £53.5 million, and to make full provision for the programme would have entailed raising the authorised limit of the Board's capital expenditure for general purposes to £120 million.  The Act of 1954 authorised capital expenditure by the Board for general purposes up to £100 million.  It was intended that further provision would be made when the need arose, that is to say, when the total of the Board's expenditure and commitments was nearing this limit.</P>
    <P>The 1954 programme envisaged the addition of 413 megawatts to the Board's generating capacity during the following seven years, on the assumption that the demand for electricity would continue to increase at the rate of about 13 per cent. per annum, which then prevailed.  This rate of increase did not continue, however, and it became necessary to curtail the programme early in 1956.  Later the rate of expansion in demand recovered to an extent and the provision of some of the capacity which had been postponed was undertaken.</P>
    <P>At present the installed generating capacity of the Board is 728 megawatts and further plant, which I shall describe in a moment, will be commissioned between now and 1964. Planning for the expansion of generating capacity must commence many years ahead because it takes up to five years to bring a new power plant from drawing board to full operation.  The generating plant requirements of the Board for the years from 1964/65 onwards were approved at the beginning of this year and a new programme of construction for the five years to 1968/69 has been settled.  The programme from 1964 to 1969 is based on an estimated growth in the consumption of electricity at an average rate of 7 per cent. per annum.  This was the rate of growth in the two years 1957/58 and 1958/59.  While the Board has been planning for an increase in <Col N="179" /> demand of 7 per cent. per annum, the increase in the year 1959/60 and so far this year has been of the order of 10 per cent. per annum.  The advance programme has already come under review and it may be necessary to accelerate the provision of new plant. We could not contemplate the possibility of power rationing or power cuts.  Apart from the serious social consequences, power cuts could cause heavy losses to industry and rationing would cause incalculable harm to our present industrial effort and our prospects for new industrial development.</P>
    <P>Before the first plants in the new programme come into operation in 1964-65, the Electricity Supply Board will have brought into commission in the meantime at Rhode, County Offaly and Bellacorick, County Mayo, 80 megawatts of new plant, all of which will use milled peat.  This will increase the total generating capacity of the Board's plant to 808 megawatts.  The new programme envisages the addition of a further 340 megawatts of which 160 megawatts will be fired by milled peat and 180 megawatts by oil, and provides for the absorption by 1968-69 of the annual output of all the bogs which are at present considered economically usable for the generation of electricity.</P>
    <P>Oil-fired stations will be sandwiched between peat-fired stations so as to ensure maintenance of electricity supply in year in which weather conditions may be adverse for either turf or water generation of electricity or both.  To ensure continuity of bog development and employment by Bord na Móna the oil stations will be used only to the extent that water and peat generation is insufficient to meet demand.  For the development and exploitation of the bogs in connection with this programme, it is expected that Bord na Móna will provide additional employment for up to about 1,000 men each summer, falling to about half that number in winter.</P>
    <P>All the more important rivers have already been harnessed for electricity generation.  Stations on the remaining rivers would be uneconomical in <Col N="180" /> present circumstances having regard particularly to the high initial capital costs and current high interest rates. The Electricity Supply Board, however, are continuing to collect data and investigate other rivers with a view to possible later development for hydro generation.  The Board have in operation a 15 megawatt generating station at Arigna using native coal and considerable quantities of native coal are also used at Ringsend station. Although the use of nuclear energy for generating electricity is not foreseen in the immediate future, the Board is keeping in close touch with developments in this field.</P>
    <P>The process of increasing the quantity of generating plant and ancillary equipment has been continuous for many years and it will continue for many years to come.  The authorised capital expenditure of the Board for general purposes is at present subject to a limit of £100 million and this limit will be reached about 31st March, 1961.  We are providing in this Bill for an increase in the limit, to £120 million, to enable the normal process of development to continue for the next three or four years.  The sum is not allocated in advance as between each year but the Capital Estimates, for each year as they become availaable, will contain particulars of the estimated annual allocations.</P>
    <P>The financial provision I have described will cover some of the expenditure on the advance programme of the Board; that is, the programme for the years from 1964-69 inclusive, which I approved at the beginning of 1960.</P>
    <P>It is, on occasion, suggested that the Board has an excess of generating capacity.  I could deal with this suggestion at some length but it should be sufficient to refer to the Annual Reports of the Board for the last two years which indicate that, in 1958-59, due to shortage of both turf and water and in 1959-60 due to shortage of water alone, it was necessary to draw on the Pigeon House Station which is the standby station of last resort.  I might also say that the advance programme up to 1969 was proposed to me in its entirety by the <Col N="181" /> Board and that after careful examination I approved it without modification. At no time was there any pressure on the Board to formulate the programme.</P>
    <P>Another contention which is sometimes made about the Board's generating plant is that the turf stations are unduly expensive in comparison with those operated with coal or oil. If we disregard cost for a moment we can find very compelling arguments for the use of turf for power generation&mdash; the tremendous employment afforded by Bord na Móna and the reduction of our import commitments.  It is not necessary, however, to disregard costs. In milled peat, Bord na Móna has produced a highly efficient fuel which in the last year or two, with imported fuels virtually at a discount, has compared very favourably in fuel cost per unit with both coal and oil.  Milled peat is the fuel which is going into all the new turf stations.</P>
    <P>The Bill raises by £2 million to £32 million the total amount which the Board may spend on the electrification of rural areas.  It had been estimated that a total of £30 million would be sufficient to complete the scheme but a wider response in some areas than had been provided for has resulted in increased expenditure and it is now expected that by the time the scheme has been completed, in about another two years, expenditure will approach £32 million.  As the scheme nears completion, the rate of progress has slowed down slightly but, nevertheless, forty areas were completed in the year ended 31st March, 1960, and completion of forty more areas is expected in the current year.  At 30th September, 1960, the number of areas completed was 708, and there were only 84 areas in which work had yet to commence.  The raising of the limit of £30 million to £32 million involves increasing the total amount of the subsidy which may be paid to the Board by £1 million but no change in the principle of subsidy is involved.</P>
    <P>The rural electrification programme has proved a heavy burden to the Board.  This is partly due to the withdrawal of the 50 per cent. capital subsidy in 1955.  In addition, however, <Col N="182" /> the rural areas developed in recent years and those remaining to be developed are the more uneconomic areas and the subsidy of 50 per cent. of the capital cost which was restored in 1958, is not sufficient to enable supply to be provided except at a continuing loss to the Board.  The regrettable result is, that, over the past three years, the Board after taking account of surpluses on its non-rural operations showed overall revenue deficiencies amounting in the aggregate to £750,000.</P>
    <P>The statute clearly sets out the duties and responsibilities of the Board in circumstances of this kind. It is entirely the responsibility of the Board under Section 21 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927, to ensure that its revenue will be sufficient to meet outgoings.  In discharge of this responsibility, the Board recently announced an increase in charges which, I understand, will add approximately 5 per cent. to its total revenue.</P>
    <P>The relevant statute does not enable me to intervene in the matter but I am in very close touch with the Board and I am satisfied that if the increase had been avoidable the Board would not have introduced it.  The position is, indeed, that if the revenue of the Board had not been sufficient to meet outgoings the provisions of the statute would, automatically, have precluded the increase in charges.  If the charges had not been increased it would have been necessary to assist the Board from public funds, that is, from taxation. Taxation would have been an alternative means of raising the sums required but the charge would have fallen on substantially the same body of persons.</P>
    <P>In connection with the price increase, however, I have been struck by the fact that the average price per unit for all electricity sold by the Board in the year 1959/60 was only 36 per cent. above the corresponding price in the year ended 31st March, 1939.  This compares with increases in the costs of gas, oil and coal over the same period ranging from 145 per cent. to 218 per cent. and with increases of 164 per cent. in the con- <Col N="183" /> sumer price index, 232 per cent.  in the wholesale price index, and nearly 230 per cent in average earnings per week in industry.</P>
    <P>The comparisons I have quoted and indeed the general record and reputation of the Electricity Supply Board reflect the efficiency and devotion to the public interest with which the Board and their staff have discharged their responsibilities.  The Board are not complacent, however, and take every opportunity to increase efficiency further and reduce costs.  I am glad to know that in these respects, the Board, like other forward looking organisations, is making use of modern techniques such as work study.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for withdrawal of the limit of £25 million on the amount which the Electricity Supply Board may borrow from the public by the creation of stock.  When the Board was first authorised to seek capital from the public under the 1954 Act, a statutory limit was set to the amount which the Board might so borrow. Experience has shown that this limitation is unnecessary and the present opportunity is being taken to remove it.  The prior consent of the Ministers for Finance and Transport and Power will, of course, continue to be required to each public borrowing operation by the Board.</P>
    <P>Under existing provisions the Board has made two issues of stock totalling £15,000,000.</P>
    <P>The Bill also makes provision for the assumption by the Minister for Lands of certain powers and functions in relation to the fisheries vested in the Electricity Supply Board.  A few provisions in existing legislation bearing on the Board's fisheries provide for the consent of the Minister for Transport and Power in certain cases, but, in general, the Minister for Transport and Power has no function in regard to the Board's fisheries nor has he available to him the information and technical advice which he would require to deal with any matter which may arise in regard to them, either in the Oireachtas or elsewhere.  It is desirable, therefore, <Col N="184" /> that the Minister for Lands, to whom the necessary information and technical advice are available, should be more closely associated with the administration of the fisheries and that the occasional questions which may arise should be dealt with by that Minister.</P>
    <P>In the administration of the fisheries under their control, the Electricity Supply Board have concentrated mainly on the development of angling and commercial salmon fisheries and commercial eel and oyster fisheries. The position in regard to the trout and coarse fishing under the control of the Board has, accordingly, been under consideration by the Minister for Lands.  The Board have fairly extensive powers in the matter of awarding leases of trout and coarse fisheries but have not widely exercised these powers.  The Minister for Lands feels that the rights which the Board find possible to grant are inadequate to enable lessees to develop these fisheries in the best way.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands desires that, in any case where it would be in the national interest for the Board to grant a lease in respect of trout or coarse fishing to the Inland Fisheries Trust or some other suitable body, he should have power to influence the Board in the matter.  He considers that angling for trout and coarse fish should be on an agreed plan, in the devising of which he will seek the advice of a joint committee representative of his Department, the Inland Fisheries Trust, Bord Fáilte and the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <P>If the development of particular fisheries can best be achieved by leases of certain waters, the Minister for Lands should be in a position to indicate the term of years the lease should run so as to allow of adequate development and protection in each case.  The Minister for Lands has made it clear that in the matter of leasing of Electricity Supply Board Fisheries, the object would be to ensure as far as possible the full development of these fisheries.  In this, due regard would be given to the salmon fisheries and their primacy recognised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="185" /> I am satisfied that the arrangements now proposed will not compromise the management responsibility laid on the Electricity Supply Board and a provision has been included in the Bill to meet the desire of the Minister for Lands.</P>
    <P>There are also three minor provisions in the Bill to repair defects in the legislation relating to the Board's fisheries:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  <i>New Fisheries arising in E.S.B. waters:</i></P>
    <P>Under present legislation, the Board have power to manage fisheries which they have acquired but they have no general power to manage some new fisheries which have arisen mainly in the reservoirs of hydro-electric schemes.  The hydro-electric schemes were bound to destroy existing fisheries by submersion in the reservoirs and otherwise, and the Board had no option but to acquire them under Section 7 of the 1945 Act.  On the basis that the fisheries would be destroyed no provision was made for their management.  It is now proposed that the Board be given power to arrange for the preservation and maintenance of the new fisheries which have arisen.</P>
    <P>(b)  <i>Compensation for interference with fisheries:</i></P>
    <P>The destruction of fisheries interfered with the livelihood of a number of persons employed in fishing and Section 18 of the 1945 Act was designed to provide for the payment of suitable compensation to them. The measure of compensation laid down in the Act is such as is considered reasonable for total loss of profits or earnings and all persons who have so far received compensation under that section did in fact suffer total loss of their profits or earnings.  The Act did not, however, provide for partial compensation for persons whose profits or earnings were merely reduced but not extinguished.</P>
    <P>The establishment of an electricity generating station on a river may not immediately affect the <Col N="186" /> earnings of such persons, but progressive diminution in the run of fish, attributable to the establishment of a hydroelectric station, may later occur and the earnings of such persons may be reduced.  To provide for the case of such persons, the Board is now being authorised to pay compensation to them in proportion to the measure of their loss and to make further payments to them in the case of any subsequent losses until the total of payments reaches the compensation appropriate to total loss of earnings.</P>
    <P>(c)  <i>Board's title to Shannon Fisheries:</i></P>
    <P>The purpose of the third minor provision in regard to fisheries is to repair a defect in the Board's title to the Shannon Fisheries.  It was intended that the Shannon, Fisheries Act, 1938, would transfer these fisheries in to to the Board but the relevant provisions were not effective to transfer any State-owned fisheries which might have existed in the waters of the Shannon.  The present Bill proposes to confirm the title of the Board to all fisheries in the waters of the Shannon.</P>
    <P>The Electricity Supply Board, being the first of our semi-State bodies to be set up, was inevitably burdened with a few very rigid procedural obligations which later experience has shown to be unnecessary.  The present Bill provides for two modifications of procedure.  Firstly, the cumbersome arrangement which requires members of the Board of the Electricity Supply Board, on the occasion of any alteration in their remuneration or allowances, to resign and be re-appointed, is being abolished.  Secondly, it is proposed to end the requirement that the the Minister for Transport and Power, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, should prescribe by regulation the time, place and method of conducting the audit of the accounts of the Electricity Supply Board, the accounts to be furnished to the Minister and the accounts to be published and put on sale.  Modern practice has been to allow the responsible Minister to give an informal direction in such <Col N="187" /> cases and it is desirable to bring the position of the Electricity Supply Board into line with the modern practice.</P>
    <P>Further provisions of the Bill will allow the Electricity Supply Board to grant to their pensioners increases similar to those allowed to public service pensioners in 1959 and 1960.</P>
    <P>The opportunity of the present Bill is also being taken to bring the legislation in relation to the superannuation of whole-time members of the Board of the Electricity Supply Board into line with legislation enacted since the passing of the Electricity Supply Board (Superannuation) Act, 1942, in regard to the superannuation of whole-time members of the boards of semi-State bodies.  The Bill provides that the Minister for Transport and Power, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, may make a scheme or schemes covering the superannuation of whole-time members of the Board. The schedule to the Bill sets out details of matters to be provided for in any superannuation scheme made under the provision.</P>
    <P>I am very happy to recommend this Bill to Seanad Éireann.  The Electricity Supply Board is one of the oldest of our semi-State bodies and one of the most effective.  The success which has attended its efforts over the years, on which the management and staff deserve our most sincere congratulations, has in large measure contributed to the economic advancement of the nation in general.  The enactment of this Bill will enable the Board to continue their good work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind, it is a serious matter that Ministers should come to this House with these megalomaniac proposals.  The Minister for Transport and Power was responsible for another last year.  To put it in a nutshell: the Government, the Party to which the Minister is attached, brought in proposals in 1953 to increase from 629 megawatts, the then installed generating capacity, to 1042½ megawatts by 31st March, 1961. In fact, during the intervening years, <Col N="188" /> so far, all that has been added is 99 megawatts&mdash;from 629 to 728 megawatts. Where was all the planning in 1953?  What was the basis of the White Paper?  The Minister may bandy figures like 13 per cent. per annum around in his brief, if he wants to&mdash;I cannot stop him&mdash;but I have met no one attached to the E.S.B. who believes in that 13 per cent.  I visited Cumann na nInnealtóirí&mdash;unwisely at the time because I did not know what their difficulty was.  Anyone who knew anything about the way economic progress goes would not be fool enough to believe that the kind of thing that happened in Western Europe with Marshall aid and the installation of plants from the United States free in France and Western Germany would be repeated in this country.</P>
      <P>Let me get back to the essence of the matter.  Only 99 megawatts have been installed since 1953.  It is commonly believed, and I believe correctly believed, that there is a substantial excess installed generating capacity in the E.S.B.  Until the Minister answers the question asked in Dáil Éireann by Deputy McGilligan, this Bill will go through this House stage by stage.  He did not answer this question, this perfectly plain question: what was the maximum total load at the highest output moment in the last year?  He did not answer that question.  He sent Deputy McGilligan an absurd statement that every station was working to 100 per cent. capacity. One has only to look at the figures in the E.S.B. report to see the absurdity of that.  Some of these stations have an immense capacity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity of paying tribute to the excellent work done down the years by the E.S.B.  They have set a headline for all of our semi-State bodies. If there is any lesson to be learned from them it is the lesson that the E.S.B. was staffed by men who were technically trained at the start.  The engineers carried the main brunt of the development and they justified in every way the confidence reposed in them by the state.</P>
      <P>Having said that I should like to say a word of caution.  The whole Bill is based on the Principal Act of 1927 and I think the time is long overdue for having a commission at the functioning of the E.S.B.  I am not saying there is anything wrong, but, after 33 years of public service, it is now time to take a look at the functioning of this body to see whether the functions of the 1927 Act have broadened or become restricted.</P>
      <P>I am very disturbed that these general purposes for which we are asked to vote an increase from £100,000,000 to £120,000,000 apparently are to involve going into competition with retails traders in electrical appliances and apparatus.  I for one cannot share the enthusiasm which greeted the opening of the new E.S.B. showrooms in Cork City.  I regard it as being very unfair to the private traders engaged in the supplying of electrical&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not.  I believe that taking over a main building like this and doing it up in such a grandiose fashion was wrong.  I am further disturbed when I see that this tendency apparently is to seep down into small country towns and villages. I have in mind a small town in Limerick which has less than 1,000 inhabitants and in which a principal corner is to be taken over and, with this money which we are voting, very elaborate showrooms erected.  That is despite the fact that in the same town there are two or three small electrical supply people, individual concerns working 12 or 14 hours a day to give a very satisfactory service to the people in the locality.  I do not know of any demand for these showrooms or that there have been any complaints about the service those people are rendering.  Consequently I believe this is a tendency which should be investigated immediately and which should be stopped.</P>
      <P>I believe that if we are to extend the functions of the E.S.B., we could very profitably extend them where the first-class scientific talent at the disposal of the E.S.B. could be utilised. I have in mind the manufacturing, say, of cable and other commodities of which considerable quantities must be imported at present.  That would provide a fruitful field of endeavour for the E.S.B., along lines similar to those adopted by the Irish Sugar Company. It has broadened its functions to include the development of machinery for its beet harvesting, as well as other sideline activities, including the development of research.  Those seem to me most laudable additions to the company's primary function of producing sugar from beet.  In the same way, the E.S.B. should broaden out and engage in similar appropriate functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of us feel that this country has been slow in developing along the light engineering side of electronics. We read about the large-scale factories in Holland and elsewhere which employ thousands of workers in the field of electronics and I believe within the E.S.B. we have that high-powered talent which could profitably develop <Col N="194" /> such activity.  Not alone that, but we have, in the board, the financial backing and standing which would enable it to get into those fields with profit to the board and to the nation as a whole.  I suggest that the time is long overdue to have a look at the functions of the E.S.B., and then plan a course for these extra activities over the next 15 or 20 years.</P>
    <P>The other point on which I wish to comment is in regard to the rural electrification service in respect of which we are increasing the limit from £30,000,000 to £32,000,000.  Very soon, all the areas mapped out will be completed, but that will still leave certain places in the more remote areas which will not have got the amenity of electricity.  I feel we owe something to the people in those regions.  We cannot treat them like the unfortunate people of West Cork are about to be treated.  We cannot ignore them and say that because it is not economic to provide a service for them, therefore they cannot have it.  I suggest there is a way out.  I do not advocate the totally uneconomic course of electrifying all these areas but I believe that in the development of calor gas for heating, lighting and power, we have the solution for those areas which may have proved uneconomic for development under rural electrification.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that those who visited the Whitegate refinery were struck by the waste of a resource, the fact that gas has to be burned because it is no use and that only a fraction of the gas produced can be used commercially. I understand that the same supply would provide sufficient for the development of practically all the areas outside those developed under rural electrification and I would ask the Minister to look into it as a means of bringing comparable advantages to the people outside the areas considered uneconomic for development at present.</P>
    <P>In regard to the development of nuclear power stations, I was glad to hear the Minister say that this is being kept under review.  I know that apparently there is not the same urgency for developing nuclear power now as there appeared to be three or four <Col N="195" /> years ago, because the natural resources of fuels are not likely to be exhausted as quickly as appeared likely some three or four years ago. Therefore, the development of nuclear power has been slowed down somewhat. I know that the authorities in the English Atomic Energy Commission see in this country a very valuable place for the siting of nuclear power stations for Western Europe as a whole because these stations have to be sited away from regions of dense populations and there are very few parts of Western Europe which satisfy that requirement.</P>
    <P>With the strides that have been made in conveying electricity across water barriers by means of a direct current transmission, it is quite feasible in the very near future that current generated here could be sold to the European Continent.  Of course, it would be a very costly undertaking and probably the capital involved would be beyond our ability to provide.  In addition, the return might not be all that attractive.</P>
    <P>I feel that in the future either power concerns in other countries or other groups may be willing to invest in the development of nuclear power stations here in some of the more remote parts of the country.  When these are properly controlled, I do not think there should be the slightest worry about any hazards involved.  I think that is all I can add, except, again, to pay a well-deserved tribute to the E.S.B. and, above all, to the engineering staff of the Board who have shown that they are capable of combining both expert management with top-class technical efficiency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House are delighted to see that the white elephant of a few years ago is now so worthy of consideration that those who referred to it as a white elephant at that time now come before us with this proposition tonight. The first proposition is to increase by £20 million to £120 million the sum which the Electricity Supply Board may spend for capital purposes other than rural electrification and, secondly, to authorise the increase to <Col N="196" /> £32 million of the present statutory limit of £30 million for rural electrification.</P>
      <P>We all know that the E.S.B. has played a most significant part in the development of the economy of this country.  Nobody can deny that and the Minister gave them credit for it. I think it was the first State company born here after we got our freedom. It has been a first-class success and has pioneered the way in that sphere. As the body responsible for the general electricity supply since the Shannon Scheme was established, it has played&mdash;and I think we all agree &mdash;a unique part in the economic development of this country.  Were it not for the fact that the Shannon Scheme was started in 1924, we would not and could not have had the industrial revival we had in this country over a long number of years.</P>

      <P>Whatever the Senator may like to call it, it has been a success.  I have been informed that the E.S.B. officials have recently got 15 per cent. increase in wages, but whether that is necessary or not, I do not know.  I wonder would the Minister tell us if that is true and whether it has anything to do with the increased price being charged for electricity because many people claim that what we want in this country at the present time is stability for a few years.  If we started to give these increases, to start an eighth round of wages increases, we shall have the vicious circle all over again.  Would the Minister tell us if that is correct? I do not know but I have been informed that it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we look up the figures, we can see that the fact that we are burning turf has cost us something in the region of £600,000 per year, that is, omitting, I think, the item of £500,000 for depreciation, interest and repayment for the excess generating capacity which we have to maintain. Altogether that is a sum of £1,100,000. The Government, as Senator O'Donovan stated, entered into that with their eyes open.  If this money is needed, I <Col N="197" /> think it is only right to point out that it is not due to the fact that the Government were going ahead with rural electrification but to the fact that we are burning native fuel which costs £600,000 and the fact that the other £500,000 has to be paid because we have excess generating capacity which we have to maintain.</P>
    <P>As regards the second part, it is perhaps bad policy to have so much generating capacity and to have to maintain it.  As regards the burning of our native fuel, I think there are some people who may argue against it.  I myself am all in favour of burning native fuel and on any committee I have ever been in Westmeath or elsewhere, when any officials recommended the use of oil or coal, I have always stood up for home fuel and I shall do so in future.  I maintain that the E.S.B. are quite correct in that matter because I think the Minister stated in the Dáil that Board na Móna provides employment for 1,000 men during the peak period and over 500 men in the low period.</P>
    <P>I have always claimed that in an underdeveloped country like ours no man should be unemployed if we can possibly manage it and instead of expecting men to live on 30/- or 31/-. per week dole, it would be better for companies like the E.S.B. and Bord na Móna to co-operate to give employment to our people at home at a reasonably good wage.  As far as the E.S.B. are concerned in that regard, I am in thorough agreement with them.</P>
    <P>I want to say what Senator O'Donovan did not say.  I want to say that the present Minister deliberately misled Dáil Éireann and gave incorrect information to the Dáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I rise to direct the attention of the Minister and the House to what I consider a grave injustice done to the people of Clare ever since the E.S.B. was established. The lands taken over in Clare for E.S.B. purposes had a valuation of £267 13s. and the buildings thereon a valuation of £280.  The two together make a valuation of £547 13s.  That is free, exempt from rates, and has contributed nothing to the rates in Clare during the past 32 years.  As well, salmon weirs and eel weirs, carrying a total valuation of £450, have been taken over and, I understand, they are also exempt from rates.  That makes a gross total of £997 13s. which should be carrying a valuation, judged by ordinary commercial standards.  The present rate in Clare, I understand, is 40/- in the £.  That makes a tidy sum of £1,995 6s. which the E.S.B. should have paid to the funds of the Clare Co. Council in the past year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the highest. In the preceding years, it would be on a sliding scale.  On a rough calculation, that means that for the past 32 years the E.S.B. got out of the rate-payers £63,857 12s. by way of rates arrears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to direct the attention <Col N="199" /> of the House also to another enterprise in Clare, that is, Deputy Dillon's rabbit warren situated at Shannon Airport. That at the present time has a valuation of £12,062 16s.  The rates paid by the authorities of Shannon Airport to the Clare Co. Council during the past year were £20,131 13s. 7d. What a contrast! I cannot understand why, if Ardnacrusha and the buildings thereon are free from valuation and free from rates, Shannon Airport is not likewise free and, <i>vice versa,</i> if Shannon Airport has to contribute £20,131 a year&mdash;and the valuation is growing, thank God&mdash;why should the E.S.B. not have to pay a proportionate contribution according to their valuation? I want to know if the same operates in the other schemes at the Liffey, the Lee and the Erne.  Are they also exempt?</P>
    <P>Incidentally, I want to know if the power stations in connection with Bord na Móna are contributing a rate or if they are specially exempted in those counties.  If they are not specially exempted, why should there be one exemption, that is, in respect of the buildings and lands taken over for electricity purposes at Ardnacrusha?</P>
    <P>The Minister has had no notice of my raising these matters but I want an answer to them at the earliest opportunity.  I think that more than your humble servant in County Clare would like an answer to the questions. Everybody interested in justice would, I think, be anxious to know why that scheme alone should be exempted from rates, if all the other undertakings I have referred to are carrying a rate and contributing a fair share to the rates and expenses of the county.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is concerned with the generating of electricity. Obviously it has generated a great deal of heat in this House this evening.  I think it is regrettable that a scene such as we have witnessed tonight should have occurred.  I do not intend to assign the blame for the situation in which this House found itself, but it is regrettable that it should have arisen.  There seems to be a considerable difference of view between people on this side of the House and <Col N="200" /> the Minister as to whether or not the E.S.B. system at present has an excess of generating capacity.</P>
      <P>The Minister has given a figure which seems to indicate what I calculated&mdash;22 stations.  We gather that they all generate at the maximum point and when carrying the maximum load they are all generating electricity at 100 per cent.  That seems to be a correct figure.</P>
      <P>Ringsend Station, on the Minister's statement, comes in only as a station of last resort.  It is understandable that when that station is brought into operation, it will be generating electricity at something near maximum capacity and that all the other stations, having generated at maximum capacity, have not been adequate for the needs of the moment.  The figure being asked for, I venture to suggest, is whether or not there are some stations lying idle for a considerable period of the year and what the average generating capacity of these stations is over the year at peak.</P>
      <P>That would be a different figure, I imagine, from the figure supplied by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I think it was quite clear what Deputy McGilligan was seeking in the questions put by him to the Minister for Transport and Power on the Fourth Stage of the Bill in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I do not understand the position. On the one hand, the Minister apprehends, as I understand his statement, that we may find ourselves in a position where, if the E.S.B. is not supplied with more capital to instal more generating plant, there will be power cuts which will have drastic social and economic consequences which he wants to avoid.  At the same time, for some years past, the E.S.B. to the knowledge of all of us who travel on buses and keep our eyes open and pay electricity bills, have been indulging in an intensive advertising campaign to get people to use more electricity.</P>
      <P>It does not seem to hang that, on the one hand, there is a fear that we may find ourselves faced with power cuts and, on the other hand, that the E.S.B. is apparently anxious in its advertising policy to encourage people to use more and more electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="201" /> The reports of the E.S.B. are notable for the dearth of information they contain.  When they are printed, on very fine paper, they might, for the benefit of the uninitiated who want to understand what the Board is about and what have been the results of its activities over a particular period, try to set out the position in language intelligible to the average Irishman who may be interested in reading them. This book is unintelligible to most people.  I can only hazard a guess as to its meaning.  It may be said that I am subaverage in intelligence; anyone who wants to make that charge can do so.  I do not think that is a proper kind of report for the E.S.B. to present to the public.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a contradiction between the Minister's fears of a threatened shortage of power and the E.S.B. policy of advertising.  On top of that, there is this other factor.  Some years ago and within my time in Seanad Éireann, the present Taoiseach, when Minister for Industry and Commerce, introduced a Bill to expand the capital of Bord na Móna.  At the time, I ventured to express the hope that the increased capital of Bord na Móna would be used in such a way that the ordinary householder who wanted to use Bord na Móna turf, briquettes, and so on, would have them available in more ample supply than they had been up to that time.  I hoped that that would be one effect of the increased capital for Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>The then Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;the present Taoiseach&mdash; was very quick to retort that that was not the intention in increasing the capital for Bord na Móna.  He said it was intended that the capital would be used to develop bogs for the supply of milled peat and other peat for electricity generation.  In no time the market has been flooded with Bord na Móna turf which suggests that the E.S.B. has not been using and is not using the turf or briquettes and that its activities are not directed towards supplying the basic ingredient for the generating of electric power.</P>
    <P>That suggests that there is some <Col N="202" /> substance for the uneasy feeling that this white elephant which we should all like to see well fed with capital is not alone being well fed but overfed&mdash;and overfeeding is as bad as starvation.</P>
    <P>I entirely agree with the suggestion by Senator Quinlan that after 33 years, the operations of the E.S.B. could be investigated, if only for the reason that a periodic investigation of the functioning of any such body would keep it on its toes and ensure that its operations are carried out at peak efficiency. I have a recollection of expenditure by the E.S.B. outside my own door. It took about five to seven employees four days to do the same kind of work as I saw one man do by himself in one and a half days.  When they had finished their work, which was merely making a bit of a path into a transformer, the path would not run the water, so that the total work was a dead loss.  On top of that, they left behind them, as a kind of a <i>res nullius</i> which the people around the place took advantage of, about half a load of gravel which was trampled on by local children.  Eventually, some of it found its way usefully into the back gardens of the local inhabitants.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of operation which, if you had a proper audit as you have under the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Board would be asked to account for and explain, and that is the kind of thing that does not happen on any widespread scale in the public service because of the fact that you have a rigid system of auditing and accounting which involves not alone seeing that money does not find its way improperly into anybody's pockets but that it is not wasted.</P>
    <P>When you have that kind of thing going on, it would be a very useful function to ensure that a body which has proved itself so good might in fact prove itself better, and that instead of the minor amendments which the Minister is introducing to the 1927 Act, particularly in relation to the auditing of accounts, for which he has given no explanation except that it is the modern style, that the Minister by informal direction determines what accounts are to be given, the Minister, who now has only transport <Col N="203" /> and power to look after specifically, might consider the advisability of reviewing the operations of a semi-State concern with expenditure as big as this, where, as far as I can see, so far from the average price per unit of electricity sold decreasing with the greater number of consumers, it has been tending to increase, particularly since 1951.  Perhaps the Minister's explanation might be that that is the cost of bringing electricity to rural areas.  I do not know, but I should have thought that that was covered by the subsidy for capital development in rural areas.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which seems to me to call for some comment. We cannot dam up the waters and store them for the dry season, but I should have thought it was possible&mdash; perhaps I am speaking from profound ignorance&mdash;in very good summers to lay up a stock of peat for use on occasions when we have either a bad summer which does not give us an adequate supply of peat or an unduly dry winter.  That seems to me to be a matter of planning.  It does not seem to be done to date, and the supply of turf is on a yearly basis, instead of carrying over some and building up as big a stock as is possible for use in those emergencies, instead of, as appears to be the position, turning over to oil-burning stations when stocks of turf supply and the rain water, <i>mirabile dictu,</i> run too slow.</P>
    <P>I am not at all clear as to what the position is with regard to pensions under Section 13 and 14 of this Bill.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate the categories and how it comes about that there are varying percentage increases for different categories. As far as I can read it, persons who retired after 1st September, 1956 do not gain any increase in pension under this Bill.  I should imagine that the cost of living has risen somewhat since 1956, so that those people would also be entitled to an increase in their pensions with those who retired before 1956.</P>
    <P>It strikes me with regard to the point raised by Senator O'Grady that <Col N="204" /> it was right and proper in the 1920's that this first venture in a State-sponsored body should be exempted from rates.  I should perhaps say for Senator Sheehy Skeffington's information that at the time when the Electricity Supply Board was being established, there were at least half a dozen capitalist firms in Germany and the United States who were only too anxious to get a licence to do what the E.S.B. subsequently did.</P>

      <P>It seems that while there was a case for not obliging the E.S.B. to pay rates in respect of its property and buildings in County Clare in the 1920's, that has long since gone, and that is a matter which the Minister should seriously consider in justice to the people of Clare, who ought not to be bearing on behalf of the whole country an undue burden. If Senator L'Estrange were here, he would probably say that that was a penance for a particular sin they committed for many years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to this discussion, there are certain realities which should be borne in mind.  The first is, that, in 1954, the Electricity Supply Board prepared a programme of generating expansion on the basis of an increase of electricity demand at that time.  That programme was announced and in 1956, which is the key year, it had to be modified considerably because in that year there was a reduction in the demand for electricity.  In other words, the economy was being run down to the extent that the power requirements were not what they appeared to be two years before, and the result was that the Board rightly met the slump <Col N="205" /> situation in 1956 and decided to curtail expenditure on the expansion of its own power requirements.</P>
      <P>However, happily the situation which obtained in 1956 does not obtain to-day, and we have an increase of steady progress in the past three years.  In passing, it might be no harm to mention that power demand and increase of power demand is one of the best indicators of economic progress in any country.  It is quite clear that whereas in 1956 there was this slacking of power demand which caused the Board to curtail their generating expansion, in the following years that situation changed, and in 1957-58, there was a 7 per cent. increase in the demand for electricity; in 1958-59, a 7 per cent. increase in the demand on the previous year; in 1959-60, a 10 per cent. increase in demand on the previous year; and the indications are that in the present year 1960-61 that rate of increase in power demand will continue.  It is that very simple expansion in power demand reflecting the expansion of our economy that has now induced the Board to expand the programme already envisaged in 1954 and which the Minister has now announced to us, will reach completion in 1968-69.</P>
      <P>To meet that expansion in demand, that regular expansion, in the past few years there has been an increase from 609 megawatts to 728 megawatts and in the immediate future before 1963, that will be raised to 808 megawatts with the completion of the power stations at Rhode and Bellacorrig. A further 340 megawatts will complete the generating capacity programme by 1968-69.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite apparent from that that what was a very proper programme based on the realities of the situation in 1954 became, in 1956, a practical proposal with the revival of our industrial economy in recent years and the consequent extension and expansion of the power demand.  The E.S.B. have revived their generating programme and, as outlined by the Minister, will reach the present planned capacity in 1968-69.  In that connection, I thought that a lot of the contributions made tonight <Col N="206" /> by the other side of the House, and by Deputy McGilligan in the Lower House, were unreal and woolly.</P>
    <P>The present planning in regard to power is based on the extension and expansion in the demand for electricity, and that extension and demand are largely due to the expanding needs of our growing industrial development, and to the indications I have mentioned; a seven per cent. increase three year ago, a seven per cent. increase again two years ago, and a ten per cent. increase last year.  Those figures almost approximate to the expansion in industrial production and industrial exports in the same years.  We have the two percentage increases side by side to prove that there is no point in not having power unless you have further consumer demand for that capacity and the greatest consumer demand obviously must be industrial.  In that connection this extension of the E.S.B. plans is a reflection of the expanded industrial economy in the country.</P>
    <P>One very welcome factor in recent years has been the cooperation and interrelationship between the activities of the E.S.B. and Bord na Móna, especially since the milled peat development which bears comparison with any other type of fuel, as regards economy, in the world.  That is a development in which we can take a certain pride.  Bord na Móna launched out on the milled peat project some ten years ago.  We were the first in the world to develop it and it has now proved to be as economic as and, in some cases, more economic than, any other form of fuel.</P>
    <P>It was the milled peat development which enabled Bord na Móna to fit in with the E.S.B. and provide them with efficient low-cost fuel from which the E.S.B. could develop and generate power for the country.  That interrelation will have very practical results when this programme envisaged by the Minister is completed.  It has resulted in an extension of the briquette factories and an extension of the employment in the Bord na Móna camps.  As a result of the expansion of the E.S.B. generating capacity, 1,000 extra people will be employed, and on the completion <Col N="207" /> of the programme, there will undoubtedly be improvements with regard to briquette production and other activities.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley got a bit mixed up when he said that the interrelation between the E.S.B. and Bord na Móna did not appear to be quite so happy, now that Bord na Móna were going into the business of selling fuel to a greater extent.  I did not understand the point the Senator was getting at.  Surely those are two distinct developments in Bord na Móna activity. On one side there is the domestic fuel, the production of briquettes now happily going into the export market in Britain.  That is one facet of their activity and the power facet is an entirely different facet.  The two are not contradictory.  They run side by side and represent different facets of the Board's activity.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything more to be said at this stage.  This is a financial Bill making financial provision for the extension of the Board's activities.  As such, it is welcome, and the extension in power capacity is a welcome and further indication of the economic progress taking place. For that reason, the Bill should commend itself to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertLahiffe" hpid="Mr. Lahiffe Mr. Lahiffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lahiffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to make one observation.  In spite of the fact that most of the country is already lighted by electric current, in many small isolated parts of the western countryside, we still find small pockets left without current.  The reasons are perhaps economic.  We find that in order to get into the extreme end of the pocket, the E.S.B. decide that each and every householder must accept before they started work on the main pocket.  If one householder on the outside refuses, the rest must wait until he can be got to accept the current, but if he decided for his own reasons&mdash;perhaps that he could not afford to take the supply&mdash;the rest are deprived of supply.  These people may be prepared to accept it later on, and they will not be supplied unless they are prepared to pay the full cost of the connection for the whole <Col N="208" /> area, with an increase of one-third over and above the cost of the original survey.  The Minister should take this matter up and give to these people the same opportunities their better-off neighbours have.</P>
      <P>In other pockets, we find that in the case of an isolated house in an out-of-the way district, the householder must pay the full cost of development. That is unfair and it is also unfair that in the other case they have to pay an extra one-third of the cost.  That is the only point I wish to raise.  I would say to the Minister that in the interests of fair play and justice, these people should have the same conditions as their better-off neighbours had when the place was being developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what has been said by the previous speaker with regard to the pockets which exist in many areas throughout the country. It is a great disappointment to people, after waiting half a lifetime for the benefits of rural electrification, and after having their houses wired and all preparations made, to be told that because they are living in outlying areas away from the main source of supply, electricity cannot be supplied to them, except by paying an enormous rate&mdash;in some cases an increase of 50 per cent. on what they had already been assessed for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I strongly urge the Minister to look into this matter.  There are a few such cases in every area.  The fact that people are living in backward parts of the country in my opinion, is a compelling reason for making available to them the facilities which are available in the more progressive areas, so as to encourage them to remain there, in view of all we hear about keeping people on the land.  I know people in my own area who had their houses wired and because a neighbour fell out with them, they could not get the supply except at a heavy additional cost.  I appeal to the Minister to look at those areas.  In my opinion, they should be made a capital charge and if a householder is willing to take the electricity supply at the ordinary <Col N="209" /> rates charged to the majority, then he should get it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to make just two points.  One of them arises from what Senator Lenihan said about the use of milled peat for the production of electricity.  I think he painted an over-rosy picture when he said we were one of the first countries in the world to do this.  I distinctly remember in 1935 Mr. R.M. Tweedy coming to the Engineers' Society in Dublin and showing that this had been done in Germany and Russia and demonstrating incontrovertibly that it would be a good thing to do in this country, and the Government of the day deciding that it was not feasible, impossible and so on, and in fact not having it done until more than ten years later.  It was perfectly feasible long before that and we discovered how silly we had been not to do it then only when the war came and our usual supplies of fuel were cut down. I do not think that should lessen the pride we should take in what we did since 1946 but we should not be too silly about boasting that we were the first in the world to do it.  In point of fact, we were a little bit slow off the mark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point is that I should like to ask the Minister to make a comment on the rates charged for electricity in off peak hours.  It is a technical problem which I do not pretend to understand.  It seems to me that it is the interest of the Board to have the current consumed which is produced and which otherwise, presumably, largely goes to waste in the off peak hours.  I am thinking in particular of the night storage method of using this current and I think the E.S.B. has been imaginative in bringing in the system of storage heating.  In this, we have been a little ahead of many of our neighbours.  I feel that in a way they are damaging themselves by charging a rate more than they need and consequently having rather less of this type of electricity used than could be used.  It would seem to me to be both feasible and desirable to charge considerably less for electricity used at night time.  It is <Col N="210" /> produced after all for these storage heaters, in order to extend quite widely, as could be done, this very useful method of heating.  I should like to know what the Minister feels about this, or if he knows upon what calculation the rates charged by the E.S.B. are based and whether it would not be in their interests further to encourage the use of this electricity by cutting its price.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by supporting what the Minister said about the E.S.B., its production, planning and so on.  A good deal of the criticism to which the Minister and the Bill have been subjected is of a very niggling kind.  We can be very proud of this development and I do not think it matters who started it or whether some sections of the political life criticised it from one angle or another years ago. The fact is that the production of electricity and its distribution are being done extremely well by this State company, in which we all can feel a legitimate pride.  The Minister is to be complimented on his attitude towards the future supply of electricity and the praise he gives the company and its officials is highly deserved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady2" hpid="Mr. Brady Mr. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to endorse everything that has been said by Senator O'Grady in connection with the rates on the Shannon Scheme.  I was a member of the County Council in Clare when the E.S.B. derated their undertakings in the county and when they took over the lands which extended from Ardnacrusha down to Whitegate, a distance of approximately 30 miles.  It was a great national undertaking and, like Senator Sheehy Skeffington, I am proud of its success.  I see a great future for the E.S.B. but at the same time, I believe that to deprive the Clare County Council of the rates on that undertaking since 1927 was a grave injustice.  That matter has been raised on several occasions by Clare County Council. Resolutions have been sent to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to the Government, to various bodies, and to Deputies, asking them to take it up, but with no effect.  That is now almost 33 years ago.  We believe that <Col N="211" /> the State should pay rates on the Shannon Scheme undertaking, just as Shannon Airport is paying rates.</P>
      <P>I should also like to endorse what Senator Hogan said about people in small pockets in the rural areas.  I know of a case where the E.S.B. were carrying out rural electrification in the area of a particular farmer.  He was slightly removed from their line of action and they wanted him to pay £120 for the erection of two poles to bring the supply up to his house.  In addition, he would have had to pay for the wiring of the house.  He was quite agreeable to pay a sum in the region of £20 or £30 but he could not afford to pay £120.  Now that man sees no hope of getting lighting for his home, for his cow house or power for his kettle in the morning, if he is going to a fair, amenities which his neighbours enjoy.  We have a lot of remote pockets in County Clare, north, south, east and west, and we should try to keep these people on the land.  The best way to do that is to give them the same amenities as the people who live quite convenient to the big towns and villages have.</P>
      <P>That is all I have to say except to add that I feel that I would have been lacking in my duty if I did not mention these points.  Senator O'Grady said: &ldquo;If they gave you £60,000 in a lump sum would you be satisfied?&rdquo; and I replied: &ldquo;If they gave us that lump sum and agreed to pay rates for the future, we would be quite satisfied.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to refer to one facet of the activities of the E.S.B. and that is their sale of appliances in competition with traders and the providing of services such as wiring in competition with the ordinary electrical firms and such like.  I feel that a Government body providing a service and charging a price for it should not do that.  Before proceeding any further with criticism, I give the obvious answer.  In 1960, there are several hundred people, almost a thousand people, in the employment of the E.S.B. who are actively engaged in that end of the business.  They cannot <Col N="212" /> now be disemployed but I would suggest to the Minister that any expansion of that side of the Board's activity would, in fact, be unfair to the ordinary individual citizen who happens to be an electrical contractor or a supplier of electrical equipment such as washing machines, refrigerators and other similar goods.</P>
      <P>The question was raised of rates not being paid in Clare.  That is merely one part of the Electricity Supply Board's privileges.  Where that obtains, it gives an idea of the advantage that a Government body holds.  A Government body holds that advantage over the ordinary trader and they can utilise the advantages to suit themselves. Take the position of a man supplying a machine on the instalment system in the ordinary way.  He must write into his costs of that machine the risk of his repayments not being made, the risk of his not being in a position to repossess the machine. The risk of the E.S.B. in that case is far less.  It is lessened by the fact that the E.S.B. can switch you off.</P>
      <P>The position is that when the refrigerator or the similar appliance is supplied, the additional cost of the instalments on that appliance is added to the nine weekly payments the householder makes.  If those payments are not kept up, in the most arbitrary way the E.S.B. employees can turn off the supply of current. As I see it, that places the E.S.B. in a far better position, as far as the sale of such appliance is concerned, than the ordinary trader.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of wiring by the E.S.B., the E.S.B. people can avail of bulk buying because they are backed by unlimited capital.  We are increasing the capital tonight.  Is it not true that they can buy whatever quantities of various expensive cables they require so as to get the cheapest price?  No individual firm can compete with that, but at the same time each individual firm must pay trade union wages, its rates and taxes.  May I emphasise that?  They have to compete with the E.S.B. with all these advantages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I make this analogy?  When <Col N="213" /> you had the practice of assessing the profits the flour mills were allowed during the war, the average losses of all the publicly-owned flour mills were taken into account.  Having made these good, a figure of 6 per cent. was added for profit.  I am making a case in this particular situation whereby I said that in the case of one mill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Acting Chairman (Professor Stanford) Acting Chairman (Professor Stanford)">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Professor Stanford)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator may not pursue that here; he may make an analogy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to the end of the analogy.  In this case, there was a huge garage into which went 50 vehicles.  It was hard to decide which one was on bakery and which one was on flour.  The E.S.B. has huge vehicles.  Which one of these vehicles is engaged on a particular day on work relating to the price per unit charge and which as related to business?  Similarly, when we take the turnover off the sale and the service and on business in relation to the turnover on the supply of electricity, one is a minute fraction of the other. When all the costs are taken into account at the end of the year, it is quite easy perhaps to charge over 10 years a fraction of a penny more per unit so that, in fact, the unfortunate trader in the towns in Ireland, who was there before the E.S.B. started, can be put completely out of business by this sort of activity.  Nobody's business should be placed in jeopardy because of our wrong policy in the past.  I feel it would be quite wrong if in the provincial towns of Ireland you had a situation in which the E.S.B. shop or the E.S.B. office to which everybody must go to transact his normal business with the E.S.B. in another way was selling at cutthroat prices while the man around the corner, rearing his children and paying his taxes, is forced out of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would recommend to the Minister that that end of the business, while it should not be interfered with, should not be further expanded.  I think that is not a very flamboyant approach.  It is not a very radical approach.  I think <Col N="214" /> it is very fair.  It would be wrong if we passed legislation tonight authorising further borrowing by the E.S.B. on a colossal scale, if, at the same time, we did not advert to the fact that there are around the corner from every E.S.B. office unfortunate men engaged in business, men with families to rear, who must compete with that huge organisation which has all the advantages and none of the disadvantages of that end of the trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Donegan in what he said in relation to the selling of fittings and appliances.  I should like, however, to go very much further.  When these Electricity Acts came in in 1927&mdash;and even the later Acts&mdash;they did not envisage retail trading by the E.S.B.  The powers given to the Board were given for the purpose of allowing this great State organisation to perform a function which it might be very difficult for the private section of the community to undertake.  But in recent years the policy of the E.S.B. has been to compete vigorously with local traders.  I have seen a case where the E.S.B. went so far as to purchase a shop three or four doors from an excellently equipped electrical sales shop.  In order to entice customers, infra-red heating strips were placed above the windows so that potential customers could warm themselves on winter's nights at our expense.  I do not think there was any suggestion by the E.S.B. that the same free service would be supplied to the local trader further up the street.  It is a very sound social principle that the State ought not to engage in anything that can be well done by the local trader.</P>
      <P>Manufacturers of goods and wholesalers very often hire or procure shop windows or show rooms to exhibit and promote the sale of their goods and wares.  I suggest the Minister is proceeding along the wrong lines if he does not use these shops for that purpose rather than for retail sales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In every electricity bill we receive, a blurb is enclosed inviting us to buy on cheap terms some of the appliances the E.S.B. wish to sell&mdash;I suppose to boost the sales of electricity.  They <Col N="215" /> have the finance to enable them to sell on the hire purchase system.  They have a method of collecting money that is not available to any of the competing traders.</P>
    <P>I think we are surrendering some of our rights in handing over this retail trading to the E.S.B.  I see shops being opened in every town and I say: &ldquo;There is another infringement on the rights of the people. There is another yard in the progress along the road to serfdom.&rdquo;  The Minister and his officials ought to know better than, little by little, to build a road to serfdom where independent people who have engaged in retail trading, who have given a good service to the community, will be destroyed.  To use a semi-State company for that purpose is irresponsible.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power is the first Minister of that designation.  He has more time to devote to this matter than had our Ministers for Industry and Commerce. He should see to it that we will encourage our people to be economically free, independent and self-reliant. How can people be independent and self-reliant unless they have some economic independence?  If we use State companies to destroy their economic independence, we are travelling very much along the wrong lines.  I understand that much the same principle is adopted in contracting. There may have been some excuse for that in the past and I would say less in the present.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the withering away of this State control and the same applies to contracting.  Where contractors have grown up, the E.S.B. should withdraw when the citizens are able to perform these functions themselves without relying on the State.  That will help us to grow up. It is not necessary at all times and for ever that there should be somebody to hold our hands while we cross the street and that there should be somebody to switch on the light for us and to switch it off again.  We have gone much further in these respects than we should have gone.  We have shown an extraordinary lack of philosophy and thought as to where <Col N="216" /> we are going.  They say that nobody goes as far as the person who does not know where he is going.  We must have the lights turned off when we are drawing up the laws with regard to the E.S.B.</P>
    <P>I admire much of the great work this great body have done.  In many respects, they have been an admirable organisation.  No matter how admirable a State organisation may be, it must be subject to criticism and, like all of us, by examination and vigilance be brought back to the right lines.  They publish a report each year.  It is as attractive as one of the glossy covered magazines.  One likes to browse through it, to read of the achievements and to look at pictures of what has been done.  It tends to make one feel better.</P>
    <P>I look in vain through the pages of that annual report to see if the cost of electricity is cheaper in Dublin than it is in Bristol, or if the man running a factory here is paying more for his lighting than his opposite number is paying in Dusseldorf, Haarlem, Utrecht or any other place.  None of that information is available.  I consider it ought to be a basic feature of any report.  There is no mention of comparative achievement.  I do not wish to be critical but praise is in some measure self-praise when it is not backed by an exposition of what is done by other countries in the field of public lighting.</P>
    <P>It has recently been brought to my attention by a member of a public body that he believes that the cost of public lighting in comparable cities and towns in our neighbouring island is cheaper than it is here.  I understand that many public bodies would now like to know how their charges compare with those in similar sized towns in Britain and elsewhere.  We ought to be given this information.  It ought to be readily available.  Without it, we are uninformed.  No democracy can survive if it is an uninformed democracy.  The basis and strength of a democracy is to be informed and supported by information and equipment. The breath of enlightenment ought to be let into every institution <Col N="217" /> in this State.  The E.S.B. should tell us what everybody else is told.  We should know whether they can do less or more than similar bodies elsewhere.  If we have that knowledge, we shall be armed with the facts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to speak on this Bill but the contribution by the previous speaker has brought me to my feet.  I cannot understand the argument that the E.S.B. should not be allowed to trade in electrical appliances or to take part in contract work.  I could understand and agree with the argument if it were shown or even suggested that the E.S.B. is subsidising this retail trade out of the sale of electricity&mdash;in other words, that out of the monopoly we have given them for the sale of electricity, they are utilising the profit to undercut the retail trade.  That has not been suggested.</P>
      <P>I have not the accounts before me, but I think the opposite is the case.  In fact the profits the E.S.B. make on the sale of electrical appliances do to a certain extent subsidise the sale of electricity, so that if the argument is to be carried to its logical conclusion, the Board would not be allowed to engage in retail trade because they would make a profit; but of course they should be obliged to supply electricity because they might be able to make a profit, and they should be obliged to go into all those out of the way pockets we have heard about to supply electricity to the people who might want it.  I do not see any people on my left jumping to the rescue of those out of the way pockets and suggesting that some private enterprise people should be allowed to supply electricity to those parts.</P>

    <P>I could agree with the argument if it were shown that in fact out of the monopoly we have given the E.S.B., they are subsidising this other aspect of their trade, and if they were doing that, it would be unfair and should not be tolerated; but that is not the case.  Instead it is suggested that the Board should withdraw from this field altogether and allow the other operators to sell, presumably at higher prices than the E.S.B. are selling <Col N="218" /> currently, because the E.S.B. are in competition with them.  Nobody obliges me or anybody else to go to them for an electric kettle or any other appliance except on the basis of what it will cost, the money aspect.</P>
    <P>We have heard, of course, the suggestion that the Board are in a more favourable position in regard to hire purchase because it can be put on the electricity bill, whereas the private trader runs the risk of either having the washing machine returned to him or not being able to recover it.  My knowledge of hire purchase trading, the little I have, is that the ordinary shopkeepers do not carry the risk at all.  It is borne by one of the finance companies.  You sign a form and from there on the trader is paid by the finance company, the risk, if any, being borne by the finance company. I cannot therefore accept that that arrangement is in any way unfair to the private traders.</P>
    <P>The private traders have a useful function to perform in the selling and installation of electricity and electrical appliances, but I certainly would not support and could not accept silently the view that the E.S.B. should be forced out of this field in order to allow people to charge more, presumably, and because they might be making money, and because of that fact they might be able to eventually supply all those out of the way pockets which other Senators have been talking about.</P>

      <P>Generally, I am able to say in the case of a debate in this House that it has taken place in a friendly atmosphere, but I am afraid that I cannot say it with regard to some remarks made on this Bill.  I charge the Fine Gael Party with using the deliberate weapon of propaganda by rumour particularly when they see a general election coming in the offing, of quiet sabotage, little suggestions sent out on all sides that there is something terribly wrong with the State companies, little suggestions that the Minister is making gross misuse of inaccurate figures even though they are supplied by the State company, in order to prevent the public from knowing <Col N="219" /> of huge loss, or losses, suggesting that some alleged juggernaut is rolling over the people and preventing them from having their due prosperity.</P>

      <P>We have seen a good example of it in this case.  I have said on a number of occasions that in the plan for the future of the E.S.B., no excess capacity is foreshadowed, that in relation to the present generating stations of the Board, there has been no concealment of alleged past excess capacity that was the result of a fraudulent plan by my predecessor.  I make that statement again expressly.  I have been supplied with figures by the Board whose chairman has my confidence, which showed that every single station at one time or another of the year is working at 100 per cent. capacity; and I have indicated again in the Dáil that there are periods of the year, particularly in the autumn season, when sometimes there is an insufficiency of hydro-production and when all the steam stations of the Board at once are working at 100 per cent. capacity in order to provide sufficient power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There can be most extraordinary circumstances in which shortages of peat and water fuel occur in an unusual pattern where again the spare capacity is put into full operation.  Every generating station has to be closed down for <Col N="220" /> maintenance and that amounts sometimes to a very considerable percentage of the power cut off.  I have said all that and made those statements explicitly, and I think what I have said should be accepted.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan suggested that in 1954 he made some observations to the effect that the increase taking place every year in consumption was quite out of reality. In fact, an increase of between 12 and 13 per cent. has taken place in the years previous to 1956, and it was the crisis of that period which reduced the increase in consumption.  I am glad to say that the increase of consumption is mounting up again.</P>
    <P>In regard to the observations made by a number of Senators about the practice of the E.S.B. in selling equipment, I should say, first of all, that I have not had any complaints of note or representations by the traders concerned that they object to the practice of the Board, and there has been no pressure of any kind, in that regard. Secondly, the E.S.B. enable small firms to collect their instalments through the Board's account.  Thirdly, the E.S.B. by adopting the modern technique of having colourful showrooms, help the sale of equipment by the other smaller retailers who cannot afford that kind of overhead expense.</P>
    <P>There has been a certain amount of reckless exaggeration in regard to this. I can say that if the Board were to invade the whole territory of the private trader, there would be serious complaints and I should naturally have to review the whole position, but at the moment, so far as I have been informed and know, they are carrying out their obligations and there is no element of subsidy.  Their merchandise accounts are presented and can be found in the report of the Board.  I should also add that a consumer cannot be cut off by the Board for nonpayment of hire purchase instalments. My answer to that point is that at the moment I see no reason to interfere. If ever some distortion of the position should arise, naturally that would call for examination.</P>
    <P>I omitted to say in relation to the <Col N="221" /> alleged excess capacity in the E.S.B., that naturally the E.S.B. have made every effort, in co-operation with Bord na Móna, to reduce the amount of spare capacity required.  Bord na Móna have decided to have a stockpile of turf to tide them over a bad year, so that if there are insufficient supplies one year, there will be a reserve to enable the generation of current from turf to continue at a fairly high level whenever the year itself has been a very poor one.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion was made that Bord na Móna might go into the manufacture of equipment.  One of the first things I did when I was appointed Minister was to ask the E.S.B. to examine once again the equipment imported into the country, and also the normal standard spare parts for existing equipment imported into the country, to see whether they could give advice to the manufacturers who are producing similar sorts of articles in order to help them to produce them in this country.  From speaking with the directors of a number of concerns, I know that the E.S.B. have been extremely helpful in that regard. On the whole, unless the E.S.B. can find a proposition in which they could take part on a more economic basis than any private firm, it would be as well to leave the position as it is.  In fact, I think it would require legislation if the E.S.B. were to go actively into the manufacture of certain classes of equipment.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan suggested that we were not doing enough in the electronics field.  I want to mention in passing that we export radios to countries as far away as Pakistan and Ceylon and telecommunication equipment manufactured in this country to other countries all over the world, so although we may not have gone as far as we would have liked, there has been considerable progress in that direction.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan also suggested that it might be time to appoint a commission to examine the work of the E.S.B.  I am in very close touch with the chairman, in whom I have the utmost confidence, and with the directors. We meet regularly and discuss <Col N="222" /> every phase of the work of the E.S.B. without any interfering in the conduct of the day-to-day operations of the Board.  I discuss with them all the future trends which are likely to arise in regard to generation and consumption, and I press upon the chairman at all times the necessity for adopting the most modern techniques and engaging in work study of the most modern and efficient type.</P>
    <P>I know the E.S.B. are in touch with engineers from a number of different countries versed in all the latest techniques. In deciding which equipment to select, they are automatically bound to make a study of new trends in design.  If I thought for a moment that the E.S.B. were seriously lagging in adopting modern concepts and modern techniques in relation to the generation of power, I would certainly have no hesitation in asking the Board to accept the services of an independent consultant or consultants. That would be my duty.  To my mind, there is no necessity for that, so long as I have the assurance of the chairman and the Board that they are adopting work study of the most modern type and keeping in touch, as I have said, with developments all over the world.</P>
    <P>In relation to Bord na Móna, I should say that there are about 6,000 employees at the moment and that number will increase by 1,000 as I mentioned in connection with the observations I made in regard to the cost of electricity.  I should say that the actual comparative costs show that milled peat is competing very satisfactorily with coal and oil and offers great hope for the future.  It is true that sod peat is not able to compete in regard to comparative costs, but the milled peat stations are truly competitive. It should not be thought that our generating costs are excessive because of the use of peat.</P>
    <P>A number of questions were asked about E.S.B. property being exempt from rates.  I am sorry to have to tell Senators&mdash;I sympathise with them in some ways&mdash;that successive Governments have failed in their intention or wish to repeal the clause in the E.S.B. Act of 1927 which relieves them from <Col N="223" /> the responsibility of paying rates on any of their property.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That is something one could argue.  Some Senators raised the question of the small pocket of consumers who have not been supplied with power and said it would be very desirable now to make a change in the system which would enable them to have current, without additional charge.  The position is quite difficult to describe in that regard.  Roughly speaking, the E.S.B. must have a very rigid system of not allowing themselves to run into debt and to cause deficits over and above a certain specific figure.  In relation to current supplied in rural districts, after allowance is made for the subsidy, a special charge is made if the normal fixed charge in respect of a particular dwelling does not provide 4.25 per cent. of the capital cost.  The special charge which is added to the two-monthly bill brings the figure up to 4.25 per cent.  I should say in that connection that, as must be known to Senators, the E.S.B. are subsidised to the tune of half the capital cost of rural electrification. The Board also make their own contribution to the capital cost.</P>
      <P>That figure of 4.25 per cent. is grossly inadequate even after the subsidy has been applied so that there is a very heavy deficit in the rural electrification account.  Briefly, if the E.S.B. were not to make a supplemental charge for those living in these pockets all over the country, there would be an immediate increase in the total deficit, if all the persons concerned joined the network, of anything up to £600,000 or £700,000 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The best thing to do, in my belief, is to allow the E.S.B. to continue charging in an orderly way at the lowest possible cost, directing their construction teams in a manner which will ensure that the cost of installation in each area is as low as possible and allow them to complete the present scheme.  The Government will examine the position and if it is possible to <Col N="224" /> undertake a further scheme in which there might be some amendment of the present scale of charges, this will be considered.</P>
    <P>I should make it clear that the Taoiseach, when he first announced the rural electrification scheme, clarified the position by saying there would be certain consumers who might never get current.  It might be less expensive on them to get calor gas or Kosangas or some other gas fuel as an alternative.  The position could easily be reached that the capital cost of providing the supply would be greater in many cases than the entire valuation of the household in question. Therefore, the answer is not to impose any further burden on the taxpayer or on the E.S.B. consumer by attempting to reduce these charges&mdash;which are made on an absolutely scientific basis &mdash;but to bring the present scheme to a conclusion, with all the areas connected, and then to re-examine the position and see what can be done.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington asked whether I had made an investigation of the charge system of the E.S.B. with a view to encouraging the consumption of power in off peak periods.  The Board has a supply tariff for industries under which very favourable terms are offered and have the effect of keeping down the peak period when the consumer demand is at a maximum.  I have impressed upon the chairman that everything possible should be done to examine the tariff with a view to making sure that they will not either inhibit new industries or sell less current than they could because they are making unnecessarily high charges.  They should constantly examine the whole structure of the charges whenever they think it is possible to sell more current and at the same time, carry out their obligations under the Act, discharge their financial obligations, and if they make any profit plough back the whole proceeds into the development of the concern.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke asked me about the comparative costs for power in different countries.  Comparisons are very difficult indeed to make because, for example, this country has a greater <Col N="225" /> proportion of its population in scattered groups of less than 200 persons than any other country, along with Sweden.  Of course if you were to compare the costs of current here with those of Sweden, you immediately see that Sweden has a great spine of mountains and a very high proportion of its power is derived from water.  Therefore, comparison becomes impossible. If you try to compare the position in Great Britain there is an enormous and extended three shift industrial complex to be supplied and the power is largely derived from either coal or oil and so comparison is difficult in that case.  I think I could say that I am satisfied that the cost of power here is reasonable and that if we examine the increases in cost over a period of nine or ten years, or longer, as compared with those in other countries, there is every reason to believe that the E.S.B. operates efficiently.  I should say also that the cost of installing the rural electrification net work here is regarded by engineers in other countries as being extremely low.  Recently engineers have <Col N="226" /> been visiting the E.S.B. to examine their methods of rural installation because of the low costs.  In general, I think we can say that it is most unlikely that the cost of current here is excessive.</P>
    <P>I think I have answered all the points raised except that Senator O'Quigley did refer to the section dealing with the increase in pensions.  It is a perfectly normal matter.  The sections, of course, are complicated, but they are, in effect, giving to the employees of the E.S.B. the increases extended to the Civil Service. No one is being omitted and it is working on absolutely parallel lines. There are no anomalies and no unusual factors in the proposed increases.</P>
