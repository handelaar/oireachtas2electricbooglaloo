    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill relating to hire-purchase and it has two main objectives.  Firstly, it provides that the Minister for Industry and Commerce shall have the power to make Orders regulating minimum deposits and maximum periods of payment in connection with hire-purchase and credit-sale transactions and prescribing the information to be given in relation to goods advertised or displayed for sale on hire-purchase or credit-sale terms.  The second objective of the Bill is to amend in certain respects the provisions of the <Col N="1103" /> Hire-Purchase Act, 1946, which deals with the private rights and liabilities of parties to a hire-purchase or credit-sale agreement and the powers of the courts in legal proceedings arising out of hire-purchase transactions.</P>
      <P>Hire-purchase benefits the community in a number of ways.  It stimulates demand for a wide range of consumer goods and other products and in that way promotes production and employment.  It enables persons in the lower income groups to furnish and equip their homes and to acquire many of the conventional necessities of life which they might otherwise have to do without.  So long as hire-purchase facilities are utilised sensibly and prudently, there is no doubt but that the system is a useful one and that in normal conditions it can be beneficial to the national economy. This may be particularly true when the facilities are availed of for productive purposes as, for example, the purchase of industrial machinery and plant which will add to the national income and provide employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Figures published by the Central Statistics Office show that in 1938 there were 64,000 hire-purchase and credit-sale transactions the total retail value of which amounted to £1.5 million.  In 1958, the number of such transactions was 242,000 and their total retail value £15.6 million.  Thus, between 1938 and 1958, there was a fourfold increase in the number of transactions and a tenfold increase in their retail value.  While part of the increase in retail values as compared with 1938 is due to the change in the value of money in the interval, it is clear, nevertheless, that the use of hire-purchase facilities has increased very considerably.  Indeed, hire-purchase has now become such an important economic and social factor in the life of the community that I am sure the House will agree that it is essential that the conduct of this business should continue to be subject to regulation so as to ensure, first, that the economic consequences of hire-purchase spending can be controlled in the national interest and, secondly, that the practical operation of the <Col N="1104" /> system as between the owner and the hirer of goods is fair and equitable.</P>
    <P>While the growth of hire-purchase plays an important part in the development of the economy, it could give rise to serious problems in certain circumstances. Hire-purchase credit provides spending power and creates a demand for goods and services.  To the extent that the demand is for imported goods, it is capable of having an adverse effect on our balance of payments. Furthermore, by encouraging and facilitating expenditure on consumer goods, hire-purchase can affect the volume of national savings available for productive investment.</P>
    <P>It is very desirable, therefore, that, if circumstances at any time so require, the Government should have the power to control these undesirable consequences of hire-purchase.  Part II of the Bill provides, accordingly, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce may make Orders regulating the volume of business transacted by prescribing minimum deposits and maximum periods of payment.  Orders of this kind were previously made in 1956 when excessive consumer spending and other factors had contributed to balance of payments and capital difficulties.  The 1956 Orders were made under emergency powers legislation as continued in force by the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946.  The Supplies and Services Act expired on 31st December, 1957, and in order that there may be power to exercise controls of a similar kind if the necessity should arise at some future date, the new legislative provisions contained in this Bill are necessary.</P>
    <P>The Bill also authorises the Minister for Industry and Commerce to prescribe the information to be given in relation to goods advertised or displayed for hire-purchase or credit-sale. The interests of hirers or buyers in this matter are already protected to some extent by the Hire Purchase Act, 1946, which provides that, before a hire-purchase or credit-sale agreement is entered into, the hirer or buyer must be informed of the cash price of the goods.  The agreement itself, which must be in writing, must show the cash <Col N="1105" /> price and the hire-purchase price of the goods.  However, when advertising and displaying goods for sale on hire-purchase terms, many traders do not show the cash price or the hire-purchase price but merely the amount of the weekly or monthly instalment.</P>
    <P>I think it will be agreed that the practice of showing only the amount of the instalment induces a number of people to buy goods without knowing the exact cost or the full extent of the commitments being entered into.  I consider, therefore, that it is desirable that at the time goods are displayed or advertised, consumers should be made aware of the price at which the goods may be purchased for cash, the total hire-purchase price and the number, frequency and amount of the instalments payable.  The powers contained in Part II of the Bill will enable the Minister for Industry and Commerce to require that information of this kind shall be made available to the public.</P>
    <P>The Hire-Purchase Act, 1946, is designed to protect the interests of persons who hire or acquire goods under hire-purchase or credit-sale agreements.  As I have mentioned, it establishes and defines private rights and liabilities between owners or sellers and hirers or buyers of goods, and it deals with the powers of the courts in legal proceedings arising out of hire-purchase transactions.  A detailed examination has been conducted by my Department of the present state of the law on this subject and of the manner in which the Act of 1946 has been operating.  There have been consultations with various interested parties, including the hire-purchase finance companies, and an opportunity has been taken to obtain the views of the Judiciary and Court Officers who have specialised experience in this field.  The investigations which have been carried out show that certain changes in the law are desirable and it is with these changes that Parts III and IV of the Bill are concerned.</P>
    <P>Under existing law, if a hirer defaults in payment under a hire-purchase agreement and the owner takes legal proceedings for the recovery of the goods, the court may make an Order giving the hirer an opportunity of paying the outstanding <Col N="1106" /> balance of the hire-purchase price by instalments.  If, due to some misfortune such as illness or unemployment, the hirer falls behind in the payments and fails to apply to the court for a variation of the Order before the default, he may lose the goods, even though by that time he may have paid off practically all his indebtedness.</P>
    <P>It is inequitable that the hirer should lose the goods in such circumstances, and provision is, therefore, made in the Bill to enable the court to vary its Order at any time before the goods are actually returned to the owner in accordance with the delivery warrant issued under the Order.  The hirer is also being given the right, which he does not at present possess, to pay the outstanding balance of the hire-purchase price instead of handing over the goods in compliance with a delivery warrant.  The owner can recover whatever costs and expenses have been awarded to him by the court.</P>
    <P>In ordinary civil proceedings, if a defendant admits the plaintiff's claim and makes an offer of payment which the plaintiff accepts, judgment is often entered in the court without any query and without attendance of the parties. This cannot be done in hire-purchase cases, since the Act of 1946 provides that an Order giving relief to a hirer may be made only at the hearing of an action after the courts have had regard to all the relevant circumstances of the case.  These precautions are not necessary where the owner has accepted the hirer's offer of payment, and, accordingly, it is being provided in the Bill that in such case the court may enter judgment forthwith.  This provision should speed up court procedure and reduce legal expenses, to the benefit of both hirers and owners.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1946 renders void any clause in a hire-purchase agreement authorising an owner to enter the hirer's premises for the purpose of seizing the goods which are let under the agreement.  The Act furthermore provides that, where one-third of the hire-purchase price has been paid, the owner cannot enforce any right to recover possession of the goods except by action in the courts.  It has been <Col N="1107" /> represented by the hire-purchase companies that these provisions operate harshly.  It has been said that there have been cases in which a hirer acquired a motor vehicle or tractor under a hire-purchase agreement and subsequently abandoned it in a place or in circumstances in which it was subject to serious damage or depreciation.</P>
    <P>The hire-purchase companies claim that in such cases they should have the right to recover possession of the vehicle&mdash;and, if it is necessary for that purpose, to enter the premises of the hirer&mdash;pending legal proceedings under the Act of 1946.  The Bill seeks to provide an equitable remedy for owners in cases of this kind.  It includes a provision to enable the owner to insert in a hire-purchase agreement a clause permitting him to enter upon any land or premises of the hirer&mdash;except a dwelling house or a garage or other similar building attached to a dwelling house&mdash;for the purpose of recovering possession of a vehicle let under the agreement.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides, moreover, that, even where one-third of the hire-purchase price has already been paid, the owner will in the circumstances mentioned, be entitled to recover possession of the vehicle without a court order pending the making by the court of an interim Order for the custody of the vehicle.  Two safeguards are being provided against the abuse of this provision.  First, where an owner recovers possession of a vehicle, he will be obliged to make an application to the court within 14 days for an interim order for the custody of the vehicle.  If he fails to do so, he will be deemed to have recovered possession in contravention of the Act of 1946, and the hirer will be released from all liability under the agreement and may sue the owner for payments already made.  The second safeguard is that if, on the hearing of the action the owner fails to satisfy the court that in all the circumstances of the case he was entitled to seize the vehicle, the court may award damages against him in respect of the recovery and retention of the vehicle.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1108" /> In an action for the recovery of possession of goods let under a hire-purchase agreement or for payment of instalments due under such an agreement, the existing law allows the plaintiff to bring the proceedings in the court area where the contract is deemed to have been made.  Many of the hire-purchase finance companies are situated in Dublin, and it is generally claimed by them that the contracts which they enter into are made in Dublin, irrespective of where the hirer resides.  Under this system the defendant does not, in many cases, get a reasonable opportunity to appear in court.</P>
    <P>It is hardly necessary to say that, to a defendant resident in a remote part of the country, the prospect of having to come to Dublin for the hearing of a case can be somewhat intimidating. There are valuable reliefs which a defendant is entitled to receive if the court deems fit, and it is very important, therefore, that he should be given every opportunity to appear before the court.  Accordingly, I am satisfied that a defendant in a hire-purchase action ought to have the right to have the action heard by the court in the area in which he resides or carries on business and the Bill provides accordingly.  This is already the position in regard to actions brought in the District Court for the recovery of possession of goods let under hire-purchase agreements.</P>
    <P>As a result of the provision changing the locale for Circuit and District Court hearings, there may be a tendency for owners to bring hire-purchase actions in the High Court in Dublin.  In order to ensure that the intentions of the Bill are not frustrated in this manner, it is essential that the High Court should be able, of its own motion, to remit or transfer to the Circuit Court or the District Court proceedings which, in its opinion, ought to have been commenced in those courts.  A provision to this effect is included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to take advantage of the opportunity afforded by the Bill to revise the limits on the jurisdiction of the Circuit and District Courts in relation to hire-purchase actions.  It <Col N="1109" /> is now being provided that the Circuit Court shall have jurisdiction in all such actions where the hire-purchase price of the goods involved, or the amount of the claim for arrears of rentals, does not exceed £1,000 and that in the case of the District Court, the limit of jurisdiction shall be raised to £100.  The present limits of jurisdiction are £600 in the case of the Circuit Court and £50 in the case of the District Court.  The proposed revision of the limits of jurisdiction is justified by the change in money values since 1946.</P>
    <P>In hire-purchase actions taken in the High Court and Circuit Court, if the defendant does not enter an appearance or defence the owner is entitled to apply for judgment in the Office of the court.  I am informed that, in the majority of cases, defendants do not enter an appearance or defence and that judgment is marked in the office, usually for the recovery of the goods, arrears of rentals and costs.  This procedure deprives the defendants of the reliefs to which they may be entitled under the Act of 1946.  These reliefs include the making of a &ldquo;postponed Order&rdquo; for the return of the goods to the owner or the making of an Order for the transfer to the hirer of title to part of the goods and for the return of the remainder to the owner.</P>
    <P>While it may be that if the defendant does not appear in court, the judge is unlikely to grant any of these reliefs, he has discretion to do so and he may be disposed to exercise that discretion if there are any unusual circumstances in the case.  Where judgment is marked in the office, the Registrar has no such discretion even if it would manifestly be unjust to allow the plaintiff's claim in full.  I am satisfied, therefore, that in undefended actions for the recovery of possession of goods let under a hire-purchase agreement, the law should be altered so as to compel the plaintiff to apply to a judge in court for judgment and the Bill provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>Under the Hire-Purchase Act, 1946, if a hirer defaults under a hire-purchase agreement and determines <Col N="1110" /> the agreement by returning the goods to the owner, his liability for further payments to the owner is limited to payment of the arrears of rentals due at the time of termination of the agreement and, in addition, payment of such sum, if any, as, when added to the amounts already paid and the arrears due, is necessary to make up one-half of the total hire-purchase price.  The Act does not, however, provide for the limitation of the liability of a guarantor.  It is only equitable that, where the goods are returned to the owner, the liability of a guarantor should be limited in the same way as that of the hirer and provision to this effect is made in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The right conferred on a hirer under the Act of 1946, to terminate an agreement on payment of one-half of the hire-purchase price has created difficulties for some agencies which provide hire-purchase facilities for industrial plant and machinery.  In the case of machinery which may become obsolescent quickly, it may be in the hirer's interest to terminate the agreement by paying one-half of the hire-purchase price and returning the machinery to the company rather than to continue a transaction in respect of equipment which has become obsolete. Because of the restricted market for secondhand industrial machinery in this country, it may be difficult for the hire-purchase company to find a buyer, particularly if the machinery is specialised.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I feel that there are good grounds for altering the law in relation to hire-purchase transactions in respect of industrial plant or machinery so that the hirer in such a transaction will no longer have the right to terminate the relevant agreement on payment of one-half of the hire-purchase price.  The Bill provides, therefore, for exemption from the scope of the relevant provision of the 1946 Act in respect of transactions involving industrial plant or machinery the cash price of which exceeds £200.</P>
    <P>My attention has been drawn to an abuse arising out of the sale by dealers of goods which they have acquired under hire-purchase &ldquo;stocking&rdquo; agreements. Cases have occurred in which <Col N="1111" /> dealers have sold to the public goods so acquired, without first discharging the &ldquo;stocking&rdquo; agreement.  The purchaser found afterwards that he was not the legal owner of the goods and in order to acquire title to them, had also to pay the hire-purchase company concerned.  It is proposed to amend the law so as to safeguard the purchaser in cases of this kind.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might elaborate on what a &ldquo;stocking&rdquo; agreement is.  The obvious illustration is a garage displaying certain makes of cars.  These cars may be under hire-purchase agreement already with the garage proprietor as the hirer and some finance company as the owner.  If a person buys a car from the garage proprietor, his immediate liability is to the garage proprietor for hire-purchase repayments, if it is a hire-purchase agreement between him and the proprietor. However, having paid his liability to the garage proprietor, it has happened that the garage proprietor may not have paid his liability in turn to the hire-purchase company.  He may be a man of straw or not be available otherwise.  The hire-purchase company could then claim against the <i>bona fide</i> hirer from the garage proprietor who, as far as he knew, had become the purchaser and owner of the car.  That person has no answer to the hire-purchase company's claims.  It is obvious that such a situation needed to be remedied.</P>
    <P>These are the main provisions of the Bill, the need for which will, I feel sure, be generally accepted.  In the preparation of the measure, I have tried to hold the balance as evenly as possible between the parties to hire-purchase transactions and I hope that I have succeeded in so doing.  I feel sure that the general principles underlying the Bill will commend themselves to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this Bill was welcomed on all sides in the Dáil and I expect it will also be welcomed here.  The Minister gave us an unusually comprehensive introduction to this Bill today.  I had made some notes on my way down here today <Col N="1112" /> but I see that the Minister's introductory statement seems to have included all the points I had thought up.  It is only right that the statement should be comprehensive because hire-purchase has become a major feature of modern commercial life.  That can be judged by the increase both in the number and value of the transactions in this country over a very short period.  Indeed, we can see a dramatic increase.</P>
      <P>As far as we can see, this extension of hire-purchase is going to continue almost indefinitely.  It began with certain types of goods in certain types of businesses but now it would appear that it has extended into almost all forms of commercial transactions.  It even goes so far as to embrace selling holidays and travel.  We have many people coming to this country this year who have done so through hire-purchase or some similar type of agreement.</P>
      <P>Hire purchase, as the Minister said in his statement, is a mixed blessing. It is something that can confer immense benefits on the individual and on the community and on business generally in that it has stimulating effects by creating and expanding the demand for all sorts of commodities.  On the other hand, there is the other side of the picture.  It can also create many evils in that it can entice commercial and industrial concerns to resort to some of the less desirable methods we have seen in operation.  People are sometimes enticed to purchase goods which it is not really advisable for them to buy.  Transactions are conducted which may be economically unsound both for the individuals and for the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these things were apparently borne in mind in the preparation of this Bill.  The State, quite rightly, is taking power to have its hand on the wheel, so to speak, in regulating and controlling the operation of hire-purchase. Naturally, when the State takes powers such as these, there is always the danger that the powers may be abused or used in the wrong way.  That applies both as regards the hirer and also the owner.  It is very important that the rights of both <Col N="1113" /> people should be balanced and respected.</P>
    <P>As regards the hirer, it seems that in this Bill he is getting an extended protection.  That is quite right because the giving of extended privileges to the buyer really imposes upon the seller a greater wariness.  It will impose a greater necessity on the owner to see that the people who are pressed to buy articles will, in fact, be able to pay for them ultimately. Up to now, because of the powers the owner had to recover goods, the door was rather left open to high pressure salesmanship, without regard to the ability of the customer to pay.</P>
    <P>This Bill also gives certain powers to the State to invade the premises of individuals and companies in order to secure certain information.  We all agree that a reasonable degree of power must be given to ascertain the facts lying behind these hire-purchase transactions, but we must always be jealous of the rights of the individual to a reasonable amount of privacy, both in his individual and his business life.  Of course, these rights can be stretched too far either way.  It is to be hoped that the balance will be maintained in favour of keeping individual privacy and business privacy as far as possible.  I should hope that in the operation of this Bill that point will be safeguarded.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned the necessity for seeing that the true price of goods will always be made known in relation to the presentation of the goods.  Also it should be ensured that the purchaser will know what he is paying for the goods.  Very often people, if they find goods attractively presented for, say, 2/6d. or 5/- a week, are inclined to think only of the 2/6d. or 5/- without having regard to the ultimate obligation on them and what total sum they will have to pay ultimately. That is a very important point which should be stressed.</P>
    <P>Another important point is the necessity for a reasonable down payment in the first instance, because I think that many people would be deferred from entering into undesirable arrangements if they had to pay a comparatively substantial sum in the <Col N="1114" /> first instance.  I know in my own business that we have always found that people of straw will buy if they can get an article very quickly with a very small deposit, whereas if such people had to pay a reasonably decent-size deposit at the beginning, the story would be different.  The payment of a reasonable deposit is desirable and the most creditworthy people are attracted by insisting upon one.  You will thus get hirers who will not be letting themselves in for difficulties.</P>
    <P>There is another point about hire-purchase. You still hear people say that hire-purchase is a bad thing and should be frowned upon, but actually hire-purchase and the ability to be able to buy goods on the hire-purchase system is, in fact, a development that was inevitable in modern life where we live in times of constant inflation.  In the old days, we all remember what our fathers told us in regard to saving and buying.  We were not allowed to buy anything unless we saved up the money first and then when we had the money saved we made our purchase. That was a very good rule in the old days when money had a definite value.</P>
    <P>Nowadays, if one had to wait to save up the money to buy an article such as an essential household commodity, it would mean that at the end of five, six or seven years which it took us to save, the value of the money saved would have depreciated, whereas under the present system people can buy the necessary household articles first and pay afterwards.  They are thus enabled to set up a house at an earlier age than would be possible if they had to wait until the money was saved.  It enables people to get married younger and start a family at a much younger age and to enjoy a more comfortable way of life.</P>
    <P>Used properly, hire-purchase is of great benefit to the community.  Purchasing the articles first and paying for them later means that in our inflationary world, those who purchase articles are, in fact, paying for their goods in cheaper money.  That is an advantage to families and to people who invest properly and wisely.  The danger in hire-purchase is that of overstretching one's commitments or buying things which are, perhaps, luxuries <Col N="1115" /> and cannot really be afforded.  Another advantage of hire-purchase is that people are able to have luxuries which they otherwise would never be able to afford.  The ideal arrangement in any family would be to buy the essentials first and when they have been paid off to move on to the luxuries in a gradual process.  Unfortunately there are many cases where people mix up the essential needs of the home with the luxury articles at the same time, sometimes with very disastrous results.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking then, I think we shall all agree that it is right that this Bill, which amends the 1946 Act and which is the result of experience gained in the meantime and in which improvements are introduced, should be before us today.  I suppose it will not be the last Bill we shall have on hire-purchase in our lifetime but it is a step further and I think we all agree that it is a necessary one and we hope it will work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to address myself to a very narrow part of the Bill, namely Section 6.  The legal aspect of the Bill can be dealt with by the legal people in the Seanad.  The business aspect has already been dealt with by Senator McGuire and no doubt will be dealt with by other members.</P>
      <P>I should like to draw attention to Section 6 which is concerned with the general monetary situation and the balance of payments.  The Minister and Senator McGuire said that hire-purchase has grown materially in recent times and I agree entirely with what Senator McGuire said, that it has an effect on raising the standard of living.  The fact that people have to pay instalments on durable consumer goods makes them economise on other things and makes them save.  It is really an extension of the old building society method of buying a house.  It enables people to get possession of the object and to pay for it over a period of time.  It is also used in the purchase of industrial plant.  Business people who are not able to buy plant with their own capital have found the system a very useful one in modern society.</P>

    <P>As against that, of course, there is <Col N="1116" /> the danger of over-indebtedness, over-expansion and over-commitments.  From the national point of view, there is the danger that, if too much is spent on consumer goods, there may be pressure on the balance of payments.  Practically all countries in the world today have taken power, either through their Governments or through their Central Banks, to regulate hire-purchase from the point of view of its effect on the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>From that point of view, I propose to deal with the Bill.  The Banking Commission, which reported in 1938, referred to the growth of hire-purchase in Ireland.  It made the point that one effect of the growth of hire-purchase is to increase the instability of our economic system because, when there are fluctuations in the national economy, the fact that large parts of the national income are already pledged for repayments in hire-purchase means that less will be spent on other things.  Therefore the instability of other types of spending tends to be increased.</P>
    <P>The Banking Commission recommended that the Central Bank should have power to collect statistics about hire-purchase.  It did not recommend that the Central Bank should have power to control the volume or the terms of hire-purchase.  It recommended that the Bank should have power to collect and publish statistics. That power was in fact given to the Central Bank by the Central Bank Act, 1942, and people who read the Central Bank Report are aware that every year there is a section of the Report dealing with the volume of hire-purchase.  The Central Bank has no power to control the volume or the terms of hire-purchase.  The great growth that has taken place since the Central Bank Act, 1942, has made some power of that kind necessary. This Bill proposes to give power not to the Central Bank but to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, following the British precedent.  The power to regulate hire-purchase in Great Britain is in the hands of the Board of Trade and not of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>In recent years, many of the Irish <Col N="1117" /> banks have entered into hire-purchase business by taking shares in hire-purchase companies and another company of that kind is now about to be formed.  Therefore, when the banks begin to take part in hire-purchase, hire-purchase becomes part of the general credit mechanism of the country.  In modern times, it is generally recognised that the Central Bank or the Government, or the two together, should have some power to regulate the volume of credit.  Therefore, this Bill is really bringing us into line with other countries.  It is giving the Government&mdash;in this case, the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;power to regulate to some extent hire-purchase from the point of view of preventing an undue expansion of credit and therefore undue pressure in the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion in modern times in this country about how the Central Bank can deal with deficits in the balance of payments. One of the difficulties has been that it is extremely difficult for the Central Bank to regulate the Irish rate of interest independently of the British rate.  This is a matter into which I need not go now.  The regulation of hire-purchase is a method of control, an anti-inflationary measure that would help the balance of payments, which can be operated independently of any outside influence.  There is no reason why the regulations regarding hire-purchase in other countries should in any way hamper the Irish Minister for Industry and Commerce in making the appropriate hire-purchase regulations. From the point of view of monetary control, the volume of credit and the balance of payments, this Bill can play a very useful part.</P>
    <P>The whole question of the effect of hire-purchase on the credit situation was considered at length by the Radcliffe Committee on the Working of the Monetary System which reported last year.  This Committee reported that in the 1950's the regulation of hire-purchase by the Board of Trade had played a very important and effective part in controlling the monetary system in Great Britain.  It went so far as to say that the control <Col N="1118" /> of hire-purchase was more effective than either changes in bank rate or the credit squeeze.</P>
    <P>The benefit of hire-purchase control, according to the Radcliffe Committee, is that it operates quickly, whereas changes in bank rate and the volume of credit take a considerable period to permeate through the whole society.  By hire-purchase control the volume of expenditure on durable goods is quite rapidly reduced.  They pointed out that while in the long run it is not so effective because the percentage of people's incomes which they devote to payment of hire-purchase commitments probably remains the same, in the short period, restrictions on hire-purchase, the raising of the deposit and a reduction in the period of repayments, which really amounts to raising the amount of the monthly instalments, can have a very rapid effect on the monetary situation. It is an extremely important measure for correcting inflation in the short period.</P>
    <P>In spite of that, the Radcliffe Committee did not favour hire-purchase controls as a normal method of monetary management in Great Britain.  The reason for that was that they regarded hire-purchase controls as qualitative rather than quantitative, dealing with particular aspects of business rather than with the business situation as a whole and as being possibly discriminatory against certain types of trade.  The Committee said that hire-purchase regulation makes certain industries, the durable consumer goods industries, the residuary legatees of anti-inflationary action. It was in respect of that difficulty that they made the following remark which has been very widely quoted by people writing about the Radcliffe Committee:</P>
    <P>The regulation of hire-purchase is far removed from the smooth and widespread adjustment sometimes claimed as the virtue of monetary action.  This is no gentle hand on the steering wheel that keeps a well driven car in its right place on the road.</P>
    <P>The Radcliffe Committee recommended that hire-purchase regulation <Col N="1119" /> should be used only when something in the nature of an emergency begins to appear, that it should not be one of the normal methods of correcting disequilibrium in the balance of payments. It should be one of the measures resorted to when an inflationary condition began to appear serious.  They further recommended that any regulation of hire-purchase made in those circumstances should be the subject of Parliamentary debate.</P>
    <P>The reason why they recommended that was perfectly sound, that Government expenditure itself can be very inflationary and that it is no use restricting private consumer expenditure if the Government's own financial policy on the expenditure side is of an inflationary kind.  Therefore, the Radcliffe Committee recommended that, whenever hire-purchase controls were proposed, they should be debated in Parliament in order to give the members of Parliament an opportunity of debating and discussing the Government's own financial policy in relation to inflation.</P>
    <P>The conditions in England and in Ireland are so different that I do not think that what the Radcliffe Committee said about the undesirability of hire-purchase controls in normal times applies in this country.  The reason for that is that it is one of the few anti-inflationary measures which are independent of outside influences. In Great Britain, the Bank of England and the Treasury between them have considerable influence on the bank rate, on the volume of credit, on Government expenditure and on hire-purchase. The measures which can be taken in relation to the price and the volume of credit, the control of Government expenditure, and so on, must all operate together.  If they are all operated in the same direction, none of them need be operated very severely.  It is a combined operation. They are mutually helpful and complementary.</P>
    <P>Of course, on the other hand, there is the danger that they may neutralise each other, the measures taken in one field being neutralised by measures in another field, thereby subjecting the <Col N="1120" /> system to interruption and to interference without producing any positive result.  An example of that is that some years ago, when during the period of high bank rate, the Government were increasing the floating debt by the issue of a large volume of Treasury bills.  The result was that the monetary policy of the Bank of England was frustrated by the inflationary policy of the Treasury.</P>
    <P>Monetary policy requires a large admixture of suitable measures combined in the right proportions.  In Ireland, a bank rate policy is very difficult to apply.  Even if the Central Bank could affect rates of interest in Ireland, the Irish system is insensitive to changes.  Changes in bank rate depend on the presence of a very sensitive and responsive type of borrower whose borrowing is in terms of a very small margin of profit in which small changes in bank rate make a considerable difference.  In Ireland, the Central Bank is not able to control the rates in the commercial banking system, except perhaps to a very limited degree.  But, even if it were able to do so, the effect of commercial bank rate changes in Ireland would be quite unimportant in correcting over-expansion.</P>
    <P>We must therefore rely on other weapons of Budgetary control and hire-purchase control.  They must not pull in opposite directions.  It is no use for the Department of Industry and Commerce to put on controls on hire-purchase, if the Minister for Finance is pursuing an inflationary policy in his Budget, if he is borrowing and spending in an inflationary manner.  That is why I suggest that the amendments put down by some members of the Dáil in this matter should receive the serious attention of the Minister.  The amendments in the Dáil were to the effect that these hire-purchase Orders, which, under Section 4 of the Bill, are to lie on the Table of the House, should be debated.  That would be completely in agreement with the proposals of the Radcliffe Committee in England.  The Radcliffe Committee recommended that any hire-purchase controls should be the subject of Parliamentary debate.  I suggest that these Orders, instead of being just laid on the Table of the House, should be <Col N="1121" /> debated in the House and should be the subject of a positive motion by the Minister before they come into effect. In that case, the Dáil and Seanad would have the opportunity of considering how far these Orders were necessary and how far they could be reduced in severity by suitable changes in Government policy.</P>
    <P>As I have said already, the chief villain in modern times in regard to inflation is often the Government itself. There is no use in the Government imposing measures designed to curtail expenditure when they are pursuing an inflationary policy themselves. There is a great deal to be said for debating these Orders, as suggested in the amendments put down in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>It is provided in subsection (5) of Section 6 of the Bill that the Minister for Industry and Commerce must consult the Minister for Finance before making an Order.  I would suggest that the body to consult is the Central Bank.  The primary purpose of the Central Bank is to deal with the whole monetary and credit situation and to take whatever anti-inflationary measures are available.  Consequently before any Order of this kind is made, the Central Bank should be consulted regarding its effect on the whole credit situation in the country.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested recently that hire-purchase controls could be helped by a variable purchase tax on durable consumer goods.  If the Minister for Finance had power to vary a purchase tax, within certain limits, on durable consumer goods, it would be a valuable additional weapon for regulating the volume of expenditure on those goods. The Minister might consider that suggestion, because, as I said, there are a number of weapons, so to speak, in the Government armoury for dealing with inflation, and if each weapon is used a little bit, none of them will need to be used very much and, therefore, they will help each other. I suggest if the Minister for Finance had power to vary a purchase tax on durable consumer goods within narrowly defined limits, the necessity for drastic action in relation to hire-purchase <Col N="1122" /> might be reduced.  I also suggest that any variations of that kind, and any variations in Orders in relation to hire-purchase, should be debated in Parliament in order that the members of Parliament who represent the public will be in a position to investigate whether the inflation and the disequilibrium in the balance of payments was caused by the public or by the Government.</P>

Rud tábhachtach é seo mar uaireannta, ní thuigeann daoine i gceart cad tá a dhéanamh acu i gcásanna mar seo.</P>
      <P>Go dtí seo, ní raibh an iomad gnoithe den tsórt seo ar súil ach anois tá sé ag leathnú ar fud na tíre agus ar an ábhar sin, caithfidh an Rialtas súil a choimeád ar gnothaí fruilcheannagh ó lá go lá mar atá luaite sa mBille, ar eagla go rachfadh siad ro-fhada sa ghnó.  Ach is ó thaobh eacnamuíochta na tíre is mó is ceart an Bille seo do mheas agus mar gheall ar sin is cóir na comhachtaí atá luaite sa Bhille seo a thabhairt don Aire Tionscail agus Trachtála.</P>
      <P>I have not very much to say on this measure.  I realise, of course, that this is a highly technical Bill and that one would need to have a specialised knowledge to deal adequately with it. Like other speakers who have already addressed themselves to it, I welcome the Bill for a few reasons, but I welcome it especially because I realise it is necessary for any responsible Government, or the Minister answerable to the Government, to keep a very strict eye on these hire-purchase transactions all over the country.  As the Minister has stated, these transactions have very much increased in numbers over the years.  A few years ago, there, were many people in the country who did not pay any attention at all to these transactions because they were not at that time commonplace.  Now they have become a permanent feature of our commercial life and, for that reason, it is necessary for the Government and the Minister to be watchful of these transactions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1123" /> The difficulty about many matters like this is that there can be two sides to them, a good side and a bad.  These hire-purchase transactions can be very good, if, as the Minister said, they are kept within sensible and reasonable bounds.  If they are allowed to go beyond that, if there is indiscriminate indulgence in them, they can be very injurious to the overall economy of the country in the end, as well as to the individuals participating in them. That has been the experience in other countries already, and even across the Border, we have seen it, because they found themselves up against inflation and they had to take the necessary steps to curb that inflation.  We do not want any situation of that kind to develop here, and that is why it is necessary to have a Bill of this type enacted.</P>
    <P>I regard Part II of the Bill as the most important part, because it gives the Minister power to make Orders dealing with these transactions to which I have referred.  Senator O'Brien referred to those Orders and intimated that they should be open to Parliamentary debate.  I am very doubtful about that myself.  In the first place, it is the Government and the responsible Minister who have to watch these trends from day to day. That is their responsibility, and it is hardly likely that any Order will ever be made unless circumstances arise in connection with hire-purchase transactions which justify the Order and make it necessary.</P>
    <P>In any event, if there is any desire to have a Parliamentary discussion on these Orders, it could be done in another way.  A motion could be brought before either of the Houses of the Oireachtas to have the Order anulled and that, in itself, would give rise to a Parliamentary debate.  It is entirely too much to expect that there should be a Parliamentary discussion on every Order made by the Minister to deal with the matters envisaged in this Bill for the regulation of these hire-purchase transactions.  I would not be in favour of that.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, this is a highly technical measure and it does <Col N="1124" /> not lend itself to a long discussion on Second Reading.  It is an amendment of the Act of 1946 and if these hire-purchase transactions go on at the rate they have been going on over the past 20 years, I can envisage the necessity for amending legislation later on, maybe, according as the system grows.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a measure of the important place hire-purchase has come to occupy in our society that Senator O'Brien found it necessary to devote a serious contribution to this debate.  Of course, hire-purchase is only an extension of the facilities which were enjoyed heretofore by people in good standing, and it has now become so respectable that I feel we should accept it as being a necessary enlargement of our way of living.</P>
      <P>I shall be very brief.  I want to refer to one particular kind of hire-purchase: I think the last speaker had it in mind. I refer to the supply of certain kinds of domestic goods, sometimes of poor quality, meritricious in appearance, probably in wear and endurance and, in the end, very expensive for the purchaser.</P>
      <P>The Minister is taking power to insist that the cash price is placed on any advertisement or illustration of articles either in newspapers or shop windows.  The hire-purchase price should also be indicated clearly.  By &ldquo;hire-purchase price&rdquo; I mean the sum of all the hire-purchase payments that will be made.  Then nobody could make a decision to buy on hire-purchase without fully realising the cost.  That would be a desirable development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an amending Bill.  I think we are all indebted to the Minister for giving us a comprehensive statement when opening this Second Reading debate.  We are also privileged to hear Senator O'Brien deal with the importance of the measure in relation to the whole national economy.  This is an important Bill but I want to deal with a smaller aspect of it which was already touched upon by Senator Barry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned with the effect of hire-purchase on the lower income <Col N="1125" /> group of the community who have availed and who continue to avail of the benefits of hire-purchase.  However, hire-purchase is a mixed blessing in some cases.  I think it is right that the Minister should take power to come to the protection of the consumer in this instance.</P>
    <P>In hire-purchase, that relationship which formally applied between the seller of the goods and the purchaser disappears very quickly and in place of the seller, the impersonal finance company steps in and continues to be the owner of the goods until the purchaser has paid the final instalment. The finance company does not enter into the sale of the goods.  It is not concerned as to the quality or price of the goods or the creditworthiness of the purchaser.  I think it is right that the Minister should come in and take power in Part II to make Orders for, I hope, the protection of the consumer &mdash;the consumer in the lower income group.  These people have and will continue to purchase the necessaries for setting up homes&mdash;for furnishing their homes through hire-purchase.</P>
    <P>I have seen these goods for sale.  I have seen them advertised.  The shops selling them have a very glib way of putting it across to the consumer.  You see something labelled at 5/- deposit, maybe, and 2/6d. a week for 2 years. The Minister has explained that it will be compulsory, on the same advertisement or illustration, to quote the cash price.  But that is not a complete and I do not think a very satisfactory picture for the people in the lower income group who would contemplate the purchase of these goods.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Barry, I think the final price they have to pay in hire-purchase as well as the cash price should be clearly shown to these people.  I shall take an easy illustration of, say, 5/- deposit and 2/6d. a week for two years.  The price the purchaser would eventually have to pay would be £13 5s.  It is not a complete answer or picture to him to have shown on that advertisement or illustration &ldquo;Cash Price, £7 0s. 0d.&rdquo;  It would be to his benefit and a service to him if, at the same time, he was shown that the total amount he will <Col N="1126" /> have to pay on hire-purchase, plus the deposit, was £13 5s. and that he would be able to make a ready comparison of the price for which he could get the article if he were able or prepared to pay for it on the spot.</P>
    <P>Another aspect arises and again it is in relation to the lower income group.  I know, and the Minister has underlined this, that hire-purchase has become respectable.  That is as it should be when it is a second class form of saving.  It is now used for industrial goods, for capital goods.  In many instances, I think these people availing of these services have an alternative&mdash;maybe not in all cases but in some cases.  They can compare the price and the facilities they would get under hire-purchase with that of borrowing the money by way of overdraft in the bank or some other method.  However, the lower income group who have to purchase these consumer goods by hire-purchase have not that alternative.  It is necessary that there should be some protection for them in relation to the interest they have to pay when availing of hire-purchase.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the various forms of control and what he could do under these Orders.  He did not mention the question of interest which is of importance.  These people &mdash;I would say maybe unfortunately in many cases&mdash;have no alternative but to avail of the facilities of hire-purchase. I do not think there is any real competition between various finance companies by way of giving cheaper interest rates and better facilities. I do not think there is.  I think the Minister should have power to come in for the protection of the consumer and to provide that there should be a maximum rate of interest allowed for the calculation of the instalments to be paid under hire-purchase. The Minister has not said in his statement that he will avail of the Order to control that aspect.  I hope that when he comes to reply he will assure us that he does intend to take power to control the rate of interest and will fix a maximum rate of interest which will be of some service and some protection to the lower income group of the country <Col N="1127" /> who have to avail of the arrangements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise a point in regard to the statistics of hire-purchase. Would the Central Bank or the Minister have any figures of the amount of extra capital which is exported, as it were, and of which we would not have any account here? Suppose an article is imported at a cash price of £30 and is later sold, on hire-purchase agreement, for a total price of, say, £40 over a number of years.  Assuming that that transaction is financed by foreign capital, has the Minister any figures to show what amount such transactions would come to in a year?  On the basis of £15½ million hire-purchase agreements, it would be a considerable figure.  Nowhere in our balance of payments figures have we that figure.  Would it be possible for the Minister to ascertain what it is?</P>
      <P>Partly arising out of that comes the suggestion that if he has not power under Section 6 to authorise a lesser deposit on goods manufactured in Ireland, one would hope he had that power.  I am not quite sure whether under that section it would be possible to do that.  The regulation made would have to be a general regulation.</P>
      <P>Section 6 should be amended to allow a lesser deposit to be deemed necessary on goods of Irish manufacture.  It would help the internal trade and it would also stop the unknown leakage of capital from the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my praise to the praise already given by other Senators.  I think the Minister and the Department ought to be complimented on what is a very thoughtful and a very carefully-framed Bill.  Anyone reading it clause by clause and section by section will recognise that all kinds of contingencies are foreseen and carefully dealt with. The intention of the Bill is quite clearly good but I think the implementation matches the intention.  As well as that, I am particularly glad to see that there are several sections the main purpose of which is to safeguard the rights of the <Col N="1128" /> ordinary citizen on either side of these hire-purchase agreements.</P>
      <P>For instance, in Section 8, having allowed for the fact that authorised officers may have certain powers of investigation and so on, it is specifically laid down that the authorised officer &ldquo;shall be furnished with a warrant of his appointment ... and shall produce the warrant to the person in charge of the premises&rdquo;.  That is the kind of thing which one might take for granted and yet all too often it is left out of a Bill.  We are asked to assume that, of course, he will have a certificate authorising him and, of course, will have to produce it.  I prefer, as I think all of us in this House would prefer, that it be quite simply included in the Bill, as it is here.</P>
      <P>Section 9, subsection (2) of the Bill deals with a matter that has concerned us in the past in regard to other Bills.  Section 9, subsection (2), provides that &ldquo;No one shall be required ...to answer any question or to give any evidence tending to criminate himself.&rdquo;  I think that is very important.  It has been argued before that you do not have to say that because you can legitimately assume it.  Here, I am glad to say, the Minister has included it.</P>
      <P>There are also laid down in Section 10&mdash;Senator McGuire referred to it&mdash; (a) that the information so acquired shall not be disclosed and (b) the exceptions which must be made for the purpose of usefully using that information.  That is to say, it may, of course, be disclosed to his superiors or in court, should the occasion arise.  Similarly, too, the Bill contains what I think are most valuable provisions, provisions about the jurisdiction of the various courts and the power that is here given to the High Court to transfer or remit cases to the lower court.  That seems to me to be the mark of a very carefully thought measure which does a great deal to anticipate the kind of loopholes that might otherwise be there and to stop them up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Something has been said already about hire-purchase in general.  Senator Murphy spoke about interest rates <Col N="1129" /> I think what he says is very important. One of the things that, perhaps, very few people advert to fully is the true amount of interest they are paying. When they buy goods on hire-purchase, they assume that the amount of interest they are paying is simply the difference between the cash price and the hire-purchase price, forgetting that from the very time they pay their first deposit and month after month as they pay instalment after instalment, they are still, in fact, paying interest upon money which, originally borrowed, has in large measure been paid back.  The calculation of the interest would often appear to be made as if a month before the total sum is paid back, one owes the total sum, which, of course, is very far from being the case.</P>
    <P>I would support Senator Murphy consequently in his suggestion that the interest rates are higher than is justified. I should like to see the Minister take powers to make provisions or even Orders to control the interest rates.  A good deal will depend upon how the Minister uses the powers to make Orders under this Bill.  I have every confidence that he will use them well.</P>
    <P>The point made by Senator McGuire is certainly one that will appeal to the Minister and to all of us, that it should be possible to insist by law that in the case of many goods bought on hire-purchase, there shall be a reasonable down payment.  It has been met across the water quite recently in many cases by an insistence upon the down payment being a considerable percentage of the final sum. I think any discouragement of the sort of thing referred to by Senator McGuire of seeing goods advertised at 2/- a month without any reference to the deposit, is to be welcomed.  I hope the Minister will use his power to discourage it.  In other words, a person reasonably requiring certain goods should be in a position, before entering into such an agreement, to make a reasonable down payment.  I think we should insist that should be so.</P>
    <P>We have all accepted the notion, I think, pretty well, of hire-purchase and its necessity.  I think we are right in doing so.  In one sense, it constitutes <Col N="1130" /> the poor man's overdraft.  The better-off sections of the community borrow from the bank and the less wealthy borrow from the finance corporation through the medium of the shopkeeper.  I was a little startled to hear a suggestion that this is a form of saving.  I have never been very clear in my mind on these matters of credit and money and so on.  It is a kind of magic, as far as I am concerned. It is odd to say that if I am putting away money to pay off my debts with it, this constitutes a form of saving.  It is a very odd form of saving.  I do not think, except in a very esoteric sense, it could be regarded as saving.  When you are paying out money to pay for money you borrowed in the past, that seems to me not to constitute saving in the sense in which I understand it.</P>
    <P>A point was made by several Senators, and, I think, by Senator Murphy in particular, about the form of the agreement that people sign in order to get goods on hire-purchase.  The Minister takes power to make Orders relating to the form of agreements under Section 6, subsection (2), paragraph (a).  I think it very important that considerable thought be given to that.  I should almost be inclined to ask the Minister to take power to insist upon a certain minimum size of type being used in these agreements.  I have seen agreements extending over two full foolscap pages in which the most vital clause was a tiny clause right at the bottom of the second page and in minute print which might be quite difficult for many people to read.  That tiny and apparently harmless clause which the signer does not read could, in certain circumstances, be quite vital to him.  It might mean the loss of the goods.  In thinking about the form of the agreement, one should think about its clearness to the purchaser and even think about such things as the size of the type.  Important clauses committing one to certain penalties should not be concealed by the smallness of the type in which they are printed.</P>
    <P>One point which I should like to ask the Minister is in relation to Section 6 and the type of Orders which he can make, and also in relation to the definitions in Section 3. <Col N="1131" /> Subsection (1) of Section 6 gives the Minister power to do certain things by Order&mdash;the regulation and control of the hire-purchase, the selling by credit sales agreements of goods or any class or description of goods.  Is the Minister satisfied that &ldquo;goods&rdquo; is a sufficiently comprehensive term? Can it be taken to mean, in the absence of any definition to that effect, goods or services?  We have already heard that you can take a holiday or go on a journey by hire-purchase.  The hope is that soon you will be able to get a University degree by hire-purchase. I do not know whether the hire-purchase would come under the goods or the holiday or the aeroplane trip.  You can even buy your own funeral by hire-purchase now, I understand.  Does that come under the heading of &ldquo;goods&rdquo;?  There are, in other words a number of services for which hire-purchase agreement methods are being used.  Is the Minister satisfied that his phrasing is sufficiently comprehensive or should it be amended here in Section 6 to read &ldquo;goods and services&rdquo; or else give an extended definition, in Section 3, of the word &ldquo;goods&rdquo; as used in subsection (1) of Section 6?</P>
    <P>I should also like to put the point that the principle of hire-purchase appears to me to be most valid and to be most justifiable in relation to durable goods, goods enjoyed not only during the period of payment for them but afterwards also.  I would put forward the view that hire-purchase on things of considerably less durability, in the case of goods or services which are rapidly consumed, may well be bad in its effects. Having said that, I shall conclude by adding that I think this a good Bill under which the Minister is given wide powers and I should like to express the hope that those powers will be used broadly and well.</P>

      <P>A good deal of what I had intended to say has already been said by previous Senators.  There is no doubt at all that many of the amendments, particularly those contained in Part 3, were highly necessary and long <Col N="1132" /> overdue, particularly in the interests of the hirers of goods under the Hire-Purchase Acts.  I am particularly pleased that the Minister has made provision in the Bill with regard to the entry of judgment in default of defence and appearance and that he is providing in particular for the situation in which the hirer of the goods will be able to dispute his liability with the owner in the court area in which the hirer lives.  I am aware of a number of cases where people have not, as the Minister said, come to Dublin to dispute their liability or availed themselves of the reliefs which they are entitled to under the Act because of the fact that it involved travelling to Dublin and perhaps a lot of unnecessary expenditure on their part.</P>
      <P>In regard to that, I am not quite satisfied whether the power which the High Court will have under Section 26 to remit of its own motion an action to the appropriate court can be availed of at the instance of a defendant in an action.  I think that is so at the moment, that a defendant in an action which has been instituted in the High Court can apply to the High Court to have it remitted to the Circuit Court. I have not had an opportunity of looking up the relevant sections in the Courts of Justice Acts, to see if the power which the defendant has at the present time is taken away or merely reserved to the High Court in hire-purchase proceedings, to remit to the appropriate Circuit Court.  The Minister may be able to clarify that in his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington has very rightly paid tribute to the Minister for the safeguards for individuals on both sides of the hire-purchase agreement contained in the Bill and I want to add my appreciation to that of Senator Sheehy Skeffington in that respect.  I was particularly pleased when I read the Bill to note that the Minister had again included in a Bill which he was piloting through the House the section that nobody shall be obliged to answer any question or to give any answer tending to criminate him.  I can only hope that if the Prices Bill of 1957 ever comes up for amendment during the <Col N="1133" /> Minister's term of office, it will be amended to incorporate this subsection in the appropriate section in that Act as it stands.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is the section which will regulate the mechanism and procedure for hire-purchase transactions.  As I mentioned before, I am not all satisfied that in this Parliament we should relieve ourselves of the responsibility of challenging or examining Orders which by various statutes are required to be laid before each House of Parliament. I notice on today's Order Paper that there are 35 of what are called Statutory Presentations and 24 Non-Statutory Presentations.  Of the 35 Statutory Presentations, 13 comprise Orders all of which I am sure can be annulled or revoked within the period of 21 days from today.  There are 40 other Orders which apparently do not fall into that category.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to say, as Senator Ó Ciosáin said, that Section 4 of this Bill provides power to annul any regulation which may be made by the Minister under Section 6.  If the facility were provided for members of the Oireachtas of sending them each of these Orders which are required to be laid before the Houses, so that they might have an opportunity of examining them, there might be something to be said for a provision such as Section 4, but the fact of the matter is that all these Orders which are required to be laid before the Houses of Parliament are never examined.  I doubt if Deputies or Senators would have time to examine each of these regulations, so that, in effect, what we are doing in this Bill is giving power to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to make what legislation or regulations he thinks proper and which are never afterwards likely to be subjected to scrutiny by either House of Parliament.</P>
    <P>The stage has been reached where so much power has been vested in various Ministers of State to make regulations that Parliament, or at least this House will have to take note of the position and establish some kind of machinery as a House of the Oireachtas for the examination of the various regulations and Orders which <Col N="1134" /> are laid before it with a view to seeing whether in fact these regulations conform with what it conceives to be the spirit and intention of the legislation under which the regulations are made.</P>
    <P>We have a Statutory Instruments Committee but its powers are restricted and its terms of reference do not extend to requiring it to examine the desirability of the regulations which it examines from time to time.  If Parliamentary control is to be retained and if Parliament, and not Departments of State, is to be supreme, then the Oireachtas must provide itself with the machinery for examining the various regulations which it decides should be laid before it and examining them with a view to seeing whether they should be annulled or not.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his comprehensive review of the Bill, said that he thought that everybody would agree that the conduct of hire-purchase transactions should continue to be subject to regulation. If by &ldquo;regulation,&rdquo; the Minister means regulation by legislation, we certainly agree with him but if it is to be regulation merely by an Order made by the Minister, we must part company with him in that view.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy and Senator Sheehy Skeffington have referred to interest rates and I myself, when I read subsection (6), wondered whether in fact the Minister proposed to take the power, subject to Parliament, to regulate rates of interest.  I have seen various calculations of the rate of interest paid by the hirers of goods and it can vary upwards of 100 per cent.  That is getting back to the old days of usury.  It is a thing I do not like and which I am sure nobody else likes, that the necessity of the poorer section and the relatively better-off section of the community should be availed of or exploited in order to provide finance houses and hire-purchase firms with a usurious rate of interest.  I strongly support the plea which has been made for some regulation and control of the rate of interest.</P>
    <P>From what I have heard, hire-purchase is so profitable that if a person goes into a shop with the intention of buying for cash certain <Col N="1135" /> commodities, the last thing certain shopkeepers want the person to do is to pay for the goods in cash.  That person will always be advised to use the cash to pay deposits on a variety of goods, some of which he or she does not want. It is well known that people at auctions particularly the weaker sex, get a bit flustered and are always out for a bargain.  Many a woman has gone into a shop with the intention of buying only a particular article and has gone home with many more articles than she had intended buying, simply because of the facilities of hire-purchase and because of the strong inducements held out by shopkeepers to buy these articles on hire-purchase.  That is a fair indication of the profit that is to be obtained under the hire-purchase system, and that arises mainly from the extraordinary high rates of interest available.</P>
    <P>Senator Cole has referred to another point which I had intended to mention and in which I support him, that is, that there should be a differential rate of deposit between Irish-manufactured or Irish-assembled goods and imported goods.  The document we received in the post this morning urging us to buy Irish is not half as effective as would be a lower percentage of the total purchase price by way of deposit for Irish manufactured goods.  That is the best way to direct people's attention to, and to make attractive, Irish manufactured goods.</P>
    <P>Quite an amount of the interest earned in hire-purchase transactions flows out of this country to Great Britain where, to my own knowledge, some of the hire-purchase credit companies&mdash;I do not know how many&mdash; have their headquarters.  I have seen hire-purchase agreements which were deemed to be made in Dublin and in such cases many difficulties arise because these companies operating here, in whatever way they manage to operate, do not seem to have any registered office which would enable a hirer to serve them in this country with a civil bill or with a civil process.  A large amount of the profit from hire-purchase transactions is flowing out of this country to Great Britain, and for that <Col N="1136" /> reason, if for no other, the rate of interest should be controlled by legislation and as it appears to be possible to do so only by regulation under this Bill, by regulation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given us some very interesting information about &ldquo;stocking&rdquo; agreements, and shown the perils to which the unfortunate purchaser can be exposed when he goes into some concerns.  I must confess I had never heard of the &ldquo;stocking&rdquo; agreements to which the Minister referred but I am very pleased that power has been taken under this Bill to protect a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser.</P>
    <P>In this Bill, the Minister has certainly held the balance between the hire-purchase companies and the citizen. If anything, the balance tilts in favour of the hirer or the purchaser, and for these reasons, I welcome and support this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I wish to express my gratitude to the Senators who have spoken in favour of the Bill. I was really confident that it would get such a reception in the Seanad because it was based largely on experience and on a desire to effect improvements where such could be effected. As the last speaker has pointed out, endorsing my own remarks made earlier, it seeks also to preserve a fair balance between the hirer and the owner of goods or between the purchaser and the hire-purchase company.</P>
      <P>The points made were points which I might well have expected to be made during the course of the debate.  They are points which, perhaps, most people would consider worth making to have them examined home.  In some respects, I am sure that even the Senators who made the suggestions will agree that there are at least certain difficulties in the way and, from my point of view, they would not be practical solutions to the difficulties they envisage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I may I shall go through the different contributions and pick out the points as they arise.  The first one I might refer to was made by Senator O'Brien.  In his contribution Senator O'Brien dealt largely with the dangers that hire-purchase transactions have in <Col N="1137" /> inflationary conditions, and in conditions in which there might be an adverse balance of payments.  I do not know whether or not he seemed to suggest that the Central Bank ought to have the power of control on these transactions which it is proposed here to give to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but he certainly made the point that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should consult the Central Bank as well as the Minister for Finance before taking certain remedial action, in the event of inflationary trends or imbalance trends coming round.</P>
    <P>In the Bill, the consultation is limited to the Minister for Finance because it is assumed that he will have direct access to and advice from the Central Bank.  While the advice of the Central Bank will always be valuable, the ultimate responsibility, as well as the statutory responsibility, rests on the Minister for Finance so to order and control the finances of the State as to ensure that no damage will be done to the country's economy, at least, in so far as his powers can effect a remedy.  Therefore, I think the form of solution provided, of the Minister for Industry and Commerce consulting with the Minister for Finance, is adequate before certain regulations are required to be made.</P>
    <P>The regulations to which Senator O'Brien and other Senators referred were largely those concerning minimum deposits and maximum periods of repayment.  I want to be quite clear at this stage, and I should like to say that the intention is that such regulations will be made only in circumstances of national economic difficulties, in circumstances where inflationary trends have displayed themselves, or where the import of consumer goods has produced an imbalance in our international payments position.</P>
    <P>So far as the other Orders are concerned, those providing for the form of agreement, the information to be given in visual advertisements, it is my intention to make those Orders very quickly, certainly as quickly as will give all those concerned reasonable time to adjust themselves to the <Col N="1138" /> new forms of agreement and forms of visual advertisement.  That, I think, brings me to the other point which was made, that there might, by statute or by regulation, be a certain maximum on the rate of interest to be charged.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest that that would import into this Bill the concept of price control, the idea of putting upper limits on all forms of interest charges.  Hire-purchase is only one form of the credit business and the rates of interest chargeable in connection with hire-purchase cannot, in my opinion, be disassociated from interest rates charged by banks, building societies and other credit agencies. As well as that, there are certain difficulties of a practical nature in imposing maximum rates of interest.  In the first instance, if one suggests 12 per cent. as a maximum rate of interest, one can readily appreciate that the effective rate over a period would depend on the length of the period.</P>
    <P>I shall give a practical example. If there is a transaction for goods worth £100 and if there is a deposit of, say, £20 and if the rate of interest is fixed at 12 per cent., if the transaction is to be completed in a year, the effective rate of interest would be 27.7 per cent.  In the same case, where the transaction is to operate over a period of three years&mdash;in other words, if there were 36 monthly instalments&mdash;the effective rate would be 9.7 per cent. So there is that difficulty in saying simply that the maximum rate of interest should be so and so.</P>
    <P>To come back to the point I was making, I suggest that Section 6 would amply cover it, if it were properly utilised.  Let us take this visual advertisement first of all.  In the regulations being made to provide for it&mdash; and that will be done at an early date&mdash;these advertisements will be required to show the hire-purchase price: in other words, the total of the payments to be made by the purchaser including the deposit and the total of the weekly or monthly payments, as the case may be.  They will also show the cash price&mdash;the price for which the goods could be bought for cash. Therefore, it would be a very easy matter if a simple deduction were <Col N="1139" /> made and regard had to the number of instalments to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I may not have explained myself clearly.

      <P>Senator Cole made the point, which was supported by Senator O'Quigley, that it might be possible to give preferential rates on amounts of deposit in the case of Irish goods as against imported goods.  As I have said already, the intention with regard to minimum deposits is that these will be required <Col N="1140" /> only in the event of certain difficulties in our balance of payments, or inflationary trends.  It will be possible, within the powers given under Section 6, to give a preferential rate in the minimum deposit as between Irish and imported goods.  There will be some difficulty if that happens in the case of goods which contain Irish and foreign material.  That would create a certain problem for whoever would have to make an Order but the power is there.  I should not like to say, offhand, that I could use it but it can be examined and it would, as Senator O'Quigley suggests, be an added incentive in the drive for the promotion of Irish goods.</P>
      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington's point is covered already in the 1946 Act.  In the first instance, services, as such, are not provided for in this Bill. Therefore, one may procure his holidays under hire-purchase but it is not the intention to control such a transaction by this Bill.  &ldquo;Goods&rdquo; are defined in Section 1 of the 1946 Act as &ldquo;goods within the meaning of the Sale of Goods Act.&rdquo;  There can be no doubt as to what the word &ldquo;goods&rdquo; means in this Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Quigley made a complaint against Section 4 and other Senators mentioned it as well.  That is the section which requires regulations under Section 6 to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. Senator O'Brien mentioned it in a different context.  His point was that when there are inflationary trends, the Government are not always blameless in bringing about such a state of affairs.  Senator O'Quigley's point was the desirability of making the Legislature the effective controlling authority in the State rather than a Minister or his advisers.  I can answer both points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to Senator O'Brien that Section 4 is adequate to meet the point of view he expresses.  If circumstances are such that any member of the Oireachtas requires that an Order made under Section 6 shall be discussed in the House, to bring home to the Government or to the country that certain circumstances exist that ought <Col N="1141" /> to be watched, he may initiate a debate by bringing the appropriate motion before the House of which he is a member, I do not think there is any difficulty about that.</P>
    <P>That brings me to Senator O'Quigley's suggestion that so many of these Orders are made from time to time that it would be difficult for an individual Senator or Deputy to keep on top of all the Orders as they are made.  One can use that argument in another way and ask one to visualise the condition, of the Order Paper of each House of the Oireachtas if all these Orders had to be debated in turn.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied with the provisions of Section 4, requiring the Order, when made, to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and enabling a resolution to be discussed within 21 sitting days of the making of the Order and annulled, if necessary.  The powers of veto of the Oireachtas are well safeguarded. The point made by Senator O'Brien is, I think, reasonably met.</P>
    <P>I should like to say to Senator O'Quigley that the making of these Orders in advance of putting them on the Table of each House of the Oireachtas is not new, but I do not think he suggested it was new.  I think he suggested it is time we had another look at this practice.  In the special circumstances of the conditions which are to be met in the regulations made under this Bill, I think the necessity for speed of action would often arise, especially in the case of inflationary trends.  If either House of the Oireachtas were not meeting at a particular time&mdash;say, during the summer vacation&mdash;first of all, it would be perhaps difficult to convene a meeting of each House of the Oireachtas in that period and it might in some circumstances practically amount to closing the stable door after the horse had gone.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that that would happen in all cases or that it is very likely, but, in general, I think it would be necessary to act reasonably quickly in the event of certain financial difficulties arising within the country.  In 1956, the inter-Party Government had to act fairly quickly.  They had to take advantage of emergency legislation to make one of these Orders.  I think <Col N="1142" /> nobody denied that a certain expedition was necessary.  I think nobody suggested at the time that the inter-Party Government acted without due regard for the public interest or without due regard for the powers of each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The other point I should answer was one raised by Senator Cole.  I am afraid I can give the Senator no information at the moment about the amount of capital leaving the country as a result of hire-purchase transactions. It would require a very prolonged and detailed survey of each transaction, probably going down to an examination of each individual case.  It is possible from the returns of these companies, that we may get such information and if it is, I hope to have it available for the Senator on the next occasion.</P>
    <P>The other point was that too much of this capital was leaving the country. The fact now that Irish banks and Irish hire-purchase companies, as such, have been going into this business is, I think, an answer to such a complaint and the only effective answer.  I think nobody will complain if Irish companies go into this business, and, if there is a profit to be made out of it, make a reasonable profit and retain as much of the profits at home for use in this country as is possible.</P>
    <P>I think I have mentioned most, if not all, of the points raised in the course of the debate.  Again, I would to thank the Seanad for the manner in which it accepted the Bill.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been introduced in response to many requests over the past number of years to successive Ministers for Agriculture to provide greater protection to livestock owners against marauding dogs.  Complaints <Col N="1143" /> of serious damage to livestock, especially to sheep and lambs, have been numerous and various suggestions have been made for coping with the problem.  The existing statute law is not good enough to deal with it and the present Bill is an attempt to give protection to stock-owners and at the same time to be be fair to dog owners who keep their dogs under control.</P>
      <P>The chief present statute to deal with dogs is the Dogs Act, 1906.  This Act gives local authorities power to make regulations requiring that dogs be kept under control between sunset and sunrise, and most local authorities have made such regulations.  The Act also provides that where a dog is proved to have attacked cattle or sheep it can be dealt with as a dangerous dog under the Dogs Act, 1871, that is, an Order can be made by the District Court directing the owner to have the dog kept under proper control or destroyed. Neither of these provisions is of much use in dealing with ownerless or stray dogs which are the types of dog which mainly cause damage to livestock.</P>
      <P>Under the Dogs Act, 1906, the owner of a dog is liable in damages for injury done to livestock but of course the owner of the dog must be identified before an action for damages can be brought and, even if he is identified, he may not have the means to pay damages.  It is of interest to note that the law as set out in the Dogs Act, 1906, as regards the liability of owners for damage done by their dogs to livestock is different from the usual law as regards damage by dogs in that it is not necessary for the person claiming the damages to show that the dog had a vicious propensity.</P>
      <P>The present Bill has three main provisions. First, it makes it an offence punishable by a fine of £20 for a first offence and a fine of £50 for a second offence in respect of the same dog for the owner or person in charge of a dog if the dog worries livestock.  The section provides that it shall be a good defence to prove that reasonable care was taken to prevent the worrying of the livestock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1144" /> Secondly, the Bill enables dogs found worrying livestock on agricultural land to be seized, detained and subsequently destroyed if not claimed.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the Bill provides that it will be a good defence in an action for damages for the shooting of a dog if it is proved that the dog was shot when worrying livestock lawfully on the land.  The Bill contains a number of safeguards so as to prevent dogs being shot recklessly or spitefully.  It does not deprive the stock owner of his right to sue the dog owner for damages for loss to his stock.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been prepared in response to many demands from the farming community and I recommend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLOSullivan" hpid="Mr. J.L. O'Sullivan Mr. J.L. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.L. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  The only thing I can say is that I do not think it goes far enough yet. In the past, we have seen dogs attacking sheep.  These dogs cannot be shot or detained during that period.  It is very hard on the owners of flocks of sheep especially to find that it is very difficult to trace the dogs which have attacked sheep.  It is also very hard to detain them.</P>
      <P>The sheep industry in this country is so important that I think the Minister should go somewhat further in this Bill.  In the past, owners of dogs that were seen attacking sheep have taken the owners of the flocks of sheep to court and got damages.  This Bill will be welcomed by the agricultural community. I think it is a step in the right direction but I still say that it could go further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speaker, I must say that I was extremely disappointed that the Bill did not go further but at the same time, I find it very difficult to suggest any improvements.  It is very difficult for the owners of sheep, even if they find a dog worrying those sheep, to seize that dog or even identify it and follow it.  I know of cases where men on horseback followed the dogs and lost them.  The worrying of sheep is probably not so prevalent in the west of Ireland where some dogs are kept. Sheep know the dogs and that is important. Sheep who never see a dog get very frightened if dogs worry them. <Col N="1145" /> If the sheep are used to being collected off the mountains by dogs, they are not frightened of them.  It is in counties like Cavan that I have heard of the greatest damage being done by dogs.</P>
      <P>There are certain suggestions I should like to make to the Minister to try to guard against the worrying of sheep by dogs.  Once dogs get the taste of sheep and once they start worrying the sheep, they keep on, until eventually they have to be destroyed.  One suggestion I make is that in those areas where there have been continued attacks on sheep, the Guards should be allowed to declare that area, be it a townland or a number of townlands, a special area for the protection of sheep for a month or two.  All dogs in that area should be actually confined during the period of darkness and any dog found in that area should be shot, especially if found wandering through the fields.  Some provision of that kind is the only thing that will stop this.  I know farmers&mdash;neighbours of my own&mdash;who have lost £200 worth of sheep in one year.  That is a common occurrence in Cavan for the past number of years where small farmers keep a few sheep.</P>
      <P>I do not think it would be a very difficult regulation to enforce.  It is impossible for the Guards to seize dogs and nearly impossible for owners of flocks to seize them, but if continual sheep worrying were going on in a certain area, some regulation could be made that all dogs in townlands must be kept under control at night.  Something like that is the only way to make people control their dogs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is relevant to mention that there was one insurance company in Cavan which insured flocks but which ceased to insure because of the terrific damage done to flocks.  They ceased accepting any new clients and refused to accept them under any conditions. Another possibility which might be considered is that if the owner of the flock believes that a certain dog has attacked the sheep but cannot actually prove it, the Guards might be empowered to seize that dog and keep it under veterinary attention in order that its droppings could be examined for wool.  It might not be absolute <Col N="1146" /> proof but at least it would go a certain way to prove that that dog had been worrying the sheep because usually wool is indigestible.  I have heard of a case&mdash;I think it was in the north of Ireland&mdash;where the owner of a dog was convicted by reason of that proof. Those are the chief suggestions which I should like to make and I think that the Minister should try to go further in this Bill than he has.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Louis Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In these days, when the demand is for increased production from the land, if the economy is to be improved, as other speakers have indicated, legislation such as this which affects the farming community and which is for the protection of their livestock is to be welcomed.  Despite the amount of land that has been acquired in recent years for afforestation, I believe that the sheep population is bigger to-day than it has been for many years.  The quality of the sheep has improved very much in my county and the number has also increased.  For that reason, this Bill is a good Bill and one that should improve the protection of sheep.</P>
      <P>I should like to suggest to the Minister that on Committee Stage, Section 2 might be improved because the section suggests that if the dog belongs to the occupier of the land, then there is no infringement of the law.  The Minister is well aware, however, that in many counties, in the west of Ireland particularly, a great amount of land is held in common.  There may be up to 20 or 30 owners of the commonage and that is where the sheep graze during the summer months.  It could be suggested, therefore, that an occupier of a common, if he was also the owner of the dog might not commit an offence under this section and I should like the Minister to consider improving that section in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already suggested, I do not think the statistical returns in connection with sheep and cattle are accurate, because, owing to the investigation of means for old age pensions, medical cards and unemployment assistance, the owners of livestock are not anxious to disclose the full amount of livestock which they <Col N="1147" /> own.  The Minister may be aware that there was some difficulty in connection with the enforcement of the bovine tuberculosis regulations because of the fact that owners were not always particularly anxious to show the number of livestock they had.  It was stated one time by an inspector of taxes across the water that even though he understood that the population of Ireland was about 4 million, from his statistics, the population must be about 10 million because of the number of the dependants claimed by people working in England.  Similarly, I feel that the returns made by the Statistics Office may not be as accurate as they should be.  At any rate, the Bill is a considerable improvement on previous legislation in connection with protection of livestock and I, in common with other speakers, welcome it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Cole has referred to a fact which seems to be related to a question which I wanted to ask.  He mentioned that where sheep flocks were not accustomed to dogs, they might very well give every appearance of being worried if a dog suddenly walked through the field.  Are we happy just to say in Section 2, for instance, &ldquo;where a dog worries livestock&rdquo;? Have we no definition of &ldquo;worrying&rdquo;?  Is that left entirely to the owner of livestock to assess?  Can he say &ldquo;My flock was worried; I will kill your dog&rdquo;?  In order to have this Bill legitimately applied, what kind of definition did the Minister have in mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point is that the Minister mentioned that there were various safeguards against using the powers of the Bill recklessly and spitefully.  I think he is justified in saying that because under Section 4 a variety of safeguards are inserted.  For instance, the dog can be penalised or possibly shot only for worrying livestock on agricultural land which is a very important point because those of us who know the more remote parts of the country realise that livestock are more frequently to be found on the roads than on agricultural land.  Consequently, this Bill would not apply unless <Col N="1148" /> the dog happened inadvertently to chase the sheep into a field off the road where it would normally have its being.</P>
    <P>We have to try to hold a balance here and I think the situation contains a certain amount of irony as between the sheep owner and the dog owner. The irony arises from the fact that they are probably the same people, both belong to the farming community. It is not some city person who comes to the country, but nine times out of ten, the dogs concerned are owned by some section of the farming community.  They may not be owned by sheep-owning farmers but they come from the same section of the community.</P>
    <P>I suggest that a good deal of this trouble is caused by a lack of a sense of responsibility in some sections of the farming community.  The responsibility of the livestock owner is to keep his stock off the roads.  Most of them do not seem to worry about that at all.  The responsibility of the dog owner is to see that the young dogs are trained.  Neglect of those requirements can, as Senator Cole said, have most devastating effects.</P>
    <P>I should like to appeal&mdash;and in most parts of the country this sort of appeal ought to be effective&mdash;for more co-operation between people who have trouble with dogs and the people who have dogs over which they have little or no control, never bothering to give the dog any kind of training or to keep it in at particularly dangerous periods for the sheep.</P>
    <P>I am a little disturbed about paragraph (d) of Section 4 which states part of what shall constitute a good defence if a defendant is having damages sought against him for the shooting of a dog.  Paragraph (d) says that if somebody shoots a dog, it shall be a good defence if the defendant proves that the owner of the dog was, when the dog was shot, not known to the defendant.</P>
    <P>Apart from the fact that that might be ambiguous&mdash;I can see a lawyer might twist two meanings out of that, that the owner was not known to the defendant&mdash;it also seems a little arbitrary to say that if you do not <Col N="1149" /> know the owner, if you do not recognise the dog as belonging to somebody you know, you may shoot it, and provided you tell the Civic Guards within 48 hours, under paragraph (e), that will be all right and will constitute a good defence.</P>
    <P>I can sympathise with those Senators who say more powers should be given and these powers are necessary, but I am not quite happy that that defence: &ldquo;I did not know whose dog it was when I shot it&rdquo; is a very good defence to insert in the Bill, because it is so easy to say: &ldquo;I shot the dog and I did not realise until after I had shot it whose dog it was.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It is of interest to note in relation to a couple of motions we had here recently that the law of this country favours animals to a greater extent than it does human beings.  If I am attacked and bitten by a dog, I have to prove, as the Minister has said, that the dog had no vicious propensities or what we call in law <i>scienter</i>, but under the 1906 Act and under this Act, you have only to establish that if a dog worried animals and has killed your animals, and even though it was a first offence, you are entitled to damages from the owner of the dog.  It is a first offence in the case of animals, whereas you have to prove it was a second offence in the case of a human being, which is a fair indication of our attitude in this country towards the protection of animals of all kinds.</P>

      <P>I do not want to muzzle the Senator.  I do suggest to the Minister that when considering this Bill we ought not to take all stages of it&mdash;although I know the Minister would be anxious to get them&mdash; because a number of suggestions have been made that might be put down by way of amendments which the Minister might consider.  Frankly, I was disappointed with this Bill when I read it because I thought it would provide some more effective way of dealing with marauding dogs.  Admittedly, the problem is extremely difficult. The Bill provides a right to the owner of livestock to shoot a dog when he finds it worrying his livestock. That gives some protection for livestock.  The measure also provides that certain things are offences but I would support the suggestion made by Senator Cole that during the lambing season, when apparently most damage is done by dogs, there should be an obligation in rural areas on all owners of dogs to keep their dogs in at night time.</P>
      <P>In many cases untold damage has been done to sheep and lambs because of the attacks of dogs at night time. If, for the closed season, beginning some time in December and ending around the end of March, dogs were kept in at night, as, in any event, they should be, we would go a good distance towards protecting livestock or protecting the sheep, which I think are the chief sufferers from marauding dogs during the hours of darkness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one other point that arises on the Bill&mdash;why it was not considered necessary to include other animals besides cattle, sheep and horses.  Probably cattle do not suffer so much from dogs or perhaps they have better powers of resisting them. I am wondering whether the definition of livestock is sufficiently comprehensive, whether, for instance, &ldquo;horses&rdquo; includes donkeys.  The number of donkeys in the country is declining but there is many a small farmer in the west of Ireland who, if his donkey were to be set upon by dogs, would feel as much aggrieved and would probably suffer as much as a more wealthy owner whose horse had been set upon by dogs.  Perhaps the Minister <Col N="1151" /> would indicate why this definition has been confined merely to the types of animals mentioned.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, this measure will be greatly welcomed by the farming community.  I hope it will be effective but I do not think it will be as effective as the necessities of the situation demand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady2" hpid="Mr. Brady Mr. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the Bill but, like Senator O'Sullivan, I do not think the Bill goes far enough.  I was rather amused by Senator Sheehy Skeffington's speech.  We all know that it is largely during the lambing season that protection is needed.  I remember a few years ago down in Ennis people came to the county council imploring us to put legislation into operation controlling dogs between six in the evening and sunrise.  We had to put that into force.  It was very unpopular with some people.  The real cause of the trouble is that in various parts of the country people have three or four dogs, mongrels and different breeds of dogs, which are absolutely starving. That is particularly true around towns and villages, not so much in the country.  As a rule, the farming community feed their dogs pretty well.  A man who has any love at all for a dog will see that it is as well treated as any other animal.  But we know quite well that in rural areas and around villages, half those dogs are half starved and go around in packs, particularly in the lambing season.  I was speaking to several farmers who go in for ewes on a very large scale.  They told me that since their sheep were attacked and badly torn by dogs and the lambs killed, they never had the same love for them afterwards.  It was a kind of turning point.  It is not a superstition but they seemed to have had bad luck with the ewes afterwards.  Another way of dealing with the problem&mdash;except that people do not like to do it&mdash;is to put a notice on the lands of the laying of poison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the detection of does, one hears very funny stories even from very intelligent people about how far does travel.  They go nine or 10 miles perhaps when they do damage.  Then <Col N="1152" /> they go and wash their face and dry themselves in the grass.  I know a man who was going to the stores with two pigs and midway between the place I live, Broadford, and Limerick, he met two dogs belonging to a farmer he knew.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady2" hpid="Mr. Brady Mr. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, a farmer.  He proceeded to Limerick and left his pigs and spent the day there.  He went to the farmer later to have the dogs destroyed for he had not any doubt in the world about what the dogs had been doing&mdash;they were covered with blood&mdash;and the man did have them destroyed.</P>
      <P>The only doubt is whether the Bill is strong enough.  Our sympathy should go out to the farmer.  In the lambing season, usually a very cold season of the year, March or April, these people are out at night with the lantern after the ewes and the lambs.  They are trying to do all they possibly can for them to keep them alive and that is enough without having dogs coming killing the lambs and driving the sheep mad.  As a farmer myself who knows everything about it, I have not the smallest doubt that the Bill is necessary and, like Senator O'Sullivan, I think its powers may not be strong enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedOSullivan" hpid="Mr. Ted O'Sullivan Mr. Ted O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ted O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to those of Senators who have welcomed the Bill.  We have not had legislation to assist us in dealing with stray dogs since 1906. I do know that county councils have had power to make an order to compel owners to keep the dogs in at night. I had experience of such an order being made by a county council but I could not see any effective means by which the county council could enforce the order.  You would want hundreds of Guards working at night to enforce an order like that.  It is absolutely ineffective. This Bill will go part of the way and it is very welcome as we have been waiting for something in that line for so many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said about justice to dog owners.  The Minister is anxious to give them justice and Senators are anxious that dogs should not be shot for any other reason than that they are <Col N="1153" /> doing harm, but, in my opinion, if a dog is any way valuable or an owner thinks much of his dog, the dog will be kept under control.  If an owner has any regard for a dog, either because he is a good servant or because he is of value as a greyhound or a sports dog, then the owner will ensure that he is under control and in at night.  If he is missing, the owner will be perturbed.</P>
    <P>The dog enemies of livestock and sheep are the stray dogs and unfortunately we have many hundreds of them. It is hard to assess the amount of damage done annually by stray dogs in the lambing season alone and mind you, when killer dogs go to work, they do not confine their activities to the lambing season for I have known them to pull down a very big strong sheep. They do damage, too, to livestock, to milch cows and in-calf cattle.  Where you have stray dogs chasing the cattle all night, the farmer cannot stay up to watch and try to identify the dog.  It would be impossible for a man to identify a dog at night anyway, especially a stray dog.  This Bill gives a good defence to a farmer who shoots a stray dog and if a man who has a valuable dog does not keep him under control, he will have to take the risk, too, if his dog is doing harm.</P>
    <P>I think the amount of damage done among cattle is nearly as great as the damage done to sheep, especially on the borders of villages, towns and cities where there are so many of those stray animals.  Senator Brady mentioned a case of a farmer's dogs doing damage.  It is quite true that they do occasionally, but in all my life I have not known a farmer who heard or suspected that his dog was damaging cattle or sheep who did not kill the dog himself.  It is a tradition in farming not to keep a killer dog or one which does damage.  The farmer will see to it himself that the dog is killed.</P>
    <P>There are too many safeguards in the Bill for the dogs, for stray dogs, at any rate.  Senator O'Quigley mentioned the other Bill under which a dog is entitled to his first bite and you have to prove that he has bitten already before the owner can be made to pay compensation, but in this case <Col N="1154" /> you could not stay up all night to ensure that the dog which kills a sheep tonight is the same dog as killed a sheep last night.  The Bill is very welcome but I would like it to go further, if possible.  People say they are worried about the injustice to dogs but there is no need, because the man who has a valuable dog will mind him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Bill is a step in the right direction but it has not gone far enough.  However, the Minister has shown his good intentions.  There is a little bit of leniency towards the dogs but at the same time, I think he means well towards the sheep owners and perhaps he will come back later and produce a better Bill.  I have practical experience of dogs worrying sheep and I am well aware of the anxiety and loss which result.</P>
      <P>It generally happens at lambing time when the sheep are not able to run away from the dogs and very considerable damage is done.  We read very often in the papers about such things happening but I suggest that only one out of every ten cases gets into the papers.  I knew a man who had 37 pure-bred ewes and 35 were destroyed in one night.  Senator Cole referred to the western counties as if much damage was not done there, but we read in the papers that the pulpits of Mayo were used to ask the people to restrain their dogs and keep them tied up at night, owing to the amount of damage done to sheep.</P>
      <P>Section 3 of the Bill provides that:</P>
      <P>a member of the Garda Síochána may seize the dog, and thereupon the provisions of Sections 3 and 9 of the Dogs Act, 1906, in relation to seized stray dogs shall apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trouble is that the Garda is generally asleep at the time when the dog is attacking the sheep, and the owner is also asleep.  The amount of worrying of sheep done in the daylight is very small.  It is done at night and it is difficult to pin down the dog or dogs which did it.  They sometimes go in droves, and when they are pinned down, the owners say they do not <Col N="1155" /> belong to them; that they have never seen them; that they are strays who have strayed in.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another point. Why are not more dogs licensed? Why are not all dogs licensed?  In old days when we had another country governing us, all the dogs were licensed, but it is not so now.  I shall tell a story of what happened in my district.  A new and very active Garda came into the district and the first thing he started to do was to find out what dogs were licensed.  The first court day after he arrived in the parish he had ten or 12 people in court.  They were fined.  They were sheep owners and they said: &ldquo;Why do you not see about the other dogs?  No dog in the parish is licensed.&rdquo;  He did, and he had another batch in court the next court day.  He was getting on fairly well but nobody in the parish would speak to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady2" hpid="Mr. Brady Mr. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda are supposed to see that the dogs are licensed. Did the people not talk to him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>He had to apply for a transfer right away.  I suggest to the Minister that he might find out what proportion of dogs are licensed. I suppose that may be an explanation of why they are not licensed.  It is the hungry dogs which do the harm, usually, and the stray dogs.  An amount of stray dogs turn up and where they come from, I do not know, but it is the stray dogs which do the harm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate has seemed to be a debate between the dog lovers and the sheep owners.  I think the sheep owners have won, more or less, by 10 to one, I should say.  I wish the Minister good luck and I urge him to go further ahead and to bring some comfort to the sheep owners.  People living near towns and villages have given up keeping sheep owing to the ravages of these dogs.  Even in more out-of-the-way places, there have been many raids.  I have never heard of a raid on a public road.  It is generally in the fields they raid.  However, I am in favour of the Bill and I should <Col N="1156" /> like to see greater safeguards in it for the sheep owners.</P>

      <P>Having heard some of the speeches here today, I begin to wonder if I was born in the country.  We heard country people contradict one another on what happens in regard to the worrying of sheep.  I was about to say in Irish that I should love to be able so eloquently to put the facts as they were put by Senator O Siochfhradha and Senator J.L. O'Sullivan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe a hungry dog ever worried a sheep.  What Senator <Col N="1158" /> Ó Siochfhradha said about the rogue dog training other dogs is true.  They do it for amusement and at night when everybody is asleep.  I cannot see any practical good in this Bill.  The main thing is that dogs should be controlled. The only thing to do is to tie them up at night in districts where there are sheep and other animals. Naturally, a dog in a farmer's house or on a farmer's premises need not be tied indoors.  If there are strangers about, he will still be a watchdog.</P>
    <P>The proper system of control is to have dogs restrained in these districts at night.  I do not believe that town dogs or dogs near the towns do the damage.  It is just that there is a rogue dog in the vicinity.  He will deceive his owner and the neighbours and he does all the things that have so eloquently been described by Senator Ó Siochfhradha.  Knowing he is guilty of offences against the community, the community being the people as well as the sheep, the dog conceals evidence of the damage he does.</P>
    <P>It has struck me as peculiar that there is nothing positive in the Bill but if you are prosecuted for shooting a dog, you are told what defence you can put up.  There is nothing in the Bill providing: &ldquo;If you see a dog worrying your sheep, you can shoot him.&rdquo;  Senator Sheehy Skeffington was worried about the definition of &ldquo;worrying livestock&rdquo;.  Most of us know that a definition is not necessary for that.  You will know what &ldquo;worrying livestock&rdquo; is when you see a dog doing it.  It is not done for food or to kill the animal or because the dog is hungry.  As a veterinary officer, I have had to examine 10 or 15 sheep, some alive and some dead, that had been worried by dogs.  None of them had been eaten.  Even when the lamb is killed, it is not eaten and therefore it is not a question of hunger.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Siochfhradha pointed out that rogue dogs train other dogs and that they travel in companies.  I do not see very much good in the Bill.  My impression is that the only satisfactory way of controlling the dogs in any <Col N="1159" /> period of danger is to have them restrained and kept tied up at night.  It has to be done.  It is not a great hardship on the dog owner.  If, at the lambing season, there is a danger, I think most farmers would be glad enough to do that.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill. I do not know if it will go far enough to meet the wishes of the farming community. I ask myself whether the Bill was intended for the benefit of the livestock owner or of the dog owner. There have been very fine contributions to this debate.  I was reared on a farm and I have a fair amount of experience of dogs and sheep.  I do not believe that one per cent. of the dogs go out for the actual killing of sheep. They start off in a playful way to worry a sheep which then gets excited. I think Senator Brady said that people feel that once sheep are worried by dogs, they never seem to have any luck with them.  It is an accepted fact, which I think Senator Ó Donnabháin can confirm, that once sheep are worried unduly, they are completely finished.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  In any future legislation, the Minister should come down on the side of the sheep-owner and disregard the dog-owner.</P>

      <P>The discussion was lengthy but interesting. If Senators feel they could improve on the measure by way of amendment on Committee Stage, I shall have no objection to their doing so.  I do not think one will get very far when one comes to analyse the measure very closely.  I listened attentively to all suggestions.</P>
      <P>I am a layman but I have some knowledge of this problem, in a practical sense, as have other Senators. I confess that when I saw this Bill I was disappointed.  Then I asked myself: &ldquo;Why were a number of my predecessors hesitant about approaching this problem and trying to strengthen the law in regard to it?&rdquo;  I suppose it was because it was difficult to strengthen the law to give the owner of the stock additional protection and at the same time, not to overdo it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1160" /> I might say that all my sympathy is with the stockowner.  For example, I cannot see how Senator Cole's suggestion, which was repeated by other Senators, could be operated because the power was already there for local bodies.  I do not know in how many counties it was done but in my county, dog owners were obliged to keep their animals under control from a certain time in the evening until a certain time in the morning, but who is to enforce that?  What further strengthening can we provide in the law which will enable these orders to be enforced?</P>
    <P>Even if it were possible, say, to select some smaller area within a county, what would one achieve by doing that in the sense that the dogs doing the damage within that area might come from miles outside the area?  To tell the truth&mdash;I think it was Senator Ó Donnabháin made the criticism&mdash;the way in which Section 4 is put is not very convincing to the lay mind.  I think it will be found that Section 4, which is in fact, the effective section, gives to the sheep owner the only protection this Bill provides.  I suppose it would satisfy Senator Ó Donnabháin and myself better if it said that the owners of the sheep should go out and shoot any dog they meet on the land.  It would be more convincing and more satisfying to us if the language used were somewhat along that line.  It is put in a legal way and I have no doubt that it has, in fact, the same effect.</P>
    <P>That is the section which provides, as far as I can see, the sort of protection that I personally wanted to provide for the stockowner.  There are some safeguards.  One of the safeguards mentioned in Section 4 was one that, perhaps, could effect an improvement. I think I mentioned it in the Dáil and there was no apparent hostility to it.  In fact, I threw out the suggestion that if there was any desire to remove this protective provision for the dog owners, I would be agreeable to take that course.  I do not think that, even if we were to remove it, the Bill would be strengthened to any great extent from the stockowners' point of view.  I can think of nothing else you could do.  You cannot just <Col N="1161" /> go out wholesale and say: &ldquo;We shall shoot every dog we meet.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Well, this fellow is not going to get away from me.&rdquo;  You keep on walking and the dog keeps fooling you along and finally you lose the battle, the dog and everything else.  It is not complete protection.  It would be a source of great satisfaction to me if I found myself in that position that I had a gun in my hand and was in a position to relieve the countryside of that animal.  Having enabled the herd-owner to take action and protect himself from the possibility of having a claim against him for damages for having killed the dog, I do not see how you can go much further.</P>

      <P>The intention there was that if the stockowner came within reach of the dog which was worrying his stock, he could shoot him, but if he did not shoot him then, how can you provide that he will know the dog in a month?  You cannot provide for a case such as this, that a month <Col N="1162" /> after such an incident I see a dog and say to myself: &ldquo;I have a kind of notion that that is the dog that was worrying my sheep&rdquo; and I just take a shot at him.</P>
      <P>I would welcome any effort on the part of the Seanad to strengthen this measure.  I think Senator Brady mentioned the damage done by dogs in towns and in villages.  I believe they are not always the offenders, but, in the main, they are.  I was asked a question about the number of dogs in respect of which licences had been taken out.  You cannot know what percentage of dogs are licensed because nobody knows the number of dogs in the country.  It is a matter in which I should be interested but not having the responsibility, and not wanting the responsibility of the enforcement of that law, I can do nothing about it.</P>
      <P>I certainly think that if it were a case that people in towns and villages just reared dogs and let them ramble around, perhaps in most cases not having licences for them, it would be a rather serious matter and those who are responsible could take very helpful action to ease that situation.  I should be glad if they would take it, that is, if it is not being done.  I have, of course, an idea of the number of dogs which have been licensed down the years but that does not prove anything, in the sense that I do not know the total number of dogs in the country.</P>
      <P>As the Senators are anxious to come back to this subject again, I am sure they will be thinking about it and we shall see what type of amendments they will bring in.  Therefore, I need not say anything more on this subject, except to assure the House, lest there be any feeling that I have any substantial leaning towards the dog owners&mdash;I keep dogs myself and like them, as does everybody else&mdash;that the weight of my reasoning and sympathy must be, of course, with the stockowners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can think of nothing that is so aggravating, that is not only a matter of serious loss to an owner but guaranteed to outrage him, than to find his sheep huddled into some corner of <Col N="1163" /> a field with half a dozen of them stuck on the ditches and the briers, some of them torn and some of them dead.  As Senator Brady mentioned, one feels that it is some sort of unlucky omen and while I suppose there is nothing in that sort of thing, one more or less expects that nothing is likely to go well for one in the sheep world for quite a time.  If the Seanad can do better in this Bill than I have done, nobody will be more pleased than I.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a simple Bill to extend the time for the completion of works in respect of which grants are payable under the Housing Acts.  These works comprise the erection, reconstruction or repair and improvement of dwelling houses and the provision of private water supplies and sewerage facilities.</P>
      <P>The effective provision of the Bill is contained in Section 2 which provides for an extension from the 1st April, 1960, to the 1st April, 1962, of the date for the completion of work so as to qualify for payment of any appropriate grant.  No changes in the amounts of the grants are proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A comprehensive housing measure, consolidating the provisions of the Labourers Acts and the Housing of the Working Classes Acts in a single code and including amendments of the existing codes is in course of preparation. The grant and other relevant provisions appropriate to private housing are also proposed to be consolidated in a single measure when a suitable opportunity presents itself.  I have therefore decided to limit my immediate proposals to a simple continuing measure which, from the very beginning of the new financial year, will <Col N="1164" /> enable private persons to plan for the carrying out of house-building and house-improvement works in the next two years, with the knowledge that grants will be available at the rates and on the conditions that have prevailed for the last two years.</P>
    <P>The Housing (Amendment) Act, 1958, provided for increased scales of grants for the reconstruction, repair and improvement of existing houses and for the provision of sanitary facilities in houses.  It also provided for the payment of an additional sum in respect of the erection, of a new house provided with private sanitary facilities. The stimulus given by the increased grants has resulted in a remarkable response.  The numbers of grants approved during the financial year 1959/1960, as compared with the year 1958/1959, showed increases of 52.3 per cent.  for new houses, 42.9 per cent.  for reconstruction, repair or improvement of existing houses and 57.2 per cent.  for water and sewerage grants.</P>
    <P>While the emphasis has, in recent years, tended to be on the conservation or improvement of existing houses rather than on the erection of new houses, nevertheless, there is still evidence of a need for new houses.  The impetus given to the meeting of that need by the improved facilities made available under the 1958 Housing Act has been clearly indicated by the increase in the numbers of grants approved in the past year.  The number of new houses completed during the financial year 1959/1960 was 3,190, as compared with 2,626 in the previous year.  The numbers of new house grants approved in the same periods were 3,868 and 2,539 respectively.</P>
    <P>The work of reconstruction, repair or improvement of existing houses is a very important aspect of private housing activities.  These houses represent an important national asset and much has been done with the aid of grants to maintain and improve them.  It is essential that these activities should be encouraged and, indeed, that the pace should be accelerated.  There is enormous scope for work of this kind and the generous facilities provided by way of grants and advances are proving to be a very desirable form of <Col N="1165" /> encouragement.  During the financial year 1959/1960 the number of grants of this type finally paid was 7,851, as compared with 6,517 in the previous twelve months.  The numbers of grants approved in the same periods were 13,312 and 9,314 respectively.</P>
    <P>A scheme of grants which is of special interest to the rural population is that which assists the provision of piped water supply and sewerage facilities in dwelling-houses.  Generally, in the less densely populated areas, piped facilities have not been available hitherto and the residents have been largely dependent on drawing water from streams or wells.  The broad improvement in the economic level, the spread of rural electrification and the amount of mechanisation on farms have combined to bring the amenities which town dwellers have long enjoyed within reach of many who reside even in quite isolated parts of the country. The response to the increased grants which were provided by the Act of 1958 has given evidence, if such were needed, of the urge to improve the rural environment.</P>
    <P>A most welcome development and one which gives proof of the community spirit in rural areas has been the co-operation of groups of persons in the provision of private water supply schemes in the outlying rural areas. These co-operative schemes will prove to be of immense benefit in the more isolated parts of the country, and particularly in areas which would not normally be served by public water supplies.  The formulation of these schemes is still only in the early experimental stage.  Our experience to date, however, has been that group communities are quick to appreciate the very real benefits that accrue by co-operative effort and I look forward with confidence to a wide extension of this type of scheme in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not a great deal to be said about this Bill which is only a Continuing Bill as the Minister has said and of course the policy of grants for new houses or reconstruction, for water or sewerage installation is one which must commend itself to <Col N="1166" /> members of this House on every side. There are only two or three points I should like to make.</P>
      <P>The first relates to the approval of grants by the Department of Local Government.  I gathered from the Minister that in the past year, some 13,000 grants had been approved and in the previous year something over 9,000.  I must say it comes as something of a surprise to me that the number of grants has reached such a high level, but I think one complaint which members of the public have about the administration of grants, whether for reconstruction, new houses or the installation of sewerage or water, is the long time that elapses between the application for the grant, the visit of the inspector and eventual approval by the inspector or indication by him of his requirements.  I think perhaps that since the number of applications has increased, the Minister might consider increasing, if only on a temporary basis, the staff of his Department to enable people to proceed with these works.</P>
      <P>I should perhaps point out that for some people, most especially in rural Ireland, delay in obtaining approval for particular works is quite an important factor.  At this time of year particularly when there is not that much work to be done on the farm for a few weeks and later on, when the hay has been saved, people have some time to carry out the necessary works on their homes.  Consequently, it is of importance to these people that they should be able to begin the work at the time when they are ready, not at the time when some inspector decides that he has time to come round and inspect the place.  It would greatly facilitate the people of rural Ireland if they were assured that at the time they were ready to proceed, the inspector should be also ready to call and do whatever inspection was necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I should not be wrong in saying that part of the philosophy behind this grant of £275 or £285 in respect of construction of dwelling houses was to enable a contractor to make roads and instal a sewerage and water system on undeveloped sites.  I <Col N="1167" /> think, therefore, I would not be out of order in referring to a matter which arises on new estates which have been developed as a result of grants under the various housing Acts during the past 20 or 30 years.  A particular problem has arisen on housing estates on the perimeter of Dublin and one to which I should like the Minister to direct his attention.</P>
    <P>The position up to date has been this: a builder has taken over a particular area of ground; he has developed it up to a certain point by installing water and sewerage and building a road; people have come along and purchased the houses from him and paid him his full grant.  That is all right up to a point but what has happened then is that the builder has either gone broke or he has sold all the houses in the area and is not to be found or he has no further interest in the owners of the houses on the estate he has developed.  But the roads have not been developed to the satisfaction of the local authority and they maintain that they are not liable to take over the roads until certain things have been completed&mdash; and the builder is either unobtainable or he has no intention of completing the development of the site.</P>
    <P>Apparently the local authority, Dublin Corporation or Dublin County Council, are not concerned unduly to take over these roads.  The people on these new estates therefore find that the county council will not take over the roads because the site has not been properly developed and they cannot exert any pressure or get the county council to exert any pressure upon the builder to complete the estate so that the county council will have no excuse for not taking over the roads.  If the state of legislation is such that the ball can be kicked from one person to another and that these people are to be left there, the Minister should consider amending the legislation to provide some remedy for the people who have paid for these houses, with the exception of the grant, out of their own money.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the housing legislation to which I should <Col N="1168" /> like to draw attention.  One sees from time to time in the Courts what we may call building contract actions. We find quite frequently that the quality of the houses which have been passed for Department of Local Government and local authority housing grants has not been satisfactory from the point of view of construction. I know quite a number of houses that were passed by the Department's inspectors which, after a period of less than a year, have proved quite unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I do not know to what extent the Department of Local Government inspectors inspect the houses which they are supposed to inspect for the purpose of passing them for a grant. It may well be that it is the business of the people building the house and getting the grant to discharge their liability but, from the national point of view, with which the Minister should be concerned, we are getting a great deal less value for the money being spent on housing both out of public revenue and the people's private earnings than would be got if there were proper supervision.  I had a house built on one of the new estates and it was completed to my satisfaction because I had my own architect there.</P>
    <P>In relation to houses of that kind, the quality of the workmanship has not been what it should be.  I have known people who had to have their houses completely stripped of plaster and replastered because there were leakages in the flat roof of the garage adjoining the dwelling itself.  With regard to my own house, I think there were at least six occasions on which inspectors came either from the county council or the Department of Local Government.  To my certain knowledge, the inspection consisted of the inspectors coming to the house and seeing that there were, in fact, so many bedrooms and so many rooms downstairs.  That was the sum total of the inspection so far as they were concerned.  That, to my mind, is not the way in which a house should be inspected for the purpose of passing it for a Local Government grant.  These men should see that the quality of the workmanship <Col N="1169" /> and the materials is what it should be.</P>
    <P>I have a suggestion to make to the Minister which I think would be worth considering.  In my own case, I happened to know an architect or, at least, I knew the brother of an architect and in this country, if you know a man's brother, it is as good as knowing him himself.  He was good enough to look after my interests when my house was being built, but most people do not know architects or engineers.  The Minister should seriously consider at this stage&mdash;in relation to all the houses that are to be built in the future, or houses that are to be reconstructed, improved or repaired&mdash;the advisability of providing for the people who apply for grants under the local authorities or to the Department of Local Government a service along these lines:</P>
    <P>Where the house is eventually to be inspected, or inspected at various stages, by the Local Government inspector or the local authority inspector, the person building the house, or having the repair work done, should be able to pay, with a fee of five guineas or ten guineas, as the case might be, to get the inspector to visit the house at specified times in the course of the construction or reconstruction, to examine the progress of the building, and to supervise the work being carried out by the building contractor. If that were done, a lot of the shabby building and the inferior material which has been put into&mdash;I shall not say a great number&mdash;too large a number of the houses that have been built under the housing grants, would be avoided.  At the same time, it would help people to get value for the money they are spending on their dwellings.</P>
    <P>Those are the only observations I have to make on this legislation but I hope the Minister will consider both the propositions I have made and that he will have something to say about them in his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is really a machinery Bill to extend the very admirable provisions of the Housing Act of 1958 and to ensure that the housing grants, the reconstruction and repair grants and the water and <Col N="1170" /> sewerage grants which were increased in that legislation will continue.  The Minister has used this occasion, and rightly so, to point out the admirable progress which has been made in the use of these grants since the passing of that legislation in 1958.</P>
      <P>I shall just take one set of the Minister's figures.  For the past 12 months, there was an increase of 52.3 per cent. in 1959-60 as compared with 1958-59 &mdash;in the number of grants for new houses; an increase of 42.9 per cent. in the number of grants for reconstruction, repair or improvement of existing houses; and a very welcome increase of 57.2 per cent.  for water and sewerage grants.  That, and the fact that it is guaranteed to continue by reason of this Bill, are facts that can be welcomed by the Seanad.  Our present financial position, of course, guarantees that there will be no difficulty in these grants being made available from the Department and of the local authorities being able to avail of the necessary finances for their supplementary schemes from the Local Loans Fund.</P>
      <P>Speaking as a representative of a rural area, I think those percentages would be even higher in the rural counties.  Certainly, in County Roscommon, which I know fairly well, I am certain that the percentage for reconstruction, repair or improvement would be much higher.  In that respect, the most welcome feature of the Housing Act of 1958 was the increased grants made available for reconstruction, repair or improvement of existing houses.  The important thing to-day is to conserve, from the national point of view, the existing stock of houses, because particularly in the rural areas small farmers in many cases are not able to enter into the commitments which would be involved in building new houses.  It is in those areas that these grants are particularly important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reconstruction grants have had the most beneficial effect in the past few years.  Small farmers may now embark with confidence on reconstruction work, secure in the knowledge that so generous are the grants and so generous is the administration of the <Col N="1171" /> grants that in many cases they can do practically the whole job within the grant.</P>
    <P>In the Housing Act, 1958, it was first made possible, provided the local authority adopted the supplementary scheme, for a person reconstructing, repairing or improving his house to get a grant of two-thirds of the estimate from the Central Fund and the local authority.  My experience is that the Department inspectors have rightly been generous in their administration of the Act, and that in many cases in the rural areas where the farmers can get their neighbours' labour, their own labour or a small contractor who does not insist on too high an estimate, they can do the work within the grant which is made available.  In fact, they find themselves at very little expense. That has been my experience in County Roscommon and I believe it is the experience elsewhere.  That accounts for the tremendous use which is being made of the reconstruction grants.</P>
    <P>Linked with that idea of conserving the existing stock of houses, we have the reconstruction loans scheme which is also being adopted by many local authorities.  I should like to say as a point of criticism that some local authorities have not seen fit&mdash;despite the fact that these funds are available and despite the fact that the legislation is there&mdash;to avail of the supplementary housing schemes.  That is a deplorable state of affairs in the year 1960.  I shall not name the local authorities. I know some of them near my own county.  They refuse to adopt the supplementary housing scheme for the purpose of making county council grants for new houses and reconstruction work available to people who wish to build or reconstruct houses. In effect, it means that in these counties a lot of work which could be done is not done.</P>
    <P>It makes all the difference to get the grant doubled when putting up a new house or when doing a reconstruction work.  It makes all the difference to get the extra money.  In <Col N="1172" /> many cases, it means a twofold increase in the grant being made to the applicant where the local authority adopts the scheme.  If it does not adopt the scheme the applicant is dependent upon the Department grant. That cuts down necessary housing in that area to a very considerable degree.</P>
    <P>There is very little excuse for any county council not adopting the supplementary housing grant scheme.  The fact that in some cases it has not been adopted shows a lack of national spirit and a failure to realise the importance of co-operating with central government when schemes and funds are provided for desirable social objectives such as this.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to water and sewerage schemes and, in particular, to the piped water scheme proposals announced recently.  I think that particular scheme again underlines the importance of having county councils that will co-operate with Government policy in vital matters of national importance.</P>
    <P>Here, again, the Government are making available with, I think, particular applicability to rural areas, an admirable scheme whereby the necessary finance for providing a piped water supply and sewerage facilities is being made available to local authorities. The finance is being provided by way of loan and the repayment is spread over 50 years.  In rural areas, 60 per cent.  of the repayment cost is being borne by the Exchequer and full repayment is spread over 50 years. That is a considerable advantage and should be an inducement to county councils to implement the scheme. Unfortunately we are up against the difficulty that if a county council is conservative, reactionary, or obscurantist, it need not follow up the scheme at all.</P>
    <P>On the local authorities has been placed the responsibility of carrying out the very necessary survey to get a picture of the position in a particular county in order to provide an overall scheme.  The onus has been placed on the county councils to initiate that survey.  If the county councils are not <Col N="1173" /> co-operative, the surveys will not take place or will be delayed for a long time.  Since the funds are now available from the Government and the scheme has been announced, it is very important for people in responsible positions on local authorities to press that the proper engineering personnel be made available to the county councils for the proper survey so as to decide what type of scheme to adopt.</P>
    <P>In some areas, they may decide on a piped water supply scheme supplied by the local authority.  In other areas, they may decide on a co-operative scheme where a group of householders join together in an application for the necessary water and sewerage grants such as was mentioned by the Minister. In other areas individual applications can be made for the water and sewerage grants that are available.  A survey is necessary so that in a detailed way a plan can be made for each county and the appropriate water supply scheme, whichever is applicable, can be laid down.  That depends on the co-operation of the local authorities, as in the case of the supplementary housing grants.  I would strongly urge that local authorities adopt and initiate with vigour the scheme laid down by the Government in recent months in that regard.</P>
    <P>In many urban areas, supplementary housing schemes have not been adopted.  The reason is that in urban areas the adoption of the scheme would mean too great an impact on the rates compared with a county area. The Minister should investigate the possibility of making arrangements whereby the county council would, out of its apportionment from the Local Loans Fund, allocate moneys to urban areas where a supplementary housing scheme could be adopted and the loan charges on the moneys got from the Local Loans Fund could be spread over the whole county.</P>
    <P>The increased rate for repayment charges could be spread over the county as a whole and the urban authority could get its allocation from the county authority by adopting a supplementary grant scheme.  I think good work could thus be done.  I welcome the Minister's statement as an <Col N="1174" /> indication of the tremendous progress that has been made since the passing of this Act in 1958 and as a guarantee that that progress will continue.  There is a very marked improvement on the position that existed in regard to housing in the latter stages of 1956 and early 1957.</P>

I have been a member of a council for 30 years.  Fianna Fáil never had a majority on Dublin County Council. Senators may wonder why I mention that.  It is to show the House how much we are co-operating and taking advantage of every scheme.  Last October, the Minister announced the water and sewerage supply schemes. In less than four months, Dublin County Council placed before the Minister a scheme for water for Clonsilla and district, water and sewerage for every labourer's cottage in County Dublin, a scheme embracing £70,000. Despite what the Minister said&mdash;I was thrilled to hear his statement over the radio&mdash;we have not got sanction for these yet, and they have been with the Department for a few months.  I expect some news for Friday night.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Quigley was not correct in his reference to Dublin County Council.  He is absolutely wrong about a builder erecting private houses and going away and leaving the work undone.  Before a builder gets leave to build houses in county Dublin, he must sign a bond that roads, paths, and everything else will be put in order.  I hope every local authority does the same.  We have taken that precaution in county Dublin.</P>

      <P>Some time ago, we had a scheme of houses for the Lucan area.  I approached the Minister in connection with the matter.  I shall give him credit for this much&mdash;it was no length of time before he sanctioned a scheme for half the number.  The full number was 84.  He sanctioned a scheme for 42 and very quickly at that.  What happened?  To cut down the cost of those houses, the Minister compelled the Dublin County Council to build 42 houses in Lucan without a fireplace.  Is that the type of house you should erect for a farm labourer? An all-electric house is all right for a person with £30 per week coming in but no farm labourer can take one of those houses because he cannot afford to pay £6 every two months.  The Minister by his action has cut out every poor labourer in the district from getting one of those houses. Some of them are living in shacks that should have been demolished years ago.  I think it is a disgrace, whoever is responsible.  Who would build for a farm labourer with £5 16s. per week a house in respect of which he must pay £6 every two months to <Col N="1176" /> the E.S.B. after paying his differential rent?</P>
      <P>Have we gone mad?  I have been pressing for those houses with Senator Carton for the past 10 years.  I am not an architect or an engineer, but, had I seen the plans, I know what I would have done.  In fact, I would prefer if such houses had never been built.  I believe in helping the poorest section of the community first.  They cannot take those houses.  I shall be discussing on Friday night at the meeting of Dublin County Council a motion requesting the Minister to take this matter up with the E.S.B. with a view to getting a reduction in the E.S.B. rents for these poor labourers.</P>
      <P>In connection with water and sewerage, Dublin County Council have a most comprehensive scheme.  Dublin County Council, although they are not Fianna Fáil, are a good council.  They are in front of any other authority in Ireland, so far as these schemes are concerned.  We have made provision that every cottage and district within a reasonable distance of water will get it.</P>
      <P>In connection with repairs, I have been several times with the officials of the Minister's Department seeking expedition of claims.  I found nothing but courtesy and consideration from the officials in connection with these improvements.  I cannot find words to express my appreciation of the courtesy of the officials in the Minister's Department who deal with improvements to houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister a case which came to my knowledge to-day.  This case in county Dublin would be laughable, were it not so serious.  The poor law valuation of the house is £35 and rates must be paid on that.  The unfortunate man in question went ahead with improving the house and spent about £400 on it, employing a contractor.  It is not the officials of the Minister's Department but the officials of Dublin County Council who said that the man was not eligible for an improvement grant because the roof was not high enough.  It is the same roof as that which conformed with the by-laws of the county council.  It is a case of <Col N="1177" /> some official outstepping his duty, without having recourse to the Minister's Department.  Surely they did not expect the man to put a new roof on a house of £35 valuation?  Were it not for the fact that he improved the house and put slates on the roof, it would be derelict in seven years' time. I ask the Minister very specially to have this case looked into.  Does he expect this man to knock down the roof and raise it?  It is the same house as was already approved under the county council by-laws.</P>
    <P>I could say a lot more on this Bill in connection with housing.  I can find no words sufficient to praise the Minister's action on this question of encouragement in relation to water and sewerage.  It is terrible to think that you had until recently&mdash;and in some cases still have&mdash;within a couple of miles of the G.P.O., workers living where there is no water and sewerage available.  Henceforth, that position will not be the fault of Dublin County Council because we have submitted a most comprehensive scheme to the Minister's Department and I hope he will sanction it.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I want to bring to the notice of the Minister. I am always for the farm labourers. I suppose that is because I worked as one myself.  In county Dublin we have about 40 people over the past couple of years who got nominee sites.  I am sure Senator Carton will bear me out when I say that during that time&mdash; I do not accuse this Government any more than the previous Government; it was the same during the previous Government's term&mdash;we could not get sanction for a nominee site.  There is a site near where Senator O'Grady lives and for the past four years we have been trying to get a house built there for a farm labourer.  The Minister will not allow the house to be built unless it can be built for £1,000. In Lucan, they have cut out the fireplaces and here they will not sanction the erection of a house on a nominee site for a farm labourer, unless it can be built for £1,000.  After all, farm labourers are as much entitled to have a little comfortable home as any other person.  It is on the farmers and the <Col N="1178" /> farm labourers we depend to produce the food.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to look into that.  I would say that there are 12 or 15 of those cases with the Department.  They will not sanction the contract prices.  There is a house in The Ward and one over at Oldtown. These houses have been advertised four times in an endeavour to get somebody to build them for £1,000 but because the figure does not come near the £1,000, the Minister's Department refuses permission for their erection.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I appeal to the Minister in regard to the all-electric houses at Lucan, to back up the workers in seeking to get some reduction, to sanction the water and sewerage schemes submitted, and also to go into the question of the nominee sites in Dublin and give the council a chance of erecting its cottages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Usually Bills which are continuing existing legislation and which do not introduce any new principle go through the House without much discussion but it appears that there is to be some discussion on this Bill and it is a good thing.  It shows the active interest we have in housing generally.</P>
      <P>I have a few comments to make in regard to rural housing.  One thing which has occurred to me in regard to rural areas is that where a new dwelling is erected to take the place of an old dwelling, because there is no provision in our housing legislation in regard to the old building, a certain thing happens in very many cases, that is the old dwelling is left to die a very slow death.  It becomes an eyesore, the walls become unsightly, and the roof falls in.  That sort of thing happens frequently very close to the new building erected by an individual, with the aid of grants from the Department of Local Government and also, in many cases, with the supplementary grant from the local housing authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is a pity that that should happen.  After all, one of the reasons for the intervention of the Department of Local Government is to improve the conditions and also the aesthetic features of the countryside.  It is my <Col N="1179" /> view that the Minister should look again at this point now or in the near future, even if it meant giving an extra sum under the existing grants under Section 16 of our housing code. I leave the amount of that extra sum to the Minister to decide but it would be paid only when an old dwelling was removed, if a new one was built to take its place, and only when the site on which the old dwelling rested was put in a decent condition and ceased to be an eyesore.  I hope the Minister will seriously consider doing that and I am sure there are many people here who would agree with me on that matter.</P>
    <P>The question of water and sewerage in rural areas is another matter to which I should like to refer.  Even though this Bill does not introduce any new principle, a lot of good work has been done under the existing Act and it was heartening to hear the Minister giving the figures in this regard.  The Minister is making a valiant effort to get the local authorities to supply sewerage and water services in rural areas and he has succeeded in many counties.  He has indicated that 60 per cent.  of the capital cost is repayable over a long term, which is a very good thing.  I should like the Minister to tell me what would be the ratio of cost in relation to an existing scheme which is carried out by an individual who relies on his own initiative and without the aid of the existing grants.  I know we cannot get a figure at this stage but the time will come when we shall be able to get a figure.  One way would be to work out the ratio of the cost of supplying services to houses in any given county, the capital cost of supplying water to all the villages in Leitrim, as matched against the number of houses using that supply.</P>
    <P>I wonder what would the figure be for Leitrim or Donegal and how far the Minister would be prepared to go, having got that figure?  Is he going to allow that figure to influence his mind in giving a similar ratio of grant for the provision of water to the people in a rural area?  I am prepared to argue that if the Minister does get that figure, the ratio of capital cost per house of every house <Col N="1180" /> serviced by the local authority in Leitrim or any county will be rather a high figure.  It is fashionable to do that now and the Minister is to be congratulated on introducing the new fashion.</P>
    <P>I hope that when the figures are worked out, if it is found more economic to ask the individual householder or farm labourer to use his own initiative, rather than to ask the local authority to provide the service, that will be done.  It is very desirable that self-reliance should be developed and if we can, we should lead our people to be self-reliant rather than to ask the local health authorities to do something which they themselves could do.  I hope the Minister will keep a close eye on the costings of rural and urban water supplies and that the grants for individual houses in rural areas will be stepped up, if necessary, in relation to the cost of water supplies in towns and villages.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will do that.  It may mean that the present water supply grants will have to be increased and if the Minister is forced into that position, there is a good case for it since the people in urban areas have received benefits from the general tax-payers, including the rural community.</P>
    <P>There is another matter on which I should like the Minister to make some statement in his closing remarks. What exactly is the position as between the Department of Agriculture farm water supply grant and the Department of Local Government water grant?  The Department of Agriculture and the Department of Local Government are like the two mothers who went before Solomon with the one child.  Both Departments seem to claim the child and I doubt if the responsibilities of the two Departments have been sorted out.  Perhaps the Minister would give us a clear picture of the situation when he is replying.</P>
    <P>I know a case of a farmer who bought a farm on which there was no house.  He rented a house and because he decided to run a dairy farm, the first thing he had to acquire was a deep well suitable for dairy farming. <Col N="1181" /> He then built a dwellinghouse on the farm and the health authority took steps to examine the water supply, and so on.  He had a pressure pump for supplying water to the house.  He was told he would qualify for half the cost of supplying water up to a maximum of £100 from the Department of Agriculture.  When he got as far as making an application, he learned that because he had connected the house to the pump which he had provided for the dairy farm, he was not entitled to a grant from the Department of Agriculture.  If he had not connected the house to the pump, he probably would have qualified. There seems to be some co-ordination needed in that respect between the two Departments.  I should like to hear a statement from the Minister on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be that Senator O'Quigley has a point on the question of supervision in rural areas. In places like Donegal, Mayo or Kerry, I agree there is a limit to the number of officers the Department can employ.  There are big areas to cover. However, when an application is received in the Custom House either for a new house grant or a reconstruction grant, there should be a deadline&mdash;let it be three, six or nine weeks&mdash;by which time the file would be back with the Department after the inspection. That might be a good thing for the officers from the point of view of preventing criticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One point on which I do not agree with Senator O'Quigley is that of getting the Department's officers to act as architects or supervisors for individuals building houses.  I hope I am not misinterpreting Senator O'Quigley's argument.  I gathered from his remarks that the officers of the Department of Local Government <Col N="1182" /> should be free to act in a private capacity in respect of individuals building or reconstructing houses. That would be a dangerous thing to do.  Those officers have a duty towards a Government Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely there is no conflict between the interests of the Department and those of the owners of the houses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a certain responsibility on the person who is building or reconstructing his own dwelling.  He applies for a grant.  It is his work and his responsibility and he has no right, not even a moral right, to shift that responsibility on to the local authority, the Minister or officers of the Department of Local Government. If the owner of the house, the person who will enjoy the house, will not take steps to ensure there is no jerrybuilding, then it is unreasonable to expect the officers of the Department of Local Government to do it. They have a duty to see, as far as they can that when public funds are ploughed into a particular project, they are not misspent.  It should not be their duty to do something the citizen can do for himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a further danger if that suggestion were implemented.  These officers would have to draw the plan. As things are, you can get, for a small fee, plans from the Department of Local Government.  Sometimes they are suitable and sometimes they are not suitable in rural areas.  It would be a dangerous thing to allow the officers of the Department to act as architects or engineers in a private capacity for a citizen.  There is always the risk that in Kerry or Donegal, if a small farmer intending to build or reconstruct his own house asked a housing officer of the Department of Local Government to supply him with a plan and that officer were not an industrious person, he might do nothing more than supply a stereotyped plan, perhaps a copy of a plan of some other place, and would get a fee for that.  Knowing rural minds, I can say that the applicant in Kerry or Donegal would say to himself: &ldquo;If <Col N="1183" /> I do not get the plan from this officer, I may have trouble in getting a grant.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Whenever the subject of housing comes up, I have up to the present so far as I recollect refrained from making a contribution, but when I hear remarks like the final remarks made by Senator Lenihan, I have great difficulty in saving myself from apoplexy.  Therefore, I went to the Library to get a few figures.  Let us look at the figures.  Take the easy figures first: expenditure from the Local Loans Fund and what was left <Col N="1184" /> over from capital issues of Dublin Corporation and Cork Corporation.  In 1956-57, it was £14.4 million; in 1957-58, the first year after the change of Government&mdash;when Fianna Fáil were supposed to have paid all the debts that were left&mdash;it was £11.8 million; in 1958-59, it was £6.5 million; and in 1959-60, it was £6.5 million.  In each year, it has been about half&mdash;less than half&mdash;the expenditure incurred by the inter-Party Government in their last years of office 1955-56 and 1956-57.</P>
      <P>Let us take the local authority area where the housing situation is most serious: Dublin Corporation.  Capital expenditure, including slight additions to housing like vocational schools, in 1955-56, was £4.9 million; in 1956-57, it was £4.4 million; in 1957-58, this year when all these debts had to be paid, it was £2.6 million&mdash;in other words, if the Government paid any debts in 1957-58, they certainly did very little else&mdash;in 1958-59, the sum was £2.777 million&mdash;there are three sevens but these are the only sevens in it, the effective figure is two.  Any person who considers housing in the Dublin Corporation will find how little has been done in the area during the past three or four years.  I am certainly glad that any Government with whom I had any association had nothing to do with that.</P>
      <P>Let us take these figures for Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act purchases and the Local Loans Fund.  These were stopped by the Finance Committee of Dublin Corporation at whose instance in 1956?  At the instance of Deputy Briscoe who is such a good Irishman in relation to this country, according to the news that comes back to us but such a bad Irishman according to the <i>New York Sun.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I shall get the quotation and use it on some suitable occasion.  He was responsible for stopping applications for Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act purchases from the Local Loans Fund in the <Col N="1185" /> middle of 1956 in Dublin Corporation. What happened at the end of the year? Dublin Corporation had surplus moneys amounting to a quarter of a million pounds over and above what they had to pay out, as was admitted in the Dáil by one of the people who supported him in that move.</P>
      <P>Look at the figures for the city of Dublin, the place where the housing situation is the worst.  Not much more than half the amount was spent, though we all know very well that the value of money has gone down: £2.777 million in 1958-59.  Of course, the present Fianna Fáil Government are great people when it comes to estimating for next year.  Last year, the Estimate was £8.6 million but expenditure was £6.5 million.  There is a big sum again in this year's Budget for housing, but what will be spent?  Will it be the same story at the end of the year, that £10,000,000 has been provided for but some £5.5 million spent? Is that what we want?  Every time this case is trumped up in this trumpery fashion, as it was by Senator Lenihan at the end of his speech, it is time one spoke out very robustly and now I have every intention, on every opportunity I get, of speaking out very robustly.</P>

      <P>Senator Lenihan said that this was a mere machinery Bill but afterwards he destroyed it all by the kind of propaganda he used to bolster up the Fianna Fáil record in regard to housing.  We all know that in the past two years everything has slowed up.  The dead hand of Fianna Fáil has descended.  According to figures given in the Dáil, 4,000 fewer people are employed today by the local authorities on building houses than there were in 1956-57, the &ldquo;disastrous year&rdquo; we are told about.  In county Westmeath, my own county, two cottages are in course of erection at the present time.  There were over 150 in 1956-57.  We are told that money is available today to build houses but we are sending up plans to the Department from Westmeath County Council and first of all, they are held for three or four months and then they are returned each time because this is wrong with the plan or that is wrong. <Col N="1186" /> We got a plan where they wanted us to build labourers' cottages and not plaster them and put in cement floors. We refused to do it.  The contract prices we have got&mdash;the Department has failed time after time to sanction them.  They will not sanction anything over £1,050.  We have a false sense of values in this country.  If we have £10,000,000 to spend on jet planes, surely we should be prepared to spend £1,050 or £1,150 on building a good type of cottage for agricultural labourers or any other rural workers.</P>
      <P>Senator Lenihan gave figures a few moments ago and talked about the &ldquo;tremendous progress&rdquo; that has been made and the &ldquo;marked improvement&rdquo; compared with 1956-57 as a result of the 1958 Bill.  In passing, let me say that the 1958 Bill was only a continuation of the previous Bill and when he talks about tremendous progress and marked improvement, it reminds me of the Russian delegates talking about peace and democracy because I think words must have lost all meaning altogether.  Senator O'Donovan has told us that expenditure on local loans has dropped from £14.4 million to £6.5 million.  If that is tremendous progress and marked improvement in three years, then words have certainly lost all meaning.  In Dublin, the amount spent has dropped from £4.5 million to £2.777 million.</P>

Then we come to the time when we have the &ldquo;marked progress&rdquo; and &ldquo;tremendous improvement&rdquo;: in 1958, it was 3,569.</P>

      <P>Last year, in 1959, the rake's progress gave us 2,626. There is a drop of 3,000 in three years under the heading of new houses built for private persons.  Then we are told of the wonderful progress that has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1187" /> Let us come to the total number of new houses built with State aid.  In 1954/55, 10,490 new houses were built; in 1955/56 the figure was 9,873; in the disastrous year we have been told about&mdash;and I remember Senator Colley shedding crocodile tears about there being no work for the people employed in house building&mdash;the figure was 10,969.  Now, with the marked progress that has been made after two years of a Fianna Fáil Government, we find that last year the figure was 4,893, a drop of 6,000 houses built with State aid in the past three years.  That is supposed to be progress and a marked improvement!</P>
    <P>Let us come now to old houses reconstructed with State aid.  According to Senator Lenihan, there was, to quote his own words, tremendous progress under Fianna Fáil and a marked improvement in the past three years.  In comparing this year with the so-called disastrous year of 1956/57, it is only right to quote his own words. In 1956/57, 8,147 old houses were reconstructed with State aid and last year the figure was 6,909, a drop of over 1,200 houses in two years.  That is supposed to be tremendous progress and a marked improvement.  When people get up to speak in the Seanad or anywhere else, they should tell the truth.  It is no wonder that the people are losing faith in our politicians and in the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall try to take them in the order in which they were raised by the various speakers.  First of all, Senator Lenihan came on the floor on this matter of getting approval for <Col N="1189" /> various grants.  He questioned the details of administration and suggested as a remedy that there should be an overall increase.  He further suggested we should do something about what he said has come to his notice&mdash;the unsatisfactory workmanship which is put into a great deal of our house building by the various builders and contractors throughout the country.</P>
      <P>First of all, let me say that, while it is quite likely in the vast number of houses being built over the years, there will be some houses the workmanship of which will not be up to par, on the other hand, I do not think it is quite true to say that there is evidence that because of this bad workmanship, there is a problem we should take special measures to deal with.  In fact, if anything, over the years, due to usage, the skill of our workmen, builders and contractors is improving.  At any rate, if we in the Department were to concern ourselves with the actual structure, and with every last detail, it would not be the score or so of inspectors we have at the moment who would be required, but at least ten or twenty times that number to carry out the job.</P>
      <P>From what the Senator advocates, it is quite clear that the inspectors or officers of my Department would be expected to act as clerks of works on every job in every part of the country, no matter how small it might be or how infrequent the building operations carried on might be.  It would tax the ability and strength of the whole staff of the Department if we had them on the road like that.  From the practical point of view, it could not be done and secondly, there is an idea implied in that suggestion that because my Department or the local authority make certain inspections, everything is right at the top level so far as the customer's needs are concerned, during the years he may live in that house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, let us look at the cost of houses ranging from £1,000 to a couple of thousand pounds.  With regard to those houses, an average of possibly £200 is paid out in grants. Surely the person who is putting up the other £800, or £1,800, as the case may be, should have some regard to <Col N="1190" /> what is being done with his money, which is a very much larger amount than the amount paid by way of grant. Again, so far as our inspectors are concerned, they must inspect the houses on at least two occasions.  Those two occasions are generally the half-way stage, when the roof is on and when the house is completed.  Two inspections of a house where a builder is trying to diddle a customer would not be at all sufficient.  It would not be possible for any inspector at the half-way stage, or at the final stage, by merely visiting the house on those two occasions, to find all the flaws which might appear in the building years afterwards.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it quite clear to any person who is getting a grant that he should not feel quite happy and carefree in his mind about how the job is being done merely because an inspector visits it on two occasions. That does not relieve him of the responsibility of seeing that the job is properly done, and that the contract which he has presumably made, is observed.  That is something our people should know.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which it would be well to bring to their notice. Very often, the jobs are practically completed before the application is even made.  In such cases, it is absolutely impossible to keep them right in the fundamentals, never mind the details.  Over the years, we have taken a very lenient view of late applications both for new housing grants and for reconstruction and repairs grants and I think that leniency has not been of benefit to the applicants.  In many cases that come before me for final decision as to whether a grant can or cannot be paid, a difficulty arises very often because the applicant went on with the work and very often it was partially done, or completed, before the application was made for the grant.</P>
    <P>However, to come back to the question of complete inspection, and inspection that would be regarded as a certificate of worthiness in every sense, I do not think it would be possible for my Department to do that.  There was a suggestion that a <Col N="1191" /> fee of five guineas or 10 guineas might be asked from the applicant.  I would say if he were prepared to pay that amount, he should get a qualified man of his own to look after his interests for the five guineas or 10 guineas, a man with whom he might be more intimate than possibly he would be with inspectors from my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are not sufficient engineers in the country for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that in a great part of the country, there are sufficient architects and engineers who are qualified to look after the aspect of building operations that might come within the terms of a clerk of works.  I am sure they could well do with those 5 or 10 guineas the Senator mentioned.  If 5 or 10 guineas were available from every applicant, I am sure they would get better service by employing the private architect than if it were a case of regional inspections.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Quigley also mentioned the problem where contractors, developers and builders leave a site where they built houses, speculative building in particular, in an incomplete state of development.  That is not a matter in which it is necessary for my Department to intervene.  The local authority have power to see to it that the development that it was understood would take place by virtue of an undertaking before the building commenced is completed to their satisfaction and according to the agreement. It is not a matter in which my Department need take any strong action, as might be suggested; rather is it a matter for the local authority.</P>
      <P>If in certain circumstances, the local authority feel they are up against it, if they do not seem to have sufficient control or powers to get things done as they want them done, I should be glad if they would refer their difficulties to my Department.  We shall try to smooth them out and direct the way for them, if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1192" /> Senator Lenihan mentioned counties which are not operating the supplementary grants scheme and also counties which are not operating the facilities under our present Housing Acts whereby Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts loans and moneys from the Local Loans Fund may be got through the local authorities for the purchase and repair of houses.  I would make a very special plea to our local authorities to consider this question fully and to realise, as the great majority of our local authorities have come to realise, that the making of supplementary grants to the limited categories of people outlined and the making available of loan moneys for the repair of houses are very good investments not merely from the individual's point of view but from the point of view of the local authority and the national point of view.</P>
    <P>In a great many cases, if houses are conserved at this stage, properly repaired and improved, it will obviate very costly new building by the local authority in the future.  They will have to fill the gap if these houses are allowed to fall down and people whom the local authority would be obliged to house are left without houses in the future.  A supplementary grant of £140 maximum in the case of repair, improvement or reconstruction or £275 in the case of a new house, is surely a very good bargain for a local authority as against having to build a house costing £1,000 or £2,000 in the future to replace such a house or to house people who themselves, if they got this small encouragement from the local authority, would build their own houses or repair the houses they are living in and in that way preserve the overall stock.</P>
    <P>I appeal to all our local authorities to have another look at the situation and, from their financial point of view and the wellbeing of the people in their area, to reconsider it.  I urge them to make a start now even if, up to this, they have not done anything in this regard.  I want to express my appreciation of those counties which, over the years, some from the beginning and some from a later date, at present are operating these schemes&mdash;<Col N="1193" /> the loan schemes, the supplementary grant schemes in respect of houses, reconstruction, repair and sanitary services, and water and sewerage grants. These people are doing an excellent job.  Much credit must go to these counties for the excellent encouragement they have given by making these financial facilities available as well as the schemes.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of urban areas being in a difficult position&mdash;in some cases not being able to afford to pay supplementary grants because of the impact on their small rating units.  I think Senator Lenihan and some other Senators may have some problems in mind.  If there are areas where a county council of the area in which the urban district is situated has found it impossible to do just what the Senator has been asking, if problems are met with by any county council which seem to prohibit them from making grants available to people residing in the urban district of their county area, I should be glad to hear from such county council and go into the matter with them.  I think it is possible within the terms of our existing laws and regulations to come to a satisfactory conclusion.  I think there could be a problem there for certain urban districts which is not insurmountable.  It is possible to get over it under our existing Acts.</P>
    <P>If any such problems are known to any Senator, I should be glad to hear of them and, if we can, we shall straighten them out.  We hope we shall be able to show them how to do this very necessary job of helping the urban areas to finance the supplementary grants and the loans scheme which we have advocated here this evening.</P>
    <P>Senator Tunney mentioned the holding-up of house-building because the cost is too high.  Unfortunately, this problem is not peculiar to county Dublin.  It has been met in a number of other cases and I am glad to say, has been solved in quite a number of instances.  Let it be quite clear that the interest of my Department and myself in this matter are that if a house is costing too much, if it is costing a price beyond that for which a similar house can be built in any <Col N="1194" /> other part of Ireland, then somebody is getting more money than they are entitled to get for building it.</P>
    <P>What is even more important, either the future tenant will have to pay a higher rent, which we all deplore, or it will be foisted on to the backs of the ratepayers who can ill afford to shoulder that extra burden in order to give a price beyond reason to a builder.  That is the only reason and it is a reason which we reluctantly had to accept in order that prices would not continue to keep one step ahead of the amount my Department is prepared to sanction for a particular category of house.  Instead of stopping at £1,000, Senator Tunney said, in regard to houses in county Dublin, we have sanctioned houses costing £1,100 and even as high as £1,200.</P>
    <P>The very significant factor in this instance was that as our level of sanction rose, so also did the tenders that came in subsequently for other schemes.  That is a problem which is not easy of solution.  Our appearing to leave ourselves open to the accusation that we are, in fact, stalling on building in these cases is one which is hard to understand.  It is certainly not very palatable to me as Minister.</P>
    <P>Those are the facts which I have to face and deal with and if there have been delays in this regard, those are the reasons.  I should be glad if there is any member who has the wisdom and experience to advise me as to how we can deal with a situation such as I have outlined and which applies not only to Dublin but to other parts of the country as well.  Our handling of the situation had the desired effect. I could get figures to show that in circumstances similar to those obtaining recently in Dublin, by our policy in the Department we got building costs back to a reasonable figure.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that we want the people of county Dublin to live in inferior houses is wrong, as is the suggestion that we want houses built without plaster, thereby inferring that it is an inferior house.  The suggestion that we think less of the people in Dublin than anywhere else is also entirely wrong.  The suggestions <Col N="1195" /> from my Department are aimed at trying to keep the cost of the house down so that the tenant occupying the house will not be carrying an undue burden in the form of rent or, alternatively, that the rates will not constitute an unduly heavy burden on the backs of the ratepayers. These are the two things we have primarily in mind and which motivated us in any action we have been reluctantly forced to take in the manner suggested to-night.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly mentioned a number of matters.  He suggested that old houses, which are being replaced by new houses, should be removed by the owner by giving extra money on removal.  It might have been far more to the point to suggest that until these houses were removed, no money should be paid for the new house. That might have been a much more sensible approach.  That method possibly would have been used long since, were it not for the fact that the local authority have full and ample powers, as they now stand, under various Acts, to compel the removal of these unsightly buildings.  They are a hang-over from the time they became derelict and the new house was occupied.</P>
    <P>I know what the Senator has in mind.  I certainly agree fully with him but it is not for me to suggest that further moneys from the Exchequer should be paid to people in order to ensure that they will do what they should do and what, in fact, they likely promised the local authority to do&mdash;what the local authority can compel them to do and should, in those circumstances, compel them to do, once they have occupied the new houses.  On the other hand, in rural Ireland, the old house becomes readily adaptable as an outhouse. That is one of the considerations which results in the retention of the old house.</P>
    <P>The local authority can and should deal with the matter.  They have ample power to do so and my advice to them is that they should do so.  We shall give them every encouragement but to suggest paying the people who already <Col N="1196" /> have got the benefit of our grants to build a new house to replace the old one and to suggest we should give them a present of money to wipe out the old house is asking somewhat too much.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If we were to do that, this position would obtain.  The person who contracted to build the houses would still be waiting for the money. It is not the person owning the house who would be out of the money but the builder or the local contractor.  If that were done as a general rule, we would be hitting the small builder and contractor and possibly, in some cases, extinguishing these people altogether. After all, these are matters for the local authority, if for no other reason than to make their own countryside as respectable looking as possible.  They have the powers and they should operate them.  I hope they will do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>You have the power in the local authorities&mdash;it is a question of using it.  Senator O'Reilly also raised a peculiar case.  He said he would call it a hypothetical case, although it is a real stickler by reason of the fact that it exists.  It was something about a house on a farm being used as a dairy farm and a grant being sought from the Department of Agriculture in respect of the supply of water from a well.  The water supply was connected to a dwelling house and an application to the Department of Local Government for a grant in respect of that water supply was turned down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be glad to have the facts.  Certainly, it did not appeal to me.  The question, of delays in inspections was mentioned.  In that regard, over recent years, there have been the usual comings and goings of our temporary inspectorial staff.  Sometimes more of them leave together than at other times but gradually they come in.  It seems to be an accepted training ground for our young engineers.  We have to send them out with a senior inspector for six weeks or two months to get them run in.  Twelve months later, they go before the various boards and pick up a permanent job. Nobody can blame them for that.  The pool has to be gradually filled up.  The drain on it is not always regular. Sometimes we are more shorthanded than others.  We have been making every effort to try to keep a pool in reserve that can fill in the gaps and meet the inspection demand that sometimes comes unheralded to us.</P>
      <P>It is rather a notable fact that a house is a job that is done perhaps once in every two lifetimes.  Yet, we find that people who are not going to build another house next week or next year, after taking years getting around to it and gathering up the few pounds needed to add to the grants they get, seem to feel that unless we are all waiting for them ready to get them going right away, they have got to blame somebody.  All I can say is that I think it is asking too much.</P>
      <P>They have the whole year to apply; they have the slack, dead period of the winter to apply in anticipation, of the good weather in which they can do their building.  Why can these people not make their applications just that little bit in advance of the time they need approval rather than look for the grant the week they are starting work or apply for it a month after the house has been completed?  Then they all want grants in a hurry and very often we just cannot give them to them in a hurry.  We would like to be able to do it in a hurry, but we cannot turn on and off our inspectorial staff like a tap.  We have to train these people and if there is a rush of work we may be shorthanded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another feature of our inspections is that our inspectors, in the areas to <Col N="1198" /> which they are assigned and in order to get the greatest possible amount of work done with the least possible travel tied to it, do a regular circuit of these areas.  Depending on the volume of work and the size of his area, that circuit may take the inspector anything from three to six weeks to cover.  If somebody applies to-day and wants an inspection immediately, the inspector may just have passed by his locality yesterday. The file is sent to the inspector but unless that inspector is to make a special run back, he will not call on that person until he has completed his circuit.</P>
    <P>As I say, in normal circumstances, these trips on average take five or six weeks and this delay, coupled with the need to submit questions to the Department and perhaps re-submit some query to the inspector, while it may be irksome to the applicant, is not of our making.  If the delay seems undue at times, it is because of the necessity to maintain some sort of regular train of events and not to have inspectors at one end of the county to-day, reporting to the other end to-morrow and coming back to the first end the following day and wasting their time by totting up a lot of extra cost through travelling.  Those are the things which operate to give the appearance of delays which I can assure the House are not undue delays, when all the circumstances are taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>Another point which was mentioned was in regard to plans not being suitable in rural areas.  The plans, which are more or less pre-sanctioned plans, are available from the Government Publications Office in the Arcade at a cost of 1/3d.  There is quite a variety of both single and two storey houses and I think with any intelligent sort of manipulation, any plan can be enlarged or contracted to suit the requirements of practically any person who wants to build a house at the least possible cost, which is the aim of most people to-day.</P>
    <P>If there has emerged some situation in which all the variety of plans have not been available, it may arise on occasion because of a run on particular <Col N="1199" /> types of plans and some time may be required to get them back into stock.  Ordinarily, there is a good variety of plans capable of being contracted or expanded to suit the individual person.  Those plans as I said cost 1/3d.  and are obtained by many people.  I think they are really very good value and the quality and variety is fairly adequate for the needs of the community, and particularly the rural community, so far as I am aware.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan took the floor next and gave us quite a dissertation on the figures which he had extracted from the large volume he procured in the Library and which I noticed him bringing into the House a short time ago.  One of the things which he mentioned&mdash;I cannot avoid mentioning it&mdash;in quoting these figures, which as the Senator well knows is quite a dangerous occupation on many occasions, was that we in Fianna Fáil appear to make very big estimates of what we intend to do in coming years and that the actual situation develops that we make a small expenditure.  I do not agree with that statement nor do the figures show that there was a big estimate and a small expenditure. Let me rather say that when we make an estimate in my Government, and in my Department, we usually make it as near to the accurate figure as we can.  A prudent estimate is generally made and that prudence is judged thereafter by whether or not the amount provided is somewhat greater than the amount spent or as near to it as possible.</P>
    <P>We are being accused of providing more money in the Estimates than is actually needed for expenditure.  If that is a feature of our Government, it is a feature which I do not think I would decry.  It is a feature with which I do not think there is anything wrong but I cannot help comparing it with the reverse trend that was so evident in the previous Government which, if noted for one thing more than another, was noted for deciding on an expenditure and not providing the money for it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

On 20th March, that year, there were tenders and site acquisition proposals from local authorities lying in the Department of Local Government to the tune of £865,685, an accumulation of the mismanagement of the Government in office up to that date.</P>

We had this deplorable condition obtaining also on 20th March: applications for instalments of approved loans in respect of supplementary housing grants were on hands to the extent of £374,000.  That was the money we had promised then to the local authorities who in turn promised it to the individuals in their counties and they were not given the money to pay.  A backlog of £374,000 was there which had not been met and which should have been met because it was a commitment by the Government to the various housing authorities for the payment of these supplementary grants.  At the same time, there was a backlog of demands worth £259,000 lying there in regard to the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts and another to the extent of £523,000 for local authority housing schemes, so that roughly we had £1,100,000 under the headings of supplementary housing grants and S.D.A. advances which were the commitments and debts of the Coalition Government which they did not pay but which they promised during the preceding three years.</P>

I might remind the House also that during the previous six months, the last six months of the Coalition Government, while £750,000 worth of tenders for sanitary works were lying in the Department, only £13,000 worth of schemes were proceeded with.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to all the expressions we heard from those Senators who would now wish to criticise the movement and the trend in the building industry, then on another occasion and in another place, I may get the opportunity of going more fully into all these figures that led up to the situation where we find £4 million worth of various projects relating to the Department of Local Government alone backlogged and held up in that Department through lack of finance in the Coalition Government who would now talk as if they could put wheels under ducks.</P>
      <P>That is the picture we had in 1957. How could there be progress in the ensuing few years in regard to housing and sanitary service schemes, both of which take considerable planning and considerable time to get under way, if the dead hand of &ldquo;no money&rdquo; of the Coalition Government in, their later days was laid on all those schemes to the degree I have outlined and to a far greater degree which will be known to the members of local authorities listening to me now?  At that time in the local authority of which I was a member not only had we schemes at tender stage in the Department which were not sanctioned but so bad was the situation in September, 1956, that our council in its prudence decided it would be unwise to plan and spend further money on planning, if we could not even get the money to pay for the schemes on hands already.</P>

      <P>That is the situation against which we must consider the development of housing and other relevant matters at the moment and during the past three years.  If that can now be fully comprehended, surely it is evident that in the ensuing years, there <Col N="1203" /> was bound to be an almost complete cessation of building as a result of the mismanagement in the Department of Local Government I have outlined in regard to the building trade through lack of money.  In regard to any development since then and any progress we see to-day, we must have regard to the fact that we had to take building from its knees, work it up off the ground in 1957/58.</P>

      <P>If the Senator will bear with me a little longer&mdash;I do not intend to keep him much longer because I know these things must be most painful to him&mdash;we had to lift the building trade up off the ground when we came in in 1957, and if the trend is now upward, it is due to the efforts of this Government and to the fact that they paid the debts of their predecessors in regard to these matters and that some little confidence has again been instilled not only into the speculative builders but into the ordinary people throughout the country who have sufficient faith in the nation's future to proceed with the building of their houses which they did not have after the experience of the last Coalition Government.</P>
      <P>Over and above that&mdash;and this is the last answer I want to make to all the various innuendoes, inferences and suggestions being made here to the contrary&mdash;there is no shortage of money for these things to-day.  There are no schemes being held up and backlogged in my Department because we will not give the money.  There are no such things as schemes being put on the long finger.  There are no false promises being made to the local authorities and they realise that when we promise to pay, we shall pay and we differ from our predecessors in office in that we shall not let the local authorities down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to enable the bye-election due in the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency and the local elections in the area to be held on the same day, if the writ for the bye-election is moved not later than 1st June; and thus to convenience electors and, incidentally, achieve some economies which may amount to a total of about £1,400.</P>
      <P>The Bill is confined to this one occasion only so as not to pre-judge the question whether it is desirable that Dáil and local elections should generally be held at the same time. This question could be regarded as coming within the terms of reference of the Joint Committee on Electoral Law.</P>
      <P>The provisions of Part II of the Bill are framed mainly to cover divergencies between the legislative codes governing Dáil and local elections.</P>
      <P>Under Section 7, the returning officer for the purposes of the poll at the combined elections will be the Kilkenny county registrar, who is the returning officer for the purposes of Dáil elections in the constituency.  He will be entitled to call on the county secretaries and town clerks, who would normally be the returning officers at the local elections, to assist him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the taking of the polls on the basis of the local elections polling places.  This is necessary <Col N="1205" /> because of some minor differences in one county between the Dáil and local elections polling schemes.</P>
    <P>Section 9 contains the usual provisions where the polls at two or more elections are taken on the same day, for the same persons being appointed as presiding officers at each of the elections and the same official mark for the ballot papers, etc.  It will also enable the Minister to extend the time for polling from 9 p.m. to 9.30 p.m. at both the Dáil and local elections in the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency.</P>
    <P>Section 10 deals with the issue of authorisations by the returning officer, enabling persons prevented by their employment with him on polling day from voting at their normal polling station, to vote at another polling station at the bye-election and the local elections.</P>
    <P>Provisions as to expenses, which will be shared between the State and the local authorities, are contained in Section 11.  Sections 12 and 13 contain the usual provisions in Bills of this kind for the maintenance of secrecy by persons concerned in the elections, and for the attendance of agents of candidates at polling <Col N="1206" /> stations and at the various counts. Section 14 will enable minor administrative difficulties which may arise in the taking of the polls together to be dealt with expeditiously.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I may say that if the writ for the bye-election is moved not later than 1st June, I intend to fix 23rd June as polling day&mdash;the day which the local authorities concerned have already fixed as polling day for the local elections.</P>

      <P>The Bill, of course, is a good measure.  It helps, as the Minister said, to save a certain amount of money and is very much for the convenience of the people of Carlow-Kilkenny.  We should be grateful to the Minister for introducing it and for making the rather complicated provisions necessary.  There is no other way it could be done.  We agree to it.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Bill put through Committee; reported without amendment; received for final consideration and passed.</P>
