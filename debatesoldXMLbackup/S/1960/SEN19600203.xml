      <P>Before we take up consideration of the Committee Stage of this Bill, it would be well if I indicated that there are two amendments&mdash;Amendments 25 and 27&mdash;standing in the name of Senator Quinlan which are out of order, the former as it involves a potential charge on State funds and the latter as it conflicts with the principle of the Bill as read a second time.</P>

      <P>I wonder why it is the draftsman seems to try to confuse us instead of helping us in some of these interpretations?  It is <Col N="231" /> stated that &ldquo;the Authority&rdquo; has the meaning specified in subsection (1) of Section 3.  Subsection (1) of Section 3 covers two and a half lines at the bottom of the page.  I cannot see why it is necessary to put in that explanatory interpretation of the subsection down below.</P>
      <P>Again, in subsection (1) of Section 1 it is stated that &ldquo;broadcasting licence fee' means a fee paid on a licence granted under Section 5 of the Act in respect of apparatus for receiving only.&rdquo;  It is a broadcasting licence fee and it is interpreted to apply to receiving only.  The phrase &ldquo;broadcasting licence fees&rdquo; occurs later on in Section 22.  I think that is the only place in the Bill in which &ldquo;broadcasting licence fees&rdquo; are mentioned. If we put in &ldquo;receiving set&rdquo; or something like that instead of &ldquo;broadcasting&rdquo; it would not be necessary to have this interpretation.  Indeed, it appears to me to be somewhat contradictory. It is called a &ldquo;broadcasting licence fee&rdquo; but it is really a fee for a receiving set only.  I do not think this savours of good draftsmanship. The interpretation is not really necessary.</P>
      <P>The same argument holds with regard to &ldquo;Director-General&rdquo;.  It is stated that &ldquo;&lsquo;the Director-General&rsquo; has the meaning specified in Section 11 of this Act;&rdquo;.  There is no necessity for that interpretation.  The clause is self-explanatory.  This has occurred in other Bills and it has always puzzled me.  That is why I draw the Minister's attention to these points now.</P>

      <P>This is an interpretation section, as the Senator has pointed out. We are amending the Act of 1926 and it is our desire to follow the interpretations given in that Act:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;broadcasting licence fee&rdquo; means a fee paid on a licence granted under section 5 of the Act of 1926 in respect of apparatus for receiving only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The type of licence fee is clearly specified there.  The Authority will, if a certain agreement is reached, have the power under the Act to collect licence fees.  The draftsman believes <Col N="232" /> it is correct that a specific meaning should be given to the term &ldquo;Director-General&rdquo;. In so far as describing the Authority is concerned, it is made clear that the Authority established under this measure will have the meaning specified in subsections (1) and (2) of Section 3 of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), line 5, before &ldquo;and&rdquo; where it firstly occurs, to insert &ldquo;after consultation with the Opposition&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down this amendment because of the fact that the Commission had recommended consultation with the Opposition on the constitution of the Authority.  Paragraph 70 of Chapter V states: &ldquo;Prior consultation with the Opposition would allay possible political misgivings about appointments.&rdquo;<Col N="233" /> I am fortunate enough to live in an area in which television can be enjoyed. I know the power it has and I think there is grave danger that such power could be misused.  I do not suggest that the Government or the Minister have any intention of misusing it but, in appointing persons to any authority or body, very often those who are appointed are those with whom one is well acquainted and whose capabilities one knows.  From that point of view there is a danger that the members of the Authority, or the majority of them, might be supporters of the Government Willy-nilly, with the best intentions in the world, they would in that situation be bound to give their little inflection to television and that inflection could amount almost to a propaganda campaign on behalf of the Government in office.  The same situation would obtain should there be a change of Government.</P>
    <P>On the Second Reading, I gave an instance in which the inter-Party Government, on three different opportunities, did exactly as the Fianna Fáil Government did; we appointed people who were supporters of ours.  Appointing such people is all right so long as they are good men.  It is very important, however, in the case of the Television Authority that the situation should be safeguarded because of the potential propaganda content and the power of expression there&mdash;things that are, I think, quite unappreciated yet in this country.  The viewer looking at television is not in the same position as the man who picks up the <i>Irish Times</i>, the <i>Irish Independent</i> or the <i>Irish Press</i>, reads what he wants to read and ignores the rest.  He is in the position of a person who is served with a menu with no choice.</P>
    <P>If a person can be induced to listen to and look at a particular programme, then he gets a ready-made menu, with that inflection&mdash;and again I use that word deliberately&mdash;of Government propaganda, an unfair advantage which any Government would hold when in power as long as they had a majority of members on the Television Authority.  It is also important because members of the Authority themselves appoint the officers of the Authority. <Col N="234" /> There is no provision for appointment by the Civil Service Commission or anything like that and therefore you have this arrangement of steps of stairs going right up to the top people in the television business, whereby they all could be, and probably would be, appointed willy-nilly through the association, friendship or greater knowledge of people of their type of opinion that a Government would have as compared with the knowledge they would have of the capacity or capability of people who did not hold the same political opinions as themselves.</P>
    <P>I think, with all that power, the recommendation of the Television Commission should have been accepted.  Mark you, I did not put down an amendment nor did the Party of which I am a member&mdash;it was not put to them&mdash;offer an amendment here whereby anybody but the Government should appoint those members because, after all, it does look as if, practically speaking, the only people to do it are the Government but, at the same time, consultation with the Opposition in a friendly way would allay the fears&mdash;and I think they are very well-justified&mdash;held by many people.  It would also allay, not only my fears as a politician but also the fears of the Television Commission, the members of which did not include any politician&mdash;politicians were specifically excluded&mdash;who deliberately made this statement I have quoted and expressed the same fears as I have expressed.</P>
    <P>Without being, shall I say, unkind to Senators opposite, they know the power they wield in regard to the Press.  I want to assure them that the power that will be wielded in television is certainly a far greater power for good or evil and, therefore, the direction of it is something which should not be left to any one particular side in politics.  In the first formative years the Government will appoint all; in succeeding years you will have changing of Governments, and, at different times because of deaths or other reasons &mdash;resignations and time limits&mdash;the defection of people from the Television Authority and then you will have a better blend but, from the start, if you <Col N="235" /> have no safeguard you will have the position in which the Government appoint the lot, the Television Authority and the officers.  They will have exactly the same power as the Government have to do this and appoint as they want all their own supporters on this service and get these supporters to give that inflection to television broadcasting that would be in their favour as the Fianna Fail Party would have, for instance, in the choice of officers and officials in the Press.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that he should accept this amendment which would safeguard the situation and place the appointment of the Authority and the officers still in the Government's hands but on a friendly basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter to which I have given a certain amount of thought.  I have no doubt that Senator Donegan in putting forward this amendment did so with the best intentions but I am afraid that if the amendment were accepted it would not, under any circumstances, achieve the end or the aim which he has in mind.</P>
      <P>The Government is responsible for appointments to the Authority.  That is their responsibility and I think they should be held to it.  This Authority will, for good or ill, be responsible for the management of the television service and if we get a certain type of Authority or an inefficient Authority, that should be the responsibility of the Government; we should not be placed in a position, by negotiation or consultation with members of the Opposition or anybody else, of shirking our responsibility in the matter.  If we agreed to the amendment, we would be limiting our choice to a panel of people which would be arranged after consultation with the Opposition.  I feel we should be left free, or that the Government of the day should be left free, to get the best possible people to put on that Authority irrespective of their political beliefs or leanings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that members of this Authority or the members of any <Col N="236" /> other Authority should be confined entirely to membership or supporters of any political Party.  In the appointment of the advisory committee and the announcement made by the Government or the Minister that the people so appointed would become members of the new Authority, we gave an indication that we would be prepared to place on this Authority people who were not affiliated solely to the Fianna Fáil Party.  I do not know whether Senator Donegan proposes to press this amendment but I think and feel that the amendment should not be pressed for the reasons I have stated.  The principal reason is that the responsibility for appointment to this Authority should be the sole responsibility of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a strange thing that when the Government appoint either a commission to examine the the possibility of introducing a television service or any other commission they have regard to representation of different political outlooks and other considerations.  If we want to have a television service which will not be subject to criticism on a political basis, then the amendment suggested by Senator Donegan is well designed to achieve a Television Authority that will command universal respect.  While the Minister was talking about the Government's responsibility for the television service, I could not help recollecting that about a year ago we were talking here on a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Constitution.  Under that Bill, a commission was to be established, concerned only with the relatively unimportant matter, as compared with this television service, of drawing up constituencies, but the Minister or the Government thought it well that the Opposition should be consulted in regard to the membership of that commission.</P>
      <P>Indeed, one wonders what attitude the Government really take up in matters of this kind.  Here we have a recommendation of a Government Commission and so far the Minister has not made any convincing argument for not accepting the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the argument is on Senator <Col N="237" /> Donegan's side, particularly in the light of the Government's act this time last year in putting into a Bill which they were sponsoring here that the Opposition should be consulted when a commission, which was only a phoenix-like body, was being appointed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose this amendment.  I do not think it is a good one and I do not think the case made by Senator O'Quigley is sound.  He says that the way to put the Authority beyond criticism is to consult with the Opposition. I think, on the contrary, the Government, if they appoint the Authority, will be open readily to criticism, that is to say, if criticism is merited, it will be made far more readily if the Opposition is in no way responsible for the appointment.  I feel that it would be a manner, if you like, of buying the silence of the Opposition if the Government were to consult with them before appointing the Authority.  I think free and ready criticism of the Authority is far more likely if the Opposition is not, as a preliminary, consulted.  I believe this is a Government responsibility.  I think the Government will fulfil it well.  I hope they will.  If they do not, I am confident that cogent criticism of the appointments is far more likely if they do not consult the Opposition in advance.  Therefore, I oppose the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister makes the point that it is wise and right that responsibility should rest with the Government in this regard.  That is a good point.  But, while he says that criticism should be levelled against the Government for the direction of the television service by the Authority, I say that perhaps criticism might not be so easily forthcoming because it might be a good service but it might also be one that gave a certain slant to political opinion in this country. For instance&mdash;the perfect analogy is there&mdash;nobody can say that the direction of the Irish Press Ltd. newspapers has not been good, if one reads the balance sheets over the past five or ten years.  It has been excellent but I <Col N="238" /> think nobody will deny that there is a political slant and political inflection in the subject matter that is provided by these newspapers.  I do not think that even the Minister would deny that.  Therefore, we may have an excellent television service, an excellent television Authority, but all the cards may be played in a certain way, all the programmes, or a certain high proportion of them, may give that slant and that particular line of thought that I fear.  It is a menu on which one has no choice.  Even though they may serve excellent roast beef, they may serve nothing but roast beef and one has not got the right to have any other dish.  In other words, they can, if they wish, have certain programmes included in the television service which will help their particular political policy and they may be very good programmes.  When one considers that probably 80 per cent. of the people of this country are not politically awake and not politically very careful, the programmes may be excellently received and yet, at the same time, they may lead these people who are politically unaware down certain alley ways and towards certain views.</P>
      <P>That is my impression.  I agree with Senator Sheehy Skeffington that the amendment I put down has its flaws but I have thought very deeply on it and can think of no better one, for the very good reason that I think the Government are the group that should appoint the members of the Authority. The only practical way of helping that I could see was to put down an amendment whereby there would be consultation with the Opposition, on a friendly basis, in the hope that this thing I fear very much will not come to pass. I honestly and sincerely believe that if there is friendly consultation, it might not come to pass.  Otherwise, I am quite certain that it will.</P>
      <P>Finally, without raising any personalities, I want to say that the appointments so far made to the advisory committee, every one of whom will be a member of the Television Authority, have increased my fear and trepidation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister clarify a point arising out of what <Col N="239" /> Senator Sheehy Skeffington has said? Senator Sheehy Skeffington believes that consultation with the Opposition in the making of appointments to the Authority would blunt criticism by the Opposition.  My understanding of all these semi-State bodies is that when any matter relating to the management &mdash;that is what we would be concerned with&mdash;of a semi-State body arises, the Minister always washes his hands of it and says that it is a matter of day-to-day administration and that he has no function.  It appears to me that this Authority will not be and cannot be subjected to effective criticism by the Opposition if it does the kind of things that Senator Donegan is talking about. I think I conceive the position correctly when I say that the day-to-day running, the kind of programmes it puts on, the kind of slant it gives in its news bulletins, and so on, will not be subject to criticism in Dáil Éireann unless under Section 26, subsection (3), which seems to provide an opportunity for criticism to members of Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>Consequently, Senator Sheehy Skeffington's view, if my conception of the status of the Television Authority is correct, does not carry any weight. In addition, I think he said that consultation with the Opposition would get rid of criticism on a political basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I must oppose this amendment also.  First of all, I do not think it has really any enforceable meaning. After all, the Government might call in the Leader of the Opposition and say: &ldquo;I am going to appoint So-and-So on this Authority&rdquo; and may ask his opinion.  He has then consulted with the Opposition.  Senator Donegan's amendment should have sought to ensure, if anything all all, that the Opposition shall appoint one <Col N="240" /> member of the Authority in some way.  The amendment has really no enforceable value at all and, consequently, I agree with what Senator Sheehy Skeffington said.  I think it could lead to the Government saying:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All right.  We shall allow you to appoint one member of this Authority&rdquo; which, I think, would be a bad thing in that it would probably stop criticism of the Government who are solely and should be solely responsible for the appointment of the Authority and running of the service.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Cole that Senator Donegan's amendment would hardly achieve its purpose but the suggestion made that, perhaps, in some way, the Opposition might appoint one member or might nominate one member to the Minister &mdash;I take it having seen the rest of the panel he has appointed&mdash;might go a long way towards keeping the Authority neutral in political matters and it is an idea that the Minister, perhaps, might consider further if the Bill goes from here.</P>

The Minister stated a minute ago&mdash; I quote his words&mdash;that the membership of the Authority should not be confined to people of one political Party.

      <P>I think this amendment put down by Senator Donegan is foolish because it is based on bogey men and on fears which have no foundation.  I am trying to find out from Senator Donegan's remarks, and those made by other Senators, on what he bases these absurd fears.  He spoke of giving slants to programmes in the television broadcasting service. I am trying to find out what exactly he means by &ldquo;giving slants to certain programmes.&rdquo;  We have many years' experience of Radio Eireann sound broadcasting and I do not think anybody will question the fact that, by and large, over all those years it has certainly given us programmes of good entertainment value, programmes of general interest.  I, for my part, have failed to find any attempt in any way, in any of its programmes, to give a slant towards one political system, ideology, Party or anything else, and I fail to see how Senator Donegan can insinuate that entertainment programmes could be given a political slant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel his fears are groundless and, as the Minister said, it is the duty of the Government to appoint this Authority, to do the best it can to get the best possible men, the best possible brains in the country to run it, and then take the responsibility if the Authority does not come up to expectations.  The responsibility can be pinned on the Government's shoulders.  On their shoulders, and on their shoulders alone, that responsibility should be placed.  I do not know if any precedent can be quoted in any other country where anything on the lines of Senator Donegan's suggestion has been adopted but, to my knowledge, it has never happened.  In every country the Government accepts responsibility for its actions and here the Government will endeavour to get <Col N="242" /> the best people that can be found and I have every confidence that will be done.</P>

      <P>There is no wish to divide the Government's responsibility on this.  I have been challenged by Senator Mullins to cite an organisation disseminating news and entertainment that gives a political slant and I will give two examples.  Very briefly, the first example is the articles printed by Irish Press newspapers coming up to the last election.</P>

I shall be very brief and refer, as my first example, to the articles printed before the last election in which violence was insinuated so that young men going in to vote Sinn Féin would vote No. 2 Fianna Fáil.  As a second example, there was a by-election held in North Kerry some years ago.  At that time we had constantly falling farm prices and on the day before the election the <i>Irish Press</i> doubled its size&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in Dáil Éireann, if he is to follow existing precedent and tradition, will say: &ldquo;That is a matter for the day-to-day management and I have no responsibility.&rdquo;  He can say: &ldquo;We have established an independent Television Authority and I cannot deal with that kind of thing.&rdquo;  The point Senator Donegan was making on this amendment is that, to avoid political slants being given to different programmes broadcast by the new television service, there should be some means devised to deal with that, and he suggests a means in his amendment by which this political twisting of programmes and this misuse for political purposes of the television service can be avoided.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with something of which we have no practical experience &mdash;that is to say, television.  We can only illustrate what is likely to happen by reference to similar types of media which have been in operation here.  I propose to recall to the House that on several occasions in the reporting of speeches made on the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill there was a definite political prejudice against the Opposition.  I have already mentioned in this House the manner in which that prejudice was given full effect on Radio Éireann; that is the kind of thing we are seeking to avoid in the television service.</P>
      <P>In addition we must have regard to the fact that in reference to this new service the Minister, as reported at Column 12, Volume 52 of the Official Report said:</P>
      <P>It is simply this, that broadcasting is a creative medium concerned with entertainment, information and enlightenment which needs a certain autonomy if it is to give of its best...</P>

      <P>I have not heard from the speakers on the opposite side any argument that would convince me that it would be right for the Minister to accept this amendment.  The Minister is wise in his decision not to accept it because, as Senator Cole said, the object it seeks to achieve could not be achieved through the amendment.  The members of the Opposition have made a very poor case for the amendment and indeed they must have been very short of material for making a case when they have had to have recourse to attacking Press organs for which neither the Minister nor anybody else here is responsible.</P>

      <P>That is not the case.

      <P>We can conclude from that that the broadcasting authority has given a fair report of the speeches and proceedings of this House.  It was always said that in a court of law when an advocate had a bad case he attacked the opposition or somebody else, and that is exactly what the members opposite are doing <Col N="247" /> here to-day.  They are making no case for this amendment but they are attacking anybody and everybody outside.</P>
      <P>This is a foolish amendment.  The Government, as the Minister has said, are responsible and will be responsible for the setting up of this Authority. They will have to follow up that responsibility and be prepared to meet whatever criticisms are levelled at them afterwards in connection with the work of this Authority.  The Government will also have to find the money to keep the Authority in being; they will have to find the money for the whole business and he who pays the piper should call the tune.</P>

      <P>What Opposition is meant in this amendment?  It could happen that there would be several Parties in the Opposition and would the Leader of each Party have to be consulted by the Minister or the Government before this Authority would be set up?  The proposer of the amendment did not say that the Leader of the Opposition should be consulted.  There is just the loose words &ldquo;the Opposition&rdquo;.  I imagine if I were a member of a Party supporting the Opposition and voting with them, and if there were a provision here that the Opposition should be consulted and if I were not consulted, I would feel aggrieved.  The whole suggestion is absurd and the amendment should be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>Before we depart from this point, I should like to pin Senator Donegan down to the question I asked him after he had moved his amendment.  Let us take the Radio Éireann sound programmes. Does he insinuate, for instance, that the children's programme in the evening, the musical programmes, the &ldquo;Down the Country&rdquo; programmes on Sunday afternoon, plays or any of the major parts of the programme material which provides entertainment would be given a political slant?  If not, is he confining himself to one programme and if so what is that programme?</P>
      <P>I should like, as probably one of the sternest critics in this House since I came into it, to register my emphatic protest at the continued use of this House to attack the Radio Éireann news service.  I have myself probably as much, if not more, experience than Senator O'Quigley or any of the other Senators in listening to news reports not alone from Radio Éireann but from broadcasting stations all over the world and I have sat with a stop watch many a night listening to Radio Éireann's &ldquo;To-day in the Dáil&rdquo; and &ldquo;To-day in the Seanad.&rdquo;  I have been trying to find out for myself if there was any basis for the criticism which has often been made here, and which I made once or twice myself, that the news is unevenly balanced, that the Dáil and Seanad Reports are unevenly balanced.  I must emphatically state that my conclusion, after a long trial of that, is that whoever summarises that news, whoever sub-edits the reports which are sent accurately and clearly from this House to Radio Éireann, has done a miracle of compression. I think a bouquet should go publically from here to whoever does that job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before we depart from this matter I should like to bring back Senator Donegan to this point: does he insinuate that there may be any tampering with entertainment programmes and in what way does he suggest that, when <Col N="249" /> we get this T.V. system started, we shall introduce this conspiratorial stuff, as he alleges?  I should like to have an answer to that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to speak at all but I believe what Senator Donegan would like to ensure in this Bill is that we would have news reports rather than views reports.  Some people think their views are news.  We had several contributions in this House recently and some of the speakers thought their reports were the facts. I shall not go back over the controversy on the question which was discussed twice but they were quite sincere as to what was the true news and the true views.  It is only by having a mixed body you will ensure that both sides of the case will be put.  I believe that is what Senator Donegan and Senator O'Quigley want to preserve, by carrying out the wishes of the Commission that sat and reported.  When the Bill was being brought in, the recommendation made by the Commission should have been given more weight than it was given.  We in Ireland are very much inclined to hold that our views are the true news.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out the sequence of events that has brought about the present set-up in Radio Éireann.  It was established in different times when the organisation of politics and political Parties was not as it is now.  Then, you had the Minister and the civil servants under him who carried out the day-to-day affairs of Radio Éireann.  Nobody has at any time imputed political preference to any group of civil servants in this country, thanks be to God.  They are an excellent group of people and they are the people who safeguard Radio Éireann.  After that we have had, as you all know, the Radio Council appointed by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Radio Éireann is an institution that has developed over the years.  Here we have a new institution and we are to have the members of the Authority, a board of directors, let us call them, appointed by the Government. They will appoint the Authority who will appoint each officer of each department in the television service. Therefore, in fact, you have all the prerequisites for a set-up whereby all of one side of the House is installed in the television service.</P>
      <P>I want to make one very cogent comment.  I do not listen to &ldquo;To-day in the Dáil&rdquo; or &ldquo;To-day in the Seanad&rdquo; because when I leave here I travel home in my car and, at the moment, I do not happen to have a radio in it.  I used to listen to that programme four or five years ago when I had a radio in my car.  However, the Leader of the House, on his own admission, has sat listening to &ldquo;To-day in the Dáil&rdquo; and &ldquo;To-day in the Seanad&rdquo; with a stop-watch in his hand.  Was he interested or disinterested?</P>

How interested will we all be when this medium of television, which is potentially three, four or six times as powerful as radio, comes into existence in our country?  Shall we all be sitting and viewing with our field-glasses and stop-watches?  Shall we all <Col N="251" /> be so interested in the political aspect that we shall be sitting in front of our television sets, as Senator Ó Maoláin was sitting in front of his radio set, measuring it out in sections?  That was an admission and regard should be taken of it by this House, namely, that he was so interested in &ldquo;To-day in the Dáil&rdquo; and &ldquo;To-day in the Seanad&rdquo; that he bought a stop-watch and kept it in his hand while the report was being transmitted.</P>

Senator Donegan has not yet answered the question I asked him nor has he substantiated the accusations he made that we are to have a slant on the television service through plays, prayers, music and children's hour.  He has not substantiated in one single instance the case he made.  Therefore, there is no ground for supporting this amendment?</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, Senator Ó Maoláin insists on making allegations that I have not answered the charge.  My answer is that Radio Éireann was a different sort of set-up and that in fact it developed over the years.  First you had civil servants and the Minister and then the Radio Council.  The opportunity for a wholesale repository for political friends and people of political influence was not there in Radio Éireann.</P>

      <P>A further point arises out of what Senator Donegan has said.  What Senator Donegan is asking for in his amendment is entirely in line with the Minister's and the Government's conception of how the Authority should be run but he wants to copper-fasten it.  Section 18 of the Bill, which deals with impartiality, provides:</P>
      <P>It shall be the duty of the Authority to secure that, when it broadcasts any information, news or feature which relates to matters of public controversy or is the subject of current public debate, the information, news or feature is presented objectively and impartially and without any expression of the Authority's own views.</P>
      <P>The Government recognise the possibility of impartiality in political matters in relation to only a few items but there are a whole number of other ways, apart from news and information, which can redound to the benefit of one particular Party and may make another political Party seem to be something less good.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with Section 4.  The amendment Senator Donegan wishes to have inserted is &ldquo;after consultation with the Opposition.&rdquo; I cannot see how the insertion of those words would allay the fears any person might have that a programme produced by the new Authority would be a programme with a political slant.  The same thing could be said about the programme even if the Government appointed an Authority equally balanced, drawn from one side or the other of the political parties that exist at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators must remember that this section is not being passed just for today or tomorrow.  It will last for a long time.  We are dealing not alone with an Authority but, as Senator Donegan said, with a Board of Directors. This will be a business institution in my opinion as well as an Authority directing an entertainment programme.  The insertion of this <Col N="254" /> amendment would lead to a clumsy arrangement.  As I said previously, it would take away the responsibility that devolves upon the Government, that would naturally fall upon them, if they, in their own right, appoint the members of the Authority.</P>
    <P>There is nothing to prevent the Government consulting members of the Opposition or anybody in the Opposition in regard to appointments on this Authority or on any other authority if they so desire, provided the member of the Opposition wishes to consult with the Government.  But it has not been done by anybody up to now and it has not been applied to any other Authority.  It has not been written into the legislation setting up any Authority.  Why should it be written into the legislation setting up this Authority?</P>

What is meant by the word &ldquo;Opposition&rdquo;? Where is it to end?  Even if you did define the main Parties as the Opposition, there could be other Parties that would have to be consulted.

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>One amendment calls for a reduction in the period of appointment&mdash;the maximum period&mdash; from five years to three years.  In this, I am guided by the recommendation of a Television Commission which travelled abroad and, I presume, examined the governing regulations for television authorities in other countries. In this they were so keenly adamant as to put Paragraph 71 into their Report:</P>
      <P>It is important that the Authority should, as far as possible, reflect public opinion and sentiment, and for this reason the Commission feels that three members of the Board should retire each year, and, with the exception of the Chairman, should not be immediately eligible for re-appointment.</P>
      <P>That is a very weighty recommendation. It was an effort by the Television Commission to ensure a change and a rotation in the membership of the Television Authority.  It is not possible, I think, to introduce an effective rotation on anything more than a three year basis.  I am suggesting here that the maximum period be reduced to three years and, as provided in amendment No. 3, ensure that a member shall not be eligible for re-election on more than two occasions.  That means that a member, if he has satisfactorily served three periods, or nine years, is not eligible for immediate re-election at the end of that period but must stand down for at least one period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You cannot obviously change the whole Authority at one stage in any one period.  It is desirable that there should be a great deal of continuity.  One third of the membership is as much as you could change compulsorily at any one time.  That means that six other members come up for re-election and are eligible for re-election in the same period and that the Minister can weed out of those six any of those he considers <Col N="257" /> are not fulfilling their task.  It means, in effect, that if he weeds out one or at most two, he is ensuring that half the Commission go forward and there is then a very definite rotation pattern.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly on this amendment because, looking at the various committees throughout the country, whether they are committees of co-operative creameries, sports societies, even university governing bodies or semi-State boards appointed by the Government, the same characteristic can be seen running through them all.  Once you are re-elected twice, you are there for life.  I submit that is not good. I would welcome a study of the boards and other important committees of this country with a view to examining their rotation and I suggest to the Minister that he give this very serious consideration and do something to introduce some measure of rotation into the membership of the Authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the general principle of rotation in the sense that instead of the members of the Authority as a whole going out of existence at the end of the period, there should be either every year or, as suggested by Senator Quinlan, every three years, a certain number of retirals or a certain number, if necessary, of re-appointments. That would give continuity to the Authority.  It would enable the Minister or his successor to change the set-up of the Board of the Authority without a sweeping change.  It is desirable that you should have this rotation&mdash;the coming in of new blood, maybe new ideas, with, at the same time, some continuity for the Authority. I hope that the Minister will favourably consider this amendment or some other amendment in order to meet this point of view.  I think there is much in favour of what Senator Quinlan has said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that here again the amendment, while it is well-intentioned, might have quite bad effects.  Very often in this country, I am afraid, when organisations or groups or committees have <Col N="258" /> been going well owing to the work of the members, other people come along and say: &ldquo;Let us replace the people who have been doing the work by somebody new, bring in fresh blood&rdquo; and so on, instead of saying: &ldquo;We have now got people who are running this well, who have got experience, who have shown their capacity, and who should consequently be retained by very reason of the competence they have demonstrated.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Senator Quinlan, on the Second Stage, made the point that we are very much afraid in this country of giving offence, of dropping somebody who has been on a committee for years, and therefore it would be easier for us if automatically we were to have to drop people off the Authority, whether they were good or bad.  I am afraid I think that is a cowardly way. I think we should be quite prepared to say of a member of the Authority who has shown himself to be incompetent, or not quite up to the standard that had been hoped: &ldquo;Right.  We shall drop him.&rdquo;  Why not do that instead of saying: &ldquo;We should love to keep you on but our legislation is framed in such a way that there is an obligation on us to get rid of you.&rdquo; That seems to me to be sheer hypocrisy.  We should have the right to retain the services on the Authority of anybody who proves himself good, and the right to drop anybody who proves himself incompetent.  Both of those rights are contained in the original draft of the Bill.  The draft is therefore good and the amendment should not be supported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington has put his finger on the pulse of the matter.  I should like to point out that the five year period, as stated in the Bill, is a maximum period, but it does not necessarily follow that, in practice, every member will be appointed for the maximum number of years.  I feel that the three year period sought by Senator Quinlan would, in fact, be too short.  You are establishing a new Authority; you are charging them with certain responsibility and giving them certain functions and certain work to do.  I feel that, in the <Col N="259" /> initial stages, the members of the Authority would not attain their best within a three year period.  In any event, they will not have in the initial stages five years' experience of operating a television service.  There will of necessity be no television service for quite a while and they will be simply operating the sound broadcasting service. It is true that the Television Commission suggested a steady turnover in membership without causing disruption. I agree with that but I think it will take time to arrive at the stage when such a system can be put into operation.  We should not be compelled by legislation to follow that method.  It should be left to the Government to decide this matter for themselves. The Government should be free to appoint the members for the full period or for a shorter period, as the case may be.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal now with the second amendment, amendment No. 3, which concerns eligibility for re-appointment. Straight away, I should like to assure Senator Quinlan that I fully appreciate his purpose in putting down this amendment.  It is true that, as the Bill stands, a member could continue indefinitely as a member of the Authority through repeated re-appointments. But it is not the intention to have repeated re-appointments made in order to continue the membership of a person over, say, a lifetime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully realise that it is absolutely essential to have fresh minds on the Authority as the occasion demands. Nevertheless, it would be a fatal mistake to confine the period of membership of the Authority.  It might be of very great value to the Authority to retain the membership of a person who, perhaps, by reason of this amendment, would have to leave the Authority.  I think the Government and the Minister should be free to determine that question for themselves so that we would have the best possible people on the Authority. That could be achieved by leaving the Government free to decide for themselves to terminate an appointment&mdash; as they have authority to do in the <Col N="260" /> Bill&mdash;or to say that an appointment should be for a lesser period than five years in certain cases while retaining the right to re-appoint as may be desirable.  In order to introduce new blood they should be free to appoint as members of the Authority people with special knowledge who may become available at any particular time and I believe this would be of material benefit in the operation of the service. They should also be in a position to retain on the Authority persons whose service indicates they have given of their best.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has properly pointed out that the period of five years is the maximum period but not necessarily the period of membership. It is very desirable that there should be varying periods of membership so that overlapping will take place.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that would be advisable on the first appointments for the reasons I have stated.  This is a new service.  The recommendation made by the Television Commission will be implemented.  There will be rotation, and all the members of the Authority will not be appointed for a full period of five years, but the five-year period must take effect on the first appointments.  There is a very good reason for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not think it desirable to appoint some members for a briefer period than five years?  If the members are good, they can be re-appointed.  If, however, the situation is not satisfactory, this suggestion would permit a change of blood, while still maintaining continuity of membership in certain cases. If all are appointed for five years and one has to be sacked at the end of three, it might be very embarrassing.</P>

      <P>My point is that, while we may lose the services of a good man after nine years, according to my proposal, on the other hand, without some automatic cut-out, we may be forced to retain the services of a very mediocre member.  The members of this Authority will be like the directors of the E.S.B.  They will have a couple of hundred pounds a year by way of remuneration for their services. We know what pressures will come on to compel retention so that they may, having got used to them, continue to enjoy those few hundreds.  The Minister will leave himself open to very heavy political pressure for the re-appointment of some poor old fellow, who can live only another ten years, and why not leave him to enjoy his pension from the T.V. Authority for those few years?  Senator Sheehy Skeffington made references to the cowardly way out.  I hope that I, for one, and the Minister secondly, will never take a cowardly way out.</P>

      <P>Nobody is indispensable. The good man one might lose through operating the proposed system might die anyway.  Even if he does not die, there are many State boards to which he could be appointed and, if he has proved himself a good man in one capacity, he can carry that experience with him on to another board.  There are many advisory committees associated with T.V. and his services could be availed of on one of those.  A good hunter is turned out to grass after a hard season.  There is no member of any board or authority in the country who could not do with being turned out on grass to give him an opportunity of looking at the authority or board from the outside. He will return refreshed, and of much greater value to the authority subsequently.</P>

      <P>I am not saying that is the ideal solution, or the ideal way of dealing with this matter, but it is no harm to read the section through to find that there is that cut-out in it.  In America, a man is promoted after he has been a long time in office.  He may be getting on in years and the passage of time may have impaired his capacity.  The apt phrase used to describe his promotion is &ldquo;kicking him upstairs.&rdquo;  If this subsection were to be applied, I wonder would the members of the Television Authority regard themselves as being kicked upstairs or downstairs?  I shall leave the answer to that question to somebody else.  While there is that cut-out in regard to the Authority, there does not seem to be any reciprocal cut-out in regard to membership of Dáil or Seanad Éireann by kicking Senators or Deputies upstairs to membership of the Authority.  Possibly that might not be a good thing, either.</P>

      <P>To delete subsection (5) and substitute the following subsection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) When a member of the Authority is elected to either House of the Oireachtas, or is nominated a member of Seanad Éireann, he shall thereupon cease to be a member of the Authority.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This actually removes the safety valve that Senator O'Reilly found for disposing of those members who stay too long.  I believe the approach to membership <Col N="263" /> of the Dáil and Seanad is far too restricted.  Even the approach to candidature is too restricted.  I cannot understand why a candidate should be ineligible for a board, while a defeated candidate is always most eligible. Surely we could show a little more political maturity now.  I see no crime whatsoever in a member of an authority or a board going forward for election to the Oireachtas.  To my way of thinking, he ought to be required to do nothing more than simply retire temporarily from the board, or authority, during the election period.  Well and good, if he is elected to the Oireachtas, he should automatically cease to be a member of an authority or board.  Otherwise, I see no reason why anyone seeking membership of either House of the Oireachtas should have that used against him.  That applies even more to membership of the Seanad than to membership of the Dáil, because you have not got in relation to the Seanad, the open canvassing, the rough and tumble of the hustings and all the rest of it that you have in relation to the Dáil.  You have a more refined type of approach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">

      <P>The effect of Senator Quinlan's amendment would be that a member of this Authority could be a candidate for the Dáil or Seanad, but he could not be a member of the Dáil or Seanad.  That seems to me to be a reasonable proposition. The Minister has taken pains in the drafting of the Bill to provide that a person who becomes a candidate for election to either the Dáil or Seanad will be disqualified by his very candidature. I think we would all be in agreement that if he were successful, or if he were nominated by the Taoiseach to the Seanad, he should resign. Why he should be compelled to resign merely as a candidate, I am not quite clear, particularly when one comes to think of the Seanad and the fact that there may very well be a change made in the future in the method of election to the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may very well be that a member could be a candidate for the Seanad; and as Senator Quinlan pointed out, such a candidate is not obliged to <Col N="264" /> make speeches or take any public action.  I am not prepared to accept the adjective &ldquo;refined&rdquo;.  I know everybody is very nice but I would not say that the operations are, of their nature, refined.  I think it is going too far when we try to prevent a person from going up for election.  We have debated this point before on several occasions. What we are doing is giving the State more and more power, creating more and more boards, and narrowing the basis of election by making more and more people ineligible for election to the Dáil or Seanad.  It does not seem to me that it affects the Minister's idea or materially alters the section if this amendment is accepted.</P>

      <P>I fully agree with the section in the Bill in the case of this Authority.  Perhaps, in the case of another authority, the person selected and nominated as a candidate could carry on if he were elected or if he were defeated; but in the case of this Authority it is right that a person who is in Radio Éireann or who broadcasts and who, people might say, had the opportunity of using the broadcasting system for his own private use in some way, should on his nomination as a candidate, be asked to resign his membership of the Authority.  I feel that should apply only in the case of such an Authority as this and not, I think, in the case of a member of Bord na Móna or some such body.</P>

Without any factual evidence to back it up, we were trying to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Now it is suggested that a member of the Authority could go forward as a candidate while retaining membership of the Authority. In that event, he might at least have to make speeches or might have to write circular letters.  He might have to declare certain political opinions. He might be defeated and he would retain his membership of the Authority and I can visualise what might happen afterwards in the event of any programme broadcast by the Authority which might be suspect by any one person.  I think there is a factual case against changing the section in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not follow that.  I do not follow Senator Barry. I do not know whether he was making fun of the Minister or myself.  I do not quite know what his point was. I suppose Dublin people are inclined to be dull.  Senator Cole was entirely against Senator Donegan's amendment but he is entirely in favour of what the Minister has in the Bill; but election to the Seanad may change very much and this section will still be law and will still be in operation to prevent a person on the broadcasting authority from being a candidate. There is no use in pretending, as Senator Ó Maoláin tries to tell us, that there is nobody on the broadcasting authority who is a politician, because one of the people on the Advisory Committee is a red, roaring ranting supporter of the Minister for Health and he has no qualification in the world but that.</P>

I do not see why we should have a restriction of this kind.  The Authority itself could <Col N="266" /> have power to provide that a person be suspended while a candidate, for example, but why prevent a person from being a member and at the same time prevent him from being a candidate? Actually, the section does contemplate that a member of the Authority might become a member of the Oireachtas.  Then why prevent his being a candidate?

When the Minister was concluding the debate on the Second Stage, he said that the most important person in relation to the Television Authority would be the Director-General and it seems the amendment put forward by Senator Quinlan is perfectly in order in view of the fact that there is no restriction or prohibition whatever contained in the Bill to the effect that the Director-General cannot be a member of Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann, or, indeed, any of the staff.</P>

      <P>We are discussing Section 4 and the amendment.  There is a statutory prohibition against members of the Authority even standing for election to the Dáil or Seanad.  As I see it, that is quite in conflict with the other provisions of the Bill where there is no prohibition on the Director-General who is to be the chief executive officer of the Authority becoming a candidate and being elected.  It may well be that the Minister has a reply ready on his lips.  I can anticipate that it will be that the <Col N="267" /> Authority will determine the conditions of service but it is questionable whether the Authority can put in a condition of that kind restricting a man's right to stand for parliamentary election.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is anything really in what Senator O'Quigley has just said.  He has answered this himself by referring to the terms of appointment and the restrictions there could be in the terms of appointment of the Director-General. In any case, I do not think that Directors-General of television or broadcasting Authorities would bother standing for Dáil Éireann or coming into the Seanad and that is not casting any reflection on either body&mdash;they will be fully occupied with the business of their office.  I do not think the matter has been raised seriously.</P>
      <P>It might appear unfair that a member should cease to be a member of the Authority merely on nomination as a candidate for either Dáil or Seanad, but when you look further into the matter, you find that a person who is nominated as a candidate has to come forward publicly and express his opinions and take part in public debate and controversy.  I feel that would not be consistent with his membership of the Authority and I think the section should be left as it is, and that the amendment should not be inserted. I believe it is a good principle that members of the Authority, while in office, should not identify themselves with a political Party.  Accordingly, I feel that the provision of the Bill should stand.  It is a sound provision and will eliminate all criticism of the Authority in regard to that matter of members of the authority offering themselves to any political Party as candidates for election to the Dáil or Seanad.  This is a sound provision and should be retained in the Bill. It is a standard section and it applies equally to the other Boards that have been already established under similar sections of similar legislation.</P>

      <P>There is a certain amount of political debate apart from elections and there are a good many people who think that we have not enough political debate, instead of having too much.  If the members of the Authority cannot take part in political debate at an election, presumably the idea is that the members of the Authority will refrain from expressing themselves while in office, which would not be a bad thing, on the whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have raised this as a general principle, not particularly in regard to this Bill but in regard to all boards.  I am perfectly aware that the same provision exists in respect of all boards but I regard it as being unduly restrictive and narrowing down the classes from which members of the Dáil and Seanad can be drawn and, of course, there are many other classes excluded in the same way, such as those serving on local authorities, and so on.  I think similar steps should be taken in regard to such persons but that is outside the scope of this amendment.</P>
      <P>The only other point I would make is that while this Bill may, perhaps, have been a bad example, a bad place to begin this loosening up of restrictions on candidates for the Dáil and Seanad, still, the Seanad does command a different position and there might be even a half-way loosening of the restriction because the Seanad is in part elected on a vocational basis and I would hope that in the years to come, it will evolve much more in that way.  This debate has shown that the Seanad can make very useful contributions. It has been largely a nonpolitical debate.</P>

      <P>There have been flashes now and then, but, on the whole, I think the Seanad has been helpful.  I fail to see the consistency between regarding a candidate who gives expression to his views, who identifies himself with a particular Party, as being ineligible to be on the Authority and the practice, of which we have had too much in the past, of appointing defeated candidates to these posts.  I shall have great pleasure in dropping this amendment if the Minister will give me the assurance that his view on the suitability of defeated candidates, who have expressed themselves in that way, corresponds with his view on the suitability of actual candidates.</P>

      <P>I take it this is a departure from the normal procedure. Personally, I do not know of any other case in which this barrier is imposed.  The question we have to decide is: does this type of appointment necessitate this restriction?  I think it does.  I should say that, in view of the noisy discussion we had earlier to-day, it is necessitated. Senator Donegan time and again got up to point out that this Government or, if what he calls the Opposition were in power, his Government, would appoint political nominees.  I do not think that either Government would do it consistently.  Everybody is entitled to have political opinions and it would be wrong to accuse anybody appointed to a high position of being appointed because he was a supporter of this or that Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case, this restriction is necessary because we have had so many ridiculous accusations against those who will be appointed by the Government. It is an outstanding case where the restrictions should be from the time the person is nominated.  I know of no other case&mdash;perhaps the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&mdash; where a person nominated as a candidate would have to sever his connection with a board to which he has <Col N="270" /> been appointed.  In my view, in this case, this restriction is justified.</P>

      <P>It occurs to me that the real reason for this section and similar sections in other legislation, starting possibly with the original Electricity Supply Acts, and the only justification for it, is that we seem not to be politically mature.  It does appear to me that there is a great deal of loosening out, which seems to correspond with the little degree of maturity in these matters that we have reached.  The fact that we have had such a discussion on both sides of the House to-day satisfies me that there is necessity for the section as it is.</P>
      <P>A Government in power, as well as doing right, have to do what appears to be right.  There are such restrictions in the Electricity Supply Acts.  They are much more comprehensive in that a person could not be a servant of a State board and a member of the Oireachtas.  That has been remedied to some extent by legislation.  The restriction applied to a person who was a servant or officer of a huge corporation, like the E.S.B., in which there would be people of different political views, people with no political views and people with views that would not be catered for by any of the existing Parties.  Apparently we are becoming gradually more mature politically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every sane man has views on politics.  If he has not, he is useless as a citizen.  The fact that a person may have known views on political matters is no reason why he should not be appointed to this Authority. A strong man holds his views strongly.  Because of our political immaturity, simply in order to appear to be right, we are prevented sometimes from selecting the person best qualified for a position.  That is not confined to any one side of this House <Col N="271" /> or any one side of the Dáil.  We all suffer to some extent in this regard.</P>
    <P>While this would be the worst Bill in which to start an experiment in a general way, the fewer restrictions we have in respect of elections to Parliament, the better.  Senator Quinlan did mention the question of officers of local authorities. He said that officers of local authorities were debarred from being members of the Oireachtas.  I do not think that is so but I do know that in some counties the senior executive officers of local authorities create a position which makes it very undesirable for junior and middle grade officers to take part in politics. That is one of the ways of politically emasculating leadership but I am also aware that an officer of a local authority, who was elected to Dáil Éireann, became a Minister.  In fact, I remember that particular person was promoted during that period and there was nothing wrong about that.  I am not saying there was; I am not one of those people who wish to suggest corruption because that is a bad thing and the sooner we grow out of it the better.</P>
    <P>By this Bill, we are launching a ship in regard to which we have no experience.  I think the section should stand as it is and, if necessary, we can have a look at it in five, ten or fifteen years' time, if we feel we can widen the scope.</P>

I think he is asking for too much in that.  I could not give him that assurance and I do not intend to give it to him.  It could very well be that persons who are members of Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann would be eminently suitable persons to be members of this Authority, or any other public authority set up as a semi-State body.  This amendment is not dealing with people who are outside the Authority.

      <P>Subsection (1) of this Section provides that the membership of the Authority shall not be less than seven and not more than nine in number.  I wish to put it to the Minister <Col N="273" /> that, certainly in making the first appointments, the maximum number should be adhered to, that is, that he should appoint nine to the Television Authority.  I do so because television is obviously of very great importance to all sections of the community.  The section about which I wish to speak is the trade union people and the workers.  Between themselves and their families trade union people comprise, I suppose, one-third of the population and in making appointments to the Authority the Minister should have regard to people with a background of experience in that direction.</P>
      <P>I know that the Minister would want competent people and I hope he will get and choose competent people for the Authority, but it would be desirable that regard should be had to trade union interests, to people with a background experience in trade union affairs.</P>
      <P>Another aspect which is of importance is education.  I hope that television will be utilised not solely for the purpose of entertainment but also for the purpose of education.  I think it would be very desirable, in constituting the Authority, that the Minister should have available somebody with actual experience of teaching so that the Authority could draw on his experience for the purpose of utilising the new medium for education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support very emphatically the plea made by Senator Murphy.  This is a new venture for this country and, as a number of Senators have already stressed, to a certain extent we are venturing into the unknown.  I am quite convinced that the Minister will be subjected to a lot of pressure from various sections of the community, representing all sorts of interests and outlooks.  I want to point out that the plea just made by Senator Murphy has been made on behalf of 500,000 citizens and I submit that their outlook and point of view should have proper representation. I also think that the point made by Senator Murphy regarding the educational aspect of this particular <Col N="274" /> matter needs to be more strongly emphasised.</P>
      <P>The tremendous possibilities of this medium as an educational medium are hardly realised by anybody.  Certainly from what we read and see around us we know that the medium of television has been utilised by many Governments for purposes that go far beyond the imaginations of most of us and, apart from representation for the very solid group of people to whom Senator Murphy referred, the Minister would be very well advised if from the outset he made certain there was somebody on the Authority with a good strong background as well as an expert knowledge of the best methods of applying television to education.  As I say, such a person should be on the Authority from the outset.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thoroughly agree with Senator Murphy in one of the things he said but I am afraid I do not agree with him in another.  I wanted to make some observations myself on the general position of the Authority and I do not know whether it is fair to ask has the Minister given any consideration to the particular type of person he has in mind.  In the beginning I agree that the maximum number should be appointed but I think it would be very undesirable that the Minister, or the Government should begin, in making these appointments, to make them on a basis that would be sectional.  I think the notion that this Authority should be representative of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, or that it should be representative of trade unionists and employers. or should be representative of teachers, for example, of whom I happen to be one myself, is rather a bad idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Authority will have an extremely difficult task, a task which, as has been said over and over again here this evening, of which there is very little experience and which involves going into new and unknown fields. It has very serious obligations.  Under Section 17 of the Bill, it has an obligation to preserve the Irish language and traditions.  Under Section 18, it has the obligation of being impartial. Apart from these two sections, they will have the obligation of keeping <Col N="275" /> up to date in a medium which is constantly changing, and which may indeed see very great technical changes comparatively soon.</P>
    <P>Under Section 17, it will be extremely difficult to get the appropriate person because there should be at least one member of the Authority who not only knows Irish&mdash;it would be comparatively easy to get such a person&mdash;but who has a proper understanding of what Irish literature means and what the people in rural Ireland stand for, some of whom still speak Irish and a great many of whom up to comparatively lately did speak it, somebody who understands that Irish is not merely a collection of irregular verbs, which, I am afraid, a great many people think it is.</P>
    <P>Under Section 18, the appointees are bound to impartiality.  You want people of very strong character because endeavouring to get impartiality sometimes gives you simply nervousness which immobilises you.  It is a matter of very great difficulty to be impartial and the notion that certain people ought to be represented is not the correct approach.</P>
    <P>Similarly, some people on this Authority will have to have experience of administration, of how things are run.  That is a matter which could not be left entirely to the Director-General or to the staff because if you have an Authority and none of them is familiar with the ordinary problems of administration, they will not be in a position to direct anybody.  Administrators, no matter how good they are, do need some direction.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to education. The television service will have considerable influence on schools and it should also be available for adult education.  The fact that a person has been a teacher&mdash;I speak as one myself&mdash;is not a sufficient qualification.  It is not sufficient to say: &ldquo;I have selected Patrick Murphy&rdquo;&mdash;I am taking the name as it is a common one&mdash;&ldquo;because he has been a teacher.&rdquo;  He may have been a teacher and a very good teacher, but might not have the necessary <Col N="276" /> vision for running television. Television will be a new thing here and it is quite possible that the person entirely tied by his experience to other media would not be as good as you might imagine.  It requires very much more than mere experience as a teacher.  The suggestion that the Authority should be set up, so to speak, on a system of proportional representation, where people who have numbers behind them should have a certain representation on the Authority, is not a good one, and if my friend Senator Murphy and Senator Crowley give that consideration, they will, I hope, agree with me.</P>
    <P>The Minister will find great difficulty in getting the proper people and he may have to make very serious experiments.  Sometimes a person is extremely successful for whom you could not make out a case beforehand. For instance, the first film censor here was extremely good, but one of the things he had and one of the things these people will have to have is considerable breadth of vision and considerable depth and breadth of knowledge and talent.  Unless you can get that, I do not think you will get any benefit at all from this venture.</P>
    <P>I would be prepared for my own part, to leave the responsibility to the Minister and I feel that the Minister, or any other Minister in his position, would recognise that he will be judged by what he does and that inevitably, whatever he does, he will be criticised, but that over a long period, if he makes the correct choice in the beginning, he will have success.  We are all interested in this.  There has been a certain amount of talk to-day about the type of people to be put on this Authority.  We shall need public money and we must all do our level best to see that this system works satisfactorily.  For that reason, I wonder could the Minister tell us if he has any particular type of person in mind.  The television medium itself, from the point of view of information, entertainment and education, will be all-important.  What has been happening in recent years, since 1922, progressively since we put our faith in the schools, is that the schools are <Col N="277" /> becoming less important than they used to be.  The radio has changed that situation and television will change it again.</P>
    <P>The matter is one of very great difficulty and I wonder whether the Minister has any specific views on it. However, for my part, I feel he ought to regard himself as entirely free and he must look for a variety on this Authority, not a variety which would bring the Authority to a stand-still, which you could have easily, but considerable variety.  It should not be bound to sectional interests nor should we endeavour to have certain types of people represented.  On the other hand, we must have people who understand education in its best and widest sense and people who understand entertainment as well.  How the Minister is to do that, I do not know, but I should like to hear whether he has anything to say on it in general terms.</P>

      <P>When Senator Murphy suggested on this amendment there should be representation of the trade unions, it did occur to me that I know of a person&mdash;whose name I shall not mention&mdash;who has given great service to the trade union movement and to the Irish nation.  It could happen that that person or a similar person who has given service to the trade union movement might be appointed to this Authority.  I do not intend to make any representations to the Minister or the Government in that regard, but I could readily understand that happening, and if the person who came to my mind were to be appointed, he would be appointed not because he was a trade union official and a great Irishman but because of his ability to be a good member of the Authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>This is no laughing matter and if this debate is to progress in a reasonable manner, it should be taken seriously, and it would be helpful if certain people would conduct themselves.  Senator Murphy should agree, in all seriousness, that it would <Col N="278" /> be a bad thing that the members of this Authority should be appointed on a sectional basis.  If that were to be conceded to Senator Murphy, it would become a question of the strongest pressure groups, those groups that shouted loudest, being heard.  That would be a very bad thing.  It would be even worse than having members appointed on a political basis, bad as that might be.  The next thing that would happen would be that another strong section in society, the farming community, would make a case that they should have a representation of at least three on the Authority.</P>
      <P>It would mean that all along the line, even within the trade union movement and within agriculture and industry, the groups that could bring the most pressure on the Government would have their nominees appointed. That situation would be a disaster.  In the appointment of the Authority, there should be some balance, and regard should be had to the administrative and business capacity of the persons to be appointed.  It is necessary, therefore, that members, or some members, of the Board would have wide business and administrative capacity because the Board must run as a business.</P>
      <P>The second important feature in my view would be that it should be weighted in favour of education rather than entertainment.  Entertainment as such may be all right but I should think the Board, if this Authority is to give of its best to the Irish nation, can do so only through the medium of education rather than entertainment for entertainment's sake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After business and administrative capacity, the question of education should be weighted higher up than the question of entertainment as such. How far education and entertainment can be coalesced is a matter on which I am not prepared to make any statement here but I feel certain it is possible to do that by proper presentation of programmes and that a programme can be educational and entertaining.  I am satisfied it is along these lines and only along these lines <Col N="279" /> that the Board should be appointed by the Government.  When the Board is appointed many of the members of the Board I feel certain, without having any notion who they will be, will be persons who have given much service to the country and, maybe, to different organisations such as trade unions and different political Parties in the past. There is nothing wrong with that.</P>

      <P>So far as the number of members of the Authority is concerned, I can say at once that the Government intend to fill the membership by the appointment of nine persons. The Government are responsible for the appointment of the members to the Authority, not the Minister, as Section 4 points out; Senators know that themselves.</P>
      <P>I agree almost entirely with the advice given here by Senator Hayes in relation to the type of person the Government should have in mind when seeking nominations for this Authority. I believe it is important that we should take persons representative of the various broad aspects of national life and that we should not seek to appoint persons as representatives of sectional interests.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 5 not moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;( ) The Minister shall cause the terms of employment and <Col N="280" /> remuneration of the members of the Authority to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are a number of such amendments. I do not want to take up the time of the House too long with them. The Bill gives the Minister very considerable powers in a great many sections.  It seems to me that where the Minister exercises a power there will be an accompanying Parliamentary power of debate or of question and answer.  That is inevitable. Once the Minister has power, then there is power in the Oireachtas to ask the Minister questions.</P>
    <P>I suggest that in this instance where a member of the Authority is to hold office on such terms as the Government may determine from time to time, the Minister should cause the terms of employment and remuneration of the members of the Authority to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas as a piece of information.</P>
    <P>I have repeated that type of amendment in other cases.  For instance, in Section 13, amendment 10:</P>
    <P>In subsection (4) to add the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;( ) The Minister shall cause notice of the appointment or removal of the Director-General or of the alteration of his remuneration or of his terms and conditions of holding office, to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I take that view generally.  I should like, if I may, from the point of view of the Chair, to ask the Minister his general view on that.  Perhaps we may be in agreement or we may be in partial agreement.  My reasons are that since the Minister has the power, since the matter is one of great public interest, the members of the Dáil and Seanad should be acquainted with the way the Minister from time to time exercises his power.</P>
    <P>I have not in any case put down an amendment to the effect that something should not be put into operation until the House agrees.  That is put down in regard to another matter.  In the exercise of this power, in a matter of great public interest which will <Col N="281" /> influence a great many people's lives, everyone is entitled to say that the information should be available to the members of both Houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Hayes has already pointed out, if this amendment were accepted, this would be the first Bill on which such an amendment was accepted.  He has already indicated that, if a member is removed from office, the matter can be raised publicly by public question or by notice of motion, I presume, in either House if that conforms with the Standing Orders of the Houses.</P>
      <P>It would be a very rare occasion on which a member would be removed from office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry.  I did not know.  The amendment is No. 6. In so far as that amendment is concerned, we feel that in asking a person to become a member of this Authority we should not be obliged to say to the person concerned: &ldquo;The terms of your employment&rdquo;&mdash;that is what is here; the terms of appointment I presume is what is meant&mdash;&ldquo;shall be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and particulars of the remuneration shall be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  I do not think I could accept that amendment.</P>
      <P>I know that the matter can be raised by public question and that the practice is to give the necessary information when it is asked for.  It is a matter on which we can have two opinions&mdash;whether it would be better when the person is appointed just to let both Houses know exactly what the terms of appointment are and the remuneration&mdash;it will be known, anyway&mdash;or whether the practice should be continued that obtains in other legislation of a similar character.  Then, if anybody wished to know, he could raise the matter by public question. I do not think it advisable to have matters such as this raised by public question in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is my view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is, and that has been the practice down the years.  You are asking people to serve on a public authority.  It is generally conceded that their terms of appointment will be in conformity with an Act of the Oireachtas, that the remuneration certainly will not be out of line with that paid to people in similar appointments on similar boards, and that it is bringing public attention to the individual concerned.  I feel that is not a very good thing in a public service of this character and that the amendment should not be pressed.  For these reasons, I am reluctantly opposed to the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with the Minister.  I do not see reasons for any shyness about this.  If anything, you are going to do more injury to the members of this body if you do not publish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of shyness; it is a question of the principle involved.  It has not been the practice in legislation in regard to other bodies.  There is no obligation in any of the other Acts to lay on the Table of the Houses of the Oireachtas the terms of appointment or the remuneration given to members of a number of boards and semi-public bodies established already.</P>

      <P>In regard to the Civil Service, it is a fact that all one has to do is to consult the Book of Estimates to find out.  I would regard these members of the Authority as being on a par with members of the Civil Service, as well as on a par with members of semi-State bodies.  It would be wise to allow the remuneration to be publicly known, rather than have it sought for by way of public question and perhaps sought with an innuendo.  It would be far better to have it stated and have all remunerations known, rather than have a question raised in relation to the remuneration of an individual, a remuneration which might be greater than another for obvious reasons.  The post might be whole-time or part-time.  In regard to the question in both Houses, there <Col N="283" /> might be an innuendo as to an underhand reason for a person getting more money than another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is wise in rejecting the amendment.  After all, we have 20 odd statutory corporations in this country and I am not aware that the conditions sought in this amendment apply to them.  As the Minister pointed out, there is ample scope by means of question and answer to get this type of information. If you want to make the Authority independent and at the same time, want to have your finger in the pie, I do not see how the Authority can look so independent. I think that we should, as far as possible, try to divorce it from the terms of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance, the Bill contains ample provision to see that the Authority is not independent.  There is no doubt about that.  You cannot call the Authority independent when the Minister has power to prevent it from broadcasting particular things and to compel it to broadcast certain things.  There is no independence there.  That is quite plain.  He appoints them and they have to appoint a Director-General and the Minister's consent must be obtained.</P>
      <P>I am not thirsting for any information for the purposes of making any capital out of it.  It seems to me that in the situation we are in where people are employed on public boards, there is no use in being thin-skinned or mealy-mouthed.  The salaries paid to the members of the E.S.B. are well known.  As Senator Donegan said, I think, civil servants and judges have their remuneration which is well known and easily ascertained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a new Bill and I do not see any reason why, when the Minister has the power to fix not alone the remuneration but the terms of appointment, the members of the Dáil and Seanad should not know as soon as may be of the terms.  I think this is a much better scheme.  People might <Col N="284" /> be quite satisfied with that rather than that attention should be drawn to the matter by way of Parliamentary Question.</P>
    <P>The argument is used that this provision is not made with regard to other boards.  That may be, but, as the Minister has pointed out, questions are frequently asked in the Dáil with regard to remuneration and the questions are answered.  It seems to me that it would be a much better thing in this instance and, indeed, for other boards like this&mdash;I am not saying that they should be published beforehand&mdash;when remuneration has been fixed and people have accepted posts, that they should be made known.</P>
    <P>The argument against this runs rather on the basis that it is an indelicate operation, that in some way it is indelicate to have it put on the Table of the Dáil and Seanad.  Once we accept this kind of system, we have to accept with it the indelicacies.  It is a public matter.  I think it should be known to the members of the Dáil and Seanad and then they can use their discretion afterwards as to what they may do about it.  There is nothing shameful about it.  If you accept public office, you have to accept certain things that go with it. It is one of those things.  Parliament have a right to inquire into the terms of office and the amount of remuneration.</P>
    <P>I can see no objection to the putting in of this kind of amendment in this Bill, especially since the Minister has agreed that the information could be got by way of Parliamentary Question. This is a simpler process without Parliamentary Question.</P>

As I say, I should prefer to see the matter dealt with in a general way.  I do not wish to labour the point or say any more on it.  I feel that the amendment cannot be accepted because of the fact that there are a number of boards in relation to which the same obligation does not apply.

      <P>Reading this amendment, it seemed reasonable enough.  I am surprised that Senator Hayes dilated upon it.  It is all very easy to announce what the remuneration is but it is not so easy for anybody in authority to answer to the Houses of the Oireachtas as to what the terms of employment are, if there is not some specific explanation of what &ldquo;terms of employment&rdquo; means. Section 16 states: &ldquo;The Authority shall establish and maintain&rdquo; etc.  You would have to put in the individual terms of employment which cover a whole page of the Bill.  The amendment does not seem to be reasonable although at the start it seemed to be a reasonable amendment.  In any case the terms of remuneration would be difficult and would create discussion and criticism.</P>

      <P>It shows that neither of us is getting very old, alhough we may look it.  Let me put this question to the Minister.  I do not know what precisely the suggestion that this should be put in a general way means, except that it is an argument against doing it here because it must be done in some general way.  Would the Minister not agree to this course? This is a very important Bill.  If we think this ought to be done, could the Minister not take it to the Dáil and see what the Dáil says about it?  If the Dáil takes it out, we cannot go any further with it.  But I think it would be a very good idea, and a very good way to begin the general principle if we in this case made a breach, if we put in this subsection suggested in my amendment and the Minister brought it to the Dáil.  Even if he said to the Dáil &ldquo;I accepted this amendment but I have no enthusiasm for it; what do you think about it?&rdquo;  he would have gone a certain distance.</P>
      <P>It is part of the business of the Seanad to suggest that there should be certain changes in legislation and even that certain precedents ought not to be followed.  I know of course that there is amazing reverence in certain Senators on the far side for Cumann na nGaedheal precedents, but Cumann na nGaedheal precedents were not all absolutely right.  There may be doubt about some of them.  I think the Minister might accept this amendment or accept some of these amendments, then put them to the other House and see what the other House has to say about them.

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if there is any difference between the allowance given to the Chairman and the other members?  Judging by the wording of the section, there would appear to be no difference.  A member shall be paid &ldquo;such remuneration as shall be fixed from time to time by the Government.&rdquo; It does not indicate that they will pay any special remuneration to the Chairman and I assume the Chairman will have more onerous duties than the other members.</P>

      <P>I wonder would this be the place to ask&mdash;or should it be on Section 11&mdash;what general scheme there is for the relationship between the Chairman of the Authority and the Director-General?

      <P>The Director-General will be the executive authority, in an executive position, and he will be responsible for the day-to-day work of the service.  The Board itself, and the Chairman of the Board as such, will not interfere unduly with the Director-General in the carrying out of his duties.  There is no such thing as superiority as between the Chairman of the Board and the Director-General. Is that what the Senator has in mind in asking the question?</P>

Will the Chairman have any power, for example, to take steps himself as between meetings of the Authority? Will he have any power to give instructions to the Director-General or will the Director-General be governed merely by the Board and will it be the Chairman's business to preside over the Authority or will he have any authority such as the Minister has as executive head of his Department?</P>

      <P>No, part-time, at the moment, anyway, but I should not like to say that the Chairman for all time will be on a part-time basis.  We shall have to wait until we see how this service operates to know whether it would be advisable or not to have a full-time Chairman.

      <P>Would that presuppose a situation in which, if in the day-to-day work of the television service, the Chairman disagrees violently with what is being done by the Director-General he would then report back to the Authority, have the matter raised with the Authority and there take over and instruct the Director-General either to do what he was not doing or not to do what he was doing?

      <P>Will the relationship not be the same as that between the Chairman of a company and the managing director?  The position in that case is that the board of the company have full power to issue any instruction they like to the managing director and that the chairman normally would not have any particular power to overrule the managing director between meetings, but from time to time the board may give the chairman a specific power to take a day-to-day interest in some specified matter.  In that case, the chairman would have power to overrule the managing director.  I think the principle here is exactly the same <Col N="291" /> principle as you find in any company governing the relationship between the chairman of the board and the managing director.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">

      <P>Except of course if the Chairman in this instance were full-time, obviously, his relationship with the Director-General would surely be different from the relationship of the chairman of a board to the managing director.  However, that is a matter for the future, as the Minister says.  Analogies are never quite satisfactory and while there is a good deal in what Senator Ryan says, being Chairman of this Authority is not quite the same as being chairman of a board of directors because there will be a great many things to be decided from time to time and the Director-General and the Chairman would have to &ldquo;hit it off&rdquo; together just as the managing director of a company and the chairman of the board have to do.</P>

      <P>The Bill gives no authority to the Chairman to interfere or to give a direction to the Director-General but the Authority is, as I have said, the policy-making body and, as is normal in any business board or executive, the Authority can at a meeting or in its discussions authorise the Chairman to convey its direction to the Director-General, if it so desires.  I mean, it is quite free to do it that way or to send its general directions to him in writing.  It may not be always feasible to send it in writing and the Authority could tell the Chairman or ask the Chairman, or have it agreed amongst themselves, that the Chairman would see the Director-General and convey some item in regard to the general policy as operated in the service by interview or word of mouth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>Before section 8 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;8.  Before appointing a person to be a member of the Authority the Government shall satisfy themselves that that person will have no <Col N="292" /> such financial or other interest (and in particular no such financial or other interest in any advertising agency or in any business concerned with the manufacture or sale of apparatus for wireless telegraphy or other telegraphic equipment or in any business consisting or intended to consist in whole or in part in entering into or carrying out contracts with the Authority for the provision of programmes or parts of programmes) as is likely to affect prejudicially the discharge by him of his functions as member of the Authority and the Government shall also satisfy themselves from time to time with respect to any member of the Authority that he has no such interest and any person who is, or whom the Government propose to appoint to be, a member of the Authority shall, whenever requested by the Minister so to do, furnish to the Minister such information as the Minister shall consider necessary for the performance by the Government of their duties under this section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This involves the substitution of the amendment for Section 8 of the Bill as drafted.  I take it that we are all agreed that the fundamental thing to be sought after in this Bill is to establish an Authority that will be as independent as it can be, consistent with the necessary restrictions which the Minister may from time to time impose upon it.  What we are trying to achieve is the establishment of an Authority which will be completely free from all kinds of influences and in the earlier sections we have provided that people will be free, as far as legislation can make them free, from political influences.</P>
    <P>In the Authority of nine people there will be various kinds of interests represented, not so much various interests, but people with different types of experience, all of which will conduce to the provision of the best television service that the limited financial resources and the considerable talents of this country can produce.  I do not think that Section 8 of the Bill is at all helpful to the establishment of the kind of Authority that we have in mind or to the establishment of an <Col N="293" /> Authority which will achieve the objectives which everybody is agreed upon.</P>
    <P>The section, as it is set out in the Bill, enables people who have interests in companies and concerns which will, we can take it, be dealing directly with the Authority, to remain members of the Authority and it provides that such members of the Authority shall merely disclose that fact to the Authority and that they will not take part in any discussion.</P>
    <P>What is proposed in the amendment is that, before the Government appoints any member to the Authority, the Government shall make such inquiries as are necessary to satisfy themselves that every one of the seven to nine people they appoint will not have any such financial interest in any matter as would be likely to affect prejudicially the discharge by such people of their functions as members of the Authority and in the amendment I particularly specify the type of interest which, if people had it, would be likely prejudicially to affect the discharge of their functions as members of the Authority.  These interests are: interest in any advertising agency, since the Authority will be concerned with advertisements and will be deriving a large part of its revenue from advertising; interest in any business concerned with the manufacture or sale of apparatus for wireless telegraphy or other telegraphic equipment&mdash;that embraces the whole range of apparatus and equipment which the Authority would be purchasing from time to time or, indeed, the kind of receiver which the Authority would decide should be the type of receiver that would be necessary to operate upon the line standard with which they would be dealing&mdash;or any business connected with the putting on of programmes for entertainment in any shape or form.</P>
    <P>I think there are very good practical reasons why the amendment suggested should be accepted as against the section as it stands in the Bill. First of all, the section in the Bill has no real practical value.  It merely <Col N="294" /> means that if X, Y, Z and A, B, C, are members of the Authority and X indicates to Y, Z, A, B, C on a contract which they are proposing to make with a firm of engineers or with an advertising agency, or with somebody interested in putting on programmes, that he has an interest in that firm, X shall then take no part in the proceedings having disclosed his interest in the firm.  We hope the members of the Authority will be supermen, will be a great deal above the average, but they will not be gods or will not partake of a divine nature to the extent that they will shed themselves of all the infirmities of human nature.  Being human beings, as X has an interest in a particular contract it must follow in the ordinary course of events&mdash;and this must be the experience and judgment of members of the House&mdash;the other members of the Authority are more likely to find reasons for giving a contract, whether it be for the building of a transmitter on Kippure, or supplying certain apparatus, or putting on a programme, to the firm with which he is connected rather than to a firm they know nothing about.</P>
    <P>For that reason alone, if we want to establish an Authority which will not be subject to adverse criticism, and a service which will not develop in people's minds a particular prejudice because of the type of people who are on the Authority, we should seek to appoint to it people who have no interest in television, or television service other than the provision of the best service they can get for the people of this country.</P>
    <P>The whole aim of the Bill, as I say, has been to create an independent Authority but I can see that, since the Director-General is to be the key man in this service, if we have on the Authority people who have interests in companies and concerns interested in advertising, in putting on programmes and entertainment, the Director-General, as a matter of practice, will have an extremely difficult job and the difficulties with which he would be faced would be of such a calibre and such a type that the television service will be less efficient, less <Col N="295" /> useful, and less profitable to the country than if these difficulties did not arise.</P>
    <P>For instance, if you have on the Authority a person who has an interest in an advertising agency and his agency wants advertisements dealt with by the Television Authority in a particular way and the Director-General, in the exercise of his discretion in that capacity, decides that is not the way best suited to programmes, that best meets the reasonable requirements of the tele-viewers or accords with good taste and good programming, if the member of the Authority interested in the advertising agency is a strong character, or a truculent character, the Director-General will be faced with a problem with which he ought not to be faced as to whether or not he will decide to overrule the wishes of the agency with which the member of the Authority is connected, or row in with its wishes. I do not think that if we want to achieve a really first class television service within our resources that we ought to put the Director-General in that kind of position.</P>
    <P>Similarly, if a member of the Television Authority is concerned in the production of programmes, if he has an organisation with which he is associated in putting on particular types of shows and entertainment, and the Director-General is satisfied that perhaps too much of that particular type of programme is being put on, he will then have to meet with the vested interest of a member of the Authority to deal with that.  The member of the Authority, sitting with his colleagues, will be able to produce all classes of convincing reasons and&mdash;since the Director-General is merely an executive and a subordinate of the Authority&mdash;the member interested in that kind of venture, such as putting on programmes, will carry a great deal more weight than merely the paid officer of the Authority.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from that, if you have on the Board people who are interested in contracts, who have business and private profit interests in matters with which the Authority may <Col N="296" /> be concerned, and who&mdash;mind you&mdash; may be fairly expert on these matters by reason of their knowledge and their position, they will be able to exert an influence over the Board which will sway the Board into making a decision which, if they were free from that kind of influence, the Board would not make.  If we want to have a completely independent Television Authority we should provide that it will be uninhibited by any consideration, on the part of any member, of private profit or gain, and the only way to do that is to exclude from the Board all people who would have any interest in any concern of any kind which would impinge upon the activities of the Authority.</P>
    <P>I want to point out to the House that this section is by no means a precedent.  We have had it in a number of Bills which have come before us, even in my time, and it is to be found in quite a number of other statutes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>If you look up the recent Bill dealing with Coras Tráchtála, the Bill dealing with Bord na gCon, and so on, you will find it in all of them.  Senator Lenihan is asking for something for which he has not bargained but I want to point out that the real precedent for this kind of section is to be found in the Electricity Supply Act, 1927.  Earlier this evening we discussed Cumann na nGaedheal precedents and that very section, Section 8, is an exact reproduction of Section 10 of the Electricity Supply Act, 1927.</P>
      <P>For the benefit of the House I want to read Section 11 of that Act:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  Every person appointed to be a member of the Board shall within three months after his appointment absolutely sell and dispose of all shares in any electrical undertaking which he shall at the time of his appointment own or be interested in for his own benefit, and if any shares in any electrical undertaking shall come to or vest in a member of the Board by will or succession for his own benefit, he shall within three months after the same shall <Col N="297" /> have so come to or vested in him, absolutely sell and dispose of the same or his interest therein.</P>
    <P>I shall read on, if the House will grant me the indulgence.  It continues:</P>
    <P>(2)  A member of the Board shall not, while he holds that office, purchase, take, or become interested in for his own benefit any shares in any electrical undertaking.</P>
    <P>(3)  Any member of the Board who shall retain, purchase, take, or become or remain interested in any shares in any electrical undertaking in contravention of this section shall be disqualified for and be deemed to have vacated his office as such member.</P>
    <P>(4)  In this section the expression &ldquo;shares in any electrical undertaking&rdquo; means and includes any stock, shares, debentures, debenture stock, bonds, or other securities of any company engaged in the generation, distribution, or supply of electricity or the manufacture of or wholesale or retail dealing in electrical apparatus and includes any share or interest in any unincorporated undertaking similarly engaged.</P>
    <P>These were Procrustean standards and these were the standards upon which the first semi-State body in this country was established.  If the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in his opening speech on this Bill advances as one of the arguments for creating a new independent television Authority as a semi-State body that a number of other such semi-State bodies have functioned satisfactorily in this country and refers to the E.S.B. as one such, which indeed was the prototype of all such semi-State bodies, it is a great pity the Minister did not observe the standards of integrity and impartiality that were adopted away back in 1927 on the establishment of the very successful undertaking, the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <P>The provisions of Section 11 of the Electricity Supply Act, which has formed the pattern for all semi-State organisations that have since been established, apply today to the members <Col N="298" /> of the Electricity Supply Board. The supply of electricity, while of the greatest moment and consequence to the people of this country, and indeed was a great venture when it was established, is nothing compared with the tremendous power for good or ill which has been vested in the Authority under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The House should accept this amendment for the purpose of ensuring that the members of the Authority will not be inhibited in any way that legislation can provide from giving a completely impartial view of every matter that comes before them in the discharge of their functions as members of the Authority.</P>
    <P>Section 8, as it stands, is a sham.  It would have no effect in practice and it is merely a pretence.  As Senator O'Reilly said earlier this evening, the Government are appearing to do what is right in Section 8 as it stands.  If we want to be really sincere in establishing an Authority that would be uninhibited in every respect and free from any prejudice in the discharge of its functions, this amendment should be substituted for the Section.  However, I do not think that merely the appointment is sufficient.  It is also provided in the amendment that from time to time&mdash;it is a matter for the discretion of the Government&mdash;they shall make such inquiries as the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs deems necessary to satisfy themselves that no person has been appointed who at the time of his appointment has any interest which is likely to affect prejudicially the discharge of his functions as a member of the Authority or, in the intervening period, has acquired such an interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a rather clumsy amendment and if it were accepted it would not be effective.  The object of both Section 8 and the proposed section is to prevent the members of the Authority from being influenced by financial reasons in exercising their functions as members of the Authority but in the amendment all the onus in ensuring that the member has no financial interest elsewhere is placed on the Government.  The Government have to make sure, in the first place, <Col N="299" /> that the person whom they are about to appoint has no interest, has no connections, which would prevent his being unprejudiced in carrying out his functions as a member of the Authority. That would be relatively simple. The Government could, I am sure, find out a certain amount about a person and make reasonably sure that he did not have interests which would affect him, but the second thing that the Government have to do is to make sure from time to time that the person has not acquired interests.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons I say this is a somewhat clumsy amendment is that the amendment starts off by saying: &ldquo;Before appointing a person to be a member of the Authority the Government shall satisfy themselves that that person will have no such financial or other interest...&rdquo; How the Government are to make sure that the person will have no financial interest, as apart from deciding at a given moment that he has no financial interest, is something I find it hard to understand and something which the Government would find it very hard to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leaving aside for the moment that rather peculiar wording, the Government have to ensure from time to time that the member has not acquired any interest.  How are they going to do that?  Will they constantly check on the activities of a member?  Will they appoint a special civil servant or ask for the help of the police constantly to go around to check on the activities of the members to see if they have acquired any interest in anything that would affect their position?  The Government could not, in practice, do it.  If the Government had this obligation laid on them and if they took their duties seriously, it would be a most objectionable business because if they took their duties seriously they would have to spy on the members of the Authority to see were they acquiring any interests which would affect their position on the Authority.  No Government will constantly check like that on the members of a board.  It would be most objectionable if they did, and I am quite sure that in practice the Government would not take any steps <Col N="300" /> to check constantly on the activities of such members.  Consequently this amendment would be quite useless.</P>
    <P>The difference between this amendment and the original section is that under this amendment there is no obligation on the member to disclose any interest he may have.  Under the amendment, as it stands, the member could go on acquiring interests in radio factories, advertising firms or anything else.  He could go into meetings of the Authority and vote in such a way that his firm or company would benefit and he would be under no obligation whatever under the amendment to disclose the fact that he had an interest. He can carry on until such time as the Government or the Minister taps him on the shoulder and says: &ldquo;No. We have made inquiries.  We find you have an interest.  You must not take any further action or make any further decisions in this matter.&rdquo; Therefore, the onus is entirely thrown on the Government to check on his activities and tell the member he may not take any action or continue as a member because he has acquired an interest whereas, under the original section, the onus is cast on the member.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill corresponds very much to the usual clause which appears in the Articles of Association of a company applying to directors and saying what the duties and obligations of a director are in regard to contacts which may be entered into by the company and by some other firm in which the director has an interest.  By and large, the obligations of a director under the Articles of Association as normally drafted are very much the same as the obligations of a member of the Authority as set out in Section 8.  I think it is a very much better approach to this problem and a very much more effective one.</P>
    <P>If the member fails to disclose at any time the interest in any particular contract or the interest in any particular firm or company with which the Authority proposes to have dealings then appropriate action can be taken against him by the Minister. I believe the original section is a much more practical one and very <Col N="301" /> much more effective.  It obviates the possibility of the Government's having to indulge in the very objectionable course of action of constantly checking on the affairs of members of the Authority.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from all that, there is another consideration involved.  Under the proposed amendment the Government would be precluded from appointing any person who had any connection with or interest in any firm which might be likely to have dealings with the Authority.  It might rule out the appointment of a person who would be eminently suitable as a member of the Authority.</P>
    <P>There are very few people in this country who have any experience of television and broadcasting.  With regard to the few who have any experience and who would be useful members of the Authority, quite a large proportion must have some interest in factories that make radio equipment, or advertising firms, and so on.  To introduce an amendment which would positively preclude any person of that sort from being a member of an Authority would be a bad thing because it would rule out the possibility of appointing a person who might be eminently suitable and very valuable as a member of the Authority.</P>
    <P>If the person is well known to have an interest in some firm which would have dealings with the Authority, the very fact that he is well known to have that interest would be a sufficient safeguard to prevent his abusing his position on the Authority.  The better known he is to have that connection, the more certain it is that he will not abuse his position because it would be quite obvious to everybody if he did.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, under Section 8, even if people do not know originally that he has this interest, he is obliged to disclose the interest.  He is obliged not to take part in any discussion or decision affecting a contract or anything like that between the Authority and the firm in which he is interested.  There is quite sufficient safeguard in Section 8 to prevent <Col N="302" /> any person of that kind from abusing his position as a member of the Authority.  Therefore, I believe the amendment would not be effective from the point of view of preventing a person abusing his position.  It might also do positive harm in preventing the Government appointing a person who might be very suitable as a member of the Authority.</P>

      <P>This is a very small country.  I feel that in many business undertakings there is a situation where if you are one of the &ldquo;boys&rdquo; you can get everything.  If you are in the swim you are within the closed shop circle and nobody else can buy or sell except you.  You have it in many industries.  It is inevitable in a small country such as this.</P>
      <P>If an industry becomes big enough in this country there is no room for anyone else.  The television industry is a perfect example.  The Minister in a reply to me said there will be no others.  Therefore, these people who have things to sell to television, whether it be an act, some sort of entertainment, whether it be some goods&mdash;it does not matter&mdash;have only one person to whom they can sell it. The case was made so well by my colleague, Senator O'Quigley, that there is no point in my labouring it further.</P>
      <P>I want to deal now with prior information.  I know of instances where prior information in regard to decisions taken but not yet implemented was most valuable.  I know of a factory which is extending its premises to do something new because of prior information that the Government intended to set up a Television Authority. It is quite right that that should emanate from the Government, that somebody should tell these people that we should manufacture in this country things that would be used in television.  That has happened. It is excellent that the Government have done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us suppose, however, that the Authority is making some decision and that a member of the Authority discloses the probable decision, or if he has withdrawn because of his interest and goes out and meets socially <Col N="303" /> other members of the Authority afterwards and finds out that the majority are in favour of a certain decision, and passes on the word to his business associate, then if he is in the particular business providing this service or these goods, he will be in first. In such circumstances prior information is most important.</P>
    <P>If you are to have a board on which you have people involved in the television business, as such, you must have this weakness of prior information. I know of a public board&mdash;it has nothing to do with entertainment&mdash; and it was bitterly complained to me that because a member of it had prior information on things that were happening he had made a very fine business out of that prior information. Whether that is true or whether it was just a case of ordinary competition succeeding in bringing the person out in front of his counterparts, I do not know, but he is a member of the board and he has made a fine business out of it.</P>
    <P>Therefore, you have that worry.  It is a more natural one than the ordinary thing that comes to mind of a contract coming up and a person voting against his conscience.  That is bringing it to the ultimate.  Prior information is a thing almost anybody would give if they were involved in business &mdash;say, a director&mdash;and left a meeting of the Television Authority and knew a decision would be likely to be taken in three weeks.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan made the point that the passing of this amendment might mean the exclusion of people who were excellent and who would be the best people for the Authority.  It would exclude a lot of people but I feel that the standard of integrity we must demand insists that we do not place people in this position of having a business interest that will interfere with their membership of the Authority.</P>
    <P>This will be big business.  The biggest expansion in business in terms of turnover and profits in Britain in the boom years of the past five years was Independent Television.  The greatest profits that were made and the greatest advances in any shares were the <Col N="304" /> profits and advances made by the Independent Television Authority.  As I said in my speech on Second Stage, though we may not except such spectacular results, we must expect a good business result.  In that situation, I can imagine members of the Television Authority being asked to become directors of firms who will have interests which would mean that they would wish to know just what the Authority was thinking of doing.</P>
    <P>I know that if I were involved in a business or company which had a service to give or goods to sell to a television authority and was making a good profit and I saw another chance of a good profit, I would not think twice, as a businessman, about asking a member of the Television Authority to become a member of my Board and giving him £250 a year.  I submit that businessmen are not little tin gods. When you are in business, and someone raises the ante, you have to raise it again.  Nobody knows that better than Senator Lenihan.  That is no charge against him or me.</P>
    <P>That danger is there.  I think it would be quite true to say that if we carry on as we are to carry on under the Bill, certain members of the Television Authority will be members of companies selling goods to the Television Authority.  Senator O'Quigley has made an excellent case.  I merely want to make the point about prior information and the fact that the television authority in Britain has shown us that big profits will exist for advertising firms and firms supplying services</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Louis Walsh Mr. Louis Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Louis Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to see the analogous position between a director of the E.S.B. in 1927 who would have an interest in an electrical undertaking and a member of the Authority, for the reason that in that year, there was a tremendous number of electrical undertakings all over the country and it was the policy of the E.S.B. to acquire these undertakings at the best possible price at which they could get them.  Accordingly, these were rival industries, one competing against the other and, therefore, there is no analogous position in regard to the present position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley referred to the <Col N="305" /> fact that people with vested interests might give reasons why a certain programme should be put on but the section, as drafted, prevents that person having any discussion whatsoever because he has to disclose the fact that he has an interest.  For that reason, he is not permitted to take part in any discussion.  I think the section, as drafted, could be improved.  I should like to suggest to the Minister that, apart from the member not being allowed to take part in discussion, he should actually withdraw during the discussion of any matter in which he has any interest.  That might make it more effective because if a member of the Authority did not take part in the discussion, it might not be sufficient. Somebody referred to the fact that he might prejudice the discussion to some extent.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan referred to the fact that if the person does not disclose his interest, the Minister can take appropriate action.  I should like to see it embodied in the Bill that the Minister would be prepared to dismiss him or do something of a positive nature. Senator Ryan very properly pointed out that practically any useful member of the Authority would have some interest in a company, in the promotion of a programme or some such thing and that that individual would be a very desirable member of the Authority.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes referred to the fact that considerable experience should be possessed by a member of the Authority.  I could name a number of people who would be, in my opinion, very desirable members of the Authority.  They would have experience; they would have knowledge; and they would be competent, as Senator Murphy mentioned, and they would be extremely useful in an advisory capacity.  It would be very wrong, I think, that the Authority should be deprived of their knowledge and experience.</P>
    <P>The amendment, as drafted, in my opinion, would mean that any person who has shares in any company which is advertising on television would thereby be excluded from membership of the Authority.  In other words, the amendment, as drafted, is much too restrictive.  We must also remember <Col N="306" /> that there are to be nine members on the Authority and even if one individual had an interest, there will still be eight others.  You could never visualise one person dominating all the others.  These people would be men with minds of their own and they would, therefore, be able to assert themselves.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, however, the Director-General will have the day-to-day administration.  It will be a matter largely for him to decide as to the programmes to be put on by the Authority.  The Authority is simply a policy-making Authority which will meet occasionally.  The members being only part-time members, they will not have that power which some people suggest they would have.  The Authority would have to delegate most of the day-to-day work to the Director-General.  It is right that he should not have any financial interest.  For these reasons, I think the amendment, as drafted by Senator O'Quigley, should not be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that if this amendment were accepted, it would throw an extraordinary onus on the Minister.  The operative words are: &ldquo;Before appointing a person to be a member of the Authority the Government shall satisfy themselves that that person will have no such financial or other interest... as is likely to affect prejudicially the discharge by him of his functions.&rdquo;  It does not at all exclude apparently anybody with an interest but only if the Government decide, according to the amendment, that it will affect &ldquo;the discharge by him of his functions as member of the Authority.&rdquo; I think it throws an extraordinary onus on the Minister if he has to decide at what stage a man's financial interests will have an effect.  If he himself had shares, does that put him out?  If his wife has shares, does that put him out?  If his brother has shares, does that put him out?  It does not prevent any man from being a member of the Authority.  I think that is one of the defects in the proposed amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="307" /> As Senator Ryan and others said, it will exclude an extraordinary number of men who probably would be the best men we could get here to advise on at least the business side of this whole proposition of television.  We could hardly afford to lose their experience. I imagine that the number of men outside who would be conversant with the business side of it and who themselves had no financial interest in it would be very small indeed. I could conceive of a man who perhaps took an interest in television from the very beginning, who saw that it was something that was going to be great, not alone in power but also as a business proposition. Perhaps he invested a few pounds in it because he believed it was the coming thing.  Here is a man who would probably be an ideal man to have on such an Authority, but according to Senator Quigley he must go.</P>
    <P>We had a very good example of roughly the same thing in the inquiry that was held in the last 12 months in England where it transpired that the directors of the Bank of England were men who had interests in, and were directors of, huge international finance companies.  Their companies, it was discovered, profited by the steps taken by the Bank of England. They were directors of their companies and also directors of the Bank of England.  They would not have been directors of the Bank of England unless they were in close touch with day-to-day international business and finance.  To a great extent that is what we are doing here if we completely exclude all men connected in any way with financial matters in television, broadcasting and even advertising.  The section as it is drafted is much more suitable, but I am not quite sure on that one point: that the disclosure should be made to the Minister and not to the Authority. It would be much more suitable to make it to the Minister.  The Minister could then ask the man not to take action when that contract was being discussed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me <Col N="308" /> that there is agreement between the two sides that something more is necessary than is in the section, that there could be a certain amount of abuse.  It would seem that the original two sections, as quoted from the Electricity Supply Board Act, seemed to meet the case better than Section 8 and the amendment proposed by Senator O'Quigley.  Section 8 appears very defective in that, as mentioned by Senator Louis Walsh, there is not the obligation on the member to withdraw from the meeting.  Senators all know that the fact of having a silent member present at a meeting, when he knows what is said and what goes on at the meeting, is in itself a grave embarrassment especially when dealing with something that concerns his firm and so on.  Secondly, I note in this Section 8 there is no penalty provided for failure to disclose, which seems to be a grave weakness, as in the Electricity Supply Board Act the penalty provided was automatic disqualification. I think that should be provided here too.</P>
      <P>I always wonder at the scarcity there is of good men, when there is such concern that we might miss a good man as if we have not 12 jobs to do for every good man we have got.  It is to the credit of those who drafted the E.S.B. regulations that, as quoted by Senator Walsh, they actually excluded from membership those who at that time might be regarded as having intimate knowledge of electricity and its working&mdash;those who were responsible and in charge of the local electricity companies throughout the country.  That was a very wise decision, and if you have to exclude those who are connected with television or radio services at present, you are doing only what was done in 1927 and, I think, done wisely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One other point.  It does seem again that unless some deterrent is provided there will be this development of appointing members of the Television Authority as sleeping partners or directors on various agencies that hope to profit by the development of television here.  I wonder whether the Minister would use the section in the Act which says he has power to <Col N="309" /> remove?  I wonder would he immediately remove a member who accepted a directorship on some firm of radio or television manufacturers or who would be likely to give scandal by being connected with a firm that might ultimately profit?</P>
    <P>The example given by Senator Cole sets no standard for us.  In fact, I could imagine it in many countries being the subject of a public outcry that financial institutions with which these directors were concerned actually made a profit that could be traced back to the decisions of the bank itself. If that is not approaching graft, I do not know what graft really is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of fact, I think the inquiry in that case decided that they did not disclose anything at all&mdash;that it was purely business acumen on the part of the companies.</P>

      <P>I should like to support what Senator Cole has said.  It would be a great pity if we drafted this section in such a way as to exclude genuine experts.  It is true that, as Senator Quinlan said, we are on the whole short of experts in matters of this kind in this country. It seems to me if the section were as stringently drafted as Senator O'Quigley suggests, we might simply be excluding very valuable men.  It would be like excluding medical men, because they have some financial interest, from a committee dealing with medical matters; or University men from some committee dealing with University matters.  It is very hard to draw the line in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Quinlan that this section is perhaps not quite stringently enough drafted, and I think the Minister might reconsider it before Report Stage.  I agree with Senator Quinlan that there ought to be some provision that a person with financial interests should be bound to withdraw and that possibly there should be a penalty imposed if he did not withdraw in such circumstances. I suggest to the Minister it might be worth while looking into the wording <Col N="310" /> of this clause before the Report Stage. I think also that Senator O'Quigley's amendment is rather too far-reaching, and if we adopted it we would probably lose some very valuable men.</P>

      <P>The Government will in the ordinary way consider before appointing anybody to the Authority whether such person is suitable.  This consideration will include the question of whether he has an interest which would conflict with the general performance of his duty as a member. I take the same view, as was expressed here by several Senators, that the amendment proposed by Senator O'Quigley restricts the choice of the Government too much.</P>
      <P>The section as drafted&mdash;this was pointed out by Senator O'Quigley and by several other Senators&mdash;is practically identical with somewhat similar provisions in other statutes.  I shall name some of them.  It is practically the same in the Electricity Supply Act of 1927.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same in the Transport Act, 1950; it is the same in the Turf Development Act, 1946; it is the same in the Sea Fisheries Act, 1942; it is the same in the Gaeltacht Industries Act, 1957, and in the Export Promotion Act, 1959.  Under all those Acts, there are people contracting with the authorities set up and probably the contracts are more valuable and more continuous in their nature than will be contracts under this Bill.  It is a fact that the public service rendered by these authorities is of a very high standard.  I know of no case in which it has come to light that any member of a board has interested himself in securing contracts for firms in which he may have an interest.  If we accept <Col N="311" /> this amendment, there will have to be an inquisition into the private affairs of every individual considered for appointment to this Authority.  We should have to exclude people who perhaps have shares in a Company, as has been pointed out by some of the speakers.</P>
      <P>Senators who have spoken in favour of the section as it stands have made a reasonable case and a good case against the amendment.  If this amendment were accepted, it would be very difficult to determine to what extent the exclusion should go.  As Senator Donegan pointed out, this is a small country and the number of people conversant with television, and all that goes with it, is limited.  If we were to accept the amendment, we would limit the field of selection.  I cannot conceive the Authority meeting and a member of the Authority, who might have some interest in a contract or in some other business connected with television, sitting down with the other members while that contract or business is being discussed.  I take it that such a member would leave the meeting.  That is the normal procedure.</P>

      <P>If we did that, someone would have to stand at the door and ensure that the man went out. This Authority will be constituted of rational men transacting business. The people appointed will be people of repute and independent character. Accepting the responsibility imposed, any member affected in the way suggested will leave the meeting and let the business be transacted in his absence.  He will take no part in anything that might possibly concern himself.  Remember, it is the approval of the Authority that will be <Col N="312" /> sought.  The contracts will be examined, in the first instance, by the staff.  I am sure the Authority will follow the long practice which has obtained of selecting the contractor competent to carry out that for which he has contracted.  The section, as drafted, is, in my opinion, a sufficient guarantee.  It is in line with previous legislation.  The Authority will, I believe, conduct its business in a manner worthy of its members.</P>

We will accept that the people appointed will be responsible people who will act honestly and honourably, irrespective of personal interests.  If we could eliminate avarice and selfishness from humanity, this would be a much happier world today.</P>
      <P>I do not want to widen the scope of this debate too much because I know how much could be said on these lines.  The fact is that we must decide whether we have faith in humanity or not.  If we have faith, we shall not put in undue restrictions born of suspicion and the fear that something will go wrong, a fear that members of this Authority appointed by the Government will use methods of business which would mean sharp practice, or act on dishonourable lines.  If that is to be the situation, it would be better for us that we should never embark on any such undertaking as a television service.  I know that the majority of the people do not hold that view, no matter what their political beliefs may be.  That is my own opinion and my hope.</P>

    <P>The situation of members of the E.S.B. was referred to.  Much water has flowed down the Shannon and the Erne since 1927 and I am accepting Senator O'Quigley's reference to Section 11 of the E.S.B. Bill to the effect that if a member of the Board of the E.S.B. acquires from his aunt or from somebody else a share in, say, Solus Teoranta&mdash;the people who make the lamps&mdash;in the G.E.C. or in the factory at Carrick-on-Shannon where electrical fittings are made, and that person, through neglect or carelessness or through not having read the Act recently, although working it in practice, within three months fails to dispose of those shares, he would <Col N="314" /> be penalised and kicked off the Board as an undesirable person.  The position is that we have outlived the necessity for that type of restriction.</P>

I do not think it is desirable or good or honourable under the privilege of Parliament to suggest, or to insinuate, despite the findings of the sworn inquiry, that there were sharp practices or undesirable dealings on the part of certain people.  If we are to restrict too much, as a member proposes to do, and if all countries were to work along those lines, the fear of malpractice on the part of others would choke every enterprise or undertaking.

      <P>May I say, in conclusion, that the best case for leaving it as it is, has been made by Senator Ryan?  Let us have as few restrictions as possible.  Let us rely on the honour of the men who are to be members of this Authority.  The voice of Parliament and of the people is a powerful weapon.  If it should ever happen&mdash;I <Col N="316" /> hope and trust it never will&mdash;that sharp practice such as appears to be in the minds of people who, I think, are over-suspicious, should occur, Parliament would still be there.  In the long run, that is the best way of righting such matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I found myself in substantial agreement with Senator O'Reilly&mdash;which does not always happen to me.  I think he is quite right in what he says on several points.  In the first place, I think in regard to many of the provisions of this Bill, we must demonstrate our trust in the Authority.  We must not draw up a Bill so framed that it makes it appear that we have an Authority of scoundrels.  We must place trust in them in relation to this clause and others about which I shall speak later. As Senator O'Reilly said, we must have faith in the people appointed. Furthermore, I think the section as drafted is very carefully drafted.  It sets out three provisions about people who might have some interest in contracts. The first is that they shall disclose this interest to the Authority; the second is that they shall take no part in deliberations or decisions of the Authority in regard to such contracts; and the third is that the disclosure shall be recorded in the minutes of the Authority.</P>
      <P>If somebody had such an interest and failed to disclose it, there would be grounds for a major scandal and it is quite obvious that he will, by very force of circumstances, in every case disclose it.  Secondly, he has no power to affect a contract because he is not allowed to take part in the deliberations.  Then there is the fact that these minutes must be recorded. These provisions, I think, provided we have any trust at all in the people we appoint, give full guarantee that the kind of trickery anticipated by some of the supporters of this amendment will not take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the amendment itself, if the Parliamentary draftsman were to commit a section like this to paper and to send it up to the Seanad, I should imagine Senator O'Quigley being one of the first to be bitingly sarcastic about a section which contains one <Col N="317" /> sentence but 186 words.  It is clear, of course, that from a lawyer's point of view that makes it an extremely interesting section.  Consider the fun you could have construing it legally and reading words 53 to 74 in the light of what comes between words 122 and 127 and wondering whether the first 16 words are all to be taken together or whether we are to understand that what is contained in the bracket in the middle also applies to what is outside of it and to the second portion, in which the Minister is to look into these things.  In other words, for lawyers who want to have fun in court and to enjoy being paid for construing complicated Acts, this is an excellent amendment.  It is not only unnecessary but so cumbrous, as Senator O'Reilly pointed out&mdash;a much better amendment would be briefer&mdash;and tries to cover so many things in a single sentence, that it is bad by reason of that alone.  I do not think it is necessary. I do not think it is a well-drafted amendment and we should not contemplate it further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Being a Corkman, I am naturally suspicious of human nature in other human beings and even though I am a bit uneasy about Senator O'Quigley's amendment&mdash;like Senator Sheehy Skeffington, I think it has much too many words in one sentence&mdash; nevertheless, I am far from happy about the section as it stands and I was anxious to hear the Minister because I hoped that he would say to us that he would reconsider the position between now and Report Stage. I am beginning to fear, however, that this Bill is being discussed on a political basis rather than on the merits of the various sections, which I think is regrettable.</P>
      <P>I am not so much concerned about the contracts that this Authority might make for the building of stations, the supply of equipment, and things like that.  I am concerned with the contracts which it will obviously have to make in regard to the handing over of programme time to promoting companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talked about people expert in television and in radio.  I was hoping that the Authority that <Col N="318" /> he would be appointing would be regarded as people who would be good administrators, with a broad background, sensible people, not people who are experts and who already have a foot in in regard to T.V.  I expected that he would point to the sections in various other Acts, such as the Transport Act.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister and the House will appreciate that we are not just dealing with a business in this matter; we are dealing with a very important service and I should imagine that most of the time of this Authority would be taken up, not in administering its business, but rather in making contracts. I do not know too much about T.V. but it seems to me that most of their time would be engaged on this matter of making contracts for the sale of time on T.V. and, in those circumstances, the section governing the members of the Authority should be very carefully drawn up.  There have been scandals previously&mdash;not very many&mdash;but we cannot simply say there has been no scandal.  I do not want to throw things in at all.</P>

      <P>I think it would be very undesirable either to discuss this now or to leave grounds for suspicion in future.  I hope the Minister will not look on this as a political matter simply because Senators here take one line and Senators over there take another line.  I hope between now and Report Stage he will look at this section and see if it could be improved. On reading it, before considering Senator O'Quigley's amendment at all, I thought it was loosely drawn up in the sense that it was dealing with an important service and that the Minister should be very careful that the people on the Authority would not be people who were engaged in the business of advertising or in the business of promoting programmes.  Remember, this is a part-time Authority in the sense that the people will be part-time; they will probably be working at something else and it would be <Col N="319" /> very desirable that the Minister should look again at this section.  I appeal to him on those grounds and not by way of a political issue at all.</P>

Senator Murphy should get it out of his mind that we are approaching this matter of Section 8 in a political way.  We are not.

The Authority, of course, will approve of contracts but, as I have said, in relation to the carrying out of the ordinary programmes and contracts, the Director-General and his staff will deal directly with these matters.  I cannot see any better method of dealing with the problem here than the method provided in Section 8 of this Bill.</P>

      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington was not listening to me when I quoted from the Electricity Supply Act, 1927.  That certainly sets out in full detail how an impartial board should be constituted so as to make it completely independent and impartial, but I want to say that I have always understood it to be a cardinal principle in the political government of this country that no individual or private corporation should be able to make a private profit or gain out of public funds, out of the public purse, and that principle was given full effect to in the 1927 Electricity Supply Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="321" /> Senator Louis Walsh was obviously well acquainted with the Electricity Supply Act but he was not listening to me when I read out the relevant section.  He said that the members of the Electricity Supply Board who had shares in electrical undertakings had to sell them, that it applied only to electrical undertakings and, further, that it no longer applied.  He either did not listen to what I read or he did not understand it.  I read out the full section so that people would understand what was involved and subsection (4) clearly provides&mdash;and it operates to this day&mdash;that any person who has any interest in any company or concern &ldquo;engaged in the generation, distribution, or supply of electricity or the manufacture of or wholesale or retail dealing in electrical apparatus&rdquo; may not be a member of the E.S.B.</P>
    <P>So if you are manufacturing electric fires at the present time, you cannot be a member of the Electricity Supply Board.  This is not ridiculous because the public funds which are entrusted to the E.S.B. will not be permitted to enable the E.S.B. to use the particular type of electric fire in its showrooms that I, as a member of the E.S.B., am manufacturing.  That is the cardinal principle that I have always understood to apply, that in relation to public funds and the distribution of public funds, no private individual or citizen shall make a profit out of them and it is incorporated in the Constitution of Eire, passed in 1937.</P>

It is provided in the Constitution, which was enacted by the people for their better protection and for the better ordering of society through the civil Government, that we establish a functionary under the Constitution known as the Comptroller and Auditor General.  That was for the purpose of providing that neither the Government nor its servants shall use public funds except in the manner laid down by Oireachtas Éireann and that is the principle we are seeking to incorporate in this amendment, however clumsy it may be.  That is the principle and it is not a new one.  It was established in the Act of 1927. Senator Ryan, of course, being a lawyer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;appreciates the niceties of draftsmanship.  I have already tendered my apologies for having fallen for the British Act but it is significant to know that it is included in the British Act.  Senator <Col N="323" /> Ryan then comes along and says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Well, sure all the responsibility is placed upon the Government and the Government would have to act as spies, going around with eyeglasses to see did somebody become a director of a particular firm, was somebody connected with an advertising agency,&rdquo; and so on.  I do not know whether he has not sufficient imagination, or a sufficient comprehension of the English language&mdash;and I stress the word &ldquo;English&rdquo;&mdash;to see that by what is provided in the amendment, the Government will not have the slightest difficulty in the world.</P>
      <P>The Government will not have to appoint any civil servants to make any inquiries.  The Government will not have to go around spying.  They will not, at the parties they attend, have to ask: &ldquo;Do you know Mr. X in television?  Did you hear did he recently become a member of any company engaged in the manufacture of electrical or telegraphic apparatus?&rdquo; Under the amendment, they will not have to do any such thing.  It is provided in the amendment that a member of the Authority, or a person before being appointed a member of the Authority, shall furnish to the Minister any information which the Minister considers is necessary to enable the Government to discharge their functions under this section, and all the Government would have to do under this section is write a letter.  I have to get down to the boring details since people did not understand what was contained in the amendment.  They would have to write a letter asking:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Have you any interest in the different things specified, advertising agencies, sale of electric and telegraphic apparatus and the like?&rdquo;  The member says &ldquo;no&rdquo; and there is an end of it.  He is not disqualified.  He says: &ldquo;I have not a directorship but I have £50 worth of shares in such and such a firm.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Stanford referred to the fact that we might be losing experts if we operated this section and that the Government could not appoint people who are associated with different types of businesses.  I must <Col N="324" /> confess my understanding of the position of people who are to be on the Authority is that they are not to be experts.  We are not to have a representative of trade unions just because he is an expert on trade union relations, but we shall appoint him because he has a contribution to bring to policy making and the administration of the Authority.  If we appoint a man who is, say, a national teacher we shall appoint him not because he understands and applies pedagogics but because he will make a good member of the Authority, will be able to take a broad view, able to understand such matters in relation to culture and advertising, and able to make good decisions.</P>
    <P>I have always understood the principle of democracy as practised in Britain&mdash;and followed here&mdash;is that if they want to get a good administrator, the last person they appoint is an expert.  The British never appoint a man who was ever on board a ship as First Lord of the Admiralty.  They never appoint a soldier as Minister for Defence, for the simple reason that people who are experts in a particular limited field are not, in general, able to take the broad view which is demanded of them in relation to national problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about administration.  I shall come to the lawyer drafting the amendment in a minute and I shall satisfy Senator Sheehy Skeffington entirely on that point.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, here this evening, is not an expert on television, but that does not mean he is not well qualified to make up his mind as to the kind of Authority he thinks we should have, and the kind of provision that should be made as to its numbers and so on. The Minister professed no knowledge whatever of the technicalities and intricacies of television, nor does he want to know these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Health is not a doctor and when he is determining that the children of such and such an <Col N="325" /> age should be injected against poliomyelitis, what he does is get in the experts who will advise the different courses that may be adopted and, on the basis of that information, and having regard to wider considerations, the Minister decides.</P>
    <P>We did not exclude experts by virtue of this provision because in any event the Television Authority will have to appoint experts, experts in different fields, including lawyers to draft regulations.  The introduction of this amendment does not in any way mean that we are losing people who have a contribution to make and, furthermore, there is provision in the Bill for establishing advisory committees who can advise, and if the experts are as altruistic and as good in relation to television as we have heard they are, they can sit on these committees and give their views.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the amendment is not designed to exclude people who have, say, a £50 share in Solus Teoranta. The amendment is merely excluding people who, the Government think, have such an interest as would prejudicially affect them.  The Government are able to, and do every day take all classes of decisions and the Government must face up, in a case of this kind, as the Minister has said, to deciding who is qualified to be appointed a member of the Authority.  Among other things they may consider, as the Minister has indicated, what interests people have in different types of concerns or firms. The Government can say: &ldquo;Such and such a person is a first-rate man in Irish cultural matters and all that appertains to the national way of life,&rdquo; but he is a clerk down in an advertising agency.  The Government can also say: &ldquo;This man is a junior clerk.  He is a first rate man in this line and we think he would make an excellent administrator.&rdquo;  The Minister could say: &ldquo;He has an interest which would not prejudicially affect his functions in the authority.&rdquo;  That is provided for in the amendment.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is intent upon benefiting by the consideration and thought that have been and are being given to the Bill in this House, if he <Col N="326" /> is not prepared to accept this amendment because of the way in which it is drafted, he might at least indicate that he will put down an amendment something along these lines on the Report Stage.  I am perfectly satisfied that we need not lose experience or experts but we would uphold the cardinal principles about which I spoke earlier and furthermore we would remove all these inhibitions and prejudices, for and against, which would affect members of the Authority in their judgment in the discharge of their functions.</P>

      <P>I take it that the idea behind this amendment, as voiced by Senator O'Quigley and other speakers, is to see to it that there is no undue interest or undue advantage to be gained from such interest by a member of the Authority in respect of any contract or in respect of any interest which he may have in a firm connected with television.  I fail to see how this amendment is any improvement on the Government section in regard to that aspect of the matter.  Section 8 of the Bill very squarely places the onus on any such person who is a member of the Authority to make a disclosure of any interest he has whenever any matter comes on the agenda of a meeting in regard to any firm with which he might be connected.</P>

      <P>I refer to the aspect which is mentioned in the first part of the amendment.  It is completely ineffectual.  As Senator Ryan has already asked, how is the Government to be in a position to satisfy itself that a person will have no such financial interest in any firm connected with television?  The Government cannot, prior to the appointment of a man, satisfy themselves whether that man is likely in future to have any interest in connection <Col N="327" /> with television or matters appertaining thereto.  The first half of the amendment is completely ineffectual.</P>

The onus is placed squarely on the person appointed, and in the event of that person not making that disclosure at a meeting of the Authority, the Government have very clear powers under Section 6 to deal with the situation. Sections 6 and 8 are linked up very simply and very explicitly.</P>

Last December we had a debate here on the P.A.Y.E. proposals and I happened to mention in the course of my contribution that I thought it was an admirable thing that the Government had adapted that scheme to suit our needs here.  Senator O'Quigley in his contribution after mine said at Column <Col N="328" /> 1318, Volume 51, of the Seanad debates of the 16th December, 1959&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is only one other matter to which I should like to refer, that is, the reference by Senator Lenihan to the fact that this Bill followed the pattern of what had been done in Great Britain.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because of the disparity in the standard of living and income and because of the different type of economy in Britain.  However, it is a most pernicious doctrine to say that we should look around other countries, see what they are doing and then copy what they have been doing.  We have sufficient skill, resource and brain-power to devise any schemes we require to meet our problems.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Quigley's skill, resources and brain-power were applied in this instance to taking out <i>holus bolus</i> a section of the British Television Act and copying it.  I quote again:</P>
      <P>We may not always have the finance to match the schemes we devise but it is a most pernicious doctrine to suggest that we should spend our time looking over at Great Britain to see what they are doing and that we should become a nation of imitators of Great Britain.</P>
      <P>In this instance, this cumbrous section of the British Television Act has 138 words.  I counted them after Senator Sheehy Skeffington had counted them. Senator O'Quigley's only contribution here is to take that in its entirety from the British Act and place it before us for our mature consideration and waste an hour of the time of the Seanad.</P>

Taking Sections 6 and 8 together, you have all the authority in the world that any Government want in regard to this matter.</P>
      <P>Another point made was that Section 8 should be tightened up, particularly in relation to the provision that such a person having such an interest in a contract or in any such matters shall take no part in any deliberation or decision of the Authority. I interpret that to mean that he should not be in the room at all, then.  In my view, if a director of this Authority stayed at a meeting, did not take any part in the deliberations but was present in the room at the meeting and was minuted in the minutes as being present, that, in itself, would be evidence that he took part in the deliberations and the decisions of the Authority at that meeting.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="330" /> As has been stated here repeatedly, it is not sufficient to do justice: you must show that justice has been done. Would the Minister answer two questions now and it might clarify the discussion considerably?  The first question is: What is the penalty for failure by a member of the Authority to disclose his interest?  The second question is: If a member of the Authority is, subsequent to his appointment to the Authority, appointed, say, a director of a professional entertainment group, a group that stands to gain quite a lot from contracts with the Television Authority, what action will the Minister take when such an appointment is brought to his notice or does he consider that it would be wrong for any member of the Authority to accept the appointment?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I answer Senator Quinlan, I want to refer to a question asked by Senator O'Quigley. He referred to my statement on his amendment.  He asked me if I was considering some amendment to Section 8 and, if I were, if I would have the matter looked into so that a different form could be taken from that which appears in the amendment put down by him.  I want to say straight out that I am not considering any amendment to Section 8 and that I did not wish to convey that impression, if I did, in my statement here so far.  If I mentioned or described persons likely to be debarred from becoming members of the Authority, if this amendment were accepted, as &ldquo;experts&rdquo;, I wish to say now that I did not intend to use that word &ldquo;experts&rdquo;.  We intend to follow in our appointments to the Authority the procedure laid down when I said we would consider people with wide administrative qualifications or cultural qualifications or that we would take them from people who represented wide national interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the first question put to me by Senator Quinlan is concerned, I should regard it as a grave breach of trust if a member of the Authority, having the Act in front of him and having read that Section 8, had an interest in any company or concern with which the Authority <Col N="331" /> was proposing to make a contract, or if he had any interest in any contract which the Authority proposed to make and did not disclose that fact to his colleagues on the Authority.  I should regard that as a grave breach of trust.  I do not see how a person failing to make such a disclosure could be retained as a member of the Authority.</P>

      <P>The Government would have to look at that and see how far his business as a director of an entertainment company or a director of any company of such a nature would interfere with the performance of his duties and functions as a member of the Authority.  Before any person is appointed as a member of this Authority or any other such Authority, the Government give due consideration to these matters.

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>In general, I take it the view of the Government and the Minister would be that it would not be desirable that members of the Authority should become directors of such companies after appointment. If it is a general view, it would seem as well to cover it by legislation and make it hold for all such appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is, of course, that you would have to consider each case on its merits.  There is no doubt about that.  It would depend upon the volume of business the company would contract to do with the Authority.  It boils down to the question of determining the interest the individual would have in the contract, the value of the contract and the value of what he could get out of the contract.  If you were to go down to a very small business or a person contracting for a small programme and a member of the Authority had some small interest in it, you would be limiting yourself to programme content in a matter of that kind.</P>
      <P>Each case would have to be decided on its merits but if a member of the Authority failed to disclose to the Authority that he had an interest in the contract, a company or a concern with which the Authority was proposing to make a contract, one would expect that such person would immediately make that known to the other members of the Authority when he had read the Act.  It would be regarded as a flagrant breach of trust for a person not to make that disclosure, in my view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>In setting up what is to be an independent Authority, we are giving great powers to it and <Col N="333" /> asking it to do a lot on its own.

Would it not be well automatically to disqualify a member of the Authority immediately he accepted a directorship in any one of a stated number of types of enterprise?</P>

Perhaps, he may bring back the section as it is.  As laymen, I think we have benefited to a great extent from the battle between the lawyers.  In making up our own minds, we have grave misgivings about the section and we have raised what we consider to be some rather important points.  While I, for one, would not be in complete agreement with Senator O'Quigley's amendment, if it were redrafted or if I saw it put into English, as it were, I should feel much easier if the Minister would agree to leave the section stand over until Report Stage.  Then he may come back with the section as it is or he may come back with a modification of it.</P>

      <P>In relation to this subsection (7) and the fixing of the quorum, we are concerned only with the statutory minimum.  The Authority <Col N="336" /> itself, by its rules, may fix what it terms a sufficient quorum.  It can be made four or five if it so desires.  I think it would be better to leave it to the members themselves and not hamstring them by saying what it should be.  One could envisage a situation in which members might be away on business, on holiday or they might be ill for a short time.  The quorum might necessarily need to be low.  They will be able to arrive at a decision which will suit themselves.</P>

      <P>The Director-General will have very considerable powers and duties.  Is there any idea at all available as to what kind of qualifications he ought to have?  The Minister's consent will be necessary when he is being appointed.  Is there any idea of what kind of person should be appointed Director-General?  Considering the great variety of things which the Authority will have to do, it is difficult to see what kind of person should be the Director-General. Are there any particular parts of the work which it is assumed the Director-General should know, to begin with?</P>

      <P>It may be a difficult job to fill this key post of Director-General. I recognise the responsibility that will rest upon this person.  It is almost an impossibility to arrive at a conclusion in one's own mind as to what would constitute qualifications for a post such as this.  The direction of television is not like any other business that we know of.  You can go through the various classes of professional people and get certain standards of qualification which you can lay down for certain appointments, <Col N="337" /> but when it comes to the appointment of the Director-General of this Authority, you have no such thing as a standard to go by.  I think the matter should be left quite open.  We shall have to endeavour to the best of our ability to get the very best person possible.  Of course, such a person will need to have experience.</P>

Of course, Reith organised sound broadcasting.  We have not got the kind of organisation that produces these kind of men, but with luck&mdash;and certainly with a bit of good sense&mdash;we should have citizens capable of sizing themselves up to fit this Bill.  The Minister should not insist that he should have television experience.  I think he should be a whole human being.

      <P>The Government are to be congratulated for making in this section a positive act of faith in the new Authority by allowing it to appoint the first and all subsequent Directors-General.  Admittedly, <Col N="338" /> the Government have a certain sanction in Section 31, subsection (4), where the consent has to be obtained. Still, I think it is a very wise move to leave it to this body, which has been picked from a wide field, and that their first public duty is to explore and make their recommendation &mdash;which, I think, would be virtually certain to be accepted by the Minister&mdash;for the first Director-General.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Since he acts for the Board, I think it is proper that I should raise this question.  I really would like to address it, through the Chair, to Senator Barry, since he envisages a position in which the Director will be a person armed with such powers and with such capacity as to make the Board merely a rubber stamp for the activities of the Authority.  In fact, the Director would be the only person who matters.  What I should like to see are harmony and understanding and&mdash;I know it is difficult&mdash;that the limits of the powers and functions would be pretty well defined so that the Board and the Chairman would be able to render useful service and that the Director would implement the policy of the Authority.</P>
      <P>I should be alarmed, however, if the situation arose, as envisaged by Senator Barry, that the Director would be Director of the Board, that he would be the only stable influence in the whole menagerie.  I hope I am not wronging the Senator in putting it that way, but that is the conclusion I would come to.  I hope and trust that will not happen.  I should like to hear from the Minister what he thinks the functions of the Director and the Board will be and if the Director will be the all-powerful influence.</P>

      <P>I am entitled to comment upon the section.  It seems to me the Director-General will be the executive officer of the Authority.  His business, therefore, will be to execute the policy laid down by the Authority. The Authority may decide to lay down broad lines of policy or it may enter into the minutiae of policy. It may take a greater interest in the day-to-day administration than might be desired by the Director-General.  As I understand the position, the Authority will function through its chief executive officer.  As provided in Section 14, all these officers will be duly authorised.  I cannot see what further clarification the Senator needs. It is one of the few sections in the Bill that is not vague.  I cannot understand what Senator O'Reilly is on at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my first intervention at this stage.  When introducing the Bill the Minister said he wished to give as much freedom and autonomy as possible to the Authority. The fault I had to find with the Bill was that there was far too much Minister and far too little Authority through the Bill and, from this point onward, that is very apparent.  I am glad now to find the Authority rather than the Minister appointing the Director-General.  That is a good thing. If the Authority is to work with a certain amount of freedom the man at the top should have the confidence of the people with whom he works.  That <Col N="340" /> is the usual pattern in all forms of life from business to sport.  I am glad it is the Authority who will appoint the Director-General.</P>
      <P>On the matter of his qualifications, it is wrong to ask the Minister now too much about the kind of man we shall have.  I agree with Senator Barry in this matter.  I make no apology for our copying Britain where they do the right thing.  When they do the right thing we can copy them without any danger of our faces becoming red subsequently. I do not think a single expert has been put in charge of I.T.V. or the BBC. I.T.V. is under control of Sir Ivone Kirkpatrick who was prior to his appointment Secretary of the Foreign Office.  Those are his qualifications. We have already heard the qualifications in the case of the BBC. I think it is very well run and we cannot go far wrong if we copy the right things they do.  I shall have more to say on the other sections.  I should like to see what is set out in this section set out in other sections as well, namely, that the Authority will be brought as much as possible into the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were asked to stipulate the qualifications I would simply say that the Authority should get the best possible person with all the qualifications essential in a Director-General.  The Director-General will be appointed by the Authority, as the section lays down, with the qualifications in the succeeding section. He will be the chief executive officer and responsible for staff and for the administration of the activities of the Authority.  He will be responsible for the introduction of the policy of the Authority, as Senator O'Quigley has pointed out.  Those are his main functions.  He will be the executive officer the same as the executive officer in any other body or institution in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of what Senator McGuire has said and some other speakers have implied, it seems that being an expert would be a disqualification.  I want to emphasise that that approach is completely wrong.  The expert is the ideal appointment.  The man who knows <Col N="341" /> a little about a great many things and nothing about something is a menace. We have too many of such men in our public positions.  We would do better if we gave the experts more of a say in all our affairs.  It would be a step forward if we put our experts into business and other walks of life while they are still young enough to broaden out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with Senator Quinlan.  I did not mean to give the impression that I excluded experts.  The danger the Minister seems to imply, perhaps unwittingly, is that the expert is the person who is in his mind.  If we confine ourselves to experts on television in this country we know immediately the people who spring to mind.  With a wider field there is a much greater scope in choice.  I would not exclude the expert if he had the other broad qualifications.</P>

      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Seanad to the fact that we are appointing this Authority and the Director-General for the purpose of providing a national television and sound broadcasting service.  Running through the debate I sense an emphasis on television. There does not seem to be very much concern with the fact that the Authority and the Director-General will be responsible for the continuation of the sound broadcasting service.  An amount of concern was expressed when the provisions of this Bill were first announced because of the suggested amalgamation of the two under the one Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the trend of the discussion here, in which the emphasis has been on television, is not symptomatic of what the Seanad hopes the Authority will do in relation to its dual function of inaugurating and operating a television service and, at the same time, maintaining and operating a sound broadcasting service.  The Director-General, irrespective of any qualifications he may have, will have that very serious and heavy responsibility of being the operation agent for the Authority in connection with this wonderful new medium and at the <Col N="342" /> same time, of continuing that which has been established and is operating successfully, and of improving it and continuing it to the satisfaction of the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the most important sections in this Bill because, as we know, the power of the Executive is very much greater to-day than it ever was, and no matter how detailed the policy laid down by the board may be, no matter how competent the board, a great deal will depend on the person who will be Director-General of sound and television broadcasting.  While it may not be desirable to make the Minister responsible for the appointment, he will be indirectly responsible because he will have the appointment of the Authority that will appoint the Director-General. I believe a man of the widest possible culture and knowledge ought to be appointed to this post, a person of whom everybody in this island will feel proud.  As I said on the Second Reading, a great deal of prestige is involved in a television service and unless we get the best man and the man recognised to be such, we shall be letting down this new service on which we are about to embark.</P>
      <P>The Authority will be aware of that point but it is no harm to express it in this House as the measure has been introduced here and first discussed here.  I should hate to think that a person would be appointed because he had some technical knowledge of the operation of a television service. There will be plenty of technicians employed who will deal with technical matters.  The whole tone and stamp of the service to a great extent, and the interpretation of the policy of the board will be entrusted to the Director-General and, please God, we shall get a man of whom we can all be proud.</P>

We want the best Director-General available because we all want Irish television to be the very best possible and to be above all suspicion.  We admit that the supply of eligible people is very small <Col N="343" /> but we sincerely hope that the board will succeed in getting a first-rate man. I sincerely hope that when a good Director-General is appointed, he will have the same freedom of action as the manager or director-general of other State bodies such as Bord na Móna, the Irish Sugar Company, or the E.S.B.  I should like to ask the Minister if that will be the case because I believe that if so, Irish television can be a success.</P>

It is very hard to evaluate his worth until then.  I am sure that the Authority which will be primarily responsible for his selection will bear mind all the considerations dvanced here by Senators.  I hope they will be fortunate enough to get the best possible person as the first Director-General, because I realise, as, I am sure, members of the Authority and Senators realise, that it is an all-important and key appointment.  On the worth and work of the Director-General will depend to a large extent the successful operation of this service.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2) to delete paragraph (iii), lines 16 to 18, inclusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A certain number of offices are <Col N="344" /> excluded from being filled by public competition and my amendment seeks to remove No. (iii) from the list. Subsection 2, paragraph (iii) reads:</P>
    <P>an office for which, in the opinion of the Authority, specialised qualifications not commonly held are required,</P>
    <P>That almost matches the drafting difficulty we encountered before.  First of all, specialised qualifications are required.  What is meant by &ldquo;specialised qualifications&rdquo;?  Secondly &ldquo;not commonly held&rdquo;?  Who is to decide they are not commonly held?  This Authority we are discussing is a broad Authority and there is de-emphasis on specialisation in the constitution of the Authority.  Yet the Authority has to make the decision as to what are &ldquo;specialised qualifications&rdquo; and what qualifications are &ldquo;not commonly held&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I think it is a mistake not to let these posts go with the other posts by public competition, because if the qualifications are not commonly held, it is quite possible&mdash;more than possible &mdash;that the number of people holding such qualifications may be one or two, perhaps, at home&mdash;if we have that number&mdash;or several Irishmen who have emigrated to England, America or elsewhere and who actually have great experience in that line of work.  Far from closing down when you think of qualifications that are rare, you need to advertise far more widely, because I take it the specialised qualifications, or many of them, may relate to graduates and perhaps to those who have gone to Britain, America or to Europe and have gone into academic, industrial or research work and have been there for a number of years.  These people are as much entitled to be considered for these posts as the local specialist who remained at home and did not attain the heights these men have attained, or did not set out to broaden and equip himself as they have done.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly on this as senior representative of the National University and I do not think Senator Barniville or anybody else can query my view on this, that these are posts that should be far more widely advertised. <Col N="345" /> Consequently, speaking on behalf of the National University of Ireland, which I have the honour to represent here, I appeal to the Minister to throw these posts wide open.  Let us have the best men and take account of our graduates who have had the courage to go away and to train themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>If I enumerate the classes of people who will be excepted, Senators may be able to get a better understanding of subsection (2) (iii). The people I have in mind would be actors, musicians, news reporters, announcers, highly qualified or experienced television specialists, such as producers, directors, script-writers or senior specialist staff who would be recruited.  They are the classes of persons we have in mind in subsection (2) (iii).</P>
      <P>Let me say straight away that I am in favour of public competition as a general method of recruitment to public bodies and to this body for the persons that we have named here. However, I feel there are special reasons why these exceptions I have mentioned, or anything like them, should be provided for in a different way.  Experience in Radio Éireann has shown that in the specialist fields it is often necessary for the radio authority to act quickly and to take people individually in a scarce field when they are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not alone that but, in the news world, this Authority would have to follow the usual procedure adopted by newspaper people.  Newspaper people do not sit for public examinations for posts.  They are employed on a different basis.  The Authority would follow the usual practice in employing news editors, news reporters or people of that kind. Furthermore, in the other fields, the people who are available might be so scarce that you would not have a competition even if a competition were advertised and we would have to leave the Authority free to deal with the classes of persons I have named and other specialist people.  In so far as university graduates with specialist qualifications in the engineering or electronics fields are concerned, I am sure the Authority would be very glad <Col N="346" /> to hear from persons abroad who have these qualifications so that they could consider them for employment if they were needed.  Many such persons have already written, I am glad to say, to the Minister, to the Minister's office and to the Advisory Committee.  Letters have come to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs from several people abroad offering such services and I have indicated that they are available for employment by the Authority.  I think Senators will have a different view of it now.</P>

      <P>I cannot see any reason why you cannot have competition thrown open to the public for people such as actors, musicians, news <Col N="347" /> announcers, and so on because that depends upon experience and qualifications. People ought to be entitled to know what posts are available in the new broadcasting Authority and to be able to compete for them but, as this section provides, the Authority will nominate its staff, its actors, its musicians and anouncers, if I understand the Minister correctly.</P>
      <P>The Minister must be aware that while Radio Éireann sound broadcasting was in operation there were constantly appearing in the Press advertisements inviting applications for posts of radio announcer and, as far as I understand, actors have not been appointed to the Radio Éireann staff merely by the Director of Broadcasting saying: &ldquo;I want So-and-So over in the Gate Theatre.  I will invite him up.&rdquo;  They have all been appointed, if my understanding of the position is correct, through some form of interview. The fact is&mdash;and this is the change that is being made from practice in this Bill&mdash;that this is not to be open to public competition; this is to be nomination by the Authority.  It is an outrageous thing, to my mind, that a good actor, say, in Cork, who may never come to the notice of the broadcasting Authority, will never have an opportunity of knowing that there is a vacancy, and will never be selected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see why it is not possible &mdash;certainly it would be most desirable&mdash; to have some form of competition for announcers because the standard of announcing on Radio Éireann has been deplorable.  I have had to write in to the Director of Broadcasting upon one particular matter.  I would not be able to pontificate upon some pronunciations, but I do think that everybody in this country ought to be able to pronounce the name of the State in which he lives, that is, Ireland, as <Col N="348" /> Senator Ó Maoláin reminded us this evening.</P>

      <P>But I strongly object, and did object to the Director of Broadcasting, to the broadcasting on our national radio station of &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; in the guise of &ldquo;Árland&rdquo;. That is the kind of standard we have. I do not know what form of selection enabled that kind of announcer to get on Radio Éireann.  For the purpose of the record, the word may be spelled as &ldquo;Árland&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Ár&rdquo; is the Irish for &ldquo;slaughter&rdquo;.  It seems to me to be most desirable to have public competition and that the Minister has advanced no reason whatever why there should not be public competition.</P>
      <P>I want to put this point to the Minister.  Actors, musicians and announcers are every year the subject of marking in public competition. The Minister must be aware of such institutions as the Feis Ceoil and the Father Mathew Feis.  There you have actor So-and-So awarded 90 marks. So-and-So is awarded other marks.  In relation to announcers, there are elocution competitions.  So-and-So can be awarded particular marks.  In relation to musicians there are competitions for violinists, pianists, and all the rest of them.  Examinations are conducted by the Royal Irish Academy of Music.  In this Bill we are saying that it is not possible to measure the competency of actors, musicians and announcers by public competition.  I think the Minister must have misconceived the section.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10 p.m. until 11 a.m. on Thursday, 4th February, 1960.</P>
