      <P>A few days ago, members of the House learned with deep regret of the death of Senator Frank Purcell.  I bhFlaitheas Dé go raibh a anam.  Senator Purcell was elected from the Nominating Bodies Sub-Panel of the Labour Panel and was a member of this House for the past six years.  He was of a quiet, unassuming and kindly disposition and his loss will be keenly felt by all those with whom he came in contact.  From the early years of his manhood, the late Senator took an active interest in the national and trade union movements. A man of strong convictions and principles, he took part in the Rising of 1916 and later in the War of Independence, during which period he suffered a term of imprisonment.</P>
      <P>His abiding interest, however, lay in the development of the trade union movement with which he has been prominently identified for a goodly number of years.  As a result of the initiative he displayed and the thoroughness of his work when dealing with union matters in his native county, he was appointed in 1922 to the staff of the head office of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union of which later he became General Secretary&mdash;a position he held from 1948 until his retirement through illness last year.  Prior to his appointment as General Secretary, he was Secretary of the Hotel and Restaurant Branch and for a time was Secretary of the National Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the passing of Senator Purcell, trade unionism has lost a worthy champion who always upheld the highest traditions of that great movement which has done so much for the <Col N="1048" /> betterment of the working classes of this country.</P>
    <P>To the widow and relatives of the late Senator, I shall convey on your behalf and on my own, our sympathy and appreciation.</P>

      <P>Subsection (5), paragraph (iv) of Section 2 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>a person appointed may resign by giving notice in writing signed by him to the secretary of the council, but the resignation shall not become effective until the meeting of the council held next after the receipt of the notice given to the secretary;</P>
      <P>Would it not be more appropriate to say &ldquo;at the beginning or at the end of the meeting&rdquo;?  In page 27, it is provided that &ldquo;the resignation shall not become effective until the commencement of the meeting...&rdquo;  I am referring to page 27, line 24.  It might be important to state, in the first instance, when the resignation actually takes place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has referred me to subparagraph (iv) (c) of subsection (5) and he read out:</P>
      <P>a person appointed may resign by giving notice in writing signed by him to the secretary of the council, but the resignation shall not become effective until the meeting of the council held next after the receipt of the notice given to the secretary;</P>
      <P>If I followed the Senator's point, he then referred me to Article 5 of the First Schedule, paragraph (1) and he read out:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  Where a member of the authority was appointed by the council of a county, he may resign <Col N="1051" /> his membership by giving notice in writing signed by him to the secretary of the council, but the resignation shall not become effective until the meeting of the council held next after the receipt of the notice given to the secretary.</P>
    <P>He seemed to think there was some slight discrepancy as between the two provisions which he read out.  I do not think there is.  They seem to me to be exactly the same, are they not?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if we are looking at the same text?  The correct one is marked &ldquo;As amended on Report.&rdquo;  There is not any inconsistency. I assume the meeting would first be called to order and the fact that a member had resigned would then be reported by the Secretary.  It would be neither at the beginning nor at the end.  The meeting would decide whether or not to accept the resignation. Therefore, it would have to be at the relevant point of the meeting where this item appears on the Agenda.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the Dublin County Council made one very reasonable request, namely, that the charges be on the basis of services rendered.  I can assure the Minister and everybody else that it is very hard on the Dublin County Council to have to hand over all their authority to the Dublin city authorities.  The Minister is generous in the number of nine members which he has given to the county council, and three for the Borough of Dún Laoghaire, but as the <Col N="1052" /> Corporation has 15 members, it is obvious that any say the county council has is very small.</P>
      <P>The Minister must further be aware that in the corporation the line of administration is not the same as that in the county council.  We are very disappointed that the Minister has not embodied in the Bill that payment be for services rendered.  I am sure Senator Carton knows that we have opposed, time out of time, the handing over of our authority to Dublin Corporation.  I appeal to the Minister to introduce an amendment on the Report Stage to meet this point.  We are asking nothing for nothing.  We are asking that charges be made on the basis of services rendered.</P>
      <P>It may be asked: &ldquo;Why should there be any question of an agreed amount when it is a question of justice?&rdquo;  The tragedy with us in county Dublin is that the corporation has us crucified.  A few years ago, it took away portion of county Dublin. A couple of years ago, it took away at least 21 per cent. of the rateable valuation of county Dublin.  Now it will take away our rights as a health authority.  I speak as one who has been associated with the health authorities in Dublin city and county for the past 30 years.  It is 30 years since I first became a member of the council and also of the board of assistance.  I look back with pride on the work done in certain directions by the board of assistance and the county council.</P>
      <P>Tied up to the corporation now, and heretofore tied up to the borough corporation of Dún Laoghaire, it is very hard for rural county Dublin to exist.  On that point, I would appeal to the Minister.  We are not looking for anything special.  All we are asking is that charges be made on services rendered and we should like to see that embodied in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VictorCarton" hpid="Mr. Carton Mr. Carton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Tunney that charges for services rendered would be good for the county but I disagree with him that we shall be a poor relation in association with the city.  I am satisfied the Bill is good in so far as the greatest number of members will, I hope, prevent overlapping. I think that is the purpose <Col N="1053" /> the Minister has in mind.  It will prevent a tremendous amount of overlapping.</P>
      <P>A point which Senator Tunney has laboured for years is that the city of Dublin has acquired our rateable property.  They will now monopolise the health side of it.  County people will have to travel long distances to acquire the benefits of the Health Act. It would be advantageous to county Dublin, therefore, if the Minister in his wisdom and final decision considered Senator Tunney's suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not accede to Senator Tunney's request unless I were to throw over one of the vital features of this Bill, namely, that, so far as possible, the allocation of expenses will be settled by agreement. Senator Tunney would like to have the allocation based upon services rendered. There are other authorities to be dealt with in the Bill who would prefer to have it on a valuation basis. A great deal of time has been wasted in trying to get some statutory formula which would satisfy everybody.  In order to get over that crux, I thought of getting the various statutory bodies who will be represented on the representative unified authorities around a table with the gentle coercion that if they did not come to an agreement, some person would make a determination for them.  That is what, I think, is the measure of hope which is embodied in this Bill.  Let me be quite clear.  I am not imposing any principle of allocation upon any one of the four statutory authorities.  I am relying upon their common sense when they are brought to face the facts.  For that reason, I could not now, at this late stage, insert in the Bill the principle of laying down a statutory basis for agreement in relation to Dublin which I would find would not be accepted by Cork, Limerick or Waterford.  For that reason, I do not think that at this late hour I can possibly accept the suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I make no suggestion, as far as Cork, Waterford or Limerick are concerned.  There is agreement as far as the authorities in Dublin are <Col N="1054" /> concerned.  Dublin County Council, Dublin Corporation and the Borough Council of Dún Laoghaire are already agreed upon the suggestion I am asking the Minister to put in the Bill&mdash; payment for services rendered.  Why the Minister keeps that out of the Bill, I do not know.  I appreciate that there has been a lot of unnecessary talk in connection with the Bill.</P>
      <P>The point I make is very important in relation to the future estimates of county Dublin.  There is no guarantee that we shall always have a Minister who will try to administer everything in the same manner as this Minister who has had a long association with county Dublin.  It is futile to talk about payment on valuation in regard to the residents of Oldtown, Garristown and Ballyfermot.  I think it would be a crime.  The three authorities have agreed that payment for services rendered should be embodied in the Bill.</P>
      <P>In other directions, I may have great sympathy with the Minister in trying to get this Bill fixed up, but on this occasion I cannot understand what should deter him from having that embodied in the Bill as we have already agreed on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>As the authority which the Senator represents has agreed with the other authorities covered by this Bill, there is not any reason why I should legislate in order to copper-fasten what is an agreement, I hope, between honourable men.  It is not necessary to legislate once you have agreed.  I think that one of the advantages of the present system is that it is very flexible. If circumstances change, it will be open to any of the authorities associated with any of the unified health authorities to ask that the position be reviewed with a view to reaching a new agreement or to having a fresh arrangement made.  If I were to do as the Senator suggests, the authorities would lose the benefit of the flexible arrangement embodied in the Bill.  As we cannot foresee the future very far in these days, it is better to leave the arrangement in the Bill stand as it is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to oppose the Minister.  I appreciate the action of the Chair in allowing me to speak.  I ask the Minister very specially to look at the matter before the Bill is finally passed We may not always have the type of men who will be honourable and reasonable.  For the protection of the farmers and people living in rural county Dublin, I make a very special appeal to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Last week, the Minister answered a question in the Dáil in regard to medical cards.  If the Minister looks up that reply, he will find that there are nearly as many people in one dispensary district in the city of Dublin on medical cards as there are in the whole rural county Dublin area.  It is a grave injustice to the farming community, the labourer and the rural people of county Dublin to join them up with the city and bind them to an agreement.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that we have nine members but what good is that number against 15, plus three members from Dún Laoghaire.  It is handing over the health affairs of county Dublin completely to the corporation of Dublin.  I am pleased with everything else in the Bill but I appeal to the Minister to consider my suggestion before the Bill passes. Every Senator will appreciate that my request is a very honest and reasonable one.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Sections 12 to 31, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">FIRST SCHEDULE.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the First Schedule be the First Schedule to the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to make clearer the position in connection with the appointment of the members.  What is the position of the Dublin County Council in connection with the members of the Dún Laoghaire Borough Council?  The matter is made reasonably clear but it is not made fully clear.  It states that 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 areas elect one member <Col N="1056" /> and that the others can form into groups.  I wonder if any of the eight members of the Dún Laoghaire Borough Council can form into a group or will it be a majority vote as far as they are concerned.  As members of the Dublin County Council, they have a perfect right to attend the meeting; they have, as members of the council, a perfect right to arrange to be present.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that this is a very awkward position as far as the other members of the council are concerned. Eight men are elected county councillors, the same as for other areas, and they are to attend a meeting and they cannot form into other groups.  I appreciate that the Minister has made the position clear as far as the first four groups are concerned but I want to be very clear on the grouping after that, and on the voting.  Have those members from the Dún Laoghaire Borough the right to propose and to vote any two of the other five additional members?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is reasonably clear.  Article 2 of the First Schedule is the relevant one and prescribes in the case of County Dublin, excluding the borough of Dún Laoghaire, that one member of the authority shall be appointed from among the county councillors elected for that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, now, I think that it prescribes, first of all, there will be one from each area.  That means that group having made its choice is then precluded from participating in the selection of the others.  The balance of the members of the authority can then come together and among themselves they can form a second group. They can elect one member and that can be a free member, who need not necessarily be one elected as representing any one particular district, and so on until the number is exhausted.  The whole thing is to ensure that every district is represented on the authority. Having provided for that in the case of Dublin, and by ensuring that there would be at least one member after <Col N="1057" /> that, those who have not already exercised their choice are free to come together and free to decide what is going to happen to the others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree there are only four groups concerned, as far as Dublin County is concerned, with the election. After that can those members on the Dún Laoghaire Borough Council, who are elected for No. 5 area, form into any group?  If so, they, by virtue of having one-third of the total council, can have a very big say in who will be elected, if it were to be on a majority vote.  Many more members of the council are not quite clear on that point and are very anxious that it should be clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is reasonably clear.  Sub-Article 2 states what is going to happen.  Sub-Article 2, to which I did not refer originally, states &ldquo;in sub-paragraphs (b) to (e) of the foregoing paragraph &lsquo;councillors&rsquo; and &lsquo;councillor&rsquo; do not, in relation to the council of the county of Dublin, include any councillor elected for the county electoral area which is coterminous with the Borough of Dún Laoghaire&rdquo; so that Dún Laoghaire having exhausted its choice in relation to one person has no right to come in and vote in relation to other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>It means they can elect one.  I did not consider, nor do I consider, that they are entitled to elect one because they have elected three of their own.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a confusion here.  The Senator led me to overlook the fact that Dún Laoghaire has a separate representation on the Dublin county authority and therefore it is not included.  Its representatives have no right, having its three members, <Col N="1058" /> to vote to select as members of the county council other members of the unified authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is only right to say that over the period this Bill was being prepared and the Minister in contact with Dublin County Council, the Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation and Dublin Corporation, he exercised extraordinary patience waiting for us to decide how many we would have from Dún Laoghaire, from the county and Dublin Corporation. We succeeded this far and the Senator was mystifying me but I think we are both clear now.</P>

      <P>I think it would be very desirable and make for the better working of the health authorities if the Minister were not confined strictly to nominating members from the county councils and corporations.  If we provided for outside members, you would have people with fewer public duties which would make for the better working of the service.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with Senator O'Dwyer.  After all, you may nominate somebody to go on a board and it has yet to be proved whether he will be of any value.  On the other hand, if a person stands for election, he has a claim from the people because the people will not elect a representative unless they feel he has certain qualifications.</P>

We cannot forget that these bodies which are now to be set up will have the control of a very vast share of public funds and naturally the people who should have responsibility for the disbursement of those funds should be elected representatives.  Therefore we cannot have people not really representatives of the people who may be <Col N="1059" /> just merely a choice of the bodies sitting on the local committees.  We could not have them coming and determining what the expenditure is going to be.</P>

      <P>Of course it is useless speaking now because the Bill is about to pass but I must express my disappointment in regard to the point I raised earlier.  As far as the residents of county Dublin are concerned, and for that matter, those of the city of Dublin, this is a very important Bill. It deals with the health of the people and with a section of the people least able to help themselves.  I followed the Bill carefully through the Dáil but I am disappointed and I want to put it on record that the affairs of the people of county Dublin as far as health is concerned are now being placed in the hands of Dublin Corporation.</P>
      <P>There is a great difference in the respective methods of administration. I do not know how it is, but it does happen that there is some kind of waste associated with anything the Corporation has to do with.  Despite the fact that 21 per cent. of our assets were taken away into the city of Dublin&mdash;had that not taken place, I believe the rates in County Dublin would be only about 27/- in the £ now &mdash;the Corporation did not reduce the rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very seldom that I go outside the scope of a Bill and for that reason I think the Cathaoirleach will be lenient with me.  I should like to put on record that we have had <Col N="1060" /> a very raw deal from Dublin Corporation over the years.  There is something wrong there.  Again, is it to happen that the officials of Dublin Board of Assistance who have been dealing with the health side and have done the spade work in connection with this Health Act are to suffer? They have got it through very reasonably and while they may be conservative as far as medical cards are concerned, by and large, they made a very honest effort to get this Act operating.  I hope they are not to be left on one side and officials of Dublin Corporation put over them.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's action in connection with Cherry Orchard Fever Hospital.  It is what I would expect. Speaking as one who has been an active member, I appreciate his attitude and I think it would be a pity if anything should prevent voluntary workers continuing to give the good example they have shown.  They have been coming there as early as 8.30 in the morning and giving their time with good results.  I should like it put on record that the health authority, whoever they may be&mdash;and possibly I shall be a member myself&mdash;should not put their hands on Cherry Orchard.  It is being very well run and they should keep away from it altogether.  I make that suggestion to the Minister and I would not make it, were I not satisfied that any interference or change in the position and the methods of running the hospital would be bad for it. I hope that the new health authority, whatever else they do, will keep away from that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carton</NameTxt>
      <P>It looks as if this is a county council day out.  I should like to say that I hope the Minister and his officials who have given a lot of thought to this Bill will find that it fulfils their expectations.  I am at one with Senator Tunney in his plea on behalf of the county and I must be conscious also that the Minister has done a tremendous job.  We believe that this scheme will justify itself economically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Senator Tunney's remarks, one important factor is that we in the county could always get treatment for our patients in the various <Col N="1061" /> voluntary hospitals we had attached to our panel much more cheaply than we could get it in the hospitals indicated to us by Dublin Corporation.  The facts and figures were available which showed a difference of nearly 6/- a day in certain cases, and we had the situation being created in a discussion in the council where the health manager seemed to be nearly touting for patients for the Dublin hospitals, particularly the one at Blanchardstown. We had one councillor who has made a great study of health and has been associated with hospitals, who gave a picture that was somewhat frightening, but that was in the interim period.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Minister will be closer from now on to this complete operation than he was when there were 20 or 30 little committees running the health services of the city and county. Therefore, I have not the same fears as Senator Tunney about this Bill.  I feel that under the Bill the Minister will get full efficiency into the running of the hospital system and that it will prevent overlapping.  The council will have to suffer; there is no doubt about that.  It would be out of keeping with the whole business to ask the Minister to alter the position at this stage.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, as Senator Tunney has said and, as I believe, we shall get in the month and years ahead a situation in which the county will have suffered somewhat financially.  The figures can be obtained for the Minister, if he wishes to see them.  I believe the savings in the all-over picture will in the coming year reach many thousands of pounds and I think Senator Tunney will agree with that.  I believe this Bill will do a lot to level the cost and the Minister and his officials will be closer to the situation, and will be able to watch it.  I welcome the Bill, despite the fact that Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation representatives are coming in, because they are very intelligent people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is unspectacular legislation, and unspectacular legislation has always meant a great deal of hard work for the Minister involved. I want to pay tribute to the Minister <Col N="1062" /> for the manner in which he listened to those of us who made representations about the awkward corners in the proposals before us.  This is a valiant effort to make a complicated social service work.  There will be awkward corners in it regarding the transfer of executives and staffs and I only hope that commonsense and goodwill will enable these to take place with as little upset as possible.</P>
      <P>I still think that this service as a whole will be run efficiently only by the State.  I suspect that that will prove to be the only efficient solution to the problem of providing health services. That, however, will require a revolutionary change, to take the whole thing from the sphere of Local Government. In the meantime, I wish the Minister success in these proposals which may make my forecast wrong, though I do not think I am wrong.  None of us can be satisfied with what is happening in the development of health services.  It has become so vague now and it will continue to grow through this trial. After a time, I believe, we shall have to try changing the whole system of running the service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful for, and, need I say, very flattered by, what has been said by Senators in relation to this Bill, but I should like to disclaim any idea of taking all the credit for it.  It was initiated by my colleague, Dr. Ryan; it was certainly debated up and down the country by my immediate predecessor, Deputy T.F. O'Higgins; and, perhaps I am garnering the fruits of the seeds which they sowed in very difficult times.</P>
      <P>Suggestions have been made that I should keep in very close contact with these unified health authorities, but I should like to say that I do not think that is my function.  These responsibilities will be imposed on the authorities.  They will, of course, be responsible to the Minister, whomsoever he may be, for the manner in which they discharge their duties, but the responsibility for making these services work smoothly, efficiently and effectively will rest upon them. So far as I am concerned, there will be the minimum of interference.</P>
      <P>When this Bill was being discussed in Dáil Éireann, it seemed to me that the people in Cork county had a very poor opinion of the people in Cork city.  I had to come to the Seanad to find that apparently some people in Dublin county have not a very high opinion of people in Dublin city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The main thing from our point of view is that whether they are nominated to the unified authority by the Corporation of Dún Laoghaire, the Council of County Dublin, or the Corporation of Dublin city, they are all there to work together <Col N="1064" /> for the common good of the 700,000 people for whom they will ultimately be responsible.</P>
      <P>I think the method which I have chosen in this Bill in relation to the allocation of expenses is the best possible one.  If I were to say that the allocation in Dublin had to be based upon a certain principle, it might happen in a very short time that the people who ask me to do that would ask me to legislate to change that position. There are at least three possible ways of which I can conceive: allocate the expenditure on the basis of services; allocate it on the basis of valuation; or depart from all that and say that Dublin county will pay a certain fraction of the total costs and the remainder will pay a certain fraction which may take into consideration both valuation and services rendered.</P>
      <P>I gather that the members of the bodies nominated or appointed to the unified authority have agreed upon a certain basis.  I suggest that the best thing is to do the work on that basis and if county Dublin are dissatisfied with what is done in the city, they can always ask to have the position reviewed by agreement or determination.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government decided some time ago that a revision of the allowances of Deputies and Senators, as well as the salaries of Ministers and of the Parliamentary Office-holders was long overdue and should not be further deferred. The outcome of the Government's thinking on this subject is set out in the Bill now before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Allowances to members of this House were last reviewed in 1947. Senators are well aware that, while salaries and wages generally have been increased several times since, there has been no change in the allowances to members of the Oireachtas or in the salaries paid to Ministers and the <Col N="1065" /> holders of Parliamentary Offices.  I need not labour the case that can be made both on the grounds of the higher cost of living and the increase in the volume of work to be done for an upward revision of Senators' allowances. The Bill provides for an allowance of £750 a year for Senators which is 75 per cent. of the new allowance for Deputies.  This relationship was introduced in 1938 and it has been thought well to adhere to it.</P>
    <P>In preparing this Bill, the Government decided to depart from the older arrangement of tax-free allowances. Deputies and Senators, in common with all members of the public, will now have to establish what proportion of the allowance payable to them can be allowed exemption from tax as an expense attributable to their duties as members of the Oireachtas and will be liable for income tax on the balance.</P>
    <P>I am not, of course, able to say what that proportion will be, but if the sum allowable for expenses is assumed to be £300, then a single Senator with no other taxable income will pay £36 in income tax; a married man will pay nothing.  If he has £2,000 he will pay roughly £635 or £566 respectively.  The position is, therefore, that where the allowance is a Senator's sole income, he would gain under the arrangement proposed in the Bill.  According as taxable income increases, of course, the bill for income tax mounts and the gain becomes correspondingly smaller.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a salary of £2,000 for a Minister, in addition to which he will receive his Deputy's allowance of £1,000 the whole amount being subject to income tax.  He will have to establish what remission is appropriate in respect of expenses in common with Deputies and Senators. At the moment, a Minister has £2,125 of which £625&mdash;his Deputy's allowance &mdash;is exempt from tax.  If we assume, to take a figure, that he is allowed £450 for expenses, he will, if he has no other income, and is single, pay about £620 income tax on his £2,000 as Minister and £1,000 Deputy's allowance.  If he has £1,000 from other sources, his tax will be about £1,150 if single and £1,050 if married.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1066" /> There is, I think, no need to make the case for a review of Minister's salaries which have remained unchanged since 1947.  The present salary level is inadequate in view of the high responsibility of the post and the standard of living which a Minister is expected to maintain.  In comparison with comparable positions in industry, even the level of remuneration now proposed is very modest.  It goes some distance, at all events, towards correcting the present position under which a Minister has less than the Secretary of his Department.  The Bill increases a Minister's remuneration by about 40 per cent. but when income tax is taken into account, his net gain will be considerably less.</P>
    <P>Suggestions have been made from time to time that there should be a pension scheme for members of the Oireachtas.  It will be for the Houses themselves to decide whether they want any such scheme and, secondly, if they do want it, what form it should take.  I have provided in the Bill that the Minister for Finance will have statutory authority to make deductions from the allowances of members of the Oireachtas.  In the event of the emergence of the pensions scheme these deductions would be paid into a pension fund.  The provision will become effective, of course, only if the Houses decide on having a contributory pension scheme.  If they do not do so the section will be inoperative. If they do decide on a scheme, the statutory power will be available and it will not be necessary to introduce a fresh statute to meet the position.</P>
    <P>As Senators will see, I have made certain increases in the pensions payable to former Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries.  The payment of these pensions has already been accepted in principle by the Houses in legislation, the underlying idea of these pensions being to compensate for the loss arising from the interruption of private business or professional occupation. It seems reasonable that the compensation for this loss should be somewhat increased in view of the change in money values since these pensions were first determined.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1067" /> The Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act, 1938, enabled allowances to be paid to the Leaders of the two numerically largest Opposition Parties in Dáil Éireann, subject to certain conditions.  These allowances are intended to go towards the cost of providing secretarial staff to help those Parties in the discharge of their parliamentary duties.  Representations have been made to me that these allowances were inadequate.  This Bill gives me an opportunity to meet these representations, to which I was sympathetically disposed.  I am proposing to increase the amount available for the parliamentary expenses of Opposition Parties.  In allocating this money, however, I am departing from the existing pattern and, instead, the total sum provided will be apportioned between the Opposition Parties which qualify in the manner set out in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Since the Bill was published and during its passage through the Dáil, there has been little objection to the main proposals.  Such criticism as there has been has taken the line that the Government might have been more generous in their approach.  As I stressed in the Dáil, the Government have at all times been anxious to strike a balance in these matters between the members on the one hand and the general taxpayer on the other.  I think that, by and large, this objective appears to have been secured in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The White Paper circulated with the Bill explains in detail the various changes proposed and the ways in which they are linked up with the basic 1938 legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill comes to us from the Dáil and it is mainly a matter for the Dáil to decide.  It is entirely for the members of the Dáil to decide what their own remuneration should be. Ultimately, they have a power to decide what allowances or remuneration of any kind members of this House should get.  They are also, in the main, concerned with Ministers' salaries. Therefore, it seems to me that this is <Col N="1068" /> a Bill which this House must accept. But for Section 5, which makes provisions for deductions, if agreed, from the Parliamentary payments made to members of the Dáil and Seanad the Bill would be a Money Bill.  It is not a Money Bill because of that section.</P>
      <P>Apart from the fact that the matter is one which the Dáil must, in the ultimate, determine, the Bill introduces a completely new principle. Heretofore, the idea and the practice have been that members of the Dáil and Seanad were given money to provide for necessary expenses of membership and these payments were not subject to income tax.  This Bill makes a departure from that practice and introduces the principle of payment for services rendered and therefore subject to tax.  That raises a number of very important questions which I do not propose to solve but, which in the interest of political discussion in this country, people should keep in their minds.</P>
      <P>In the first place, it raises the question of what kind of service the public, interested parties and intelligent people should expect from members of the Oireachtas.  In the second place, it raises the question of what kind of person will give that service. In the third place, it raises the question of how much the public ought to pay for that service.  The duties of members of the Oireachtas and of members of every democratic Parliament we know anything about have altered radically in the past 50 years and indeed particularly in the past 30 years.</P>
      <P>There is a statue in College Green of Grattan with his hand up declaiming in Parliament.  A member of the Dáil making a speech is the common picture.  What the public wants is that members of the Dáil should not make speeches but should write letters, attend meetings, go to funerals and be available for all kinds of services very far removed indeed from speaking in the Dáil.  In fact, keeping in touch with their constituents either by personal visits or by correspondence on all kinds of matters, is of much more importance than paying any attention to legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1069" /> Therefore, the whole business has shifted, from the point of view of members of the Oireachtas, to an interest in administration on the part of members rather than an interest in legislation.  The situation arises because in our time&mdash;when I say &ldquo;in our time&rdquo;, I speak advisedly&mdash;in my own time, even since 1921, the powers of the State have increased enormously. The number of semi-State bodies has increased in this country.</P>
    <P>I was Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil when the first of them, the Electricity Supply Board, was formed.  A great many others have been formed since then and, as we have already decided, we shall this evening be putting the finishing touches to a new semi-State authority, a broadcasting Authority. The result is that the ordinary citizen has many more contacts with civil servants and with State and local officials so that the time of members of both Houses and particularly members of the Dáil is taken up with grants, pensions, quotas and benefits of all kinds.  The members of the public are very insistent that they should get that kind of service.</P>
    <P>A friend of mine, a former Minister of State, who is not an authority on the Land Commission told me he met in the capital of his constituency an old man who told him some story about land which he wanted.  After a bit, the old man said to him: &ldquo;Have you ne'er a bit of a pencil?&rdquo; He wanted the Deputy to listen to him and take down what he had to say about the Land Commission&mdash;and he would not write himself.</P>
    <P>There is the belief, which I hope is mistaken, that if you go to a Deputy or a Senator, he can get you what you want&mdash;that is believed quite commonly&mdash;or, at any rate, that he can get for you what you are entitled to more readily than you would otherwise get it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The result is that members of the Dáil and Seanad, particularly of the Dáil, have had to become Jacks of all trades.  I am not speaking now of particular Parties <Col N="1070" /> or Deputies.  That is recognised by all Government Departments.  When you write to them, they send you a reply and a copy.  You send the copy to the constituent who will say: &ldquo;You did not succeed but you did your best.&rdquo;  Even members of Government Parties&mdash;I am speaking in general terms&mdash;are not beyond saying: &ldquo;I tried my best to get it for you but the Minister would not give it to me.&rdquo; Sometimes a Deputy is prepared even to put the blame on a Minister of his own Party in order to save himself from his constituent.</P>
      <P>Very often, correspondence is begun by a Deputy who knows from the outset that what he is seeking is impossible, that the conditions under which a person wants to get something do not provide for his case. However, the Deputy has to write and to get a letter from Dublin to the effect that what he is asking for cannot be done.  Some enterprising citizens&mdash;I heard an example of it this very morning&mdash;write to members of all Parties and to Independents, who are members of no Party.  When a new Government comes into office, as happened in 1948, after a long period of office by another Party, there was an avalanche of letters from people who, having failed for years to get something from one Party, thought they would have a go with the new fellows.  Members, therefore, have become not legislators but administrators.</P>
      <P>I suspect there must be some members of the Dáil and perhaps some members of this House who do not read anything sent to them but their correspondence&mdash;who never read a Bill, good, bad or indifferent.  It is interesting to wonder in relation to the people who write, who cause all this work to be done, whether the ordinary citizen who has rights to get something could not get it anyhow, whether or not he wrote to a Deputy.  One hopes that he would.  If it is true that Patrick Murphy in Dublin city or down the country would not get all he is entitled to without going to a Deputy, there is something grievously wrong and we should investigate it and see that it is stopped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1071" /> One of the troubles about the whole thing is to find a remedy.  I do not think a remedy can be imposed by any Government.  I remember the trouble there was one time.  There was an official of Local Government&mdash;an appeals officer for old age pensions. It was suggested that he should be prevented from seeing members of the Dáil.  There was a great fuss about it. It should be possible by consultation to arrange for people to get what they are entitled to and not need to apply to Deputies.</P>
    <P>One of the troubles about this correspondence is that everybody writes his letter from his own point of view and hardly ever supplies all the facts. I remember being approached in regard to about £700.  When I followed the usual procedure and rang up the Minister's Private Secretary, he put me on to somebody who told me: &ldquo;I know all about that, Senator.&rdquo;  The particular person&mdash;a builder&mdash;had already been paid £72,000 which had not been mentioned.  The £700 was a matter in dispute between his architect and the architect of some Department. I forget which Department but it does not matter.  His trouble was the smaller amount.  I wonder whether any remedy could be found for that.  It exists not only here but elsewhere.  This being a small country and Deputies, Senators and Ministers being extremely approachable, it is carried on to a degree here greater than in most other countries.  That is the kind of service people expect.</P>
    <P>It is sometimes said that members of the Dáil or Seanad do not attend to their duties.  In that connection, you have to ask yourself what is the meaning of the word &ldquo;duties?&rdquo;  Is the Deputy who is in the Library writing letters industriously attending to his duties if the Dáil is sitting at the same time?  Is there a remedy for that?  I do not know whether there is or not. Perhaps, by consultation, some remedy could be found.</P>
    <P>The second question that arises is what kind of person do you want? This measure does, in fact, favour the full-time politician, sometimes called <Col N="1072" /> the professional politician, as against the person who is already gainfully employed in some career, business or profession of his own.  I think that probably what we want is some of both.  It is the practice in certain quarters to decry professional politicians, some of whom have given very good service, particularly of the kind I have mentioned, for a reward that seems to me all too small.  They made themselves into full-time officers and have done the kind of job which I would not do myself for £1,000 a week.  I would not make myself available morning, noon and night, Saturday and Sunday and on bank holidays as they do in their own houses to their constituents.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there can be no doubt that if the business of the country is to be done, we should certainly have in Parliament people who are capable of making a success of their own business and their own careers before they proceed to do the nation's business as well.  Since this Bill gives remuneration for services rendered and puts income tax on the amount given, it will certainly have the results for some people of reducing the net amount they get for being in public life because they have made a success of some other career.</P>
    <P>I do not know, for example, how much reward should be given on the new basis which the Minister is introducing for services rendered.  It is extremely difficult to fix it.  This must be added.  People who have no experience of politics or Parliamentary life and work, sometimes ask why you cannot check what people do, but you cannot. It is really impossible.  The only method of checking or of deciding is an election and it is not always the hardest workers in the sense of legislation or of speeches in the Dáil or Seanad who find it easiest to get the votes.</P>
    <P>Let me also say&mdash;and I think it is relevant to the Bill&mdash;that we have very little thoughtful or informed discussion here on the art of the practice of politics, Parliamentary democracy.  I do not mean the discussion of the policy of Fianna Fáil.  Fine Gael, or Labour but the whole political situation. <Col N="1073" /> It is an occupation for which money is necessary but money is not enough.  This kind of Bill, no matter what figure you fix for membership of the Dáil or Seanad, is not sufficient to attract people of the right type to do your Parliamentary work.  They must have some kind of esteem.  Some of them may be themselves guilty for the lack of esteem in which they are held, but I think they are in general worth the goodwill.</P>
    <P>It is the custom to decry our Parliamentary representation and say it is worse than it is in other places.  One of the first things that struck me a great number of years ago&mdash;in 1924, to be precise&mdash;when attending a meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, was that the delegates present from a great many other Parliaments, the Commonwealth Parliaments, the European and American Parliaments, were not on the average better than the average of our Parliament.  It seemed to me that our first-class people could hold their own with many of them.  I had at one time for particular purposes to read a good many Parliamentary debates of other countries. I certainly came to the conclusion that the level here was as good as that in other places.</P>
    <P>Ministers' salaries come into this Bill.  I think Ministers' salaries should be raised.  Again, I am not able to say to what point.  I accept what the Minister is doing.  One of the reasons why Ministers' salaries are low was the campaign about Ministers and about the idea of anybody having a salary which went on for a long time. That is responsible for a great deal of the misunderstanding and confusion about Ministers' salaries and indeed, the rate paid to Ministers.</P>
    <P>I always thought, too, that Ministers are extremely approachable in this country.  It has often been put to me that too much is expected of them. That, I think, is on the whole correct, but I should not like to forgo any of the approachability which has always characterised Ministers here.  It is a small country and a small Parliament. It works very smoothly&mdash;much more smoothly than the reports of our proceedings <Col N="1074" /> would indicate.  People outside have a notion, which, of course, is quite unjustifiable upon the facts, as we who are inside know, that people in Leinster House spend all their time shaking their fists at one another.  They are astonished, as I said on another motion, to find that is not so.</P>
    <P>It should be recognised, therefore, that this Bill introduces a new principle into the payment of Parliamentary allowances and that for some members of the Dáil and Seanad it will, in fact, result in a reduction in their net income. It is for the electors to say what they want.  I am afraid that the only remedy for the difficulties which are so frequently put before us is that the electorate should take more interest in the whole proceedings and see to it that they get the kind of representatives they really want.  If there is any flaw in our representatives and in what they are paid, it should be remembered that the representatives can be no better and are certainly no worse than the people who elect them.</P>
    <P>If we ourselves could, now that we have reached a certain maturity in our political operations, in some way endeavour to disseminate among the electors the notion that you need not go to a Deputy or a Senator to get what you want, and if we could get a better understanding of what is required in a politician in Leinster House, we would have done a good day's work and something to earn the added allowances provided in this Bill.  There are a few points which might be mentioned in Committee but as far as I can see, the Bill is one which is acceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I find that the Senatorial position&mdash;and I have come from the other House, too&mdash;has not relieved me of any of the tasks of a Deputy. Once you come through the gates of Leinster House, you have influence. The people are firmly convinced of that and therefore your door knocker is knocked and your letter box fills up and your telephone keeps ringing. It is one of the facts of political life and I think Senator Hayes should not look at that fact with starry eyed wonder.  It is something we can all understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1075" /> There is another matter to which he did not refer, that is, that a great number of the people involved, either here or in the other House, also take part in local government affairs.  Whatever our troubles are in Leinster House, I think the troubles associated with local government are far more onerous.  For the last three weeks, I have not arrived home any night before 11 o'clock because I was dealing with local government affairs.</P>
    <P>I find myself somewhat disarmed by the tax clause in this Bill.  It prevents me from criticising effectively because I shall scarcely benefit myself. In fact, I think I shall lose and I cannot very well criticise those who will benefit.  My auditor told me that it will cost me something like £40 a year.  The people will not believe that if they are told.  My attitude since this proposal was first mooted some months ago is that members of the Oireachtas should set a headline and they should try to content themselves with what they are receiving, despite the truth of the fact that their allowances have declined in terms of real money, because I believe, and a number of people in the country believe, that nobody at present should demand greater rewards in the immediate and critical years just ahead. We felt that&mdash;and the Party to which I belong took a position on it, which has since been changed because of incontrovertible facts&mdash;by taking that attitude and getting the people and other members of the Parliament with us, not only would we create a mind towards solvency but we would make a real contribution towards it as well.</P>
    <P>In justice, I must admit that many public representatives cannot easily carry on on their present allowances and because those who can will not really receive extra remuneration, I am less disposed to oppose the Bill than I was.  I do think that many people outside do not understand that the proposals in the Bill will ensure that very many public representatives will not benefit at all.  They will regard the whole thing cynically.  We know that.  Cynicism is the kind of <Col N="1076" /> commodity we could do without in this country to-day.  It is an over-used commodity.  To be brief, I think the taxpayer should clearly understand that the cost of this will not be the sum of all the increases to individuals because that will be reduced very considerably by the contributions of the recipients to the collector of taxes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spoken in this House and elsewhere previously about what I consider the inadequate allowances of Deputies and because of the adjustment being made in this Bill, I welcome it very much.  I have often wondered whether some Deputies have been driven out of public life and out of the Dáil because of the hard economic realities, the fact that they could not afford to sacrifice themselves and their families on the quite inadequate allowances they received as Deputies. I am certain, however, that people I know in the Labour movement have been unable to afford to offer themselves for election to Dáil Éireann because if they were successful, it would mean they would have to leave their employment and devote all their time to Dáil work.  They could not afford to do so on the allowance of £624 per annum.  It may be quite true that many of them might not have very much more, and perhaps a little less, in the employment in which they are actually engaged but it is a fact that Deputies' expenses, their standard of living and what is required of them, are far higher than those of the ordinary worker earning £12 a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public apparently do not realise that Deputies who come from outside Dublin to Dáil Éireann have to provide their own accommodation in Dublin out of their allowances.  They have to meet heavy postage expenses and they also have to meet fairly heavy hospitality expenses.  If you go into any company the Deputy is the person who is expected to pay because he is a Deputy.  I was about to say that probably they have expenses for secretarial assistance, but I think few of them could afford to provide secretarial assistance, even though, to my mind, it is a very necessary item, a very necessary service, which any <Col N="1077" /> Deputy requires, if he wants to take care of the spate of correspondence which he gets and, at the same time, deal with legislation.  It is quite true, as Senator Hayes said, that most Deputies are fully occupied not in making speeches, not in examining legislation, not in criticising legislation, not in putting down amendments, but in dealing with all the queries and all the correspondence which they get, sending letters to Departments, getting replies back and passing those replies on to their constituents.</P>
    <P>In this measure, it is proposed to increase a Deputy's allowance from £624 to £1,000 per annum.  On the face of it, that appears to be pretty big, but, as the Minister said, it is 13 years since the allowance was fixed at £624 and in that period the value of money has depreciated by nearly one-third. In other words, the cost of living in that time has gone up by nearly 50 per cent., speaking roughly. This adjustment is very belated, even though it is welcome.  We are increasing the allowance for a Deputy to £1,000 but I doubt, in view of what is being paid in good employment, whether good people who have capabilities and who could make good representatives can really afford to sacrifice their jobs and go into the Dáil, taking on the extra expenditure involved for £1,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>We are still up against this problem. Wages and salaries have increased considerably in those 13 years, and even though £1,000 does seem good, we still have the point I mentioned earlier, that a person might be in receipt of far less than £1,000 and could not afford to give up his job and put his family at a sacrifice for the allowance provided for him as a Deputy.  It is true, of course, that other people have not to make that sacrifice&mdash;people who have not a full-time job, who have other sources of income.  It is easy and convenient and helpful for them to be Deputies. Salaried workers and such people who are in full-time employment, if they stand for and are elected to the Dáil, have to leave their employment and have no other source of income except the allowance.  I still doubt whether £1,000 would be sufficient compensation <Col N="1078" />&mdash; I stress &ldquo;compensation&rdquo;, not &ldquo;pay.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This adjustment is the first in 13 years.  I hope that if we have to face another period of inflation, if money drops in value again, we shall not have to await the position that a Deputy's allowance will have to be cut in value by a third before anything is done to rectify the position.  It strikes me that there is a great opening for a trade union for public representatives.</P>
    <P>In this measure, the ratio between Deputies' allowances and Senators' allowances is being maintained at the ratio of four to three.  In looking at this critically, I wonder if, in fact, that ratio is right and proper.  A Deputy's job should be a full-time job.  He cannot afford to spend his time looking after other business, if he is to look after his constituents properly, properly represent them and properly look at legislation; whereas in fact, we know &mdash;whether we are prepared to admit it or not&mdash;a Senator's position is part-time. Nobody expects a Senator to devote eight or 12 hours a day to public duties.  It is, fortunately, not a full-time job.  We still have that ratio of four to three, and looking at the work and what is required of a Deputy as compared with a Senator, I do not think it is correct.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Seanad meets three days for every four that the Dáil meets.  That is probably not a very welcome observation in the Seanad, but it is a fact.  The Seanad does not require as much of us as the Dáil requires of Deputies.  It is quite true also that with these allowances now subject to income tax, the Deputies will in the ultimate benefit to a far greater extent by this adjustment than will Senators. I do not think that is wrong or undesirable.  I wonder, however, whether we might not have more use made of the Seanad, whether the work of the Dáil and Deputies could be eased somewhat by transferring more work to the Seanad.</P>
    <P>We have had one measure already which was initiated here.  I do not know whether the Government think the Seanad did a good job on it, or <Col N="1079" /> whether the Dáil thinks so, but I should like to see the Seanad given more work to do.  Now that we are asked to vote ourselves increased allowances, it might be no harm if we looked at our productivity to see if we could improve our efficiency, do more work, and ease the considerable strain which does lie on the Dáil and Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to congratulate Senator Hayes on the very interesting talk he gave us on this subject.  We must all admit that he has a great deal of experience of parliamentary life and his contribution, therefore, was very interesting.  There is one big change, as Senator Hayes points out, that up to this what Deputies and Senators got was regarded as an allowance but never expenses.  We are now introducing the principle of paying them for their time.  Some Deputies did not like the idea of being paid a salary for their time, and would have preferred to have an allowance rather than payments.</P>
      <P>I must say personally that I thought we should recognise that a great deal of time has to be given, and we have many people who cannot afford to give time, unless they get something for it.  There are many, as we know, both in the Dáil and the Seanad who, when elected, must give up whatever occupation they had.  Let us say they were doing office work, clerical work or were artisans.  They have to be compensated for their time.  It would be very unfair to exclude anybody from becoming a member of the Dáil or Seanad for a reason of that kind. Therefore, the principle in this Bill of recognising that men must be paid for their time is not objectionable.  It would be a nice thing if we could all say that we would all be prepared to give our time to this work, if we merely got our expenses.  Some cannot afford to do that, and the country cannot afford to do without these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point on which Senator Hayes spoke is very interesting, regarding all that people expect a Deputy or Senator to do for them.  I am afraid that very few people, when looking on the duties of a Deputy or <Col N="1080" /> Senator, look on them as legislators, or as legislators solely.  Some of the more intelligent people in the country try to select people who will be good legislators&mdash;in other words, people who will look after the country generally&mdash;and do not pay much regard to the fact that one Deputy may be more obliging than another in looking after the troubles his constituents may have.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt, as has been pointed out by Senator Hayes, that the work of a Deputy&mdash;and I am sure this applies also to Senators, at least in the rural areas&mdash;has greatly increased. The work to be done with Departments and other work of that nature has increased enormously over the past 30 or 40 years, not alone due to the creation of State bodies like the E.S.B. but also even in the Departments.</P>
    <P>Take, for instance, the Department of Agriculture.  When I became Minister for Agriculture 30 years ago, there were very few queries from the ordinary individual.  A man might inquire perhaps about a premium bull.  All sorts of things arise in the Department of Agriculture like schemes for reclamation and drainage, schemes for farm buildings, water supplies and many other things of that kind, or a man may want to make inquiries about his case being attended to, if he will be paid a grant which is due, and so on.  These things were unknown, and the necessity for such queries did not exist, 30 or 40 years ago.</P>
    <P>The same applies to a great extent to other Departments.  In the Department of Local Government, the housing programme has been very much extended over the years, and the numbers of queries are very much greater than they were 30 years ago. The same applies to the Department of Social Welfare.  I agree with Senator Hayes that a Deputy or a Senator can very seldom do anything for these people except make inquiries.  Sometimes, of course, a Deputy or a Senator may be in a position to console a person.  If a person says he is looking for a housing grant and you write back and <Col N="1081" /> say he will get it in a week or a fortnight, that is all right, but you do not, in fact, do anything to alter the position.  He would have got it in a fortnight anyway, but he says to himself when he gets your letter: &ldquo;If I had not written to the Deputy or the Senator, I would never have got it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are, however, certain cases where the intervention of a Deputy or a Senator may be useful.  It sometimes occurs that a mistake is made by an applicant.  If the Department says that the person is not entitled to what he seeks and the Deputy finds that a mistake has been made in the application and puts it right, that is all right.  I should like very much indeed if we could make these things right without the person having to go to a Deputy or a Senator.  I agree with Senator Hayes there.  We have, as the House is aware, over the years tried to make these things a bit easier for the people concerned.</P>
    <P>I remember one occasion many years ago &mdash; I think the position may have been worse then than it is now&mdash;when the Land Commission appointed a joint public relations officer, which was unknown at that time in a Government Department.  That was a good step because the man was able to coordinate inquiries.  He got accustomed to letters from people and he was able to deal with them better than an ordinary official.  He could write back and say: &ldquo;If you can answer the following questions, perhaps I shall be able to get the matter settled.&rdquo;  Again, I am afraid that no matter what we do, people will have recourse to Deputies or Senators.  I must say I often marvel at the <i>naiveté</i> of the people who write to me for a grant for something or other, or for some subsidy or other. They are evidently under the impression that what I do is to say to the Department: &ldquo;Give it to him, and no further inquiry is to be made.&rdquo;  It must be obvious to the person writing that letter that if an inquiry is made, he will not be entitled to it at all, but he probably says: &ldquo;I suppose I can have a try at it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is another point on which I am sure Senators have the same <Col N="1082" /> trouble as I have.  A person writes to me and says he is sitting for a competition for the Civil Service, or a local authority, and that he would like a bit of help.  No matter how often I write and say that these appointments are made by a commission and that I cannot interfere, they do not believe it. They write the next time and ask what I can do for them.  It is very hard to deal with matters of that kind.  I suppose every Minister has this experience, too.  When you take over a Department, you nearly always get about 60 or 80 letters complaining about the way the last man had treated them. You ask for a report and you nearly always find that your predecessor had got a similar letter about the Minister who preceded him.</P>
    <P>I remember when the Social Welfare Act, 1953, was being put through the Dáil&mdash;a fair amount of time was given to it in the Dáil and in the Seanad, too, perhaps&mdash;saying that it would never be necessary again, when that Act went through, for any Deputy or any Senator to interfere with regard to social benefits because everything would be decided entirely on the law and by the officials.  Under that system, umpires were appointed and if a person were turned down, say, for an old age pension, he could appeal and his appeal went before a referee or an umpire whose decision was final.  The Minister had no power whatever in that Department with regard to decisions in any of those cases.</P>
    <P>Since that time, the only powers the Minister actually has in the Department of Social Welfare are: he is the head of the Department in charge of the staff; he deals with Parliamentary Questions; he deals with legislation; but he has no administrative functions so far as the awards of benefits are concerned.  I do not know if that had the effect of lessening the work of Senators or Deputies.  I am afraid there is quite a lot of that kind of thing even yet and that when a person is refused a benefit, a Senator or a Deputy has to take a hand in it.</P>
    <P>It is true, as Senator Hayes says, that this Bill will give much greater benefit to the person who has no other income than to the person who <Col N="1083" /> has an income in his own right.  It was purposely designed in that way. On the other hand, I do not think it would be true to say that any considerable number of Deputies or Senators will get no benefit.  As a matter of fact, so far as I can work it out&mdash; I am assuming a certain level of expenses will be allowed&mdash;I think a Senator or a Deputy would have to have a very large income to deprive him of any benefit under this Bill, though I admit a Senator or Deputy with an income will not get very much out of it.</P>
    <P>I thoroughly agree with Senator Hayes also with regard to the level of efficiency and intelligence of our Deputies and Senators.  Over the years, I have attended a fair number of international conferences, and I have been struck by the same thing as that which Senator Hayes mentioned, that we have at least as good representatives as they have in other countries.  I think I could perhaps say we have better than they have in some places, but we have, at least, as good.  After all, we should be satisfied with that.</P>
    <P>I could not say whether Senator Barry or any other Senator will get any benefit whatever from this Bill. First of all, I should want to know what Senator Barry's means are&mdash;I do not want to know that; I am not looking for that information.  Secondly, which is very important, I would want to know what the Revenue Commissioners are likely to agree to by way of expenses.  My own inquiries about this matter unofficially&mdash;I did not want to go to the Revenue Commissioners about this matter until the Bill becomes law&mdash;would lead me to believe that the Revenue Commissioners will probably try to arrive at a sum, common to everybody, for expenses.  They do that in many other professions besides the profession of Deputy or Senator.  If they do that, they will say: &ldquo;If you like to accept that sum for expenses, we shall not trouble you to make any return by way of vouchers or anything else.  If you are not satisfied, make returns and vouchers, and if you are entitled <Col N="1084" /> to get more than that, you will get it.&rdquo; I think that is probably the way it will work out.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy spoke about expenses that might be allowed.  I think anything he mentioned would naturally be allowed.  Certainly a Deputy or Senator would have to be allowed his expenses while staying in Dublin.  If he comes for a meeting of the Dáil or Seanad or on any other occasion when it is necessary, because of his position as Deputy or Senator, he would have to be allowed his subsistence while he is detained in Dublin.  Apart from that, he would be allowed postage.  If the Senator has to employ secretarial assistance, he will get an allowance for that, too. Some Senators will not employ a secretary and therefore will not want to make that claim.</P>
    <P>Hospitality is something that gives the Revenue Commissioners a fair amount of trouble, no matter from whom the claim comes.  I do not know how they may decide a matter. If, say, Senator Barry brings up two men from Cork to a Department or on some business or other, and then brings them into the restaurant here, naturally he is expected to stand them lunch, I think that would be a fair claim in the way of hospitality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Barry; I suppose we all have the same experience that if we are in a group, we are expected at least to play our part.  I am certain a Deputy will be allowed his expenses for travelling around his constituency, and his subsistence, if he has to be out for his meals.  That would be quite a legitimate expense.  I am not sure how the Revenue Commissioners would look at Senators from that point of view.  I suppose there would have to be some agreement about that.  I agree with Senator Murphy, too, that the 13 years was too long a period. It is a great pity it was not attended to in the interim, and now again, because such a drastic change would not be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1085" /> I do not think it would be possible to come along every time there is an increase in wages all round and to say that Senators and Deputies must get something but I think we should not allow the time to go longer than five years.  It should be reviewed every five years, in relation to the change in the value of money.  In that way, the amount necessary to make things right would not be so high and would not look so high to people outside.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy thought the ratio 4 to 3 between the Dáil and Seanad was rather unfair to the Dáil.  In 1923, they were put on a par.  I am sure Senator Hayes will have a recollection of this.  Those who were sitting at that time cannot be blamed because they had very little experience of what the work of either the Seanad or the Dáil might be.  In some countries, the Upper House has almost as much work to do as the Lower House.  Nobody could be expected to know at that time whether or not it would be the same here.  The allowances fixed were very low so they got the same all round.</P>
    <P>Then, in 1938, when it was necessary to fix an allowance for the new Senators, it was fixed at three-fourths of what the members of the Dáil had at that time.  As I said in my opening speech, I thought it well to stick to that ratio.  I did not want to have to defend a departure from it.  I believe the best remedy is that suggested by Senator Murphy that, if the Seanad are not giving value for what they are getting, they should get more work.  It is a good idea but it gives rise to certain difficulties in practice.  The Government have considered that point and have handed the Seanad one Bill to deal with.  We are certainly in favour of that, in principle, and would be glad indeed to resort again to that method of trying to divide the work more evenly between the two Houses. It may be possible to do something again in that way in the future.</P>

It was already considered.  It has been the practice in England for some time.

      <P>They can indeed decide on a full contributory scheme if they like, but it would be a very expensive scheme.  Consider the average life of a Senator and the average life of a Deputy which is perhaps ten or 12 years, whereas the person who works all his life, with a contributory scheme, has 40 years in employment.  That will indicate how expensive a full contributory scheme would be.  Personally, I think it will come down to a scheme related to necessitous persons in the end, as the Senator has suggested.</P>

The other is the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, <Col N="1087" /> 1959, which I think should have been introduced in the Dáil but of the other nine, there are eight, with the exception of the Hire-Purchase (Amendment) Bill, 1957, which might easily have been brought in here.  It would lead to what Senator Murphy wants, more work for this House, and it would ultimately make matters easier for the Dáil.

      <P>Orders made by the Government under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957, must be confirmed by the Oireachtas in the calendar year following that in which they are made.  The purpose of this Bill is to confirm 28 Orders made under the Act during the year 1959.</P>
      <P>The duties imposed by nine of these Orders afford protection to new industries. Nine others protect the manufacture of additional lines which were undertaken by existing concerns.  A further seven Orders amended existing duties, where experience had shown that these duties were not adequate because of increasingly severe competition from imports.  Two further Orders were made because the existing duties were being evaded.</P>
      <P>The remaining Order is an exemption Order which removes from the duty of metal containers, articles used in connection with the brewing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An explanatory memorandum on the Bill has been circulated to Senators. I shall, of course, be willing to give any further information or answer <Col N="1088" /> any questions which Senators wish to ask about the Orders.</P>
    <P>The motion, in the name of Senator McGuire, calls on me to make a statement in connection with the imposition of duty on medicinal tablets. The following is the statement:</P>
    <P>The recent imposition of a duty on medicinal tablets is not to conflict with the general policy of the Government in regard to tariffs.  As indicated in Paragraph 99 of the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> it will continue to be the policy of the Government to grant protection for worth-while industries.  The industry to which the duty under discussion relates is a worth-while industry; the firm chiefly concerned has, for several years, been producing products which comply in every respect with the requirements laid down in the British Pharmacopoeia and the British Pharmaceutical Codex and they have undertaken that the prices of their products here will correspond with the prices of similar tablets in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The Irish industry was unable, because of the long established contacts of external manufacturers on the Irish market, to obtain a reasonable share of the pharmaceutical trade and the primary object of the duty is to assist the Irish industry in overcoming this disability.</P>
    <P>There was initially, considerable misunderstanding in various quarters about the effect of the duty on the prices of tablets.  In so far as tablets are made here, their prices correspond and I hope, will continue to correspond with British home prices.  In so far as requirements cannot be met by home manufactured tablets, licences are and will continue to be available for the importation of tablets.  There are no grounds, therefore, for the suggestions made that the effect of the duty will be to bring about a general increase in the price of medicinal tablets.</P>

      <P>May I suggest to the Seanad that when the Minister indicates the meaning of the amendments made by the Dáil we shall look upon that as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad.  The House might then consider these amendments only on the Report Stage and then go on to the Fifth Stage when the contents of the Bill may be debated.  Alternatively, the Seanad might care to combine the two discussions. It is a matter for the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Bill was passed by the Seanad, a number of amendments have been made by Dáil Éireann.  The number of amendments is four.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of Section 15, subsection (4) is a new subsection which has been inserted to enable me to give effect to an agreement reached through Civil Service Conciliation and Arbitration machinery with the staffs concerned <Col N="1091" /> regarding the superannuation of unestablished staff at present serving in Radio Éireann.  The discussions which led up to this agreement have been rather protracted and in view of the delay which has taken place, I feel that I should take the responsibility of prescribing the provisions of the scheme which will be applicable to these existing officers.  The provision for retrospective application arises out of the delay to which I have referred and will provide against hardship in certain cases.</P>
    <P>It will be remembered that I promised this House on the Report Stage that I proposed, in the light of the discussion, to consider amending Section 20 in certain respects.  As it stood, the former subsection (5) empowered the Authority specifically to grant preferential conditions and reduced charges to Irish advertisers, and, in addition, to vary such preferences and reductions to benefit such of those advertisers as used the Irish language in their advertisements.</P>
    <P>On reconsideration, I felt that there was a need to define what was meant by an Irish advertiser, and I came to the conclusion also that the preference for the use of the Irish language should be available to any advertiser. Subsections (5) and (6) are new subsections which provide accordingly. Subsection (7) is also a new subsection which is considered desirable for drafting purposes.</P>
    <P>As Section 22 stood, it could be held to imply that the Minister for Finance &mdash;not the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;would take primary responsibility for the grants under this section.  That was not intended and the wording of the Section has been amended to make it clear that I will take primary responsibility&mdash;in regard to the presentation of Estimates and otherwise&mdash;for these grants.</P>
    <P>In this House and again in the Dáil, subsection (3) of Section 31 which provided for my consent to any announcement by the Authority that they had received a direction from me under this section, was the subject of considerable discussion and criticism. I decided to take a calculated risk by <Col N="1092" /> omitting this subsection altogether, in the hope and belief that the Authority will use their commonsense and discretion in regard to announcing that they have received directions under this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>On amendments generally, the Minister was rather adamant when he was here before. Some of the amendments mentioned now, which were made in the Dáil, are the result of matters raised here. In fact, three amendments he has mentioned, including the first one on superannuation, particularly as it related to certain unestablished people in Radio Éireann, were raised here.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister in Section 15 has succeeded in coming to a conclusion with regard to the matter of advertisements.  I think it was Senator McGuire who raised the question of how to define an Irish advertiser and I myself was of the opinion that the preference for the use of the Irish language should be extended to all advertisers.  The Minister has done that and I think it is an improvement in the Bill.  It makes it more lucid, clearer and more effective.  As a matter of fact, I think it strengthens the preference for the Irish language which was in the previous section.</P>
      <P>In regard to Section 31, we had a very considerable discussion here and I presume the position is that the Minister retains his power to direct the Authority in writing to refrain from broadcasting, and also may direct the Authority to broadcast, certain things&mdash;the power either to prevent them from doing something or to compel them to do something.  In the Dáil, the Minister deleted the subsection that says that &ldquo;The Authority may, subject to the consent of the Minister, announce that a direction has been given under this section,&rdquo; so that the Authority may use its own discretion.  I think that is a great improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the whole, therefore, as far as this Report Stage is concerned, whereever the Minister has inserted an amendment, except, I think, in Section 22, the matter was brought to his <Col N="1093" /> attention here.  All we can say is that we are glad that in the other House he had second thoughts and went a certain distance, anyway, to meet the points raised here.  I am glad and grateful for that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Bill the first thing to be said is that it was introduced in this House.  It is a very important Bill and it was given a very good examination in this House. As I said on the Report Stage, a number of amendments were not accepted here but were subsequently inserted in the Dáil.  May I be permitted to hope, that following a discussion with the Minister for Finance here today, this idea of giving the Seanad more work by introducing measures in this House will be followed?  If followed, it will save time.</P>
      <P>Following that idea, I propose to be brief and to allow the Bill to pass without much more discussion.  The Minister accepted very few amendments and as the Bill stands, it still contains Section 8 to which in this House and in the other House a good deal of objection was taken.  It should be emphasised that the objection taken both here and in the other House was based on principles of legislation and not on any personalities involved. One can understand the Minister's desire to get a very enterprising and extremely successful Irishman into this Authority and the objections made here, and in the other House, were based entirely on a matter of how legislation should be drafted because this legislation will remain when the personalities involved will be no more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 31 has been materially altered for the better.  The Minister has <Col N="1094" /> divested himself of the power to prevent the Authority from stating, if it so desires, that he ordered it to refrain from doing something or ordered it to do something.  As a matter of fact, most of the Government announcements made by the Authority will, on their face, indicate whence they came and there will be no necessity for the Authority to say whence they came.</P>
    <P>As far as the Bill generally is concerned, we have now reached the point at which television is to be launched in Ireland and this broadcasting Authority, when we have passed this Bill, will become an Irish enterprise. It will, as everybody knows, be an Authority which will exercise great influence in Ireland.  I am sure everybody in the House will agree with me when I say that we hope it will be a successful Irish enterprise and run in such a way as to reflect credit on us and on the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is one point which I think should be made.  The Minister made an estimate of the cost of this new broadcasting Authority and the amount that will be required from public funds. It seems to me that his estimate of how little the taxpayer will have to bear is entirely too optimistic.  This, by its very nature, is an extremely expensive service.  I do not know of any method, and I do not think the Minister knows of any, by which that expense can be so reduced that you can give a satisfactory service which people will look at and at the same time go as low in your costs as the Minister has indicated. It will be found as it has been found in health services and in a number of other enterprises that the cost of this service to the taxpayer will be considerable.</P>
    <P>I hope also that the enterprise will not be marred by political patronage, that no attempt will be made to use it for a particular political purpose, while at the same time preserving liberty for the broadcasting Authority to give political broadcasts fairly as between different Parties.  Finally, I should like to say that I hope the broadcasting Authority will be so managed and so developed that we can all be proud of its success.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a well-known fact that the Government have decided to offer the position of Chairman of the broadcasting Authority to a particular gentleman.  While he may be a fit and proper person to become Chairman of the Authority, I object to the Dáil or Seanad passing special legislation to facilitate any one individual, and that is being done in this Bill.  It is a retrograde step that indeed may have far-reaching effects in the future.  The Government and everybody concerned knows that this gentleman is concerned with the commercial aspect of television, and they have inserted in the Bill special sections to get over their difficulty.  In my opinion, this is setting a very dangerous precedent.</P>
      <P>It would be much better to employ this gentleman on a wholetime basis and make it possible for him to sever all connection with agencies or with the commercial aspect of television. This is a question of principle and the creation of a dangerous precedent.  I believe that if we are to get the best possible board, and that is and should be the desire of everybody, no member of the Authority should have any financial interest in any company or concern dealing with commercial television. We all know that this gentleman has a substantial interest in television. We know that he has his agencies, his own studies, and that he has acquired the rights of many programmes which naturally he intends to sell to television here or elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I wonder is it right that a person having all those agencies should be appointed Chairman of this board. For example, say that the board receive three tenders for a particular period&mdash;from A, B and C.  If A comes from the agency with which the Chairman is concerned, the other members of the board will be put in a very embarrassing position, and it will be very hard for them to remain neutral, despite the sections in the Bill providing that he may have to go outside the door and wait outside until they have reached certain decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is also bound to place the Chairman frequently in a very awkward and embarrassing position.  In <Col N="1096" /> this country, with a population, which is dwindling, but nevertheless numbers nearly 2¾ million people, it should be possible for the Minister to get nine members to form a board who would be in no way connected with commercial television.  It is a pity that the Minister will not do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>When I came to the Seanad with the Bill for its Second Reading, and during its passage through this House, I was very deeply impressed by the examination the Bill got by the Senators and by the application of the Senators who took part in the debate to the various provisions of this Bill.  It may be that it was because it was my first big responsibility as a member of the Government that it made such a deep impression on me, but it may very well be that the debate was such and the points made were such that I took a deep interest in the suggestions made to me in regard to amendments it might be possible to make to the Bill in its passage through the Oireachtás.</P>
      <P>I am glad that Senator Hayes has made reference to the fact that three of the amendments are amendments initiated by discussion on the sections in this House.  In regard to Section 8, I am firmly convinced that it is not a departure in principle from the principle laid down in similar Acts, under which the semi-State bodies operate in this country.  In the Dáil and in the Seanad, too, I made reference to the fact that in regard to the placing of contracts and the provision of public work, the members of our public authorities had set a very high standard, and we wished to see the same high standard maintained under this Bill.</P>
      <P>I also pointed out in the Dáil that 1927 was the first year in which a semi-State body was set up to undertake national work, and since then, a number of Bills have gone through the Oireachtas and many State bodies have been set up to continue to expand the national development that has taken place since this State was founded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am convinced that you will get out of usage and practice a better <Col N="1097" /> standard than you would get by writing into a Bill of this kind restrictions in relation to the people whom the Government can pick to appoint on an Authority such as this.  The usage and practice that have obtained in the public boards and semi-State bodies of this country are above reproach. The method of placing contracts, the method of asking for tenders and the method of deciding contracts are laid down by usage and practice.  Invariably, some civil servant is appointed as Secretary to the new Board when it is established, and he is fully conversant with the usage and practice in a State authority.</P>
    <P>The only other aspect of this matter with which I wish to deal now is that the responsibility of appointing the members of the Authority rests on the Government.  They must decide the degree to which any individual they propose to place on that Authority is committed to a private enterprise, in so far as that commitment of his, or hers as the case may be, would conflict with membership of the Authority. It is no harm for me to name the person concerned, Mr. Eamonn Andrews.  He has been referred to here by Senator L'Estrange.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am mentioning it&mdash; Mr. Eamonn Andrews.  When the Government came to consider this question of a public broadcasting Authority, we had at our disposal in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs certain advice.  The officials of that Department had for years been making themselves conversant with television operation in other countries. We had administrative advice from the higher officials of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  In the country, amongst the public, there was open discussion as to what type of equipment and what type of service the new television Authority would provide for this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was felt by the Government that it was necessary to add to that advice by the establishment of an Advisory Committee, to advise the Minister, to <Col N="1098" /> advise me, on the complex and technical questions which faced the Government in their decisions on this matter. It was natural for the Government to look around for a person who had immediate experience in television, full experience in television, a person with a business, a person who was making a success of his business, a person of good character, a person of high ability, an Irishman who had made good in his own occupation, in his own field.</P>
    <P>We are making no apologies for asking that gentleman to come back to his own country to advise me and to advise the Government as to what type of equipment we should buy and what class of studio we should build, and to advise us in the planning of this service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VictorCarton" hpid="Mr. Carton Mr. Carton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anyone asked the Minister to make an apology.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not make an apology, whether I am asked or not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say anyone asked me.  We wanted to make certain, as far as we possibly could, that we would have the equipment and the studios capable of putting on the necessary programmes to be broadcast to our people.  When Mr. Eamonn Andrews was asked to accept this assignment, he immediately referred to his private interests, and he immediately told me, and the Taoiseach, that if those interests interfered with his membership of the authority, he would resign, but he was pleased and honoured to be asked to initiate an Irish television service. He understands, and everybody else understands, that the Government are free to make their own decisions in this matter as to whether his interests conflict with the public interests in his appointment to this authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this Bill becomes law, this Authority will not be concerned immediately with the broadcasting of a television programme.  The work of the committee is not yet <Col N="1099" /> finished.  The tenders are in for the transmitter, but we have not yet seen the completed drawings and plans for the television studios, or for the link between the television studios and the transmitters.  The tenders have yet to be issued for the other transmitters that will give the country complete coverage.</P>
    <P>Mr. Eamonn Andrews and his committee are being asked to accept membership of this Authority.  They were appointed originally on that committee so that they would know in advance what the Government were asking them to do and the type of equipment the Government were asking them to use in the new service.  The Government took two people who served on the Television Commission with Mr. Eamonn Andrews&mdash;men with wide experience in law and in business&mdash;to sit in with the other three on this advisory committee.</P>
    <P>It cannot be said then that the new Authority did not know what the Government were doing to ensure that there would be some members on the Authority, when established, who would be a party to the decisions the Government were making in the purchase of the equipment, the planning of the studios and the planning of the programmes.  It will be a good while yet before the television Authority is operating in this country.  Between now and then, Mr. Eamonn Andrews, if he so desires, can intimate to the <Col N="1100" /> Government that his interests are such that he cannot any longer remain a member of this Authority.  We can thank him&mdash;and thank the members of the committee&mdash;for the service he has given here to his own country in a patriotic way in this enterprise.  I am proud as Minister to be associated with him in this enterprise.</P>
    <P>I hope this Authority will be an impartial authority, and that we will not have any cause for complaint that it is being used by any Party, or any group of people, for their own interests, for political or any private interests, but that it will be a really impartial authority.  When the Authority is established, I propose, in the normal way as Minister, to meet the Authority and to provide them with an indication of what I think, and what the Government think, should be the broad principles upon which programmes should be operated and propagated. In arriving at this decision, I shall bear in mind the many contributions that were made in the Seanad, and in the Dáil, in that connection, so that we shall get or try to get over to the Authority what the Oireachtas has in mind as well as what the Government have in mind as to what is expected from an Irish television Authority.</P>
