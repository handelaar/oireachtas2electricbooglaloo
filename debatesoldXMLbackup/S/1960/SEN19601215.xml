      <P>In addition to the business on the Order Paper, we have received from the Dáil to-day the Derelict Sites Bill.  It is also hoped to have this evening the Dairy Produce Marketing Bill, 1960.  Senators were notified of the possibility of these Bills by circular last week.  Accordingly, it is proposed to take business, as set out on the Order Paper, in the following order: Nos. 3, 1, 2, followed by the Derelict Sites Bill, 4, 5, followed by the Dairy Produce Marketing Bill, 1960, and No. 8, the motion in the name of Senator Prendergast.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Defence (Amendment) Bill, 1960, was before the Seanad some months ago, I mentioned that permanent legislation to authorise the sending of contingents of Irish troops to participate in police actions under the auspices of the United Nations had been under consideration by the Government for some time and that proposals for that legislation would be submitted to the Oireachtas before the expiration of the six months' period mentioned in the temporary measure.</P>
      <P>This Bill is intended to provide in permanent form a legislative basis for such action in future.  Senators will note that before any action may be taken under it in any specific instance, the approval of the Dáil must be secured.  Ireland, as a member of the United Nations, is committed, both by our signature to the United Nations Charter and by our general policy of supporting action by it in all circumstances where international peace appears to be threatened, to help it, when called upon, within the limits of our resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is hardly necessary to restate Government policy in that regard. The Government's view, which is indeed shared by all the main political Parties in the State, is that it is in the interests of this country and of the <Col N="397" /> world to encourage the growth of the United Nations authority and influence and the establishment of the rule of law in international relations.</P>
    <P>We accept that the United Nations have the right and the function to act in any situation in any part of the world which may endanger peace and that we should be prepared to contribute to the fulfilment of these responsibilities by the United Nations.  The immediate occasion of this Bill is the situation in the Congo where an Irish contingent at present is part of a United Nations police force, to which indeed we have been asked to send a further contingent when the two battalions already there are brought home next month.</P>
    <P>The situation in the Congo has not been resolved during the six months which have elapsed since we authorised, by legislation, the sending of that Irish contingent and during which the United Nations have been involved in this police action there.  Indeed, it has in many ways deteriorated.  While there has been a reduction in the incidence of violence and loss of life, nevertheless it is clear that the federal Government of the Congo has since fallen into a state of confusion and ineffectiveness with rival claimants to the right to exercise authority there and the ever-present threat of civil war.</P>
    <P>As I said in the Dáil during discussions on this Bill nobody doubts that the situation in the Congo would by now have been completely chaotic but for the United Nations presence and that a situation could well have developed which would have involved the great powers with all the inherent threat to the general peace if the United Nations had not intervened in the Congo when its Government so requested in July last.  During the course of the debate on this Bill in the Dáil, and on other occasions, I have refused to comment on the present internal Congo situation both because of our acceptance of the official United Nations position in that regard and also, and perhaps, mainly, because of belief that if by making statements here the Government should appear to be taking sides between the political factions in the Congo it might very <Col N="398" /> well increase the hazards which Irish troops there have to face.</P>
    <P>The United Nations position is that the force is there solely to keep order and protect lives, that it operates for these purposes independently of any national authority and that it has no function of any kind in the resolution of internal political conflicts, constitution or otherwise.  Senators may, however, be aware that a delegation from a United Nations Conciliation Committee has proceeded to the Congo and is endeavouring to bring about a situation in which the internal political conflicts will in some way be resolved. That, however, is a completely separate exercise and it is not contemplated that the United Nations force at present in the Congo will be used to enforce any political settlement.  It is also true that United Nations personnel are endeavouring to ensure the restoration and operation of the normal machinery of civil administration, including health and similar services. Again their activities are distinct and separate from the responsibilities and functions of the United Nations peace force.  In agreeing with the request from the United Nations to send a contingent to the Congo, we had no purpose in mind except to help a newly founded State, which was in grave difficulties, to get itself organised and into a position in which it could undertake for itself the basic operations of any Government, to keep law and order, to prevent the Congo situation deteriorating to an extent which might gravely prejudice the prospects of other new independent African States or those who are expecting or hoping to achieve independence in the near future, and to obviate the prospects of great powers intervening, either directly or in support of contending Congolese factions, which could very well endanger the peace of the whole world.  We have no enemies in the Congo; we have no motives direct or indirect which could possibly raise doubts in any Congolese mind as to the <i>bona fides</i> of our intentions.  There are many States including some African and Asian States which sent contingents to the Congo in the same situation as ours, but it seems to be established <Col N="399" /> that the continued presence of non-African contingents in the Congo force is necessary to demonstrate its United Nations character and to emphasise that its function is limited in the manner I have stated, and that it is not involved and it does not intend to become involved in imposing any solution of political problems there.</P>
    <P>We can hope that, through the efforts of the United Nations Conciliation Committee or otherwise, there will emerge in the Congo an accepted and representative government which can at some early time take over the functions which the United Nations forces are now performing and so permit of their complete withdrawal, in that a stable functioning Congo Government will emerge to develop their state and promote the welfare of their people and to which there can be given, through the United Nations, the aids, financial, material and moral, from the many countries willing to help in that way.</P>
    <P>Whilst this Bill is, as I have said, a permanent measure which would be proposed by the Government to the Oireachtas, if the Congo situation had never arisen, that situation is very relevant to it.  Indeed, it is well the Oireachtas should understand that it is not intended to be a mere gesture of goodwill to the United Nations but represents the acceptance by us of a very real commitment which may require action by the Government from time to time, in relation to our obligations to the United Nations and indicates our willingness to take action in accordance with these obligations when we may be so requested and our resources so permit.  The Government recommend this Bill to the Seanad.</P>

      <P>Although the Bill is general, our mind must be focussed on the Congo.  I think that, despite the comments that are made the people are satisfied that Ireland is doing her job well.  There is great pride in the Army abroad and the more thoughtful will know that the difficulties of this very awkward situation will be handled as well as it is humanly possible.  In this issue, I think our men <Col N="400" /> have clean hands and clear heads and and if the Congo experiment fails, it will not be for lack of goodwill and a more than reasonable contribution on our part.  If it succeeds, I think we can feel grateful that we have helped to make that success possible.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter about which at this stage a lot should not be said, except in relation to the Bill as a permanent measure.  The Taoiseach has explained the occasion for the Bill, which may be the Congo and perhaps the Lebanon before that. It is, in fact, something that marks a new outlook by Ireland on the world. In the beginning, we were more or less preoccupied with our internal problems, setting up the State and Government here and putting our economy in order.  Now we are beginning to develop a world outlook.  I think that is an attitude that is welcomed and not only by our own people but by many people outside.</P>
      <P>I had occasion during the past week to speak to some representatives from nations here&mdash;diplomats.  All of them spoke in the highest terms of the prestige which Ireland has enjoyed in recent times through not only its participation in world affairs but the quality of its participation.  That is particularly noticeable in the Congo which is the immediate situation with which we are concerned.  I think everybody is in full agreement with the actions and the attitude of the Government in this matter.  Naturally, there is a certain amount of concern about the situation there which has now become very confused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that when the sending of troops to the Congo was under consideration, everybody here had full regard to the obligations, the difficulties and the dangers that would arise.  Not to have regard to these things would have been absolutely wrong.  Our action in sending troops to the Congo was decided on after much examination and with great deliberation. Therefore, now that the position has arisen where there is a confused situation&mdash;there has been death&mdash;there is all the more reason why we should not withdraw from our obligations <Col N="401" /> until the position is untenable and is no longer any use.  I do not think it could be said by anybody that that situation exists at present, even though other people are pulling out.  They are pulling out for the reason that they are taking sides.  As the Taoiseach pointed out, quite rightly, Ireland is not there taking sides.  We are there undertaking a dignified and responsible task&mdash;the establishment of law and order.  In the past, that mission was undertaken by bigger nations and very often with very many ulterior motives.</P>
    <P>This is one of the first times it has been possible for the small nations of the world, who are committed and who have not any ulterior motives, to do a job of international importance which will ultimately lead to peace and justice for all people, regardless of their size or strength.  Therefore, I should like to say that this Bill has the full support of everybody I know of in the Party of which I am a member.  I feel that if we always conduct ourselves in the future&mdash;we are only starting&mdash;as we have conducted ourselves so far, this Bill will be fully justified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened very carefully to the Taoiseach and I read his statements in another place in support of this Bill and have noted its implications.  I should like to say that I support everything he says.  I think the Bill contains provisions that are necessary if we are to fulfill, as he says, our obligations to the world, to the United Nations and to the growth and influence of the spirit which is symbolised by the United Nations for the purpose of the promotion and maintenance of the rule of law.  I feel that the Taoiseach today as elsewhere has put before us a very sober, moderate and, I think, convincing statement of the reasons why this Bill, and the Government promoting this Bill, deserve our unreserved support on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say that personally when I read that Mr. Hammarskjoeld, on behalf of the United Nations, had invited us way back in June, I think it was, to be one the nations to send <Col N="402" /> our troops to the U.N. police force, as the Taoiseach rightly calls it, I felt very proud that we should have been one of the first nations to be invited.  I feel that it was by reason of our behaviour in the Parliament of the world, that we had deserved this honour.  I was very conscious of the fact that it was an honour, and I was very glad that the Government had the imagination to accept the invitation at once.</P>
    <P>We know of course that when our troops went out there, many of them were killed in most wretched circumstances, and in circumstances which could not have been foreseen by us here, or indeed by anyone at the time. Consequently, there has been a very real sacrifice in human life as well as the original token sign of our willingness to co-operate.  The Taoiseach has found himself in the situation of having to recognise that conditions in the Congo, about which we are most immediately concerned, have since since unfortunately deteriorated.  It is quite obvious that the situation with which we as a participating power are trying to cope, is extremely difficult.</P>
    <P>I feel that the Taoiseach is right again when he says this is a matter for United Nations action and decision, and really the whole situation stands or falls by the capacity of the different nations, of which we are one, to stand by the United Nations.  I would have no patience at all, I am afraid, with those nations that say: &ldquo;We are now withdrawing&rdquo; or &ldquo;We will withdraw our troops unless you do so and so.&rdquo;  I do not believe that everything that is done by every section of the United Nations forces out there has to be underwritten by every nation. We are in this together, however, and we have to accept the authority of the United Nations, and it is under its banner that we participate.</P>
    <P>The difficulty of the situation has been recognised by the Taoiseach.  To a great extent, it springs from the chaotic conditions in the Congo, where the United Nations are committed more or less to try to establish unity, a unity which in fact has very <Col N="403" /> little historic significance, except that derived from the previous Belgian administration.  In that fact lies the dilemma with which we are faced, the fact that the unity which it is felt would be for the benefit of the country as a whole, has in fact no particular historic significance, except that derived from the earlier Belgian regime.</P>
    <P>One has to recognise that it might well be that some particular portion of the Congo, as it used to be understood, might hesitate when the United Nations say to them: &ldquo;You must stick together, and you in Katanga, for instance, must share your wealth with your poor brothers in the rest of the Congo.&rdquo;  One might feel that perhaps Katanga should have the right to say: &ldquo;No; we do not want to share.&rdquo; Nevertheless, I feel we as a nation have to accept the overall policy of the United Nations and attempt at any rate to maintain order to a sufficient extent in the Congo to enable the people there eventually to make their own decisions.  Such decisions were made, after all, in another recently founded State, Mali.  Its two States have recently separated again, one of them becoming the State of Senegal and the second State that which used to be the French Sudan.</P>
    <P>In other words, as has been pointed out by the Government, our obligation is, as it were, to hold the ring and see that inside the ring whatever difference of opinion is manifested is manifested in terms of decency and fair-play, and not of chaos, civil war, murder and massacre.  We are there consequently with other nations, many of them, one is glad to say, free African nations themselves, in a spirit of disinterested comradeship with those nations of the world who are concerned with decency and justice.  Although we are a small nation, and consequently our contribution is small, we take legitimate pride in that fact.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has said&mdash;again, I think he is right&mdash;that he will not make any public comment on the internal political situation in the Congo.  The reasons he gave for not wishing to do so are sound ones.  I should like to <Col N="404" /> urge, however&mdash;in a sense I believe that it is not necessary to urge it&mdash;that behind the scenes everywhere, our influence should always be felt, put forward, urged and made operative on the side of decency and justice, and against such things as arrest without trial or detention without the right to see representatives of international organisations and so on.  That is the kind of thing upon which we can have influence behind the scenes, and about which, for reasons the Taoiseach stated, it might be injurious for the Government to make a public statement. I am convinced, however, that our influence is already being used on the side of decency there.</P>
    <P>This Bill makes it possible to send a contingent of our permanent forces abroad which is a departure from policy in this State.  It is quite a new thing.  Yet I feel it is absolutely necessary, because I think that perhaps not all of us realised that there was in fact an error contained in the method of recruiting volunteers only, because of the fact that when volunteers are sought, many come from different sections and different regiments, with different training and so on.  In other words, the most effective contingent we could send would be trained contingents of our permanent Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to enable us to make the most effective contribution possible and for that reason, too, I support it.  Otherwise, there might be a measure of unpreparedness in any contingent we send, deriving not from any lack of goodwill, but, on the contrary, perhaps even from an excess of enthusiasm, and we might again get a situation such as the lamentable situation which arose in which so many of our men were killed.  Despite all the difficulties, and I think the Taoiseach is aware, and has suggested, that they may be increasing, I feel, and I think we all feel, this is no time either to falter or to withdraw, and the credit, in so far as we will be judged in the light of history, will go to those who have had the fortitude to stand firm with the United Nations.</P>
    <P>At this juncture, I should like as a <Col N="405" /> member of the Oireachtas to pay tribute to Mr. Hammarskjoeld who is a great international statesman.  He can legitimately be personally identified with what is being attempted in the Congo, and I think it is of vital necessity for us to give him the maximum support.  We must stand as we have stood, and the Government have rightly seen that, publicly and privately, we have stood four-square behind the line proposed by him and implemented by him in accordance with the instructions of his Council.</P>
    <P>It was a splendid thing that, at the Autumn Assembly of the United Nations, that policy was publicly tested, and a vote of confidence was proposed and Mr. Hammarskjoeld gathered the support of an enormous number of nations of the African States, who voted their confidence in the policy of the United Nations in the Congo.  Seventy nations, including our own, voted for, and only three abstained, to their eternal shame, the Communist bloc, South Africa and alas! France.  I think it was very moving to see these new nations coming together, because they have their differences and dissensions and criticisms, behind the policy that was symbolised for them in the person of Mr. Hammarskjoeld.</P>
    <P>This Bill before us today, and the actions which will be taken under it, is in accordance with our intelligent, generous, honourable and very well presented foreign policy at the United Nations over the past years, and for that reason I have pleasure in supporting this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VictorCarton" hpid="Mr. Carton Mr. Carton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to endorse everything that has been said and to support the Taoiseach on this measure.  Every member of this and the other House and every person in the country is proud of our troops in the Congo.  There is no doubt about that.  We have cynics who may be spreading the idea that our people were not trained, but I know that they are as well trained as any other forces of the United Nations that are overseas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This measure authorises the sending of troops overseas to serve with the <Col N="406" /> United Nations forces.  Deliberately they may be sent now on active service without any question of volunteering. Heretofore, the 32nd and 33rd battalions went overseas and I believe that, generally speaking, they were volunteers.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington feels that deliberately to form a battalion and send it out without asking its members if they would like to go is a far better arrangement, but my view is that the Minister ought as far as possible to adhere to the volunteer idea, even if he has the power to send them, that men should as far as possible get the opportunity of volunteering. In my experience, though it is not very wide, as a regular soldier and an old I.R.A. man, I always found a volunteer was far better than any half dozen conscripts.  I have no doubt the Minister will keep that in mind.</P>
    <P>When the original group was going out, there was a point which we did not raise here.  When one of our soldiers is now going overseas on active service, is it clear that the Defence Forces Acts cover that active service duty fully?  As we know, certain offences committed on active service could by court martial possibly entail death.  If these men go on active service, are they quite clear about that, and are we quite clear that where an offence committed here at home might not be grave, a similar offence committed overseas on active service might be a tremendously serious matter?  I have a feeling that the Minister will cover that aspect in relation to any future contingents that go out, but it is important that it should be mentioned.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to reiterate and endorse the words of Senator Barry, that we wholeheartedly support this measure and fully appreciate how delicate it is for the Taoiseach even to speak at any length at all on this matter when his words could be misconstrued by people who would like to build a story on a misconstruction. It has been said in many places that one is perilously poised between the cliché and the indiscretion, and the Taoiseach is more or less in that situation <Col N="407" /> now.  I wholeheartedly support this measure.</P>

      <P>Is dóigh liom gur ceart cuidiú leis an mBille seo agus leis an dlí atá á dhéanamh faoi.  Tá ceangal idir an tír seo anois agus na Náisiúin Aontaithe.  Tá meas mhuintir an domhain tuillte againn mar gheall ar an dtacaíocht a thugamar do na Náisiúin Aontaithe, go háirithe sa Chongo.  Is mór an méid sin maidir leis an dtír seo.  Is eol do na náisiúin anois gur tír neamhspleách í Éire, gur dheineamar ár gcion agus go bhfuilimid ag comhlíonadh ár gcuid dualgaisí idirnáisiúnta i neithe den tsórt seo.  Uime sin, tá oibliogáid fé leith orainn.</P>
      <P>Tugadh cuireadh dúinn a bheith páirteach in obair seo na Náisiún Aontaithe mar mhaithe le síocháin agus le leas an Chongo.  Ghlacamar leis an gcuireadh sin.  Ó thosach, bhí a fhios againn nach raibh an gnó seo gan chontúirt.  Is daor a cheannaíomar an t-eolas nár chuid dár samhlaíocht é an chontúirt ach go raibh sí ann dáiríre.</P>
      <P>Is eagal liom go bhfuil gluaiseachtaí sa Chongo ag iarraidh dul i bhfeidhm ar na daoine bochta ann ar mhaithe le cuspóirí seachas na cuspóirí úd a labhartar go hoscailte fúthu.  Is é mo thuairim féin nach ceann amháin ach dhá nó trí cinn dena gluaiseachtaí seo atá i mbun saothair agus ní ar mhaithe leis an gCongo ná le muintir an Chongo a leantar leo.</P>
      <P>Dá bhrí sin, ba cheart dúinn a bheith an-chúramach agus an-aireach gan seasamh le taobh seachas a chéile. Ba cheart dúinn gníomhú ar son cúis na síochána agus cothram na Féinne do na daoine seo.  Tá áthas orm gur chuir an Taoiseach in iúl gur dualgaisí póilíneachta is cúram do na saighdiúirí a chuirtear go dtí an tír sin.  Tá súil agam go leanfar leis an bpolasaí sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Níl aon tairbhe le bhaint ag Eirinn sa Chongo ach amháin an cháil a thiochfaidh chuice de bhárr cabhair a thabhairt sa Chongo chun a chuid ghnothaí a chur ar bun go seasamhach agus riail agus ord agus cirt a chur ar bun ann.  Is é tubaist an scéil fé láthair ag na Náisiúin Aontaithe nach <Col N="408" /> bhfuil aon duine le fáil go fóill acu sa Chongo gur féidir leis labhairt ar son an Chongo uilig agus pobal an Chongo uilig.  Is é mar dhealraíonn an scéal d'aon duine ná go bhfuil aon duine a labhair go dtí seo ag caint ar a shon féin agus ní ar maithe leis an gCongo ach ar mhaithe leis féin.</P>
    <P>Ní foláir bheith aireach i dtaobh daoine mar sin.  Dá bhféadaimís dea-mhéinn na ndaoine ann a fháil ba rí mhaith an rud é.  Tá níos mó ná 20,000,000 sa trí sin, ach an bhfuil aon duine ann a labhrann ar son iomlán na ndaoine atá ann?</P>

Is é an cuspóir atá againne agus ag ár saighdiúirí sa Chongo ná síocáin a bhunú ann agus saol agus beatha na ndaoine uilig ann do chosaint.  Dob é sin an cuspóir a bhí rómhainn an chéad lá agus ár saighdiúirí ag dul ann faoi chúram na Náisiún Aontaithe.</P>
      <P>Is maith liom gur labhair an Taoiseach faoi sin arís.  Is maith liom go nduirt sé go soiléir gurb í an gnó a bhí againn agus ár saighdiúirí do chur ins an Chongo ná go mbeidis ann mar Ghardaí Siochána agus gurb í an tsíocháin a choimeád agus saol agus beatha na ndaoine a choimeád na cuspóirí a bhí le baint amach acu.

      <P>I desire to be associated with the support for this Bill and to be associated with the tributes paid to our soldiers in the Congo.  I do this essentially from the point of view of the graduates of the National University who have contributed their bit to the development of those African states.  We have been associated, in the University, with the training of many of our priests and nuns who have gone into the mission fields.  Likewise, we have <Col N="409" /> been responsible for the training of many of our professional people who have gone to help those nations to develop into modern nations and to prepare for the day of self-government. We have had the privilege of training in our Universities some of the leaders of the new Africa. Admittedly, the numbers have been small but it is a great source of pleasure to us when we hear that students whom we knew in class some few years back are now in very responsible positions in some of the Governments in Africa.  Unfortunately, our main contribution was confined largely to Nigeria but I think the work that has been done there can overflow into the councils of Africa as a whole.</P>
      <P>This Bill, enshrining in permanent form authority to send troops abroad, really marks the fact that we are emerging as a mature nation.  This maturity has been sealed in blood by the deaths of our soldiers on active service.  We have come a long way in a few months.  We are facing up to our responsibilities to take our part in preparing the world for a rule of law based on respect for the right of the human being.  We are playing our part in preventing the spread of anarchy and in combatting the subversive influences of world Communism that are always at work.  We should be very proud of the opportunity of doing it.  I hope and pray that we can do far more in the future. We should regard this measure as only the start of our contribution.  I hope that when our Government consider the long range plans, these will include an offer to enlarge our facilities here for the training of future African leaders.</P>

      <P>In so far as the Taoiseach and other members have suggested that the internal affairs of the Congo are very confused, with which statement we all agree, surely the root cause is lack of trained personnel? I was making the suggestion that this might be regarded as just an instalment.  I conclude with a tribute to the Taoiseach for his handling <Col N="410" /> of this affair over the past months and also for the way in which our Army have conducted themselves.  We are all mighty proud of them.</P>

      <P>I should like to associate myself also with what has been said about the Irish troops in the Congo.  I should like to say, as a member of the staff of Dublin University, that we would have, I think all of us, the same feelings about these countries as have been expressed by Senator Quinlan on behalf of the National University of Ireland.  We were proud &mdash;I was proud and we were all proud &mdash;when Ireland accepted the invitation of the United Nations to send troops there.  We were proud, too, that there were to be found in our Army so many volunteers who were prepared to take up this challenge.  We were proud to learn, when they found themselves in the Congo, that they proved so worthy of their trust.  Therefore, I think this Bill that comes before us has nothing but approval and we are all proud to extend our approval to it today.</P>
      <P>I think that the feelings that have been expressed in relation to the relative values of volunteer service and obligatory service by Senator Sheehy Skeffington and Senator Carton are both covered quite adequately by the Bill.  While a member of the Force already serving is always free to volunteer, anybody joining from the time this Bill is enacted will know that when he volunteers to join the Army he is at the same time voluntarily accepting every obligation that that entails, including service abroad.  That will be obvious and clear to him.  It is a volunteer Army.  In that sense, he will be aware of the position and he will be a volunteer for this service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point which may be covered in the Principal Act, to which the Bill is really an amendment&mdash;I am afraid I have not studied that Act carefully&mdash; is the question of allowances for families of these people serving abroad. Is any provision made for additional allowances?  We all know that service in the Army takes a man away from his family.  This is a small country.  If he is serving in a small country, he may be in his own town or in the next <Col N="411" /> town.  He will probably not be called more than 100 miles away.  Therefore, he is available for advice and for many kinds of help to his family from time to time.  If there is an emergency, he can get home rapidly to deal with it.  This is not so when serving in the Congo or in any foreign country, and there should be some notice taken of that and perhaps an allowance provided for the families of people serving abroad in this way.  I am very pleased to associate myself with this Bill.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank Senators who have intervened in this debate for their comments on this Bill and on the policy which the Government have pursued, all of which have again emphasised the unity of purpose and outlook which have characterised the attitude of our people in relation to these matters.  We hope for the speedy success of the United Nations effort in the Congo, both because of its importance to the future of the world and to the United Nations and so that we can soon bring our participation honourably to an end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Defence will be available to the Seanad during the discussion on the Bill in Committee and will be able to deal with any details which Senators may wish to raise or may wish to seek information about, including those mentioned by Senator Carton and Senator Jessop.  Senator Carton was quite right in stressing the advantages of confining Army contingents going overseas in United Nations service to volunteers.  The experience of the Army Command in relation to the Congo operation has been that volunteers have been coming forward in very much larger numbers than required.  I think that is always likely to be the case and, therefore, the disposition of the Army Command is certain to be when time is available to permit of proper integrated units being organised on a volunteer basis, to confine them to those who express the wish to participate.  The advantage is obvious and the possibility of so doing will normally exist <Col N="412" /> except perhaps on occasions where speedy action requires the movement of an already existing unit.</P>
    <P>When I express the hope that the situation in the Congo will be resolved soon and that the continued need for the presence of the United Nations forces will disappear, I must say that at the moment the indications do not justify the hope and unless the United Nations Conciliation Committee, through its delegation, are able to bring about a change in the situation, we must contemplate that the presence of United Nations forces will be necessary for many months to come.  We have, however, decided that, having regard to the prevailing tensions and climatic conditions, it is undesirable to keep a particular unit there for longer than six months and therefore the term to be served in the Congo by the 34th Battalion after it arrives there, as in the case of the two previous battalions, will be limited to six months.</P>

Are there preliminary training schemes, and some kind of preliminary local training for them?

      <P>In the case of the first two battalions we sent out&mdash;the two serving <Col N="413" /> there at the moment&mdash;they had to be assembled at short notice and the whole operation conducted by the United Nation force in the Congo was being conducted as a matter of urgency and the troops had to be despatched to the area in which they were needed immediately on arriving. In the case of the battalion now being got in readiness, we have had longer notice and also the Army authorities have acquired some knowledge of the type of activity in which the troops at present there have been engaged.  It has been possible to give reasonably adequate instruction and training to the personnel of the battalion which is being got in readiness to replace the two already there.</P>
      <P>As regards the training that could be given in the Congo, that was a matter for improvisation by the officers on the spot and they could give only whatever training it was possible to give in the circumstances as they existed there.  As it turned out, they did get a reasonable time to acclimatise themselves to conditions there and I am quite certain that the troops, officers, n.c.o.s and men, have become very efficient in the type of operations they have had to perform, but I have no real information as to details of training or anything like that.</P>

      <P>There were just two points raised which I think I should deal with.  Senator Carton raised the question of active service.  It is clear to all the troops in the Congo and to all those going that they will, in fact, be on active service.  The implications of that are fully understood by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Jessop raised the question <Col N="414" /> of the extra allowances paid to the troops.  All the troops in the Congo at the moment are paid the equivalent of 9/- a day by the United Nations and we, in addition to that, pay our troops 7/6 per day over and above their normal pay and allowances.  The adequacy of that amount is under active consideration at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not quite my point.  My point was in relation to what used to be called, during the first World War, a &ldquo;separation allowance&rdquo;, which was paid direct to the wife.  We all know that in these forces, where there are men from different countries with different standards of living, very often the amount paid to our people to keep them up to the standards of other people accustomed to higher standards is not quite enough.  They may not send money home and the people at home may be in need.</P>

My information is that in so far as the vast majority are concerned, the voluntary allotment has been increased since they went out. This money, which is payable by us, is not, in fact, being drawn by the soldiers out there.  They are making do so far with the United Nations allowance and the remainder is either allotted to their dependents at home or lies to their credit.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deals with arbitration principally on land valuation that comes up from time to time.  We are co-ordinating, as it were, the arbitration procedure under three different Acts <Col N="415" /> which had different procedures up to now.</P>
      <P>First, you have the Finance Act 1909 and 1910, which deals with estate duties.  When that Act was passed, a provision was made for the appointment of arbitrators.  There was a dispute between the parties.  Then you have the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919. Again, there was a committee set up to deal with the question of arbitration. At that time, we had the Lord Chancellor and the Master of the Rolls and the Surveyors Institute.  Now you have on that committee, the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the President of the Surveyors Institute, Irish Branch.  They are the committee.  They have land valuers and they appoint one of the land valuers, if there are more than one on the list, in case any question should arise.</P>
      <P>The third Act was the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  A provision was made there for arbitration in case of dispute.  It was found from experience that there were very much fewer cases coming up for arbitration than was anticipated.  Between the three of them, there is certainly no more work than is necessary for one arbitrator. This Bill, therefore, provides that we carry on.  The committee is there. We make no changes so far as that is concerned but we give the committee power to appoint one or more valuers and they may appoint these full-time or part-time, as they think fit.</P>
      <P>The same committee will deal with cases arising under all three Acts. The procedure will be the same in each case and as it is generally a question of land valuation that comes up, it will be convenient for the committee to have the same valuer or valuers dealing with all three Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of appeals under the Arterial Drainage Act have been rather small.  The bigger number would come under the Acquisition of Land Act, 1919.  I think the average is 45 per year under that.  There might be half a dozen or so under the Estate Duty Act and, perhaps, another <Col N="416" /> half dozen or fewer under the Drainage Act.  Therefore, any Senator can see that, taking them all together, there is certainly not any more work than would be necessary for one person.</P>
    <P>In certain cases, where a person is working full time, it may be considered he would have an interest or be influenced in some way and then the committee would appoint another person to do the valuation.  We are not making any changes, so far as that is concerned.  It is the committee who decide who the arbitrators should be. It is not the parties to the action who select the arbitrator.  That also would continue.</P>
    <P>I do not think very much more arises on this, except that in regard to arbitration, there was some doubt with regard to the 1919 Act because the Act mentioned &ldquo;arbitrators&rdquo;.  It is understandable, of course, because it was an Act passed by the British Parliament which applied to Great Britain and Ireland.  Arbitrators would be necessary in England and one man could not do the work there.  The Act applied to Ireland.  The fact that arbitrators were mentioned in the Act left some doubt whether it would be legal for us to carry on here with one arbitrator.  As a result of that doubt a certain person was put on the panel, although he is, of course, a public servant.  He had to act only once in the whole time he was there, so it was, if you like, as a mere formality to fulfil the provision of the Act that he was put there.  I think we should not consider it necessary to carry that on in the future.  In this Bill, therefore, we say to the committee: &ldquo;Appoint one or more, if you wish; a full-time man, if you wish, or a part-time man&mdash;whatever you think most suitable in all the circumstances.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is one clause which refers to the present man who has a full-time appointment.  He was appointed for life and he would, therefore, expect that his position would not be interfered with by any legislation we might bring in.  There is a provision that he must not be treated less favourably than he is treated at the moment.  We may take it, therefore, that he will be <Col N="417" /> appointed as a full-time arbitrator when this Bill goes through but, in addition, the Committee may appoint a temporary arbitrator.</P>
    <P>The Committee consists of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the President of the Institute of Chartered Surveyors.  The only function of the Minister for Finance is to lay down what the remuneration and the other conditions of appointment should be.  There was a certain standard in the past from which I do not think we need depart.</P>
    <P>There is also provision in the Bill in case a question arises as to whether any decisions given in the past are valid.  As I mentioned, there was a legal doubt about past decisions when there was only one arbitrator on the panel, as it is called.  We are taking this opportunity of making past decisions legal, notwithstanding the fact that there was only one man on the panel at the time.  The Act deals only with the question of arbitration, the appointment of arbitrators and the procedure under which they will act in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a technical Bill for the purpose of tying up legislation, bringing it up to date and making the procedure under it more expeditious. There is not much anyone can say on the measure, but as the opportunity is afforded to me, I should like to ask the Minister one or two questions with regard to arbitration in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that the Committee have no other function than to recommend a person for appointment as an arbitrator. I assume once he is appointed, his award is final, and he makes no report whatsoever to the Committee. That procedure is probably time-honoured and I have no experience to show that it has not worked well.  The Minister and the Department would be much more aware of the facts than anyone else.  Undoubtedly, if an arbitration award were made, and the parties for whom or against whom the award is made felt that it was not fair or equitable, complaints would have been sent to the Minister.  I know that if the Minister provided any machinery for giving that power it would mean that after the arbitrator had made his <Col N="418" /> award, if anyone felt he should have got more money, he would have to appeal to the Committee or other body which supervised the arbitrator.  It might, therefore, be desirable that the arbitrator should send a report to the Committee and that the Committee should be satisfied, without the citizen having direct or indirect access to the Committee.  The Committee would then see that the arbitrator they had appointed was doing his job to their satisfaction.  There may not be much in the point I am making, but it might be a means of assessing the ability of the men appointed.</P>
    <P>I should also like to know if the arbitrator can be removed from office, if it is felt that it is in the public interest to do so because he is not giving satisfaction.  The Minister was quite right to clarify this legislation dealing with three systems of appointment of arbitrators, and bringing the law on that important function up-to-date. Many of us feel&mdash;and perhaps the Minister feels the same way&mdash;that there is a great deal to be said for allowing the courts to perform as many of these functions as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The arbitrator is appointed in each particular case. Every case where an arbitrator is required goes before the Committee and they appoint an arbitrator.  They do not appoint him and tell him to carry on; they must appoint an arbitrator in each case.  He makes his report to each of the parties and, unless one of the parties raises some question of law, the award is final.  In other words, there is no appeal against the amount of the award.  If a party thinks he has a question of law to raise, he can bring it before the High Court for decision, and the High Court will give a decision as to whether or not the law has been compiled with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the Committee remove a man? That depends on the appointment.  If they give a person a life appointment, they cannot remove him, so I think the Committee are in the same position as any other person who gives a man a life appointment.  He cannot be got rid of, except for a very good cause. It might be that this Bill makes a <Col N="419" /> change in the situation and that is why we have put in the clause to safeguard the present man by saying that the Committee must treat him not less generously than he has been treated in the past.</P>

      <P>On the question of land acquisition or anything of that nature which has the same procedure, I have often thought that a person may feel seriously aggrieved as a result of the amount of the arbitration award.  I often feel that there should be a way out of it.  I know that I am raising a very large issue but I feel that, in passing, I ought to mention it.  The Minister for Finance has a much more considered view on this matter than I have, but I have often felt this way about it&mdash;and I have had some experience&mdash;that it is hard that there is no way whatever, no matter what case may be made for it or whatever rebutting valuations can be brought into court, to upset the decision of the arbitrator other than on a question of law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, there must be some finality.  As the Senator knows, under the various Acts, certain <Col N="420" /> people like the local authorities can take land compulsorily.  The Land Commission is not included in this. If the local authority would like to acquire a bit of land, they try to negotiate a price, but if the owner is not satisfied, he can go to arbitration. There is, therefore, not much point in giving him further arbitrators.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the recommendations contains in the Interim Report of the Joint Committee on Electoral Law which was presented to the Dáil on 26th October and to this House on the 9th November, 1960. Advantage is being taken of the Bill also to continue two temporary electoral enactments which would otherwise expire at the end of the present year and to extend the maximum period between a dissolution of Dáil Éireann or the issue of a writ for a bye-elction and the holding of the poll.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="421" /> The Acts of 1868 and 1869 mentioned in Section 2 of the Bill deal, respectively, with petitions against the election of candidates to parliament and with the costs of certain types of parliamentary inquiries.  They are temporary statutes and, in the past, have been continued by Expiring Laws Acts; the last such Act, passed in 1952, extended their life up to 31st December, 1960.  It is considered to be appropriate to continue them by this Electoral Bill until such time as their provisions can be brought into relationship with modern conditions and assimilated into our general electoral code.</P>
    <P>The statutory prohibition on the registration of Gardaí as Dáil electors is being repealed under Section 3 of the Bill and section 6 provides that all members of the Garda Síochána and of the Defence Forces will, in future, be registered as postal voters.  To preserve a right which soldiers already possess, the Bill proposes to give members of the Defence Forces the option of choosing to be registered in the constituency where they would be ordinarily resident but for their services with the Forces.</P>
    <P>A move to simplify the procedure in postal voting is made in Section 8, which provides for the substitution of a simple receipt for the formal declaration of identity which, up to this, had to accompany each postal ballot paper sent to voters at election time.</P>
    <P>An important change is being made by Section 4 in regard to the minimum age at which a person may be registered as an elector.  Heretofore, a person could not be registered unless he had attained the age of 21 years on or before 15th September in the year preceding the publication of the register.  In effect, this has meant that a minimum age of 21 years and 7 months on the date on which the register comes into force has been necessary to secure registration.  The Bill proposes that the register now being compiled and future registers should include the names of all persons, otherwise qualified, who will have reached the age of 21 years by the 15th April on which the register <Col N="422" /> comes into operation.  It is estimated that this provision should admit up to 25,000 additional young electors on to the register now being prepared.</P>
    <P>An extension of the maximum period which may elapse between the proclamation dissolving Dáil Éireann or the receipt by a returning officer of a writ for a bye-election and the polling day is proposed by section 7. The purpose of the change is to enable a sufficiently long period to be fixed between nomination and polling to allow ballot papers to be sent to postal voters who may be serving abroad and to be returned by them in time to be counted at an election.  It is also proposed that the Minister for Local Government rather than the returning officer should fix the polling day at a bye-election.</P>
    <P>The only recommendations of the Joint Committee which I found myself unable to accept without any qualification were certain of those relating to voting by blind and incapacitated electors.  Briefly, I consider that a companion should be allowed to assist one or two blind or incapacitated voters to mark their ballot papers instead of only one such voter as recommended by the Joint Committee, and I have not adopted their recommendation that a companion should be required to complete a declaration of secrecy.  On the other hand, the Bill contains a condition, additional to those suggested by the Joint Committee, requiring companions assisting such voters to be at least 16 years of age.</P>
    <P>As the law stands at present, a presiding officer may refuse to accede to a request by a blind or incapacitated voter that his ballot paper be marked for him where the request is made within four hours of the close of the poll and the officer considers that it would unduly obstruct the voting of other electors to comply with the request.  This discretion to refuse will remain in cases where the presiding officer is himself requested, under the existing procedure, to mark a ballot paper in the presence of the agents of candidates, for a blind or incapacitated voter, but it will not apply where such <Col N="423" /> a voter wishes to have his paper marked for him by a companion.</P>
    <P>In proposing these slight departures from the recommendations of the Joint Committee and the introduction of the new provisions I am acceding to pressing representations which were made to me by a deputation from the National League of the Blind shortly after the Interim Report was published. I feel that the changes are reasonable and that they should be accepted.</P>
    <P>The changes which are proposed in relation to the Dáil electoral code under Parts I and II of the Bill will, where appropriate, be made also in the codes dealing with presidential elections, referenda and local elections under Parts III, IV and V of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to place on record my appreciation of the work which is being done by the Joint Committee on Electoral Law and, in particular, for the expeditious manner in which they completed and presented the Interim Report which has formed the basis for the major part of this Bill.  The law which they have under examination is voluminous and extremely complex and we all look forward to a large measure of rationalisation and consolidation as a result of their deliberations.  Because it is essential that certain changes provided for in this Bill should be given legislative effect in the current parliamentary session the scope of the measure is necessarily restricted.  I would suggest, however, that any ideas on electoral matters which occur to Senators and which do not directly relate to the provisions of the Bill might appropriately be submitted by them for consideration by the Joint Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">

      <P>The two most important provisions I can see in the Bill are the giving of votes to the Garda and the extension of the age position to cover people who will be 21 on 15th April in each year which, the Minister said, means that voters hitherto required to be a minimum of 21 years and seven months before they were entitled to vote, will be entitled to vote.  The register is being compiled on that basis.  If we do not give effect to all <Col N="424" /> Stages of this Bill, it will not be possible for this desirable improvement in the law to take place.  In saying this, I am not looking for any information on the closely-guarded secret of when the general election is to take place. A voter, who did not reach 21 years of age until 15th April last may well have to wait a month or seven months before he has an opportunity of casting his vote.  Be that as it may, it suffices for the Seanad to allow this measure to pass so that the Gardaí and Ban Gardaí may register their votes.  I suppose the Ban Gardaí will have to be brought in as otherwise they would have to be excluded if the Minister did not take the precaution of allowing them to retain their votes when they joined the Force as also, the people who would not be 21 years of age until 15th April.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this Bill.  I realise that it is as the Minister said, the result of an interim report.  Therefore I think we may look forward as he says to a further rationalisation of the present code which is highly complicated.  It is obvious to all of us that the provisions of this Bill are sensible and some are long overdue.</P>
      <P>The provision in relation to the age of the voter is an obviously necessary amendment.  I am glad the Government has accepted it, and also the voting by members of the Defence Forces and the Garda.  But there are a number of other points which I should like to see in any electoral Bill purporting to simplify, clarify and rationalise.  I would ask the Minister to take these into account.  Presumably this is in a sense an interim Bill, and the Minister will be preparing a second and perhaps a third Bill to come before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of anomalies in our electoral system which could well be removed and which would be difficult to defend.  One is that on a ballot paper which may contain as many as 30 names, the political affiliations of the candidate are not allowed.  You are allowed to say he is a company director, or a dustman, or a teacher, and so on, but you are <Col N="425" /> not allowed to say he is a member of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Labour Party or whatever party he may belong to.  I do not know what is the implication&mdash;whether it is deemed disgraceful or disreputable to belong to a political party.  I see no justification, however, for this failure to place this information on the ballot paper, and thus make it easy for the voter to know what he is doing.  In the old days, when there were only two or three candidates for a one-seat constituency, there was no confusion. You knew whether they were Sinn Féin, Nationalist or Unionist.  Nowadays when we have got a little beyond these primitive electoral systems and may have as many as five seats in our constituencies, we may have as many as 30 or 40 candidates on the list.  You would need a good memory to remember exactly all the political affiliations of every candidate on such a list.  You must remember the initials as well.  The same surname may appear twice on the ballot paper for members of different Parties.</P>
    <P>It ought to be a question of pushing an open door to suggest that a candidate should be allowed to put in brackets after his name his political affiliation, which would make things far simpler for the voter.  My second point is the question of the deposit. We have a monetary deposit required which we inherited from the British system.  I suggest there are here two amendments to be made.  The first is that the deposit should be considerably lower.  It is far too big a sum.</P>
    <P>This, of course, is a monetary barrier.  The small man who has not got these money resources, and is not backed by the big Party political machines, cannot become a candidate. He cannot put down the £100 or the £150 for the deposit and that is a judgement, if you like, on the adequacy of a candidate on purely financial grounds.  I suggest you might have another test, whether he could be nominated by a certain number of voters for instance, or if that test is not feasible, then let us make the deposit lower.  The only people who derive advantage from keeping the deposit high are the big Parties, but of course we realise that they are more <Col N="426" /> concerned with justice than with mere Party advantage.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to lower the amount of the deposit.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, there is the forfeiting of the deposit because the candidate has not secured one-sixth of the quota.  It is a rather high percentage, because you might get quite a lot of votes and still not secure one-sixth of the quota.  In other words, you can receive quite a considerable amount of support in a constituency and yet forfeit your deposit.  I would plead that it should be changed from one-sixth to one-tenth, or something of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two other points I should like to mention.  One of them is the question which I think disturbs a lot of us, that is, the election propaganda which is pasted up on public buildings at election time.  I am sure the Minister is aware that in continental countries every candidate is allotted four or five places in his constituency where an individual propaganda board is chained to some immovable object, and he is allowed to paste up his propaganda there, but nowhere else.  If any of his propaganda <Col N="427" /> appears anywhere else, he is liable to prosecution.  I suggest it is a simple thing which might be enshrined&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Derelict sites are used extensively for that, and, in fact, some sites have become derelict by reason of the Party propaganda which has been put up there.</P>
      <P>The last point I want to make is in relation to polling.  On the Continent, you frequently have polling day on a Sunday.  Here we have it on a weekday from 9 o'clock in the morning to 9 p.m., with the result that large sections of the working classes find it difficult to get to the polling stations. Nine o'clock in the morning is not early enough for them to get there before going to work and by the time their working day is over, and they have returned home, changed and had a meal, they may well find that at about 8.30 p.m. there is an enormous crowd at the polling booths.  I do not think the hours are good and I do not think offence would be taken by anybody if we had our polling day on a Sunday afternoon, say, from 12 noon until 10 o'clock at night.  That would facilitate voting, and I think we are in favour of voting and polling in this country.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I would plead with the Minister that we should make things easier not alone for blind voters but for all voters to cast their votes with open eyes, and with as full knowledge as they can have in relation to the candidates and their names and political affiliations on the ballot paper and so on.  We should also remove any unnecessary obstacles in the path of would-be candidates, and remove or lower the money test as a test of the fitness or otherwise of the candidate. I would plead, therefore for a second Bill which would make for even greater simplification and clarification of the code, and make it easier for both candidates and voters.</P>

      <P>This Bill, as Senators are aware, is a Bill based on the interim report of the Joint Committee and I should like to say that, in my opinion, as a member of that Joint Committee, the thanks which the Minister expressed are well deserved. I never had experience of a committee with such varying opinions which got down to the job in such a satisfactory manner and was able to get through its business as expeditiously as this Joint Committee has done.  The fact that we have an interim report, which forms the basis of this Bill, in such a short time since the Committee was established, is an indication that they are doing a satisfactory job and that they will continue to do that job until such time as they have finished the work given them to do within the terms of reference.</P>
      <P>This Bill, as the Minister explained, provides for certain things which must be brought into operation, if we are to achieve the desirable result of incorporating new names on the register which will come into operation on 15th April next&mdash;the names of those who will reach the age of 21 and who, but for this Bill, would not be entitled to a vote for two years more.  The fact that some 25,000 new young people will be given a vote as a consequence of this Bill is a most satisfactory outcome of the deliberations of the Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="431" /> I should like to point out also that, before the Committee met, the Minister for Local Government had already announced in the Dáil his decision to give the Garda Síochána the right to vote, and I should like to reassure Senator Sheehy Skeffington, and other members of the House who may have ideas on the same line, that the Committee has anticipated practically every suggestion the Senator made.</P>

      <P>And has, in fact, taken a decision&mdash;quite a number of them&mdash;which we hope to submit to the Government in a second interim report and which, we hope, will be implemented in the shortest possible time. Amongst those decisions, it might be of interest to Senators to know that we have given very careful consideration to the question of designating the political affiliations of a candidate on the ballot paper and the Senator need have no fears that this Committee is not taking into account every possible improvement that could be thought of by people experienced in regard to the electoral law.</P>
      <P>It is a very satisfactory Bill, but it is a limited Bill.  It has limited objectives. The next Bill, we hope, will go much further than this one and will clean up all the anomalies which exist in the Acts under which our elections were organised up to now.  It is a very heavy undertaking.  There is a lot of material to be read.  We have got&mdash;and I should like to say this publicly&mdash;the greatest possible assistance from the Department of Local Government and the officials who are dealing with us in regard to the reform of the electoral law.  The mass of material which we have got is certainly such as to require quite a lot of study to get an idea of all the little difficulties and the absurdities, too, which have crept into our existing electoral laws.</P>
      <P>I am quite satisfied, as a member of the Committee, that every effort is being made to do a really worthwhile job in presenting reports to the Minister which will enable a Bill or Bills to be framed that will make our electoral laws as foolproof as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the departure from <Col N="432" /> the recommendations of the Committee in this Bill, that is, in regard to blind voters, I find myself more or less inclined to agree that the Minister is taking the right line in the amendment. I should like Senators, however, to know that, when the organisation representing the blind made strong representations to the Minister contrary to the decision at which we had arrived, I think it was right and proper, since they were the parties directly interested, that he should accept those recommendations and embody them in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I entirely agree with the remarks which Senator Ó Maoláin made in his able <i>ex tempore</i> speech.  This is the end-product of the first of a series of deliberations of the Joint Committee. The Committee has been notable for its almost unanimity of views upon a wide variety of subjects.  The Minister has shown great promptitude&mdash; very commendable promptitude&mdash;in introducing, within such a short space of time, this Bill to implement, almost without exception, the recommendations of the Joint Committee.</P>
      <P>Apart from the Department of Local Government which gave the greatest assistance to the Committee in their deliberations, members of the public, too, submitted quite a number of observations and also members of the Oireachtas.  I should like to make this point.  It is not late yet for anybody, who has any ideas on the reforms that are necessary in the present electoral system, to submit these ideas to the Committee.  It is quite true to say that all the suggestions made are not just perfunctorily dealt with but are argued out at considerable length.  The result is that you have&mdash; and I think we are likely to have&mdash; another Bill upon which there will be almost complete unanimity.  The Joint Committee on Electoral Law held their meetings very frequently and the atmosphere was the kind of atmosphere that one would expect to find among people interested in elections and who know a great deal about the difficulties which voters and candidates are up against at the time of general elections.</P>

      <P>There is little, apart from what may have been said while I was absent, that really demands any comment from me, except to say, as has been said by a number of speakers, that it is not the matters that are in this Bill we really want to discuss, for the very good reason that this is but an instalment of the legislation we hope will be coming forward as a result of the deliberations of the Joint Committee on Electoral Law.</P>
      <P>I would put it even more clearly than that.  If I were to discuss the recommendations which I, as Minister, have had submitted to me and the recommendations which were submitted direct to the committee, I would probably take at least three hours.  The electoral laws have been under review in my Department for a considerable length of time, in very great detail, in advance of the decision to set up the Joint Committee. We were not just thinking of the interim report.  The investigations which have been made, have continued and will continue to be made in the future, and will be referred, for what they are worth, to the Joint Committee for their consideration and their ultimate recommendation to the Houses of the Oireachtas for implementation by me in further electoral Bills.</P>
      <P>It is natural, I suppose, that each person who rises to speak on this measure should discuss what is missing from it because each person un-doubtedly&mdash;we are all in politics and we are all interested in a political sense in these matters, and in a personal way&mdash;has his own personal views on several matters he feels should be remedied, changed, amended or deleted.  It is only natural that each person should observe what is not to his satisfaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we have said, this is really a first instalment of the new electoral laws.  We hope to deal with them in the not too distant future with the same expedition as the interim report was dealt with.  It is the intention of the Department and the Government to deal with the subsequent reports of the committee with the same expedition, if at all possible, because we know that the laws are very much out <Col N="434" /> of date.  They do not really conform with modern conditions in many respects, and we know that the sooner we get a clear electoral code suited to our every-day and present-day lives, the better for all concerned, and for democracy as it operates here.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, I am sure I will be excused if I do not even attempt to comment on some of the matters which were raised.  I again assure those who raised them that the matters dealt with in this Bill are undoubtedly being dealt with by the Joint Committee and will be fully dealt with in their deliberations in future.

      <P>The object of the Bill is to enable more effective action to be taken to secure the clearance and improvement of derelict sites.  The definition of this term in the Acquisition of Derelict Sites Act, 1940, is so restrictive that the majority of these eyesores are technically outside the scope of the Act or can be excluded by works which fall far short of the desirable clearance.  Another difficulty is that the Act of 1940 enables local authorities to secure the clearance of derelict sites only by acquisition or the threat of acquisition.</P>

    <P>The Bill proposes to repeal the 1940 Act and aims at securing voluntary clearance and improvement works. The scheme of grants, which has been introduced following the necessary financial provision by way of supplementary estimate, should greatly facilitate this approach to the problem and should go a long way to relieve any hardship which might be imposed <Col N="435" /> where the local authority have to invoke their powers to compel owners of sites to clear them.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that if the owner of a derelict site has given an undertaking to the local authority to clear the site and fails to carry out the undertaking, the local authority may do the work and recover their expenses from him, or may serve a notice under Section 3 formally requiring specified works to be carried out or may acquire the site.  The power to require works to be carried out is a new feature in legislation affecting derelict sites but the principle is long established in other codes such as the Housing and Sanitary Services Acts.  An appeal lies to the Minister for Local Government against any requisition under Section 3.</P>
    <P>A general power to acquire derelict sites compulsorily or by agreement is provided by Section 6.  It seems inevitable that somes cases will remain where acquisition will be the only satisfactory solution, namely, where the site is abandoned.  Compulsory acquisition will be by means of vesting order.</P>
    <P>A local authority proposing to acquire a derelict site compulsorily will be required to give adequate notice of such intention and the occupier or any person having an interest in the land may lodge an objection with the local authority within one month.  Where such objection has been made and is not withdrawn, Compulsory acquisition cannot be effected without the consent of the Minister.  The Minister is empowered under Section 8 to refuse consent if he considers that the local authority should adopt either of the alternative procedures provided under the Bill, namely, acceptance of an offer of voluntary clearance or requisition to carry out works.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections of this Bill are generally similar to provisions in the Act of 1940.  Compensation for derelict sites acquired compulsorily may, in default of agreement, be determined by arbitration.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>There is not a great deal in this Bill, but there are many derelict sites in this country.  I must say that I felt for a long time that they were matters that should be dealt with and I am glad that something is being done about them now.  There is no village or town in Ireland where there are not a number of eyesores in the form of derelict sites.  Apparently up to now, the definition of &ldquo;derelict site&rdquo; was not clear enough to enable anything to be done by the local authorities when owners refused to do anything, but I am glad that the whole question is to be tackled.</P>
      <P>Last year, I went on a motoring tour of the west of Ireland.  It was beautiful to motor along the main roads, but as soon as one came to what should be the pretty villages and towns, their good features were always overshadowed by the bad features of dilapidated buildings and derelict sites.</P>
      <P>I mentioned before in another context the question of derelict sites which are not being dealt with under this Bill&mdash;abbeys and churches from the Middle Ages.  I hope a Bill will come in some day under which those derelict sites will be dealt with.  Some people, I am sorry to say, seem to think that there is something aesthetic about an abbey or a church that has no roof on it so long as it is about 700 or 800 years old.  That, of course, is a mistaken idea which we should tackle very soon, but it is outside the scope of this Bill.</P>
      <P>There are not many points in this Bill, as I say, but its main object, which I think we all agree with, is the removal of those derelict sites.  There is then the question of dealing with them, which brings up the procedure under which these derelict sites will be dealt with.  Although I am a champion always of individual rights as against the intrusion of the State, a very fair attempt has been made in this Bill to give the individual every chance of putting his property in a decent condition before the State in the form of the county manager is entitled to go in under a compulsory order and deal with the site in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="437" /> I shall not go in detail into the procedure outlined in the Bill, but broadly the owner is given the opportunity to take action voluntarily or by a certain amount of persuasion, in the second case, and if he fails to do it voluntarily or by persuasion, then the authority can come in and take over the site under a compulsory acquisition order. There is also an appeal to the Minister. That is very fair procedure in dealing with owners of property that has been neglected or is falling down.</P>
    <P>On the question of the grant given in cases where work is to be done on these sites, I am not at all sure&mdash;and I mentioned this matter before&mdash;that £100 will go very far nowadays.  That, I think, is the maximum figure.  I suppose it is a start, and if it is found that a £100 grant is not enough, I hope the Minister will at some future date alter it to a more reasonable or bigger figure, if necessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in referring to these derelict sites in the Dáil, mentioned the factors to be considered in designating what is a derelict site, among them being questions of public health or amenities and safety.  I suppose amenities could include aesthetic considerations, because very often while such places may not be dangerous to public health or safety, they are certainly blots on our towns and villages.</P>
    <P>That is all one can say on this Bill &mdash;that the object is desirable and that the means of attaining the object seem to be reasonable, both as regards the owners and as regards the authorities. Therefore, I support the Bill.</P>

      <P>In the absence of any document in my hand, I am relying only on what the Minister said and I am not quite sure as to what is in this Bill.  I should like him to consider if anything can be done about semi-derelict sites in the country.  I am referring to buildings that have been injured by fire.  In the City of Cork, there are six such buildings burned to the ground floor.  They are roofed and made safe to satisfy the public authorities, but it appears that there is no power to compel the owners of such property to restore the buildings to their proper height and to restore the skyline of the street. <Col N="438" /> They are obvious disfigurements, and some power should be given to the local authority to ensure that where a building is half destroyed, it should be completely destroyed, removed or restored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In many ways, this is an excellent measure, but it is one which requires very close examination in Committee.  In examining it in Committee, we may help the Minister. I am not satisfied with the definition in Section 1.  I do not think it is sufficiently comprehensive to deal with the problem the Minister envisages. We can quite see that in the principal streets of most towns of Ireland, derelict sites may continue to exist because they will not be derelict sites within the meaning of the definition set out here.  There will be sites with the windows built up in the walls and left as disused rather than as derelict sites.  The Minister would be up against great difficulties if he had to proceed against anyone to have such a site cleared compulsorily.  The definition is not wide enough to bring in many types of unused sites, and to allow the local authority to acquire the site, in the first instance, and then to sell it to somebody who wishes to exploit it.</P>
      <P>What often happens in country towns is that people acquire sites adjacent to their premises for expansion. In those cases, all that should be required is that they will put them in such a state that they cannot be described as unsightly.  A building does not always need to have a roof to look well.  Sometimes it may be otherwise.  Some of our voluntary societies have made even sites that could, within the meaning of this Bill, be called derelict sites very slightly by growing flowers, creepers and shrubs on them.  In giving powers to the local authority, the Minister was very wise in making the provision he mentioned in the penultimate paragraph of his statement where he says that his consent will have to be received even if the owner of the site cannot be contacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGuire was right about the sum of £100.  It sounds a nice round figure.  It might be a considerable <Col N="439" /> amount in one of our small villages but there are sites in our urban and county boroughs and £100 would have no significance whatsoever. The Minister might consider making available a sum bearing some relation to the valuation on the building that previously occupied a site. The size of the building which occupied a site on a previous occasion might bear some relation to the value of the site.  We should all examine this Bill very carefully, particularly those of us who have had any experience in those affairs and in the difficulties that are likely to arise in dealing with the problem.  This has been a most desirable move by the Minister. I feel he will have the wholehearted support of all sections of the community in trying to make this an ideal piece of legislation that will help to inspire local pride so that no unsightly derelict sites will be allowed to remain in our cities, towns and villages.</P>
    <P>In the powers that will be given to him under this measure, the Minister ought to encourage the local authority to build dwelling houses on many of these small sites.  Some of the regulations of his Department with regard to garden space precluded the local authority from building houses on such sites even when they could be acquired voluntarily.  The local authorities were not interested in them because they were informed by the officials of the Minister's Department that no sanction would be granted because they did not meet the 1960 requirements. Great good could be done if the requirements and the site were looked at in a realistic way and considered sympathetically.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>The House knows that the purpose of the Bill is to enable grants to be paid towards the cost of clearing derelict sites.  The House is well aware of the problem of the sites so described in this Bill.  The House is also aware of the spectacle presented to travellers throughout the country of fallen-down walls and houses, together with refuse dumps, created mainly because there has been no direct way of dealing with the matter up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="440" /> The increase in road traffic has brought the ugly aspects of this problem home to us.  The facts are fastened in one's mind through seeing new housing schemes and other works interspersed with old buildings sticking up like bad teeth here and there throughout the country and spoiling the whole effect of improvements often undertaken at great cost to the community.  The Bill will help to sharpen the senses of those engaged in and responsible for building schemes and other development work.  I am glad the Minister has indicated in introducing this Bill elsewhere, that it is but an instalment of a proper planning system to improve the appearance of town and country.  The Bill makes provision for grants of roughly half the cost of works undertaken under it up to a maximum of £100.  I think that that is a good provision.  It is an incentive towards acquiring and disposing of derelict structures which constitute an ugly problem.</P>
    <P>This Bill is much wider in scope than previous legislation on this matter and takes in works which hitherto could not be dealt with in any rational manner.  The acquisition of Derelict Sites Act, 1940, cramped initiative in this regard and more or less succeeded in choking comment on this important matter.  It restricted and hamstrung local authorities and development societies in dealing with those scars on the landscape and prevented useful action from being taken where action was very necessary at times.  Therefore, it is a good step to repeal the Act of 1940, or at any rate to repeal some of its provisions, and substitute a Bill such as this which will enable local authorities and others dealing with this matter to take direct action, if necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I want briefly to support this Bill.  I said something along these lines the other day on another Bill.  It was gratifying to find that the Minister also felt very strongly in favour of taking action and allowing local authorities to take action to clear up some of the disgraceful derelict sites in our towns and villages.  Being a Dubliner, I am most <Col N="441" /> conscious of the derelict sites in Dublin. I am astonished at their extent. If one were to print a map of Dublin and to mark, in a single colour, the derelict sites one would be astonished at the amount of what, theoretically, is the most valuable building land in the city that has been allowed to go derelict.</P>
      <P>Senator Ó Maoláin suggested that derelict sites are now largely display areas for derelict Party promises from the last election.  Of course these may have been things fresh and beautiful when first produced but I think it is high time they were removed with the rest of the site.  It is possible that some of our local legislation is responsible for the derelict nature of some of the sites.  As I understand it, a building which has no roof on it is not liable for rates.  I may be wrong in that.  I understand if you take a roof off a building or a shed you do not have to pay rates.  I suggest that many of our derelict sites in Dublin have been caused by a realisation of that fact.</P>
      <P>I see one such site on my way home, at the corner of South King Street, beside Kennedy's Bakery and opposite Mercer's Hospital.  I think of it as a typical derelict site and I find it quite inexplicable that such a valuable site should be left as it is.  There is no roof on it and it is surrounded by corrugated iron and bits of wood.  I cannot help wondering whether it is not due to the fact that the Corporation in their wisdom said: &ldquo;We are going to acquire this site for road widening&rdquo; and the owners said: &ldquo;In that case, we cannot do anything with it&rdquo;, and the site has been left, partly owing to the slowness of the local authority.  In relation to the particular site I have mentioned, that of course is pure guesswork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is true that some of the derelict sites owe their derelict nature to the dilatoriness of the local authority who say: &ldquo;Some day, we are going to do something with it&rdquo; and obviously there is no point in the owner developing it.  I also suggested on another occasion that it might be well to consider legislation which would allow for the rating of site values rather than of what is on the <Col N="442" /> site.  I believe if that could be considered in future legislation, it might well have the effect of forcing owners who are compelled to pay rates on a full rate on a building site to develop it in order to get some of their money back.</P>
    <P>The question is whether the local authorities will use these most valuable powers when they are given them?  I hope they will; the Minister hopes they will; but some local authorities are a little like derelict sites&mdash;practically immovable and unchangeable.  I do not say that in any offensive way but look at the speed with which they use their valuable powers on some occasions.  I feel they are too slow and I hope that any publicity given to what is expressed in the Oireachtas about that point may compel the local authorities to use these valuable powers.  After all, if they are not used, they are useless.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte has initiated competitions between towns and villages for the best kept town or village and they have had an immense effect not only on the winning villages but on the villages competing.  If you go through the country, you can see the effects and An Tóstal had the same effect. There is plenty more to be done, although quite a lot has been achieved. Bord Fáilte might take the opportunity to draw the attention of the local authorities to the powers vested in them in this Bill and possibly suggest lines on which certain specific derelict sites might be developed in particular towns and villages, and also perhaps in this city.  Many of these could become attractive corners of the city if they were planted and turned into small gardens, as is done, for instance, in most of the British cities which suffered bomb damage.  One can see it all over London today.</P>
    <P>My final point is in regard to compensation. Under Section 11, the owner of the site is to be compensated. All this is laid out in various other Acts, as to the basis under which compensation will be given, but what is the value of a derelict site?  I should be very tempted to say it has no value.  The owner has not been making any use of it; he has not been <Col N="443" /> paying rates.  To whom has it value? If, we are told, it is in a built-up area, its value is £1,000 an acre or £1,500 an acre and presumably the compensation will then have to be given in relation to the market value of that land, if it is building land, although it is not being used or developed and may have been derelict.  I feel that kind of compensation is out of all proportion to the use being made of the site by the owner.  I should be inclined to say if you are prepared to calculate that such sites have a value which is related to the building value of the land, there might be some kind of retrospective rates and income tax collected out of the compensation which is given on the basis of such value for the site.  I should like to hear the Minister's opinion as to the equity of compensating in extravagant terms owners of neglected derelict sites.  Otherwise, I welcome the Bill and terminate my remarks with an expression of the hope that the local authorities will use the powers given them to the full.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of the Derelict Sites Bill must be welcomed by everybody who takes pride in the appearance of our country.  I hope the local authorities will take advantage of its terms to give the country, especially in the villages and towns, a very much needed face-lift. Derelict sites, crumbling masonry and accumulations of dirt and rubbish have almost become part of the Irish landscape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1954, when speaking on the Tourist Traffic Bill, I drew attention to the depressing effect on tourists of these derelict buildings.  I had just returned from an important tourist centre and I had been depressed by the view of crumbling buildings and broken roofs from the hotel windows. I said on that occasion that a visitor from abroad might have been excused for thinking that Ireland had suffered very greatly from bombing and had not yet got around to clearing up the damage.  Every person visiting our well-known beauty spots in Wicklow and elsewhere and going from Dublin passes through village after village <Col N="444" /> where derelict sites abound.  These sites have been there for years and each succeeding year sees them becoming more depressing, with increasing deterioration and ugliness, which is bound to have a most depressing effect on tourists.  Tourists in the main, tour for enjoyment and our propaganda invites them to enjoy the beauties of Ireland, but we dull their enjoyment by presenting to them these signs of neglect and decay which I regret to say will be found in practically every Irish village.</P>
    <P>If this Bill succeeds in getting the local authorities or private persons to clear up these eyesores, a valuable service will be rendered to the inhabitants of the towns as well as to the tourists whom we hope to attract and also the people who might be looking for places in which to set up industries. It will assure them that Ireland is not a decaying curiosity but in fact is a live and progressive country, with intelligent hard working people, a place where such industrialists might be justified in setting up concerns and where they could recruit intelligent energetic workers, a feeling which is not likely to be engendered when they see a population tolerating the sight of these derelict buildings which are a danger to the life and health of the inhabitants.</P>
    <P>When the sites are either taken over by local authorities or an offer accepted to carry out the work, there should be no undue delay in getting the improvement work completed. The longer these horrors exist, the more visiting people will see them and the more damage will be done to our reputation as a progressive nation. Where a certain amount of delay is inevitable, steps should be taken, as Senator Sheehy Skeffington said, to maintain these sites in a tidy and picturesque fashion.  Flowers of a quick growing annual variety could be sown to cover a site in the waiting period.  This need not entail any great expense and indeed the sites could be kept in a neat fashion by school children who would get a very valuable lesson in civics.</P>
    <P>Shortly after the end of the war, I had occasion to visit the badly <Col N="445" /> bombed city of Portsmouth and the adjoining seaside resort of Southsea. Every bombed site around those places&mdash;and there were unfortunately very many of them; they abounded everywhere&mdash;was a blaze of colour where the local authorities and private persons had planted flowers. Even in bits of basements where absolutely nothing was left, there were beautiful gardens.  In fact, in every nook and cranny where soil could be sprinkled, a garden had sprung up and I am sure that the effect on the population was very beneficial, helped them to overcome the tragedies through which they had lived and gave them courage to build up so quickly the magnificent city that Portsmouth is today.</P>
    <P>As well as clearing up derelict sites, something should be done to prevent more sites from becoming derelict.  I am speaking on the line which Senator Sheehy Skeffington took.  I suppose if a person feels that a particular building has ceased to be of any use to him or sees going cheaply a building which in future years might be of value to him, he might, not wanting to make a bad bargain by having to pay rates in the interval, just take the roof off.  The building therefore becomes a derelict site on which he has not to pay any rates.  I should like to have seen in this Bill a provision whereby local authorities would ensure in a case like this that at least part of the valuation of the former building would be transferred to the ground site.  This would prevent a new crop of eyesores springing up throughout the country.  If these buildings had to be maintained in reasonable order and rates paid on them, it would certainly put an end to a new crop of derelict sites.</P>
    <P>I would again like to say that I welcome the Bill and I hope that its implementation will clear away the old familiar eyesores so that we can show a brighter face to our people and to our tourists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very necessary Bill and its general intention is entirely praiseworthy.  All of us have been annoyed from time to time, and I suppose indeed are continually annoyed, <Col N="446" /> when travelling through the country by having to look at a variety of building sites in a dilapidated condition or presenting an unseemly appearance to the countryside.  I have in mind not so far away from Dublin &mdash;and it always surprises me that you have this kind of thing coming into the capital city &mdash; one field which is covered with nothing but worn-out motor-cars and rusted chassis.  It struck me as incorrect that an individual should be entitled to inflict that kind of sight upon the eyes of people coming into the capital city of the country.</P>
      <P>It is not only private individuals alone, I must say, who are responsible for unsightly sites&mdash;I think that was the phrase used&mdash;around our cities and towns.  I have in mind a local authority &mdash;I do not want to mention it by name &mdash;responsible for an old country hospital. That old county hospital constantly fell from one state of decay to another and eventually the local authority demolished it to a height of about 12 feet and then proceeded to put into the site of the former infirmary all classes of disused road machinery. They are just rusting away and a stream of rust is flowing out on to the public street at the present time.  The crime of it all is that this site which is now a county council yard, housing rusted, useless road machinery, is on a magnificent green in the capital town of the county in question.</P>
      <P>I do not see anything in this Bill to prevent local authorities from doing things of that kind.  Though there were protests from various people about this transformation of a magnificent site in the most beautiful part of a county town into an old yard for rotting machinery, nothing was done.  Now, I suppose, we have the position where one local authority may be able to proceed against another for creating and maintaining derelict sites.  I wonder indeed, when the local authority itself is the cause of creating a derelict site, whether any power is vested in any citizen to take action against the local authority in the same way as the authority can take action against a private individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Senator Miss Davidson's <Col N="447" /> contribution was most apt and indeed showed the benefit of having a lady Senator in the House.  I entirely agree and support her suggestion for beautifying, or at any rate making less objectionable, these derelict sites, once they have been taken over by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>I am not at all certain as to whether this definition is satisfactory and I should like to ask the Minister about paragraph (a) of the definition of a derelict site.  Does a cow-byre or some such building on a farm which is not a dwelling and is in an unpresentable condition come within the definition of &ldquo;derelict site&rdquo; in paragraph (a)? To me, it does not appear to come within that definition and I do not know that it comes within the definition of &ldquo;derelict site&rdquo; in paragraph (b).</P>
    <P>As regards rural Ireland, particularly during the past three or four years, this question of what is a derelict site will become more important. As we all know, whole families have been fleeing farms in rural Ireland.  It takes only a very few years for a dwelling house and out-offices to fall into the condition described as a &ldquo;derelict site&rdquo;.  A lot of these people may, in fact, return in better times.  I know quite a number of farms where the key has been turned in the door and the owners have gone.  After a year or two, these houses fall into a state of dilapidation.  Anybody who has had experience of appearing before the Land Commission Court knows that a number of people go abroad for a few years to earn sufficient money to enable them to return and stock their farms properly and, perhaps, build a new house and settle down again on the old family farm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking about the definition of &ldquo;derelict site&rdquo; in Section 1 of the Bill and, as I say, I am not satisfied as to whether an out-office on a farm which is not being used by reason of the owner having emigrated, or indeed a farmhouse which is left unoccupied for a period and could fall into a dilapidated condition, become <Col N="448" /> a ruin and appear to be dangerous, comes within that definition.  I want to ensure that, if the owner left his land because of economic circumstances, with the intention of returning, there is no possibility that the local authority can demolish the farmhouse or the out-offices associated with it.  I am not at all satisfied that the rural population may not be subjected to the attentions of the local authorities under the definition as set out in Section 1.</P>
      <P>There is another matter in Section 5 to which I wish to refer.  I want to preface my remarks by saying that when I refer to the authority which is being vested in officials rather than in the courts, I do not do so simply because I happen to make my livelihood by appearing in court.  That kind of sneer, or jeer, or gibe, or remark, can come too easily from people who want to make little of the point that has been made.  I regard the courts as one of the important institutions of the State, and when they can be properly used, they should be used.</P>
      <P>Having made that remark, I want to refer to Section 5, which provides for an appeal by the owner of the site which the local authority considers derelict and in relation to which it proposes to take action against the owner.</P>
      <P>Section 5 provides an appeal in these circumstances by the aggrieved person from a decision of the local authority. The appeal is to the Minister for Local Government, and I consider an appeal by a local authority to the Minister for Local Government, metaphorically speaking, as going to court with the Devil in Hell, because the Minister for Local Government is a person who has to co-operate with local authorities.</P>

      <P>In any event, to get down to the reality of the situation, when we put into an enactment here that there is an appeal to the Minister for Local Government, that is not an appeal that is directed to and considered by the Minister for Local Government who is the political head of the Department. As we all know, it is considered by an official of the Minister, and if we want to delegate authority to officials of the Minister, let us do that as clearly as we did in the Social Welfare Act, where certain matters are left to deciding officers.</P>
      <P>I recollect that when I was an officer of the Revenue Commissioners in the Estate Duty Branch, I frequently wrote letters saying: &ldquo;I am directed by the Revenue Commissioners to communicate with you and to point out that you have become immediately liable to pay estate duty, and unless you deliver the amount and pay the duty immediately, proceedings will be taken against you which may lead to your detention and imprisonment.&rdquo; The unfortunate person who got that notice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Then we shall say that the Minister for Local Government will vicariously decide all these appeals, and I am not satisfied, and I do not think the House should be satisfied, with a vicarious decision by the Minister on appeals under a section like this.  I am not satisfied at all that the only remedy we ought to give the owner of a derelict site in this legislation is an appeal vicariously to the Minister.  I do not think these vicarious appeals are worth anything in practice.  On the contrary, I want to point out this.  There is constant complaint about the growing size and the growing cost of the public service. Resolutions are passed by various bodies calling for a reduction in the size of the public service and for a reduction in its cost.  The latest variation on that theme is for a decentralisation of the public services. The Minister for Lands indicated recently he proposes to decentralise parts of the Civil Service to rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What does a section like Section 5 mean?  It means that more and more duties are to be discharged vicariously by the Minister for Local Government and this vicarious discharge by the Minister for Local Government means an increase in the number of public servants and an increase in the <Col N="451" /> cost of the public service, while at the same time we have an institution admirably adapted to taking decisions of this kind: I refer to the district court.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister for Local Government or anybody else say why the district court, of which there are quite a number and which cannot be said by any standards to be over-worked, is not better fitted to decide matters between a local authority and the individual than a Minister?  It seems more in accordance with the principle of justice, with the principle that no man should be judge in his own case, that the matter should be decided not by the Minister, who is an extension of the local authority, but by the district court which is completely impartial.</P>
    <P>I do not know what rules or regulations will be laid down, if any.  That is a matter which will come up on Committee Stage, presumably after Christmas.  If a letter is sent by somebody to the Minister for Local Government and a reply is issued saying, in effect: &ldquo;The Minister has considered your appeal but is of opinion that the local authority are entitled in the circumstances to proceed with the acquisition of this site,&rdquo; I submit that that is not the kind of thing we ought to have in legislation of this kind and I do not think it is the kind of thing this House should approve of.</P>
    <P>I should like to know why the Minister adopts in this piece of legislation something that will increase the volume of work in his Department when there are other institutions of State lying idle which could better discharge the duty under the Bill.  Having said that, I want to make clear that I think this Bill is admirable in its purpose and intention. I quarrel with the means adopted to achieve its purpose and to effect its intention.  I trust that on Committee Stage, we shall have an opportunity of ensuring that as far as the rural population is concerned, this piece of legislation will not and cannot be used by local authorities to cause hardship to them.  I trust the Minister will see the point of the argument I have been making that another organ of State ought <Col N="452" /> to be brought into full operation for the purpose of appeals against decisions made or notices served under Section 3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Louis Walsh Mr. Louis Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Louis Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike Senator O'Quigley, I consider that the provisions of this Bill are admirable.  It is much more expeditious to have an appeal to the Minister rather than an appeal to the district court.  I have had experience of appeals to the Minister under the Town Planning Acts on a number of occasions.  I have been very satisfied with the way in which such appeals were dealt with and with the consideration given to them by the appeals officer.  The position is that a letter is written to the Minister and the facts of the appeal are set out.  That information is then submitted to the local authority.  An inspector from the Department of Local Government visits the site and satisfies himself on whether or not the appeal should be granted. Then he submits the evidence, or his report, to the Minister who is the final arbiter in the matter.</P>
      <P>Last night, Senator O'Quigley suggested, on the Transport Bill, that litigation is expensive.  I feel if the appeal were brought to the district court, it would mean that expert advice would have to be produced by both parties and that the district justice would not be qualified to judge and in fact might have to inspect the site.  Normally, the district court does not adjourn to inspect a site and the district justice is not qualified in the way that the inspector of the Department of Local Government is qualified to deal with the matter.  For that reason, I consider that it is cheaper from all angles to allow the inspector from the Department to deal with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is very good in the sense that there is an inducement rather than a compulsion, under Section 3 of the Bill, and I feel in consequence that considerable progress will be made by local authorities in carrying out what we all hope will be the clearing up as far as possible of these derelict sites. Senators have referred to the question of valuation and rates on derelict sites but the House should be aware that until such time as the valuation <Col N="453" /> is removed by the Valuation Office, the rated occupier will be liable for rates.  An application must be made to the Valuation Office to have a revision of the valuation before the rates will be taken off, even though the roof may be removed from the building.  Just because the roof is taken off, the building is not free of rates.  The manager has not got very much discretion and he must charge the rate until such time as proof is given that the building cannot be let.  It is not so easy to prove that, even though the premises are unoccupied or part of the roof is taken off.</P>
    <P>There are one or two matters I should like the Minister to refer to. One is the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo;.  I am not sure that the definition is wide enough to cover a person who has a life estate.  It refers to an owner who has a fee simple interest and to an owner with a leasehold interest but there are cases of people who are life tenants and the remainder man may be a child and in that case the notice which is required to be served on the owner may not be practicable and the person who is the life tenant may not be entitled to the notice.  There may not be much in the point but it is a matter which should be looked into.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the question of an offer by the occupier. It states that the occupier can make an offer and the local authority can accept that offer, but it does not say that the offer should be in writing. Unless the offer is in writing, there would be no documentary evidence of the fact that the tenant or occupier was prepared to carry out his undertaking. I imagine for all practical purposes the local authority would expect the offer to be in writing but it would be better to ensure that that was actually done.</P>
    <P>I also wonder whether or not in the case of an appeal and where the Minister has decided to uphold the appeal, the local authority has any right under Section 4 of the City and County Management Act to rescind the order the county manager makes.  Would the local authority be entitled to do that before the Minister has made his decision? <Col N="454" /> The local authority, for instance, may not be aware of the matter until such time as the Minister has given his decision because this Bill is really a function of the manager rather than of the local authority.  In that respect, Senators have referred to the fact that local authorities have not been as active as they might be in dealing with derelict sites in the past, but the reflection may lie to a considerable extent on the manager and the county engineer rather than on the members of the local authority as such.  At any rate, I am very glad the Bill has been introduced and I feel considerable progress will be made by local authorities in dealing with these derelict sites which we have in so many parts of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome any effort to deal with the problem of derelict sites throughout the country and in our cities, towns and villages, but I am worried as to whether the course set out in this Bill and in the previous Bill is really the proper long term solution to the problem.  I agree that what is proposed here is all right for dealing with the present situation but I am concerned as to the position which would arise in the future, with the assistance that is being provided to people to deal with their own derelict sites.  It seems to me that with the assistance about which the Minister spoke in the Dail, the £100 grant, there seems to be an inducement to the owners of property to allow that property to get into a bad state of repair in order to qualify for this grant.  With such people I think the more just approach would be rather a penal approach, that there should be some system of heavier rating on the owners of derelict sites so that they would be encouraged by that sort of pressure to remove the eyesores and deal with them rather than leave them until they qualify for the grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the only aspect of the Bill about which I would be concerned.  I do not think it is good or proper that the ordinary ratepayer should have to provide money as a grant to the owners of derelict sites.  In many <Col N="455" /> cases, the money might be better used and if it could be done, I think a better way would be to give a financial inducement, by a penal rating to compel the people who own these sites to clear them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Any person who is interested in the appearance of the country must certainly, through time, be very concerned about it.  I looked up the date of the last Derelict Sites Act.  I see that it is the 1940 Act which is to be repealed.  Could I say that there is altogether too much regard for real property in the whole thing?  I suspect, of course, that this kind of thing comes about from the long complex code of law in the Department of Local Government.  It would be far better if the Department could get away from that complex code of law and realise that real property is not at all the valuable thing it was long ago, that there are other ways a man can make a living nowadays and that income is more important than real property.  After all, the fact is that the services of any person on a contract of service can be terminated on the end of that contract by giving notice and that is more important nowadays than acquiring a chunk of derelict land.</P>
      <P>I am not saying that it is not a good effort.  I am not capable of judging whether it is or not, but certainly the last effort was most unsuccessful. I know a village on the road from Dublin to Cork.  You pass through this long village&mdash;I do not recollect its name and that is just as well, perhaps&mdash;but really it is a desecration of the countryside.  In that village, there are at very least a hundred buildings derelict.  We have all heard stories about the well-known city in the west, about the first World War and the submarine captain who came in to shell it.  I understand it is much better now, or so I am told, but certainly in the Thirties, it was in a dreadful condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether there is any other way of tackling this problem.  I see such things as vesting orders in Section 9.  The land shall be vested in the local authority.  If a man buys a <Col N="456" /> farm under the Land Purchase Acts, I understand why it should be vested, but, mind you, many men have bought farms and for many a long year, the farms were not vested in them.  It did not do any great harm&mdash;not that I approve.  I think the efforts of the late Deputy Moylan when he was Minister for lands were of great benefit to the country.  He turned a large part of his staff over from land acquisition and division to vesting land which had been purchased and left over.  The game was to list all the easy cases, thousands of them, and when a snag turned up, put that one by and build up hundreds of thousands of them, not ten or fifteen but a couple of hundred thousand.  The late Deputy Moylan&mdash;I give him all credit for it&mdash; in 1947, proceeded to deal with the problem and all of them have been polished off now, difficulties and all.</P>
    <P>I may be thoroughly wrong in this, but you are dealing with a piece of property which has land valuation so low that the owner is not using it at all or, alternatively, he is a kind of speculator, a shrewd person, who is sitting on it in the hope that the local corporation will acquire it.  Then what is worth nought one year is inclined to have two more noughts added plus a one in front, so that one plus 0 0 0 is the value of something worth nought, from the income point of view.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill will be a success.  I really genuinely hope that and I take it that the Department, having experience of the previous Act, know the difficulties of the problem.  One thing used to appal me about the previous Act: when Dublin Corporation made an effort to put it into operation we saw the enormous notices in the newspaper literally costing pounds&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>When you scanned these notices, you found they were for four perches or something like one perch five yards sometimes and you had these enormous notices.  When you have a grave problem, a very serious problem, I suppose you have to tackle <Col N="457" /> it gradually, piecemeal, but if this Bill fails for any reason to achieve what we all want to see, the clearing off, the railing off or fencing off of these sites, then I would hope that the Department of Local Government would forget their ancient real property legal approach to the problem and deal with it by the direct method.  That sounds very much like a reversal of things I sometimes say, that we tend to give managers too much power, but if you have a grave social evil&mdash;and this is a social evil of a sort in the community &mdash;I would like to see the Department adopting a much more radical approach to the problem but I wish the Minister and the Department well with it.</P>

      <P>The general approach to the Derelict Sites Bill here tonight seems to show the keen appreciation by members of the need for such a measure and I think it can be said that the Bill was quite warmly welcomed. That, I think, was the mind expressed in the other House before it came here and this can be regarded as a very good omen for the advances which we hope the Bill will make on this ever present and pressing problem of unsightly and derelict sites throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Many and varied matters have been raised in connection with the Bill. Some of them&mdash;in fact, quite a few of them&mdash;might indeed well be dealt with more appropriately on the next stage. However, as Senators have raised them on the Second Stage, I presume it would be rather churlish of me if I did not advert in some way to them so that the House may have the official view before discussing them in greater detail on Committee Stage, as Senators undoubtedly will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGuire mentioned a point which I think I should clear right away about the maximum grant of £100 being, generally speaking, too low.  I should say here and now that the grants, or the grants scheme as such, are not a part of this Bill in any way.  That scheme is not subject to the passage of this enactment and while the lack of this enactment would undoubtedly be a grave <Col N="458" /> discouragement to the usefulness of the scheme, nevertheless, the scheme is a separate and distinct operation.  For that reason, while it does not come within the Bill, I would say to those Senators who have raised points about the inadequacy or otherwise of these grants that we will not be tied to the scheme as such.  The scheme is pretty generous and, in my opinion, it will be found to be so when it is applied, but if we find from experience that changes in the limits, minimum or maximum, are called for, then we will consider it.  We will not need legislation to change it.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that if the intentions of the House prove difficult to achieve without some change in the scheme, then, subject to the good graces of the Minister for Finance and the Government in general, I shall have no hesitation in looking for such changes as may show themselves necessary from experience.  I am satisfied at this stage, however, that the scheme, as outlined, is certainly a big advance and should make a big impression, with the full cooperation of all concerned, in the near future.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire also mentioned that voluntary clearance was being encouraged in this Bill by the terms of the scheme of grants.  Voluntary effort is without doubt the primary object of this Derelict Sites Bill.  I think it would be well that it should be regarded in this context rather than in the compulsory context in which it was discussed by some speakers here to-night.  Compulsion is not the primary method of operating under this Bill.  Rather is it relegated to a secondary position and, indeed, compulsion in regard to acquisition will arise only in some rare cases and will operate, in the main, only as a last resort.  The whole emphasis is on the voluntary removal of these unsightly or unhealthy sites which abound throughout the countryside, in towns and cities.  Voluntary effort is further encouraged by the scheme of grants which has already been introduced.</P>
    <P>Senator Barry mentioned buildings which, through fire or some such <Col N="459" /> hazard, have suddenly become &ldquo;semi-derelict.&rdquo; We are talking about derelict sites and if it is a question of semi-derelict, I do not think the site can be said to be derelict.  If such a condition as semi-derelict were to arise, I think it would not be properly dealt with under the Derelict Sites Bill at all.  Possibly he had something further in mind.</P>
    <P>He may have had in mind the type of problem to which Senator Burke referred, the broken-down house with windows built up.  The line to be drawn as to what is or what is not, or what constitutes or what does not constitute, a derelict site is difficult to define.  Each case will have to be looked at individually.  All the surrounding circumstances will have to be brought into consideration.  If we try to define too closely what is a derelict site, there are dangers.</P>
    <P>The fears expressed by two Senators that some eyesores would escape attention are not justified. There were those who expressed the fear that we might, indeed, have made the definition too wide.  We must use our commonsense and must adopt a reasonable approach to these matters. It is all too easy, no matter what stand you make on a measure like this, to pick holes in it which are not so readily filled by counter-arguments.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke also mentioned that the definition in Section 1 was not strong enough.  The definition was chosen in its present form with great care.  It was revised on several occasions before it finally emerged as the House sees it in this Bill.  I believe we got a definition which was pretty all-embracing and that there will not be the obvious escape routes which existed to the detriment of the 1940 Act, which fell practically into disuse, due to the lack of an all-embracing definition.  I can assure Senator Burke that there is no lack of strength in the definition.</P>
    <P>A point was made about the building of houses on sites which will come to be cleared under the operations of this Bill.  Senator Burke made the point that no effort was made because of the uncooperative approach of the <Col N="460" /> Department in their adherence to certain standards.  There may be a certain grain of truth in that, but, on the other hand, there is very little point in spending public money on a scheme such as this to clear up derelict sites, if in their place we are to build in a manner contrary to good building practice and to the general standards the Department apply throughout the country.  It is against that background that we must look at the difficulties which seem to have been made by the Department of Local Government for local authorities who may have wished to build houses on certain sites.  If there are such individual cases in the future, there should be no hesitation on the part of the local authority in making the case that in a particular set of circumstances, it would serve the common weal in a more advantageous way, if the regulations of the Department were departed from.  I can only say it will be examined sympathetically. We have to have a common line somewhere but that does not say that circumstances cannot alter the line for the benefit of the common good.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington raised&mdash; I was going to say he raised the roof but it is in fact a case of no roof&mdash; the question of &ldquo;no roof, no rates&rdquo; and said that we were helping to create these unsightly buildings without roofs.  I agree with him in the main that they can scarcely be said to enhance the appearance of any locality, town or village.</P>
    <P>The question of removing the roof has been dealt with to some degree by Senator Walsh who explained the situation in regard to the procedure which must be followed in order to relieve oneself of rates in respect of such buildings.  It is not sufficient to take the roof off.  The rates will not automatically disappear.  There is a further procedure to be gone through.  The hereditament must be removed from the valuation lists and become non-rateable. If we were to have some change in that direction, I would not go so far as to say that was the immediate benefit.  No such remedy would be readily available under any heading for a roofless building.  Nevertheless, if that point is worth following, <Col N="461" /> it would have to be followed through the Valuation Office, through the Minister for Finance and the Valuation code rather than by way of any action which I could take as Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>Fears have been expressed by several Senators, and indeed by a few Deputies, that the measure now before the House may not in fact be utilised fully by the local authorities. In so far as that is concerned, a circular has been sent to the local authorities and we have asked them to make an effort to encourage the use of the grants and in every way to try to make the whole scheme general throughout the country so that we can have a uniform approach rather than have isolated efforts in one place and no efforts at all in another.</P>
    <P>We shall be writing further to the local authorities, if and when this measure becomes law.  We have already issued a circular relating to the grants scheme to national voluntary organisations such as the N.F.A., the I.C.A., Macra na Feirme and Bord Fáilte.  Bord Fáilte have been asked to get in touch with local development committees to encourage them to participate as organisations to get the clearance work done and to give them every encouragement.</P>
    <P>I have appealed and will appeal again to the county councils and to the various local authorities and in so far as getting it across to them is concerned, I have not been remiss in that respect.  A further circular will be sent to the local authorities and I might say it will wind up with a special appeal to them to look after an item that has been mentioned here also, that is, that they themselves should clean up their own houses, where necessary.  If there are any of these unsightly or injurious buildings in their functional areas, I will ask them to pay particular attention to cleaning them up as well as getting after the private owner in their areas.</P>
    <P>In the main, I think there will be no difficulty whatsoever in that direction. Generally speaking, the local authorities will welcome this measure and particularly will they welcome the <Col N="462" /> fact that grants are now available which will to some degree in their case, as in the case of a private owner, go part of the way, at any rate, to meet the costs which may be incurred in doing this useful work.  I have not only written asking them to push on with this clearance work but I have also specially reminded them to set a good example themselves in regard to their own property.  That would be a very good first step and would certainly bear much fruit.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington also raised a question which came under review in Section 11.  He wished to know the manner in which the value of the site would be computed.  He thought it might be computed in an unduly advantageous way to the neglectful owner in a case where land or a site had to be acquired from him because of his neglect.  In fact the compensation will be the market value of the cleared site, less the cost of clearance which falls on the council. It is true that may, in some cases, be over-generous, but, on the other hand, no one stands to lose.  It is true that the neglectful owner may stand to gain, by virtue of having the site acquired and cleared and the value less the cost of clearance handed to him more or less as a present.</P>
    <P>We must have regard even in its neglected state to the potential market value of that land.  Before the clearance, the site must have been worth approximately the entire total value less the cost of clearance.  The owner of the neglected site will get no more as a result of the operations under this Bill than the cleared site would be worth, less clearance.  If we were to regard it at its value before it was cleared, we might create hardship and it might not be in the compass of the owner to do anything about it, due to economic circumstances.</P>
    <P>As I say, in the last analysis, no one will lose by this provision.  The neglectful owner may in fact get some money from it which he otherwise might not because it might be some considerable time until a buyer came along to buy it.  It is better that we should be fair and that we should <Col N="463" /> err on the generous side, rather than that there should be the off-chance we might inflict an injury or loss on some unsuspecting individual who may have let the site become neglected through no fault of his own.</P>
    <P>Senator Miss Davidson, in very generous and general terms, welcomed the Bill and hoped that it would work and that it would clear up all the various unsightly buildings and unsightly and injurious sites throughout the country.  She went on to develop a very sound idea which, indeed, we have not neglected, that where these small and, from a commercial point of view, useless sites are cleared, mere clearance alone may relieve them only of their ill-appearance for a short time, and that it would be far better that there should be some way of getting them planted and beautified by flowers, shrubs, or merely by grassing.</P>
    <P>This scheme of grants is not appropriate to the Bill, but I must crave the indulgence of the House to answer the Senator.  It is possible under this scheme to get a grant for the clearance of a particular site and, if necessary, to do just what Senator Miss Davidson, has asked.  It was with that in mind that we were looking to the voluntary development associations throughout the country who might find themselves in a position to acquire practically useless but derelict sites in their towns and villages, and having acquired them to clear and develop them, with, possibly, their own labour and their own money, so that they will not just fall back into the state from which they had taken them.</P>
    <P>I hope that those organisations throughout the country will take this to heart and will be very active in regard to these small and commercially useless sites which should beautify rather than disfigure, as they now do, our towns and villages and our countryside in general.  I believe that very much can be done and I hope that it will be done under the grants scheme by the grassing down of these sites and the planting of shrubs and flowers on them.</P>
    <P>Senator Miss Davidson also mentioned the transfer of half the valuation <Col N="464" /> of the building on to the actual site.  This again comes into the same category as the point raised by Senator Sheehy Skeffington in that it is rather outside my jurisdiction, and one which could be referred to the Department of Finance and the Valuation Office.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley had quite an amount to say on this matter.  In general, he welcomed the idea behind the Bill, but he took exception to a few things in it.  I am not quite happy as to whether, because of their detailed nature, I should deal with them in the detailed Committee manner which would be necessary, if I were to deal with them adequately.  I am rather inclined to leave them over for Committee stage, and deal with them there when they can be more appropriately dealt with.</P>
    <P>He did make a few points which are not new in so far as certain objections to this Bill are concerned.  A few such objections and similar ones were made in the other House.  It is better to follow the argument here and now rather than to let it die a natural death between now and the next Stage.</P>
    <P>I shall deal with the question raised by him when he took exception to the intention to have appeals under Section 5 to the Minister for Local Government, and his very pointed question as to why they should not be to the courts.  He likened a local authority appealing to the Minister for Local Government, metaphorically, to going to court with the Devil.  That is Senator O'Quigley's view, no doubt, and I appreciate his expression of it in such clear and concise terms, but equally I would disagree with his whole approach to this matter.  I do not agree at all that appeals would be more appropriate to the courts under Section 5, because if the Senator has a look at Section 5, he will realise that this appeal is the least objectionable from his point of view, in that it deals only with the question of whether or not a requirement made on an owner of property is excessive, or whether or not the time within which he is asked to carry out the requirement is too restricted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="465" /> I would say that, by and large, that is a matter which does require the intimate knowledge of a trained man, and that intimate knowledge is available in the trained men in my Department, in considering possibly a specification as to how something should be done, even to the last detail of how the job is to be done.  In other words, the examination of a specification would in fact be a quite appropriate and likely type of appeal to come up under this section.  Surely the people in Local Government are well versed in these matters, and without undue reflection on the general body of people who have knowledge such as this, I would say that, by their training and knowledge, they would be in a better position to vet these proposals and to advise me on whether or not such a proposal was excessive or not, and also be better qualified to advise me on an appeal as to whether or not the time specified was too short for the operation called for from the owner. Again, I emphatically say that they are well and truly qualified, and better qualified than most, to advise on such a matter.</P>
    <P>That brings us to the question of vicarious decisions which the Senator developed as a natural follow-on to these appeals to the Minister for Local Government.  Such decisions are arrived at after a careful examination by competent people who have no axe to grind either with the owner or the local authority, and who, in turn, submit their findings and recommendations to the Minister.  It is not a question of delegating power; it is a question of the Minister finally taking a decision against or with the advice he sees, from the reading of both sides of the case.  He is responsible for that decision taken by him, and he cannot in any way fob it off on some person to whom it would have been said that he delegated that power.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley suggested that the deciding officers would appear to be more appropriate because in fact that is what is going on.  I want to tell him that that is not what is going on, and it is not what is contemplated under this or any other sections of the Bill. When it says that an appeal to the <Col N="466" /> Minister shall lie, that appeal will in fact be to the Minister, and decided by the Minister, but he will have the evidence and advice of those competent to advise on matters such as this before he gives his decision.</P>
    <P>The idea, again, that these types of decisions which are really, according to the Senator, passed on to somebody else are going to create more public staffs and more costs on the public in general is rather begging the question. We get a clear picture of what he regards a Minister for Local Government to be&mdash;a mere extension of the local authority.  He alleges that this system of appeals to the Minister would increase the work of the Department.  He wants to know why we should increase the work of the Department of Local Government while other Departments of State are lying idle.</P>
    <P>If Senator O'Quigley knows of Departments of State which are lying idle, he should raise the matter where it is worth talking about it and try to have them given something useful to do.  There is no reason to ask me to give them work because they are idle. They are not of my creation.  I have no jurisdiction over them.  The matter here is appropriate to be dealt with by my Department in the manner proposed rather than by handing it over to other Departments of State which the Senator alleges are lying idle at the moment.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with what the Senator has said in regard to the handling of these appeals.  I would agree to what has been said by other speakers that, in the main, appeals such as these are more cheaply and freely dealt with by the Minister for Local Government than by any other institution.  We must have regard to the financial standing of the people with the right of appeal.</P>
      <P>It was also mentioned by the Senator that in his personal experience as a civil servant he himself decided to threaten proceedings.  It do not doubt that that may have happened.  I question whether or not, ultimately, the final decision whether or not to put the threat into operation was his.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Louis Walsh raised the matter of the offer which may be made to the local authority by an owner who is proposing to clear a derelict site and in what form this offer should be made&mdash;whether or not in writing.  I am not clear that it is absolutely laid down here that it must be in writing.  I cannot conceive that an offer which ultimately may become a matter of dispute or of an appeal to the Minister could be said to be an offer unless it was put into writing. This offer in most cases would be in the form of a specification for the <Col N="468" /> particular job of work the owner was proposing to do.  I do not think there could be any question that such an offer could be made verbally and that it could have any force whatsoever. If it were made verbally, to whom would it be expected to be made.  The only procedure I can see is that the offer must be made in writing.  I feel that it will not become a problem for us in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why the Minister uses a phrase like &ldquo;allegation of excess capacity&rdquo;.  This is not an allegation; it is a well established fact for years and known to everybody who is interested in the matter.  I have known it for five or six years.  The Minister in his reply to my reasoned argument in which I quoted facts and figures&mdash;except for the point he made which I fully accept that the Pigeon House station is still ineffective&mdash;really did not deal with the case I made at all.  I put down an amendment to this Bill and the position is: that the total spent for this section of the Bill, that is, Section 2, up to 31st March, 1960, was £114,000,000.  If the Minister's Bill were to be accepted in full, the capital position would be come £120,000,000 plus £32,000,000, making a total of £152,000,000.  The Minister is asking us to add a sum of £38,000,000 to the capital of the Electricity Supply Board as at 31st March last.  My amendment would give the Minister £28,000,000, a very small part of which would go on rural electrification so that he would be left with sufficient money for the next four years.  I do not understand why the Minister does not accept such an amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all, once we put this figure into the Electricity Supply Acts, it will be there and neither House of the Oireachtas will have any effective control over it, except the control of the Dáil at Budget time.  It does not matter at what rate demand increases, the fact is that with the present installed capacity of 728 megawatts, plus the 80 megawatts which are to be added in the next three years or so <Col N="471" /> the system will get through until then. But the Minister wants to add a colossal amount of further installed generating capacity.  This, of course, it seems to me is partly to prove that, after all, the programme in 1953 was right.  It was quite right except for the fact that a lot of ruffians came into the Government and developed a crisis and it was the crisis of that period&mdash;I am referring to 1956&mdash;which reduced the increase in consumption.  I can quite honestly say, and nobody can charge me with playing politics, that there was no crisis in 1956.  I always said that and I am repeating it now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the Senator's colleague disagreed with him, if I may say so.  However, I do not want to interrupt the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right. Perhaps more than one colleague disagreed with me, but may I say this, that perhaps some of my colleagues agreed with me also?  We will leave it at that.  I think it is a bit late in the day to be making that kind of point on this kind of legislation.</P>
      <P>Before the Minister came in, when we were discussing the programme of legislation, I said that last night the Minister, in effect, said to the House &ldquo;Give the E.S.B. this power to get this money and trust myself and the Minister for Finance that we will examine everything carefully, as we have examined these proposals with great care.&rdquo;  I am not controverting what the Minister said the other night, but I do know and everybody knows that the greatly inflated programme of 1953-54 was imposed on the Electricity Supply Board.  That is well known and the facts are too long known to be controverted now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In support of his case against the case I made on the statistical facts, the Minister took the autumn of 1959 and said, and I accept the figure, that the <Col N="472" /> 220 odd megawatts of hyrdo-electric generating capacity were the equivalent of only 40 megawatts.  I am quite prepared to accept that.  I do not deny it for one moment.  If that was the case, Bord na Móna had the finest crop of turf ever saved in this country for generating.  They were still using some of it well on into this year.  In fact, it was so good they were able to use part of the half-saved turf of 1958 and mix it with the extraordinary turf of 1959.  The generators were so built that there was a danger of the abnormally good turf of 1959 burning them out.</P>
    <P>The Minister also suggested&mdash;indeed he did more than suggest; he stated flatly &mdash; that it was not the excess generating capacity installed that led to the deficit on the Board's accounts but the abolition of the rural electrification subsidy.  This is the kind of argument on which you can go around in circles for days.  The fact is that on a fair estimate, there was for some years installed generating capacity, which had cost about 10 or 12 million pounds, in excess of what was required. If you take the average rate of interest on money, the cost of that is just as big as the figure the Minister mentioned as the cost of the rural electrification subsidy, £529,000 a year.</P>
    <P>I want to warn the Minister about this: it is all very fine to talk planning in great big capitals and put inverted commas around it, but you must have reason in your planning and you must be prepared not to imagine that the world never changes, not to imagine that because there have been exceptional financial conditions in these islands for the last year or so these conditions will continue in coming years.  In fact, all the evidence points the other way.</P>
    <P>The Minister also, as I understand him, suggested that we were hinting at some kind of disagreement inside the E.S.B. about this matter.  I can speak only for myself: I certainly was not hinting at anything of the sort.  I have been in contact with nobody on the board of directors of, or employed by, the E.S.B., with any civil servant or <Col N="473" /> with anybody else about it.  I knew sufficient basic facts myself to get the necessary material from the published reports.</P>
    <P>If the Minister insists on this programme, which indeed, in my opinion, is altogether more than should be planned for now, he is going to have, as he says himself, I think, 340 megawatts more installed capacity&mdash;160 from milled peat and 180 from oil.  It provides by 1968-69 for the absorption of the output of all the bogs which are considered economically usable for the generation of electricity.  If in fact, either psychologically or otherwise, the people in charge of our electrical power resources are put in a position that they must go ahead with this inflated programme, it is quite obvious that the Government will leave for their successors the same kind of charges on the community as were left with that excess generating capacity which existed for so many years in the second half of the fifties.  It is true that while the capital moneys are being spent, it will result in some increase in the national monetary income, but subsequent to that, when the moneys are spent, all that will be left if the installed capital, the real capital, cannot be utilised, will be commitments which will have to be met from the present income of the E.S.B. because there will be no additional income to meet them.</P>
    <P>I may be doing the Minister an injustice but it is his remark about an &ldquo;allegation&rdquo; that suggests to me that he feels a sense of grievance about this matter.  My criticism about this matter is personal to me and is quite honest and not antagonistic to anybody. As I see it, it is the honest discharge of what I conceive to be my public duty.  I am prepared to agree to £10 million in this Bill which would give £28 million free moneys above what the E.S.B. have spent up to 31st March, 1960.</P>
    <P>The Minister, of course, did not deal at all with my point.  He had said that the existing moneys of the Board would be used by 31st March, 1961.  I said that I could not reconcile that with the figures available to <Col N="474" /> me up to 31st March, 1960.  I simply cannot reconcile them because I know the rate at which rural electrification is going ahead throughout the country. Of course it has been spread out too long and should have been finished with by the end of the fifties, but we all know the rate: 40 areas at about £40,000 per area or £1.6 million.  Let us call it £2 million per year.  Whatever way one looks at it from 1st April, 1960, on the basis of my amendment, the Minister would have available a sum of something over £20 million for generation and transmission lines.  Let me speak in ignorance for a moment. I cannot see what amount of extra transmission lines can now be required from this on.  I know that there is rural electrification but that is provided for otherwise than in this section, and I cannot understand how, in this community with the exceptions I mentioned like the big projects using a large amount of power, the copper mines or the oil refinery, large amounts of transmission lines will be required from now on.  I do not appreciate the reason why the Minister wants to put into this Bill this enormous amount of money and I do not think the Minister last night answered my case against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support Senator O'Donovan's amendment to reduce the amount sought under this section from £20 million to £10 million. It appears to me, as a user of electricity and an ordinary citizen, obvious that what is happening is that the policy of the Board is creating the peaks which justify the Minister in coming here and asking for this additional capacity.  Comparatively recently, the Board were trying to sell ordinary heating which is naturally a peak.  When fog descends or frost comes in the window the cheapest and most efficient thing for the ordinary citizen to do is to plug in the electric fire.  Very recently, I received notification that we could now have an afternoon boost for storage heaters. Storage heaters use enormous quantities of electricity.  A small factory could be run on the amount of power which is required to keep an <Col N="475" /> adequately equipped office or house comfortable according to the requirements accepted here.  This type of load suggests to me, anyhow, that the policy adopted is a policy of encouraging peak load use of electricity.  The whole idea of heat storage has been got away from, due to giving this afternoon boost at a time when the capacity is greatest.</P>
      <P>I notice that Deputy Dillon said in the Dáil that the North Wall station works at about 30 per cent. capacity, that it was a stand-by station.  The Minister said not at all times.  Certainly, any stations that we can put up in this country will be inadequate if we are to encourage the type of load that is going to be switched on, using enormous quantities of electricity, just at the time when they are least required.</P>
      <P>I also read with much interest the debate in the other House relative to the various developments taking place.  It appears that milled peat, a most successful and probably a cheaper fuel to use, is not always available. The year 1958, a wet year, precluded the widespread use of that fuel as it could not be harvested.  We are now at the end of 1960 and it will not be long until we are informed as to how much of the milled peat was made available this year.</P>
      <P>It appears that we have a duplicate set of stations.  Would it be better if we were prepared to work on the oil stations particularly when we are an oil processing country and use some of these peat stations as stand-by stations rather than leave the oil stations which are generally cheaper to operate and are situated in areas where distribution costs must naturally be cheaper?  I think it is well, if we do not wish to saddle this or future generations with the burden of dear electricity, that we should look at the whole expenditure of the E.S.B. in as realistic and as detached a manner as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In passing, I should refer to this point.  The E.S.B. have erected a small station at Screebe&mdash;I think that is the name of the place&mdash;in Connemara.  I <Col N="476" /> understand it was many years before the Department of Lands were able to safeguard the interests of the poor farmers in Connemara in respect of adequate turbary.  Also the residents of the Aran Islands have to go to Screebe to get the turbary.  If the E.S.B. uses all the fuel in Connemara, it will make the position very difficult for these people.  This has little to do with the amount of money being voted here but I wished to mention the matter in passing.  These people would find life impossible without turbary and they must be safeguarded.</P>
    <P>I know that in relation to the use of large quantities of electricity at peak periods, the Minister can indicate on the figures that such a capacity is required, but how much capacity is lying idle for most of the day and night?  What encouragement have we given to industries engaged on shift work to use that valuable capacity, that enormous investment that is applied to the production of electricity? It may be used to its full capacity for only a few hours a day.</P>
    <P>It is said that it costs somewhere around £500,000 additional money per annum to amortise the duplication of stations that exist.  Between oil burning stations and milled peat stations, it must cost at least £500,000 in extra generating charges.  I understand that in regard to the second point I make &mdash;that in relation to extra generating charges&mdash;the Minister disputed the figures in the other House.  Perhaps he was right in disputing them but the cost of the capital equipment has to be borne by everyone who uses electricity in this country, whether it is for domestic or industrial purposes.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister to strike a proper balance.  If necessary, we should deny more rigorously the use of space heating in the valley period and encourage people to use it in the form of storage heating&mdash;that was done in the past&mdash;even if it meant reducing the night price for electricity. I am frightened by the amount of money requested here by the Minister for Transport and Power and his predecessors as Ministers for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this <Col N="477" /> amendment.  First of all, I have the utmost confidence in the technical qualifications of the engineering staff of the E.S.B.  I know that, technically, they are very highly thought of abroad.  They keep in constant touch with happenings abroad.  Consequently, we can be certain that any estimate presented by them is realistic and is presented in what appears to them to be the best engineering way and with the highest standard of engineering efficiency possible.  That is the first ground.</P>
      <P>In the second place, I am prepared to accept the Minister's assurance. This is an enabling Act providing so much money.  Its issue depends on the sanction of the Minister for Transport and Power, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance.  I take it that that involves rather tight control by the Department of Finance.  One thing gives me great hope.  The Minister stated in this Second Reading speech that he would not hesitate at any time he felt it necessary to call in efficiency experts to look over the system.  I suggest, without the slightest reflection whatever on the E.S.B. and their staff, that institutions in this country or elsewhere benefit from a periodic check-over.  Efficiency experts from outside the country who have experience of checking similar industry in other countries could apply standards and performance factors and calculate similar factors in our industry here.  We could then catch up where there are discrepancies and have it explained to us if there is something wrong.  That might improve efficiency.  When I advocate such efficiency checks, I hold that they would be useful for universities or semi-State bodies.</P>
      <P>If the Minister gives the assurance that he will not hesitate at any time he feels it necessary to call in such consultants, we can with confidence leave the figure at the level proposed no doubt after discussions on proposals and estimates submitted by the engineering staff of the E.S.B.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment if for no other reason than to help us to get some kind of clear picture as to the future development <Col N="478" /> programme of the Electricity Supply Board and Bord na Móna.  I have already pointed to the fact that the reports published by the Electricity Supply Board do not enable members of the Legislature, to whom they are presented, to understand how the board is operating.  In another context, I shall refer to the secrecy which surrounds all their activities.</P>
      <P>So far as I understand the position &mdash;and I should like the Minister to deny this if it is not so&mdash;for every peat station erected, it is necessary to build an oil burning station or a coal burning station.  What that amounts to is that the capital expenditure is twice what it need be because of the insistence on the utilisation of turf for electricity generation.</P>
      <P>Let us get the facts clear.  That is what I believe to be a fact.  I believe that the capital programme of the Electricity Supply Board in recent years is twice what it need be, or perhaps more than twice what it need be, because for every peat burning station built, another station comes into operation because the peat burning station is not generating sufficient electricity as required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I say, I cannot specify, and the Senator cannot specify if he reads the reports of the Electricity Supply Board.  If he writes to them and tries to ascertain information, he will not get it.  If one is a Deputy and puts down a Question, one is likely to be told by the Minister that it is a matter of internal administration and that he has no function in the matter.  That is what we are getting to with semi-State bodies, and that is why it is right and proper for Senator O'Donovan to put down this amendment in an effort to try to find what the facts of the situation are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be said that all this leads to increased employment on the bogs of Ireland.  That may be so, but I venture to suggest that, in the long run, it might be far more economic and far better economics &mdash; more economic from the point of view of the E.S.B. and far better national economics&mdash;if instead of using turf to generate electricity, <Col N="479" /> we used it for ordinary domestic consumption.</P>
    <P>As I understand the position, there is a tremendous demand for briquettes which is not being filled, the reason being that the turf produced by Bord na Móna is being used in these peat burning stations which the Electricity Supply Board are compelled against&mdash; again as I believe the position to be&mdash; the advice and judgment of the technical staff.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat&mdash;I do not like to say &ldquo;amused&rdquo; because it is not the correct expression&mdash;puzzled by the fact that my colleague, Senator Quinlan, said he was prepared to oppose this amendment and to support Section 2, because he had the utmost confidence in the technical staff of the E.S.B.  We all have that confidence, but when we oppose the shoving of unnecessary capital on to the E.S.B., we are not in any way reflecting on the high competence of the technical staff which has made the E.S.B. the great public utility they have been for many years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>For the point I want to make it is not necessary that the Minister should be present.  The technical competence of the people who operate and plan the various stations, whether they are hydro, peat or oil stations, is not in question.  In fact, I am sure we could become lyrical about some of the achievements of the E.S.B. officers and technical officials.</P>
      <P>I understand the new salmon lift that has been installed at the Shannon is unique.  The officer who designed it did not claim any patent rights and people who are interested have come from all over the world to see something designed by an Irish engineer. We are aware of those enromour technical advances but they should not be allowed to stop us from considering what is wise policy with regard to generating capacity, and how our load should be set.  Those are entirely different matters and they should be placed in separate compartments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree profoundly with Senator Quinlan when he says that because we have those wonderful technicians, we should leave it to them.  They are not <Col N="480" /> consulted in the policy decisions the board which is what we are discussing tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not finished at all.  I did not like to continue when the Minister had to leave for a division in the Dáil.  I was referring to the pride we all have in this great public utility, the Electricity Supply Board.  As I understand the position, as I said, I believe all this increase in peat burning stations is against the weight of technical advice within the E.S.B.  I furthere believe, as I gather from a reply to an observation by Senator Quinlan, that sometime in the 1951-54 period, the Government took over the control of the generating programme of the E.S.B.  The reason they did that, I understand, was that the technical officers in the Board were not in favour of these milled peat stations, but for another interest the Government then took over the Board, and now have decided to proceed with the remainder of these peat burning stations solely for the purpose of butterssing up the accounts of Board na Móna. That is what we are concerned with here.  It is extremely difficult to come by all the facts, but we know it is provided in legislation that the generating programme of the E.S.B. is subject to the restrictions of the Government to which it was not subject before that Act.</P>
      <P>We have the Minister telling us in this House that he is in regular consultation&mdash;one almost gathers weekly or fortnightly&mdash;with the Board, reviewing their policy and so on.  If that is the way the independent statutory bodies are to operate, we might as well forget them as independent statutory bodies, because people on a board do not have the independence of action, when a Minister is knocking around all the time looking at its affairs, they would have if they were allowed to proceed according to what they thought was best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make another reference to what Senator Quinlan said about efficiency experts.  The Minister has got so far into the active working of the Board that he said that he would not hesitate to recommend&mdash;I think that was the phrase he used&mdash;that these <Col N="481" /> experts should be brought in.  If the E.S.B. were set up as a statutory body to run the national electricity undertaking then I do not see what business the Minister has in saying: &ldquo;I am strongly of the view that you should do this.  I strongly recommend that you should bring in efficiency experts&rdquo;. If the Board the Minister appoints is fit to discharge its business, it does not require directives of that kind from the Minister.</P>
    <P>On the subject of efficiency experts, I want to say that the last people I want to see coming into this country are efficiency experts because I believe that the people of this country, if they set about examining their own problems with their own genius and their own intelligence, are more capable of resolving them.  As far as efficiency expects are concerned&mdash;and this point may well appeal to my friend, Senator Sheehy Skeffington&mdash;there is no group of efficiency experts that came into any of the larger firms or public authorities that has not made as one of its recommendations that this kind of office machinery or that or the other should be brought in, and when you begin to inquire about it, you find that the efficiency experts are all shareholders or members of the boards of the companies that supply those machines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to restrain myself, but I must reply to the allegation of the Senator that the Minister is &ldquo;knocking around the E.S.B&rdquo;.  My Department was set up to supervise and look after the transport and power companies of this country and to have a general surveillance of their activities.  At the same time, the companies by statute remain independent of day-to-day interference in the political field.  I have to build up in my own Department what might be described as a mystique or an atmosphere which enables me to steer very carefully between what Senator O'Quigley calls &ldquo;knowking around the E.S.B&rdquo; and leaving them entirely to their own devices from year to year, they reporting to me whenever they require to borrow capital, and reporting to me on the occasion of their annual report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="483" /> It would take me at least half an hour to describe in detail how I propose to create a tradition for my Department which avoids the extremes either of &ldquo;knocking around the E.S.B.&rdquo; or of standing so far outside that the Department is not doing useful work.  I and my successors will be judged on our ability to steer that very careful course.</P>
    <P>I will next refer to productivity and work study.  I never said that Irish firms are incapable of doing their own business efficiently.  What I have said is that productivity in general in all its forms is now a completely international science that allows for no state boundaries whatever, in which countries share their experiences, in many cases through the European Producetivity Agency to which we belong. Not only do countries share their experiences but experts in private organisations move from country to country, many of them speaking several languages, so that, first of all, there is that degree of international exchange.</P>
    <P>So far as the State companies are concerned, I would recommend and have recommended to every one of them that they adopt the practice of many of the great companies with international reputations for splendid-productivity, magnificent labour relations, good wages. and an excellent quality product selling competitively. What these companies do is to invite in industrial consultants to study this and that phase of their activities, and, at the same time, if they are large enough, if they are of the magnitude of the E.S.B., C.I.E. or Bord na Móna, they gradually develop their own work study team.  In the Imperial Chemical Company, there are employed 120,000 people and there is a permanent team of 1,100 work study experts.  That is a company which comes, roughly speaking, within the category I have indicated so far as one can examine it from the standard of labour relations and the fact that the workers can invest their savings in the capital and so forth, so we can have the best of both worlds.  We can have international advice and at the same time <Col N="484" /> develop our own work study, too.  A company with a work study team generally sends one or two of the staff to companies in the same field of endeavour if they will permit it, in other countries or in the same country. Therefore, there is a constant examination being made of systems of production and, at the same time, the company invites from time to time a consultant to examine this or that phase so as to keep productivity on a lively basis and so that a new view can be obtained on any phase of the company's operations.</P>
    <P>Since Senator O'Quigley raised all sorts of suggestions that there is something un-Irish about work study, I should point out that the successful work study expert is one who regards the happiness of the worker as over 50 per cent, of the whole business he is doing&mdash;work study experts have long ago got away from the American who tried to enslave the worker&mdash;I forget his name&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Burke quite clearly suggested that we should not <Col N="485" /> have used turf as a fuel for producing power.  Apparently the Fine Gael Party will split on that subject fairly soon.  It is obviously true that it is through the sole imagination of the present Taoiseach and his belief in the use of peat that Bord na Móna started.  The Government take complete and absolute credit for the initiation of that scheme.</P>
      <P>When the Coalition Government was in office a question arose as to what the future policy would be.  I am glad to tell the Seanad that the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Norton, forming part of a collective Government in which the majority were Fine Gael, did order the E.S.B. to go ahead with a specific turf station.  In other words, he followed the Fianna Fáil direction knowing, I think, partly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;any alternative policy would be almost suicide, politically. Unless the Coalition Government were operating what might be described as completely water-tight compartments, Deputy Norton must have got consent from the Minister for Finance who was Fine Gael, in order to carry on the policy of Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>I do not think I need go into very great detail in regard to the suggestion that we have to double the number of stations because we have turf stations.  It is so ludicrous as not to warrant explanation.  There are certain liablities involved in a turf station as compared with a hydro station.  If the Senator would like to examine the report of the E.S.B. he will find that the total cost per unit sent out for power produced at Ringsend, including depreciation and interest, is 1.043 pence per unit.  If he will look at the corresponding cost at Ferbane, which is a milled peat station, he will find it is 1.056 pence.</P>

      <P>I want to avoid repeating anything I said last night.  I mentioned the various forms of control over the E.S.B. that exist.  Senator O'Donovan repeated them.  This programme may require alteration.  I hope that in the course of the next eight years it will be upwards.  If the programme requires alteration, that will be done in accordance with the negotiations between the E.S.B., ourselves and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Oireachtas has the opportunity of checking the work of the E.S.B. at the time of the Budget, as Senator O'Donovan said.  They could also, if they wished, as was clearly indicated by the Taoiseach in a recent statement in the Dáil ask for a debate on the presentation of the annual report of any State company.  They have at least two occasions during the year when they can raise the subject of operations of any State company.  That, together with the control by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Transport and Power of the day, is sufficient to obviate any of the horrors we might be supposed to suffer because of gigantic expenditure by the E.S.B.  The <Col N="487" /> E.S.B. is 100 per cent in favour of this programme.  If Senator O'Donovan is correct, the E.S.B. Board and Directors are gravely wrong.  He cannot have it both ways.  He will surely take my word that I have not added any amount to the sum provided in this section.  If he takes my word for that, then the E.S.B. themselves are gravely at fault in advising me that they require this amount.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it will help to give some figures in regard to the use of this sum, £120,000,000, but if it will help, this is the statement and it can be found in the report of the Board for the year ended 31st March, 1960, page 11.  It says:</P>
    <P>The Electricity (Supply) Acts authorise the Board to incur capital expenditure not exceeding £100,000,000 for its general purposes. To enable the Board's development to continue, legislation increasing this authorised amount to £120,000,000 is under consideration. At 31st March, 1960, the board had approved expenditure totalling £101,105,557, of which £78,863,607 represented electricity assets actually in commission, the balance £22,241,950 representing either work in progress or work authorised.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the £100,000,000 of the £120,000,000 consists of work which is either being completed or is in one form of progress or another or is authorised for construction.</P>
    <P>In actual fact, the expenditure within the new total additional provision of £20,000,000 must include part of the cost of the programme between 1964 and 1965 and 1965 and 1968 as there is a need to make provision in advance, to order plant in advance, to engage in all kind of development expenditure in advance.  So it is no use calculating the number of megawatts the Board will require by 1964 and working it out at so much per megawatt.  You have also to include what is in fact a figure that is not absolutely known to me, the amount of the £20,000,000 required for plans that have to be put into operation in the period 1964-1968.  If <Col N="488" /> the consumption of electricity goes on increasing at the present rate of ten per cent, which now excludes the unusual boosts in power required for the Avoca copper mines and the Whitegate oil refinery, it will be necessary to revise this programme upwards.</P>
    <P>I always believe in taking an optimistic view of the country's economy and I should like to feel that all of us, whatever Party we belong to, may look at the present growth of industry with some hope that in the future at least we shall keep, say, an eight, nine or ten per cent increase or more. If we can do that, our programme will have to be revised upwards.  I think I have covered all the points raised and I do not think I can say anything more.  I trust that the Seanad in view of the observations made, for example, by Senator Quinlan and some other Senators, will agree to authorising the figure in this section of £120,000,000.</P>

      <P>Before the proposer of the amendment replies, I should like to say that I listened to the debate on both sides and to the Minister's answer.  It strikes me the Minister has answered the case comprehensively. All of us know that the money asked for is required.  It is not an excessive amount in view of what is contemplated and in light of what has been done by the E.S.B. over the years.  I think we all are very proud of this organisation, although it is quite obvious that the different Parties vie for the credit and in a sense credit is due to both Parties.  There have been occasions in the history of the E.S.B. when one Party fiercely attacks the other and vice versa, over the E.S.B., and they have switched as indeed they have switched on so many other things.  We need not be surprised if again they are attacking each other in what seems to be purely mock combat, quite unreal.  If the Coalition Government were in power, we would find them boldly asking for this amount and some other person like the Minister attacking them on the grounds that this was a betrayal of the country's resources or something like that.</P>

      <Col N="489" /> There is one point which the Minister made on which he should be corrected, and this, in giving all the credit to Bord na Móna for producing electricity from turf when for years before 1946&mdash;when it was finally and very belatedly decided by Fianna Fáil to do so&mdash;they had been urged by experts to do it and had consistently turned it down before the war and up to the war and perforce during the war when they learned their sad lesson. They were very slow to learn about the value of producing electricity from turf but they have learned it now, and more power to them&mdash;more electric power to them.  We have to recognise that credit for these ideas goes to the people who were urging that policy on Fianna Fáil back in 1935 and 1936 and urging it on the country as far back as the First Dáil.</P>

In view of the fact that the particular official retired a week or so ago, one might be allowed to mention his name.  I am referring to Mr. Joseph McDonald, the Chief Engineer of the Erne Scheme.

      <P>I appreciate the Minister's statement at the beginning of his reply.  I do not misunderstand him at all.  When the Ministery of Fuel and Power was being established and before I knew who was to be <Col N="490" /> Minister, I spoke in this House about it and my remarks, which I do not intend to quote, are in Volume 51, Columns 332-337.  Anybody who wants to see them can read them there.  Anybody who wants to see what I thought of the job that was being given to the particular Minister&mdash;and, as I say, at the time I did not know who was getting the job&mdash;can see what I said.</P>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister said and I appreciate the difficulty of his problem.  He is concerned about a problem which is a perennial one of how to supervise, in any modern democracy, these semi-State bodies.  If the Minister succeeds in solving that problem, he will make a name for himself. If he wants to see what a large group of people said, let me send for the huge file in the Department of Finance on the problem of how you are to control their financial operations if you are not to interfere with their day-to-day operations.  He may find some wisdom there but it will not solve his problem.  It all ended with nobody doing anything about it.</P>
      <P>Let me be honest.  There is no evidence up to the present that anybody has done anything about it.  The Minister, I regret, proceeded to set up a number of cockshies which he pretended were the statements of my colleague, Senator O'Quigley, and suggested that he had inferred that there was something un-Irish about work study.  What Senator O'Quigley said was that many of these experts suggested the installation of very expensive machinery. That is a specific statement but it is not suggesting that there is something un-Irish about work study.  Neither did Senator O'Quigley suggest that in 1953-54 the Government had put some directors on the Board.  They may have. In fact, I think they did but that is not what Senator O'Quigley suggested. It was something quite different.</P>

      <P>On the section, I want to make one or two observations on points arising from the Minister's speech.  With so much business still to be done, I am not going to traverse what I said or try to clear up misrepresentations. What I said is on the record and the record speaks for itself. The Minister was talking about the establishment of the Department of Transport and Power and said he was burdened and charged with the coordination of all the semi-State bodies connected with transport and power like the E.S.B., C.I.E. and so on.  You would imagine that these came into operation only in 1959 when the Department was established or that the liaison necessary between these bodies and the appropriate Minister must never have obtained.  Long before the Minister was ever thought of as Minister for Transport and Power, the same liaison obtained between the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the different boards over all the years.  It may be that the Minister now has more time to spend exclusively, or to put it the other way, that these State bodies have to spend more time with the Minister, but obviously the Minister should not try to lead us to believe that up to the establishment of the Department of Transport and Power in 1959, there was never such a thing as liaison between the Minister for Industry and Commerce or any Government Department and these State bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask a question as Senator Quinlan has asked one?  The Minister may not possibly <Col N="493" /> be able to answer, but when this £32,000,000 has been spent, the whole programme will be finished and 800 areas will be developed.  This is slightly different, but I would like to ask the Minister to give attention to it because I think it has some merits.  I refer to the small areas, the little bits between the developed areas.  It should be carefully considered whether the use of Calor gas or Kosangas, especially with the establishment of an oil refinery, or the generation of electricity privately by individual engines might prove a great deal less expensive than the £4.8 million calculated as the cost of covering these isolated areas with wires in the usual fashion.  I make that suggestion.  I do not know whether the Minister has got as far as that, but he must be coming very close to that now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the two questions asked, roughly 75 per cent. of dwellings in the complete area will be connected when the programme is completed, and in reply to Senator O'Donovan, the Government of the day will, I imagine, in the early part of 1962 or possibly in the latter part of 1961, make some decision on what their attitude should be to the remaining 25 per cent of the people.  The Senator is absolutely right in saying that Calor or Kosangas may be the best solution for some of the more isolated dwellings.  I think the Taoiseach, when initiating the rural electrification scheme in 1945 or 1946, mentioned that it might be difficult to connect every household because of the extremely scattered character of our rural communities.  We share with Sweden the unique distinction of being the most unvillaged community in Europe.  So the whole problem will be discussed with a view to seeing whether another scheme can be devised for certain types of dwellings, whether the cost would be prohibitive or whether it would be better to provide some other form of assistance in line with the assistance available in congested or remote areas.  This might apply to Calor or Kosangas as it does in some of the Fior-Ghaeltacht areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an amendment of Section 7 of the 1927 Act which established the E.S.B.  In his Second Reading speech in this House, the Minister said that what was being done in the amendment was merely bringing the position regarding rendering of accounts or auditing into line with modern practice.  There are a number of things in the Electricity Supply Act of 1927 that are to be brought into line with modern practice.  I do not think the Minister has given any adequate explanation for departing from the present position where the Minister may make regulations prescribing what is to be done.  Presumably, these regulations are laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate who at present conducts the audit of the E.S.B. accounts?</P>

      <P>The accounts of the E.S.B. are audited by a private auditor and not by the Auditor General.  The auditors are Messrs. Kennedy and Crowley and Co., of Westmoreland Street.  This section of the Bill merely enables the Minister for Transport and Power to give directions as to the form of the accounts in the audit.  Instead of having to write statutory regulations with all the unnecessary administrative complications involved, I simply give a direction in writing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that these statutory bodies are to be as free as possible from day to day interference by Ministers, would it not be a much more satisfactory thing for the E.S.B. to have their particular set of regulations, which they know they must adhere to, rather than that the Minister in the month of January should tell the E.S.B.: &ldquo;Well, now, these accounts are going to be presented on 31st March.  I want you to present them in a particular way.&rdquo;  I very much doubt the advisability of <Col N="495" /> vesting such power in any Minister for Transport and Power.  The format of the accounts may change from time to time.  It becomes too easy&mdash;that is the point&mdash;to change the format of the accounts purely by a direction, whereas it is not so easy to change them when it involves laying regulations before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>One of the difficulties in reading statistics and comparing them in respect of companies such as the E.S.B. is that you may find the accounts change from year to year. There will always be good excuses and explanations given as to why a different basis is to be adopted in relation to a different set of accounts.  I am not at all satisfied that this is a desirable situation to have incorporated in the Bill and I do not think the Minister has attempted to give anything like a satisfactory explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say, first of all, that I did not intend, as a result of this section being passed, to make some dramatic alterations in the format of the accounts or anything of that kind, but simply to bring the E.S.B. into line with other State companies in respect of which provision is made that the Minister can give directions. I think that in the light of the history of our State companies and our semi-State bodies, little fear need be entertained that there will be abuses as a result of the change.  We have a very splendid tradition in relation to the account-keeping of our State bodies.  My memory does not go beyond 1938 but certainly the tradition since then has been a fine one. Whatever difficulties they had have not been related to their method of keeping accounts&mdash;not so far as I am aware or have knowledge of.  This is to bring the E.S.B. into line with other State bodies where similar provision occurs.  The time, place and method of conducting the audit, the time, place and method of publication and sales, the character of the accounts which are to be published and put on sale are given by way of directions instead of by statutory regulations.</P>

      <P>It arises in relation to the accounts&mdash;Section 12. We are dealing with the Minister giving directions as to the form of the accounts.  I am raising a query as to the position in which there is no evidence in the accounts as to how a particular figure has been divided between two different activities.  I gave an example, namely, transmission <Col N="497" /> charges in arriving at the cost of current and distribution between rural and non-rural consumers.  The basis is not stated in the accounts.

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There is information I could give now, for example, as to how fixed charges in rural areas are calculated and the basis of the fixed charge.  There is information available about the deficit on the rural electrification account.  That is clearly given but whether it would be possible to answer easily a question which involves separating a whole lot of items, I am unable to say.  It is difficult at this stage to give a detailed reply in respect of that.  If anyone challenges seriously the accuracy of the Board's figures in regard to the deficit on rural account and the build up of the fixed charges, I suppose the E.S.B. would naturally have to justify their figures, but there, again, I think there has been a very fine tradition within the E.S.B. and other State bodies.  I doubt if such a charge would be made.</P>
      <P>Those are the two principal issues embodied in rural electrification&mdash;the justification for the fixed charges in relation to the contribution by the Government, the consumers and the E.S.B. and the degree of deficit involved in the rural electrification network and the fact that it has to be compensated for by a surplus in the urban network.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>These pension increases are directly related to the corresponding increases in the pensions of civil servants.  They apply to two groups of pensioners: those covered by the general superannuation scheme whose pensions are calculated as percentages of their salaries and those covered by the superannuation scheme whose pensions are expressed as fixed sums.  Sections 13 and 14 cover the first group and Section 15 provides for the second group.</P>
      <P>The pension increases are divided up.  There are three periods of retirement which are clearly indicated in the section and there are two separate increases arising from the corresponding increases to civil servants, namely, those affected in the 1959 and 1960 Budgets.  I think that described the sections fairly adequately.  There is nothing anomalous in them.  They were agreed to by both sides of the tariff organisation of the E.S.B., and they were agreed to by the Minister for Finance.  They follow completely on the lines of the Civil Service increases.</P>

      <P>This is a very desirable section which provides a <Col N="500" /> superannuation scheme for whole-time members of the Board.  Under this section, the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may make a scheme, and it is regarded as a superannuation scheme and he may make another scheme, amending the first scheme.  It is perfectly clear from the section that the first scheme the Minister makes must be laid on the Tables of the Houses of the Oireachtas, but it is not at all clear whether the amending schemes are to be laid on the Tables of the Houses of the Oireachtas. I wonder would the Minister deal with that point?  I should like the Minister to indicate also what gratuity shall not be paid to a whole-time member of the Board under section 2 of the Superannuation Act of 1942.</P>

      <P>So far as I know, we have to lay all these Superannuation schemes on the Tables of the Houses of the Oireachtas; what applies to one would apply to another.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that is not so.  The section refers to a scheme and it is afterwards referred to in the Bill as a superannuation scheme.  As I read subsection (2), there may be a subsequent scheme, referred to as an amending scheme, and it is differentiated from a superannuation scheme in the remainder of the Bill.  Subsection (6) provides merely for the laying of a superannuation scheme before each House of the Oireachtas.  I want to know why the amending scheme must not also be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I can look into that. I know there is no intention on my part of preventing publication of the scheme.  Obviously, if one scheme has to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, it would be desirable to publish the amending schemes.  On the other hand, there may be some specific reason why this subsection appears to apply only to the main scheme.</P>

      <P>With regard to <Col N="501" /> Section 2 of the Superannuation Act of 1942, why is it that that may not apply to a whole-time member of the Board?</P>

      <P>This scheme applies to whole-time members of the Board only.  It is a new scheme which is in line with schemes for superannuation for full-time members of other boards. It is virtually exactly the same in the case of C.I.E.  In principle, the scheme is exactly the same.  There is no essential difference in it.
