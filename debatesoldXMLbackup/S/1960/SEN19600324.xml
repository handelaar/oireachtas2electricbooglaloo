      <P>Last night, I gave a brief review of some of the points of Government policy upon which I wished to comment.  Naturally, I placed agriculture No. 1.  It is well that we should keep in mind the background that seems to be behind the fluctuations both in Government policy and in marketing policy with regard to agriculture.</P>
      <P>We go back to 1956.  At that time, we were apparently convinced that the cattle trade was gone.  The Argentine seemed to be a real threat and screaming headlines proclaimed the threat. Two years later, we reached the mass hysteria of the Spring of 1958.  We could no longer sell dairy products. The price of butter on the British market had gone so low that there could be no future in it.  To anybody who studied trends, it was, of course, quite obvious that a trade war was being conducted in what can be described legitimately as the best monopolistic fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New Zealand had amassed a fund of close on £30,000,000 as a result of the very high prices paid earlier for dairy products and was using all those millions to drive us and other competitors out of the British market so that she might have the market for herself.  But the drop was so steep and so drastic that even the New Zealanders grew appalled at what happened and, last year, a gradual recovery took place.  We, however, panicked and we cut the price of dairy <Col N="928" /> products by imposing a levy of one penny per gallon on milk.  It was not the amount involved that mattered.  It was the lesson it taught our farmers. They learned that increased production does not pay, and they learned that lesson at a time when everybody realised that the whole future of our economy depended on increased production both in the agricultural and the industrial spheres.  The chickens produced in that lesson came home to roost pretty rapidly because, last year, when butter was making more on the British market than its controlled price at home, we had nothing to sell.</P>
    <P>Remember, too, that last year the Irish farmer was compelled to sell products in the home market at less than he would have got for those products, had he been allowed freely to export them to Britain or elsewhere.  He found himself in that position due to deliberate Government policy at the time.</P>
    <P>There is, again, a drop in the British market to-day.  It is not a very significant one but it calls for a slight subsidy in order to export.  I hope that our Government will be resolute in tackling the problem now.  I hope they will have the courage to give the much needed increase of at least 3d.  per gallon to our dairy farmers.  Even though it may not be possible to raise the products at home by the necessary 8d. or 9d.,  I hope that our Government will face up to paying a subsidy to get at least half of it; in other words, even though it means reintroducing the consumer subsidy abolished two years ago.</P>
    <P>We are coming now to another stage.  Again, the threat of the Argentine is beginning to appear in our papers.  We read that the Argentinian beef herds are increasing so that what seemed to be a good proposition two years ago, to put our money in beef and beef products, is now appearing in its proper light as a very low form of production for Irish agriculture and one that is not comparable with dairying. Consequently, I hope the recent speech by the Taoiseach is the beginning of a really progressive and sustained attempt to get increased production in dairying products and, at <Col N="929" /> the same time, to give our farmers the fruits of the increased standard of living which is enjoyed by other sections of the community.</P>
    <P>We hope to see implemented this year those marketing boards which we have been promised.  Every progressive agricultural country has found it necessary to introduce these marketing boards, and we cannot be an exception.  When they come, I hope they will succeed in evening out some of the fluctuations.  Take the disaster of last year about which Senators from the west of Ireland know so much, where due to a slight increase in the production of lambs&mdash;I think the increase was not more than ten per cent.&mdash;one lamb in every five had to be exported, and due to the fact that the price on the British market came tumbling down, the price on the Irish market came down in sympathy with it.  The result was a 30 per cent.  drop in the value of lambs last year.  The farmers actually, by producing ten per cent.  more lambs, cut their cheques by 30 per cent.  Surely that is not realistic.  I believe that any marketing board worthy of the name would have succeeded in mitigating that drop.  The farmers were at least entitled to the same price on the home market last year as they got before for lambs, and the surplus could have been evened out and spread out as much as possible.</P>
    <P>These are just some of the fundamentals that have to be observed in the development of agriculture.  Above all, we must keep the confidence of the agricultural community, but I am afraid that confidence has been badly shaken by economic decisions the Government were forced to take in the past couple of years when we had price reductions due to increased production which cannot go hand in hand in the beginning phases of the development of agriculture but will, of course, later, when we progress to the stage that it is evened out by producing more and selling cheaper, but not in the initial stages of development.</P>
    <P>One point which needs to be emphasised here is the question of marginal cost production; in other words, the <Col N="930" /> question that bedevils the whole discussion, whether or not we can sell butter on the British market at 3/- a lb. when we are getting 4/- a lb. at home.  Of course we can, if it means increased production.  We know that if a man succeeds in getting 300 gallons per acre from his farm, and that in the following year, by better husbandry, he succeeds in getting 350 gallons, the extra 50 gallons will cost one-sixth of what it cost him to produce the 300 gallons.  If you are dealing with marginal costs and provided your export prices are higher than your marginal costs, then there is a positive gain to the community as a whole to produce those articles rather than not to produce them.  It is as simple as that so I hope we shall speak less of average cost and think more of marginal cost.  I shall come to the same fallacy again when I am speaking on the cost of universities and university students.</P>
    <P>There is one other point with which I should like to deal before passing from agriculture.  We need to be clear on the question of bovine tuberculosis eradication.  It is something that is forced on us by a prevailing fashion. It is like the Paris fashion shops saying that a lady's skirt must be 2&rdquo; lower or 2&rdquo; one way or the other.  Tuberculosis eradication is exactly the same type of fad.  In this case it is a health fad which is being forced on us and on the world.  Because the major consuming regions like Britain have accepted it, it seems that we must comply.</P>
    <P>No one for one moment should believe that our animal population is in a diseased condition.  It is not, any more than we in the Seanad are a diseased collection of human beings because we are 99 per cent.  reactors, I hope.  Let us keep our sanity.  It is a measure we are being forced to adopt but let us get away from the hysteria about our diseased cattle.  In the abattoirs, not the slightest trace of disease is found, not a pin head, in 90 per cent. of what are classed as reactor cattle.  I hope the Government are constantly trying to find ways and means of getting around it and of seeing if there is any other way of ensuring that our products are put on the market and accepted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="931" /> With regard to our dairy produce, so long as they are pasteurised, it does not make any difference whether the animals from which they come had or had not T.B., or at least whether or not the animal was a reactor.  It is the same story with regard to meat.  If we could find some way of getting around the eradication of bovine T.B. and if we could develop some type of vaccine to be given to the animals in the early stages which would confer a certain amount of immunity for the rest of their lives in the same way as many human beings are vaccinated with B.C.G., I think the Government should go ahead in that way.  It would be very wise if portion of the expenditure on bovine T.B. could be channelled into the carrying out of research in an effort to find if there is any other way of breaking out of this unscientific approach to it.  The killing of 19 or 20 animals just to get rid of one that is diseased seems to be a very crude approach in this so-called jet age.</P>
    <P>Seeing that we are spending so much money on the eradication of bovine tuberculosis, I should like if we would at the same time turn our attention to the development of the dead meat trade.  That is something we are all wishing and longing for.  We feel it would rationally be a much more advantageous way of putting our products on the market.  I believe we should get started on that now and try to even out the fluctuations in prices because at certain times our meat packers are not able to buy and then at other times they make a good purchase.  Can we even out those fluctuations and develop a dead meat trade?  Its history over the past eight or ten years has been one of great decline.  At times, it is promising and then it almost folds up.  Surely, with air transport and everything else, we should be able to place our meat products in first-class condition in markets anywhere in the world?  I think far more consideration and finance would need to be devoted to that aspect.</P>
    <P>Next I come to what has again become a major issue in the past year, our land policy.  It has seen a change <Col N="932" /> of Ministers in its administration but so far no real policy seems to be emerging, apart from various statements on the economic size of a farm, which is going up and up&mdash;40 acres, 50 acres, and so on.  These are matters in our approach to which we must have a bit of sanity.</P>
    <P>The question of the size of a holding, which is concerned with Government policy in the size of their Land Commission holdings and in their planning for the future, is very much dependent on the availability of land and the standard of living of our people.  If we could provide everybody with thousand-acre holdings here, would they need do nothing but graze a few cattle and we would all live in the lap of luxury?  We know that is impossible.  Therefore, what standard can we use?</P>
    <P>I suggest we can take the recent pronouncement by Mr. Conroy, President of the Trade Union Congress, that the aim of the trade union movement is to provide a wage of £10 a week for workers.  That statement has been attacked as being unrealistic and it is argued that the amount is far too high.  I think the present amount is just slightly over £8.  Even though the statement is attacked, I cannot see how anybody can live on the figure. I know that people are living on it and that therefore it is possible to do so but I should not like to have to do it and neither would anybody here in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Surely, in our circumstances, an economic farm must be one that yields at least a living that is comparable with that?  Farm survey figures show that, in the group 15 to 30 acres, the average income is just £6 per week on a 22-acre holding.  That is away under Mr. Conroy's figure.  You have to go to the next group with 42 acres to get an average income of £423 per annum, that is, £8 per week.  One might say at present one would have to go to at least 50 acres to produce the same standard of living as our industrial population now enjoy.  However, that is dealing only with averages.</P>
    <P>The way to improve that, and we all know it needs to be improved, is to <Col N="933" /> help the people on smaller holdings to produce more.  We find in the farm survey that the top third of the farmers on 40-acre holdings have an average cash income of £13 per week. Those on the average 22-acre holding return £8.  10s. per week.  Naturally, the £8 10s.  when other benefits are added on, is at least as good as, or better than, the £10 a week target set by Mr. Conroy.</P>
    <P>Therefore, one might say that, properly developed, a 20-acre farm can supply as good a living as what I regard as the very modest target now set by the trade union movement for Irish workers.  The fallacy of this writing and talking to the effect that you need a 40-acre or a 50-acre farm is that all the people writing and talking at that level are people who themselves have incomes of £1,200, £1,400, £1,500 or maybe £2,000 a year.  They cannot see how anybody could live on a farm of, say, 50 acres.  They cannot see how anybody could live on a salary of, say, less than a £1,000 a year.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the bulk of the people are living on it.  We must be realistic in our thinking.  I suggest, then, that the aim of raising our industrial wages from the present £8 to £10 a week should be matched by the comparable aim of raising our agricultural production and giving every facility to the people on small holdings to raise their production in the same way.  If that is done, I feel quite confident that the 20-acre farm will produce a living any day comparable with a wage of £10 a week in our cities. We find that, if an industrialist submits plans to double the capacity of his factory, he has all forms of Government grants available to him.  We voted several millions last year for the Industrial Credit Company and others, all of which was aimed at assisting such people.  So far, there is no comparable legislation to help the small farmer to develop.</P>
    <P>This free enterprise idea is, I know, a very fine idea but when it is applied to small farms, it just does not work. The man with only £5 cash for spending in the week cannot save on that.  If, by any chance, he gets £5. 10s. or £6 <Col N="934" /> one week, it is asking too much of human nature that he should save that extra £1 and accordingly build up in that way.  Is he not entitled, in the event of such an increase, to have a little luxury for his family, based on that? In other words, the problem of developing the small farms is essentially one of the State giving the tools to these men to develop.  We give tools to the airlines, to C.I.E. and to others. We expect payment on what is really a &ldquo;never-never&rdquo; system.  I suggest we shall have to do the same for the small range of farmers who are in no position at any time to make savings on the very low cash incomes they now have.  It is well to recall that, according to the farm survey, there are 4¼ million acres in farms of 100 acres or more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest that the Senator is getting away from the outline of Government policy, which is really what is under consideration in the Bill?  Matters of detail will have to be reserved for another occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The little detail I used was to illustrate a very undesirable trend in Government land policy, a trend towards the belief that we can increase incomes on our farms only by giving our farmers more acres rather than by giving them better tools to develop the acres they already have.  On that, I would welcome an extension of the Gaeltacht glasshouse scheme and other schemes to all the small farms in the country.  It is only by that type of intensification that we can raise up production and meet our national obligations of giving the small farmers a living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is just one other point that needs to be commented on&mdash;the failure of the Government to encourage employment in agriculture. So far, the allowance granted in rates for people employed on farms has remained static for at least ten to 12 years, while the value of money has halved in that period.  In fact, it is only a miserable £17 per worker employed at present.  I suggest that is one real place where an increase is <Col N="935" /> necessary.  I would say that should be trebled.</P>
    <P>We should remember that we cannot get production without men.  There is a fallacy at present that we have 100,000 too many men on the land. That is based on English standards of production, that it requires so many hours to produce an acre of wheat or so many hours to care for a dairy cow in the year and so on. Adding up those and taking our total production, it is found that we should produce what we have at present with about 300,000 rather than 400,000 people.</P>
    <P>There is one very trifling little detail that is forgotten by those who make those calculations, that is, if our people are to produce at the same rate as corresponding English workers, surely we must give them the same tools.  We find that Irish farms are capitalised at about £20 per acre, whereas English farms have at least £40 per acre invested. If we are to get the same output per man, we should be prepared to invest an additional £20 per acre and over our 12,000,000 acres we should be prepared to invest £250,000,000 for the national duty of displacing 120,000 people from the land.</P>
    <P>How far can economics be pushed? The job of finding alternative employment for those would cost at least another £250,000,000.  We would have to spend about £500,000,000 to displace 100,000 off the land and put them into industrial employment and still maintain agricultural production at the same level.</P>
    <P>Let us pass on to other aspects of Government policy.  We have the Government technical development policy.  This is our effort now to tackle the jet age.  We really got off on the jets here when we voted £10,000,000 for jets and when we put Aer Línte jets on order.  The service is going and we all hope it will be highly successful. We hope that Shannon will develop a little better than appeared to many of us to be the prospects last July when we voted this money.</P>
    <P>There are certain aspects of the Government's approach to this jet age <Col N="936" /> but two stand out in particular.  These are the Report of the Universities space commission and also the Government action which is being proceeded with in the Dáil at present.  I do not wish to anticipate the results of the debate except to state how heartening was the Minister's statement to all of us who are engaged in technical scientific development.  It was an enlightened document and it is the most obvious sign that I have seen emerging yet of really constructive high-geared Government thinking for the future.</P>
    <P>I hope it is an augury.  I commend the Minister concerned on his broad and enlightened approach and also, having accepted the recommendations of the space commission, his decision to set up a universities commission to inquire into the various problems and inter-relations between the Universities, the technical schools, the Institute for Advanced Studies and all the others.  I think the Minister deserves to be heartily commended on that.</P>
    <P>Other aspects that seem to give hope are the Agricultural Institute which in the past 12 months has gone from strength to strength.  I disagree very much with the Leas-Chathaoirleach in his strictures on that body, that is, that it is expanding too fast.  In fact, I believe it is not expanding fast enough.  It has taken over many going concerns.  The Government were very wise in the past year in passing over Johnstown Castle, the Grange Farm and the Glenamoy development to this autonomous body.  I believe that great things will develop there but in looking at the Estimate for this year&mdash; there is £400,000 for the Agricultural Institute&mdash;we might be inclined to think that the Government are being over-generous.  Actually, the figure is not what it seems because the transferred services, Johnstown Castle, the Grange Farm and Glenamoy, cost the Government last year something like £170,000 as shown in the Book of Estimates for 1959.  That is only part of the cost because you have the cost of administration of those farms which was done centrally by the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>That can be estimated at least as <Col N="937" /> 15 per cent.  of the cost of the farms themselves.  As well as that, you have the cost of superannuation, pensions and so on and 15 per cent.  of the salaries is required to meet pensions. Averaging it out, I would say it is probably 10 per cent. of the net estimate. That is 25 per cent.  In addition, if we take the Book of Estimates for this year, we find on page 199 the relatively concealed moneys that are spent on those services.  For instance, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners provides services for agriculture of some £16,000.  There are like contributions from Public Works and Buildings, Superannuation and Retired Allowances and Stationery Office-there is free stationery for the places concerned&mdash;Valuation and Ordnance Survey, Rates on Government Property and Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>All these add up to a very substantial amount.  Actually, I think it could be estimated that that would amount to at least 40 per cent of the cost shown in the Book of Estimates so that in place of transferring services which cost £170,000, the actual amount transferred would be £170,000 plus 40 per cent.  In other words, £240,000 so that the net amount given to the Agricultural Institute to carry on the work is only £160,000.  I submit that that is far too low.</P>
    <P>That is one heading in respect of which I hope we shall see a Supplementary Estimate and that certainly we shall see it vastly increased next year.  I think it would be in order for me to pay the highest possible tribute to the present Director and the present Chairman who are doing magnificent work.  Above all, what is to be appreciated is the way in which they are co-ordinating existing services and, speaking for my own university, I know they are working in exceptionally well and fulfilling their function in the co-ordination of scientific research.</P>
    <P>Now having praised Government developments, I must turn to a few black spots.  I suppose it is the sad fate of an Independent member to be mostly in Opposition but yet if we were only singing praises all the time, we would be of little use.  There are <Col N="938" /> a few matters which need to be pointed out specifically.  There is the question of the Dairy Science Faculty at University College, Cork.  Its total vote, as given here, is £30,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that is a matter of administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going into detail.  I am keeping on administration and on policy.  I want to say that the policy appears to me to be very unwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion must be on policy and then on broad lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but this is on broad lines.  It is the broad policy of starving non-Government services compared with Government services and it is a policy that is at the root of many of our troubles.  How can you for one instant justify the position with regard to the schools operated by the Department of Agriculture?  Take Athenry Agricultural School.  Those Senators from the west know what it is doing.  It is doing quite good work turning out some 30 to 40 students at most but it is in the Book of Estimates for £24,000, plus the concealed moneys which total 40 per cent., bringing it to £32,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has got more than the Dairy Science Faculty.  Ballyhaise Agricultural School has got more than the Dairy Science Faculty.  The Munster Institute has got more than the Dairy Science Faculty and the Clonakilty School has got more than the Dairy Science Faculty.  Yet we say that the country lives on agricultural produce; we must export dairy produce.  Our effort to export some £19,000,000 worth of dairy produce can be summed up by saying that we spend £30,000 on training the people to man that industry, some 120 students, on providing a certain amount of technical advice for creameries as to the best type of separators and machinery to put in, and then on developing all those wonderful dairy products that are to win the market for the future&mdash;all the various types of cheese, the use of skimmed milk, of dried milk and every other <Col N="939" /> type of milk&mdash;and yet we spend less on that than on one agricultural school run by the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>I am not saying for one moment that there is too much spent on those agricultural schools but I am using the ridiculous comparison between the two, because surely the work of the Dairy Science Faculty is many times more responsible than the work of one single agricultural school.  Coming down to something which is closer to us here, we can look across the square to No. 5 Merrion Square, which houses the School of Cosmic Physics, one of the three schools of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies.  Its grant is £33,000, plus one third of the administration of the school, which brings it to £36,000.  It is given 20 per cent.  more than the Dairy Science Faculty.  I am not suggesting it is getting too much&mdash;in fact I wish we could give it much more&mdash; but surely it is the height of absurdity that more should be spent on research on cosmic physics than on research and the development of dairy products and on the training of the technicians. Can I or need I go further?</P>
    <P>We have not got a single place catering for food technology which is so important if we are to develop in the future.  One would expect a country like ours, which is primarily agricultural, to have not one but two or three centres for food technology; yet we have none.  To our shame, the best official advice that has been given to certain groups who were alive to the necessity for food technology was: &ldquo;Oh, go cap in hand to the Ford Foundation, or some other foundation, and plead with them.  Ask them if they will give you the money to set up a food technology centre.  Ask them will they give you £150,000.&rdquo;  We cannot spare £150,000 to set up a centre; yet we were able to vote £25,000,000 last July inside two weeks.</P>

      <P>Again, may I remind the Senator that he is going outside the scope of the debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, except that it seems that Government policy leans <Col N="940" /> far more heavily on the development of industry than on agriculture and I have been trying to point out the deficiencies in the case of agriculture. The figures I have given speak for themselves to any reasonably minded person.</P>
      <P>Another point which I had occasion to mention last year, and which is again highlighted, is this policy of starving non-Government agencies compared with Government agencies, namely, the agricultural schools.  I do not want to go into the details but I pointed out last year, and there is no change this year, that it costs ten times as much per student in the State-run schools as in the private schools. Was there ever such a triumph for private enterprise?  It costs ten times as much as in places like Warrenstown, Pallaskenry and the rest of them. Again, I am not condemning the work in places like Athenry.  They are doing excellent work but I am pointing to the fact that the private schools are allowed only one-tenth of what the State schools are getting and in our present undeveloped state.  I implore the Minister to open the flood gates to help them.  It would cost only another £250,000 per annum to give the private schools the same treatment as that given to the State schools.  Remember that that is given in Holland and other countries and why should we lag behind?</P>
      <P>We were challenged by Senator Lenihan to show how the Book of Estimates could be reduced.  I am showing it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>How?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Transfer those services from State control to private enterprise.  If they can exist on the same pittance as those under private enterprise, you can do the same work and save 90 per cent on your agricultural schools, not to speak of the several other items similarly badly treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now let me deal with a few brief points on Government policy in connection with the Universities.  One of the most heartening items mentioned was the Minister's promise of increased scholarships.  Our number of <Col N="941" /> scholarships is deplorably low compared with other countries.  We have about 10 per cent.  on scholarships. England has about ten per cent. without scholarships and 90 per cent. on scholarships.  As a poor country, we cannot afford that, I agree wholeheartedly. The solution is not the solution that has been found by a rich country like England.  It is rather the solution to be seen in Sweden and the United States, where any young man reaching a certain level of attainment who wants to go to university, follow a degree course or some similarly advanced training can borrow from State agencies the necessary finance to put him through.  He can borrow it at almost negligible rates of interest.  Then he pays it back afterwards.</P>
    <P>What could be fairer?  Surely acquiring a degree, as well as enriching other aspects of life, should increase the financial earning capacity of the man, and so it is reasonable that he should be able to pay that back afterwards.  That is something the Government would do well to inquire into here.  If we do that, we shall remove many of the legitimate <i>ad misericordiam</i> appeals made at present to found universities in very many extra centres.  Universities would be founded in centres only when the existing facilities were used up and there was a legitimate demand for facilities in those regions, but a demand based on something more than an <i>ad misericordiam</i> appeal.</P>
    <P>I hope that Government policy is not using rules of thumb too freely.  I have a suspicion that the grants are tending a great deal towards a capitation basis, so much per student. That is a very easy yardstick, but a very fallacious one because the costs per head of producing in a small unit are higher than the average. These can be accounted for by the fact that the product has the advantages of the smaller units and makes a certain and a different type of contribution to the national welfare. From calculations, you can say that every medical student exported from this country costs from £2,000 to £3,000 of the taxpayers' money.  That <Col N="942" /> is done by dividing the total spent by the number of students.  In any of our medical schools and in the medical school I know best, that of U.C.C. where there are some 20 students in the faculty, if the numbers increase by 25 per cent.  the extra cost is almost negligible because the same staff, or the same staff with very few minor additions, will cater for that same unit. Just as in the case of producing 1,000 extra gallons of milk for export, you are working on a differential here also.</P>

      <P>May I suggest that this again is a matter that should appropriately come up on a special Vote, on a Vote for the Department of Education.  The Senator will have an opportunity of dealing with that later on.  On this, we have to confine ourselves to broad outlines of Government policy and not to matters of detail.

      <P>I appreciate that, a Chathaoirligh.  There is one other matter which, I think, is very much a matter of Government policy, that is, the development of tourism. During the year, we have had Bills increasing the grants for the development of tourism.  We all appreciate the part that tourism can play but let us not be led away by the magnitude of the figures, £38,000,000, because as has been pointed out, these include the visits of ordinary business men to this country.  Moreover, they also include the returning immigrants.  We have had a period of very heavy emigration for the past four or five years and surely it is only logical that, due to that alone, there should have been a great increase in the <Col N="943" /> number of so-called tourists coming back to the country.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that certain progress is being made, but progress is slow. It is very hard to assess the number of real tourists, the people who would not have come here but for our advertisements.  The work of building hotel accommodation has been given high priority by the Government and the grants are exceedingly generous. On the basis of the best information I can get, an extra hotel bedroom costs somewhere between £2,000 and £6,000.  What I am worried about is that our whole approach seems to lack originality.  If we have not got originality in the tourist trade, we have got nothing in it.</P>
      <P>I would suggest that we should explore very carefully the question of establishing farm family holidays.  In America, this is called the dude ranch system, where people who are cooped up in the cities over the greater part of the year like to sample the free open spaces in what they regard as countryside living.  I think we are ideally placed for that. Including rural dwellers, teachers and some others who might participate in such a scheme, we have a potential of 300,000 homes.  If we got only five per cent. of those, that is 15,000, to participate and they had to add an extra room or two to their houses to cater for their guests at certain periods of the year, that would provide twice 15,000 or 30,000, new bedrooms.  The magnitude of that can be gauged by the fact that the total existing hotel accommodation is only 14,000.  I would suggest to Senators who know the country very well that the cost of adding two extra rooms to an hotel is from £4,000 to £12,000.  However, the cost of their erection in some of our better rural centres would be a fraction of that.  I should like Government policy to be so framed as to give some encouragement to such a development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want now to touch on foreign policy.  I think we are right in believing that since the appointment of our new Taoiseach last July, there are welcome <Col N="944" /> signs of a change in foreign policy and a more realistic approach. Admittedly, we have not yet seceded from the disastrous vote for the discussion on Red China in U.N.O.  Indeed, we subscribed to that again last September.  However, since then, we have been doing everything we can to show what bad fellows these Chinese really are.</P>

      <P>Our efforts on Tibet were quite successful.  There, we performed a legitimate function.  In many ways, that function is serving to counteract some of the harm done by some of the other votes.  During the past few days, our Minister for External Affairs has been very vocal in condemning the barbarism of Red China in her treatment of two bishops.  Bishop Walsh has been sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment.  The pronouncements of the Minister for External Affairs in the past few days are a hopeful sign.  I hope that we shall temper our enthusiasm to become, as it were, the rebel leader of all the anti-colonials.  I hope that we shall temper that with what should be our proper function, namely, to become, as it were, the conscience always speaking on the side of right and always supporting right.  The rôle of a small nation is really that of conscience because a small nation never has great power.  It has, however, principles and it can always enunciate those as and when occasion demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The outstanding principle at issue at the moment is the question of Communism <i>versus</i> the rest.  Our Minister for External Affairs will do great good if he joins himself and his policy to &ldquo;the rest&rdquo;.  The Russian leader promising peace and talking about disarmament on his visit to other countries can be regarded with nothing but suspicion because, simultaneously <Col N="945" /> with these pronouncements, he boasts of the extraordinary progress made by Russia in the armaments race.  The Communist philosophy is committed to world domination. That has been written down. It has been repeated year in and year out.  Every step taken, every attempt at a pseudo-rapprochement, is just another rung in the ladder to world domination.  Talks, treaties and everything else are all part of the plan. Treaties will be kept only so long as they help the Communist rise to world domination.  We would, of course, at no time do anything to prevent treaties. By all means, let agreements be made. We are happy that they are made. Let us, however, always raise the red flag&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Our Taoiseach has stressed the need of finding our place in Europe.  We have the Inner Six and the Outer Seven.  We are watching where we can join.  We recognise we can no longer exist as an isolated unit.  First things first: if one is in a tight corner, what type of ally does one want?  Is it one who merely wants to share the spoils at the end or is it someone who is prepared to take his place in the face of danger? From that point of view, it is essential that we should now reconsider our attitude to NATO.  By decision of the Inter-Party Government in 1948, we remained outside NATO.  Possibly <Col N="946" /> the Fianna Fáil Party are today feeling proud that that was not their decision.  I believe the decision was wrong.  I believe it was cowardly at the time because the future of mankind hung in the balance.  Why should we hold back?  We shall have to take our part in a defensive group, a group formed for the protection of Western Europe.  I believe no Irishman will condemn the Government if the Government reverses that decision now.</P>
      <P>Finally, let us not be scared about all this talk of nuclear war.  Surely, as Christian people, we believe there is a God.  Cradled in that belief, we should face the future with hope and confidence and, if we do so, we shall play our part as a small but Christian community.</P>

      <P>We are afforded an opportunity on this Bill to review Government policy and Government activities.  Indeed it is one of the few opportunities we get in the Seanad. It is the function of an Opposition to criticise, when criticism is necessary. That criticism would we would hope, be constructive criticism.  It is also the function of an Opposition to provide alternative Government.  Anybody who has followed the proceedings in our Parliament over the years will agree that there has certainly been no lack of criticism of Government policy and Government activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like now to refer to a statement one hears from time to time that there is really little or no difference between the Fine Gael Party and the Fianna Fáil Party.  Seemingly these critics think that there should be an exceedingly sharp and clearly defined difference between the Party in Government and the Party, or Parties, in Opposition.  They seem to expect extremes, a well-defined Left and a well-defined Right, black and white.  They seem to want distinct differences even in political philosophy.  They seem to look for the sort of development we had in England in recent years with the Conservatives and private enterprise aligned on the one side and a Socialist philosophy on the other. But even in England it is apparent <Col N="947" /> now that this idea of extremes as between Government and Opposition is losing its appeal.  Already the electorate has shown its disapproval and dissatisfaction with the idea of swinging from the nationalisation of major industries under one Government to a complete reversal of that policy under its successor on a margin of a few votes perhaps.</P>
    <P>The possibility of a swing of government from one side to the other would destroy confidence and a sense of stability in the State.  In the U.S.A., there are the Democrats and the Republicans, and between each of those two Parties, there is not a very discernible difference, when one sees them as we do sitting back and looking on from outside.  In fact, there is not very much difference between them, and yet there is criticism of Government actions of an active and a vivid nature and they provide also an alternative Government without advocating a changing of the system.  I suggest here in our State we do not need or want any great change.</P>
    <P>We have the Fianna Fáil Party and the Fine Gael Party providing the right degree of criticism and opposition based on the same political philosophy in which the question at issue is how best to achieve agreed aims, rather than creating basic political changes.  We do not want big political changes in our Constitution, or in our system of Government, but we sometimes need a change of personnel&mdash;a new look, a different look&mdash; to carry out the operations that are necessary to achieve the aims which we all have for the prosperity of our economy, and the employment and happiness of our people.  We do not want any more revolutions here.  We have had enough revolutions in our country and, indeed, it is now time to get down and build up our economy and not engage ourselves in fruitless political controversies.</P>
    <P>For instance, in the beginning of our State we had the original Cumann na nGaedheal Government which we must thank for setting up the basic institutions of our State, both political and economic.  After them, the <Col N="948" /> Fianna Fáil Government came into office in 1932 and carried on an intense programme of industrialisation. That was a very desirable step, and one that was absolutely necessary. When Fianna Fáil had been in office for a long time, it was apparent that this industrialisation was achieving only part of our fundamental national aim and providing only industries dealing with our home market, the domestic market.  I think it is not unfair to say there was almost an undue emphasis on industrialisation to a certain degree, rather overlooking the aims and the claims of agriculture.</P>
    <P>Then, in the Fine Gael Party, as was manifested when the inter-Party Government came into power, the emphasis in policy was laid upon agriculture, mainly because of the dominating personality of the present Leader of the Fine Gael Party whose main interest was in agriculture.  In that way, when again the Fianna Fáil Party came into power, they were heard to talk more about agriculture. Furthermore, for the first time, under the inter-Party Government, fiscal incentives which I have advocated for many years, together with many other business men, were introduced.</P>
    <P>As a result of all that, when the present Government came into power, it was found that they further developed incentives to exports and thus we have the position today which came with a proper balance of policy as a result of the two sides going in and coming out of Government.  Today we have established a much better balance, as a result of the interchanges of Government, in our present Government policy on agriculture. One of the most startling and satisfactory happenings of this year is the fact that there is such a dramatic rise in industrial exports for the first time to fill what was a very dangerous gap caused by the fall in agricultural exports this year.</P>
    <P>I submit to those people who are saying there is no difference between the two major Parties that they are doing a disservice to the country and preventing us from getting down to a normal and business-like outlook on the running of our country in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="949" /> It was Senator O'Brien, I think, who remarked that the centre of gravity of public life is now shifting from political to economic issues.  Instead of, as I said, arguing about major political Parties, we now urgently require to work out a system under our existing political philosophy.  We urgently need to develop agricultural &mdash;that goes without saying&mdash;industrial and invisible exports.  Those are the three exports we need and it is on increasing exports that emphasis must be placed at the moment, if this country is not only to expand and advance its standard of living but even to maintain the standard we have at present.</P>
    <P>Apropos of that, I should like to reply here to a mis-statement which I think was probably not intended, by Senator Quinlan, on the question of the standard of living to which Mr. Conroy of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union referred recently with regard to the idea of a £10 per week minimum wage for workers.  Senator Quinlan said that proposition by Mr. Conroy was attacked.  As I happen to be one of the people concerned in answering Mr. Conroy on that subject, I should like to point out that the proposition was not attacked.  It was not attacked on the basis of what should be paid but on the basis of what could be paid, which is a different thing.</P>
    <P>Ministers, including the Taoiseach, economists and employers generally, merely stated that if Mr. Conroy and the trade unions of this country wished to have this standard which they set at £10 a week minimum&mdash;which I do not think is a high minimum; I should like to see a higher minimum paid&mdash;it can be paid only out of extra work and extra production.  We asked the people who want those things to come together with the people who are putting up the capital&mdash;State capital or private capital&mdash;in such a way that we can produce more and that £10 will not only be the minimum wage, but that the minimum will be much higher.  To say that we attacked the proposition that people should have £10 a week minimum wage is just untrue.  It is only a waste of time for people to <Col N="950" /> come with tears in their eyes and say a man cannot live on £10 a week.  I know that, but it is a matter of what can be paid.  That is all we are saying. It is perfectly straight-forward and should not be misrepresented.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien said the centre of gravity was now shifting from political to economic issues.  I shall not say much about agriculture, because people who are in a better position to do so than I have spoken very sensibly on that subject.  Everything is being done at the moment, and all steps are being taken to see what can be done to develop our agricultural economy and to increase our agricultural exports. Even though I am not an expert.  I I think that the more efficient we make our agricultural economy, the fewer people it will employ.</P>
    <P>I happen to know of a farm in Sweden which I saw some years ago. The owner of that farm has something like 2,500 acres and it is run in the most efficient and most up-to-date manner.  I was shown around by the owner to see the work on that farm and I saw the immense amount of mechanisation used.  Only 12 men were employed.  It seems the more efficient our farms are made, and the more we put ourselves in a position to export our farm produce in such a way, and at such prices, as to make them acceptable and competitive in the foreign markets, the fewer people will be employed.  That really means it is all the more important that we should put emphasis on the further industrial expansion of this country on which, I am glad to say, much thought and money is being expended at the moment.</P>
    <P>Now that the Minister has returned, I should like to commend the grants that have been given for this purpose in the past year and particularly the fiscal incentive given to industrialists to export.  The dramatic increase in industrial exports this year is directly due to this one thing.  It is something I have advocated for years and years. I have been told by Minister for Finance after Minister for Finance that we could not afford to do these things because the Exchequer could not afford incentive concession either <Col N="951" /> in grants or particularly in fiscal incentives.</P>
    <P>The fact is now shown that we cannot afford not to afford them.  Even in the coming year, no matter how tight our finances may be, we must find ways and means to increase and step up these incentives.  It seems that many people are surprised to see the dramatic effect this year of a £10 million increase in exports in this item.  It is no surprise to me.  It is the ordinary result of doing a business-like thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>After agriculture and industry, the third industry we have in this country is tourism.  That must be regarded purely as a business proposition in which we are going to invest money in order to get money back. Our problem is to find out which is the best way to invest our money so that we will get the most dramatic and lasting returns.  Here again, I should like to say that we are beginning to think realistically and in a businesslike way on this matter.  I should like to commend the activities of Bord Fáilte which to my knowledge is doing a very good job.  From time to time, people criticise Bord Fáilte but I do not agree with such criticism.  Being in Dublin, I am rather closely associated with the activities of Bord Fáilte.  I know many of its personnel.  I think they are doing an excellent job.  Their money is being used in the right way to attract foreign tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our great handicap in dealing with <Col N="952" /> tourism at the moment is, first, the lack of hotel accommodation and, secondly, at the height of the tourist season, our deficient transport arrangements for getting people in and out of the country.  Even if we improve our transport arrangements 100 per cent., we still cannot handle the people coming here at present, not to talk of bringing in any more in the height of the tourist season.</P>
    <P>We have a comparatively small number of hotels.  We can see in the papers these days, I am glad to say, that there are plans to remedy the hotel situation.  I should like to commend the incentives that have been given for writing-off capital investment over a period of ten years which is excellent and something I welcome very much.  I think this should have been done long ago but better late than never.</P>
    <P>Although it is very important to put up big hotels in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, and such centres, what we need in this country is a chain of good hotels of a standard quality, say, 20 or 30 hotels, in rather out-of-the-way places near beauty spots. Very often, at some of our best beauty spots where we have the finest scenery, strands, beautiful bogs, hills, etc. there are no good hotels.  These places are very far away from hotels. The booking companies in America and England say it is not possible to book holidays in this country with any degree of satisfaction, unless they have a sufficient number of hotels to build up a general tour chain.  If you want to go around the country on a motor tour you may need, as is done in France, in a period of seven days to go into six or seven hotels before reaching the big cities.  It is in that kind of rural hotel that we are very lacking as regards eating accommodation, for lunches, and so on, and particularly sleeping accommodation.</P>
    <P>I had hoped at one time that some of the big brewery people would, as they have done in England and other countries, undertake investment in such a chain of hotels.  They could centralise the control from a central area and thereby establish a standard of quality in hotels all over the <Col N="953" /> country.  Our difficulty at the moment is the extraordinary variety of hotels ranging from those giving very bad service to those giving fairly good service.  One never knows exactly what one will get in any particular place.  I hope somebody will take up this idea of a chain of hotels.  I am assured that if such a thing existed it would be possible to extend the tourist season in this country.  The shortness of our tourist season is supposed to be a difficulty.  If we had sufficient hotels the time of the year would not have much influence on the filling of them, especially with our kind of climate which is without extremes of Winter or Summer.  A Canadian woman once remarked to me that in this country we have neither Summer nor Winter but always Spring and Autumn.  Spring and Autumn make a very nice climate and most people, especially those over 40 years of age, would prefer to live in an eternal Spring and Autumn than in an eternal Winter and Summer.</P>
    <P>I should like to say on this subject, in conclusion, that it is recognised, and it can be read in all the economic and financial papers nowadays, that tourism is one of the industries that is absolutely certain not only to expand but to go on expanding indefinitely. With the ease and speed of modern travel, its future is almost unlimited. It has a great potential in the future as a source of revenue.  In a country like this, where we have a very limited number of opportunities for expansion I think tourism should be regarded as a major industry for development.  As a side-line to that, when tourists come here, they expect to have something to do and something to see.</P>
    <P>Somebody said earlier today that we must have individuality here.  The tourists must have something in this country which they will not get in other countries.  There is one thing in this country which we do not appreciate and certainly we do not present properly, that is, our ancient history and historic churches and monasteries. They can be seen in the form of derelict ruins with no roofs, although they are kept in repair or, rather, disrepair by the State.  Some people in control <Col N="954" /> of these matters seem to think that there is something unaesthetic about having roofs on churches and maintain that they should be left in ruins untouched.</P>
    <P>That is absolutely ridiculous.  All these ancient churches should have their roofs restored to their original condition.  They should be living things and if possible, actually used for worship.  They should be restored to their original state as is done in Italy, France and many other countries in the world where such churches dating from the Middle Ages are roofed and the approaches to them are not covered with grass as they often are here.  To approach many of our best known abbeys and monasteries in Ireland, one has got to cross fields which are under grass and mud.  The whole thing looks uncivilised.</P>
    <P>It looks as if we do not know the value of these historic monuments. I would suggest that the matter should be taken up seriously.  People who would be sensitive in their approach to this matter would, I think, be Bord Fáilte but I am afraid that the buildings are not under their control.  I am sure that if we were to tell Bord Fáilte to repair these buildings we would be informed that they have not got the money and even if they have they would not be allowed to do the work.  Look at the wonderful buildings which we have in Cashel.  The roofs are open to the sky.  It is a sad thing to have that wonderful monument of the Middle Ages open to the sky.  You have to go up in a most dreary way to the ruins.  Here is a fine work of art in a bad condition. It is like the people long ago who would never clean pictures because they thought the dirtier the pictures were, the more artistic they were.</P>
    <P>Again, on the subject of tourism, I should like to pay a tribute in relation to the introduction of the Road Safety Bill which is now on the stocks. That was very much needed and was long overdue, especially in view of the increased traffic not only on the domestic front but on the tourist front as well.  Tourists are puzzled by the behaviour of the people on our roads. A large number of motorists are quite <Col N="955" /> unaware of the elementary rules of the road, not to speak of elementary good manners.  Therefore, I welcome very much the forthcoming legislation.  The way people use the roads is very important, not only from the tourists' point of view but from our own.</P>

      <P>If we are gearing ourselves up to the future, as we seem to be now, in relation to economic problems, it is very important that we should have some idea as to the line of country taken by the State bodies and what field of operations will be allowed to private enterprise and what chance they are to be given to work in their respective spheres.  It is important that there should not be antagonism between these two kinds of enterprise.</P>
      <P>Nowadays, we all accept that there is a place for State enterprise and private enterprise but they must not be antagonistic.  They must cooperate, co-ordinate and work together.  I am sorry to say there is a certain amount of apprehension at the moment in regard to the whole atmosphere between private enterprise and State bodies.  It can even be seen in the statements made by some of the chairmen of the State companies.  They take pleasure in stating that private enterprise has failed here and that the State bodies are doing something that private enterprise has failed to do.  On the other hand, we have chambers of commerce and individuals protesting that the State bodies are impinging on their territory unfairly.  I emphasis the word &ldquo;unfairly.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me quote from the Dublin <Col N="956" /> Chamber of Commerce Annual Report for the year 1959.  The Council in the Report say, with reference to State companies:</P>
    <P>During the year your Council was concerned at pronouncements heralding the expansion of the operation of State-sponsored Companies. There is no objection to the operation of such companies in that field of industry for which they were originally established, but their incursion into that sphere of business and industry already adequately catered for by private enterprise is viewed with considerable concern.  The Association of Chambers of Commerce of Ireland ...has agreed to prepare a memorandum on this subject during the coming year in which it is proposed to set out, <i>inter alia</i>, the unfair competition with which some traders are confronted by the operation of these State Companies.</P>
    <P>I shall content myself with making just that reference.  I hope, when this memorandum on the subject is prepared by the Chamber of Commerce, that the Government will seriously consider their recommendations because I think it will be conceded by the Government and by any previous Governments that the chambers of commerce have always been very helpful in anything concerned with the advancement of the economy of this State.  They helped to float loans at times even when they felt these loans would use moneys which could very well be used in the sphere of private enterprise which the chambers of commerce represent.</P>
    <P>Since I am on the point, I should like to make a suggestion which I think might be well worth examining. I think it was suggested by the Taoiseach at one time.  I refer to the possibility of inviting public participation in State-sponsored enterprises by way of shares.  This would mean that shareholders might then be given representation on these companies' boards of directors.  Some of these companies are already in existence and others are perhaps to be launched in the future where there is not sufficient ordinary private enterprise backing <Col N="957" /> available.  These companies could be launched under Government guarantee rather than with State capital.</P>
    <P>In the first instance, there would be the question of existing ones.  There are not very many which would be suitable for this purpose.  Perhaps, the Sugar Company would be but I would not suggest C.I.E. or the E.S.B., but there are companies that could easily be launched on to the public and in cases where other companies are required in future, rather than setting up a State company, I suggest setting up these companies under State guarantee. That has been done to a certain degree but more could be made of it under State guarantee with the shares floated on to the public market.  Then you would get over this difficulty at the moment.  At present, State companies are in a way responsible to nobody. If you ask a Minister in the Dáil a question about the operations of a company such as this, he tells you he has no function in the matter.  He has not, under the particular way in which these companies are established. If you had this idea of a certain number of directors on these companies representing the shareholders, it would mean they would have to give a report in the ordinary way to the shareholders and be questioned by them at an ordinary general meeting.  I feel that something of this kind should be examined if we are not to drift more and more into a purely State controlled economy.  This might be a happy State where you would have real semi-State bodies and half State and half private enterprise companies operating.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word about the banking system.  I am glad to see we do not hear many attacks on it nowadays, at least the ignorant attacks which used be made on it. From my own experience, I consider that our banking system works well and reasonably, and any Government direction that is needed can be made felt under the present system.  The powers of the Central Bank are being extended gradually and sensibly and I think there is a smoothly working harmony of interest between the commercial banks, the Central Bank and Ministers for Finance, which is not <Col N="958" /> generally appreciated.  I think the Minister will bear me out on this. Government policy should be to strengthen and maintain the general banking system and the harmonious relations that exist at present.</P>
    <P>My final reference is to a matter which is related to what has really been the main theme of my speech, that is, the need to develop our economy and the fact that we should all work together to do so.  I feel that our Department of External Affairs is a little too preoccupied with the pure question of international politics and perhaps diplomacy.  The emphasis is on the diplomatic side of its work, whereas I consider that in a country like ours, our foreign diplomatic missions should be concerned with, and the main aim of their operations should deal with, the fostering and promotion of trade and commerce between this and other countries.  We would do well to strengthen the operations of our missions wherever they are, with people with commercial experience and understanding.</P>
    <P>I was talking to Madame Nehru&mdash; I do not know if I mentioned this in a previous debate&mdash;when she was here recently and she told me that 90 per cent. of the work of the Indian Embassy in London is commercial. She said her work was nine-tenths commercial and only one-tenth diplomatic. We like to see our Irish diplomats in the limelight in other countries.  I am all for a strong Department of External Affairs and do not agree with these people who say our people should not go away and should not be abroad and that they are unnecessarily spending money.  I think they are very necessary but they could give far more time and energy to trade matters and to the expansion and increasing of our trade.</P>
    <P>I have a small complaint which I should like to voice, that is, that the Department of External Affairs is keeping aloof too much from the ordinary life and workings of the country. I mean the trade workings.  For instance, every year, we send delegations to the I.L.O. in Geneva, both employers' and workers' delegations.  I have gone to these conferences in <Col N="959" /> Geneva and every year I have seen other Governments, from the Iron Curtain countries right up to the United States and Britain, with trade union representatives&mdash;employers' representatives and Government representatives &mdash;working harmoniously together. What is more, they work to a brief pretty well.  They maintain their independence but act to a national brief.  I am sorry to say that, to my knowledge, the Department of External Affairs has never, during the past 20 years, or whatever period we have been going to the I.L.O., contacted employers' delegations or workers' delegations.</P>
    <P>We also go to the C.E.I.F. conference in Paris, which is the employers' side of O.E.E.C., and the Federation of Irish Industries are also represented there, but we have no contact whatever with our Government either through Industry and Commerce, or through External Affairs, as to our policy.  Even when such matters as the Common Market were being discussed, we had to find out the policy ourselves.</P>
    <P>I was talking to two British delegations in Paris at another meeting and they informed me that the previous night they had been talking to no less a person than the Prime Minister who had consulted with them about what England was doing in regard to the &ldquo;Six&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Seven&rdquo;.  The other day, at the annual meeting of the Federation of Irish Industries, there was a complaint made that the Federation knew nothing at all about what is happening in connection with the London talks.  I know that the answer given to that is that they are secret and that something might leak out, but I think that is carrying things too far. If we are engaged in international conferences, we must take into consideration the views and advice and the interests of the people who are mainly concerned. Apart from the people themselves, you have people in trade and commerce and industry.  They should be brought into consultation and into the Government's confidence.  At least the presidents should have the confidence of the people going out to represent us in other countries so that we shall appear as one and not give the impression of being at sixes and sevens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Seán Ó Donnabháin</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate but the remarks of Senator Quinlan provoke me to speak for ten minutes relative to his comments on the tuberculosis eradication scheme.  If his remarks were to be taken seriously, it would be bad for the country.  I do not think his remarks, either here or elsewhere, are always taken too seriously. However, he referred to the tuberculosis eradication scheme as a health fad and that we should seek some means to get around it.  His subsequent remarks might be relative to a scientific means of getting around it, but seeing that those words could be interpreted that we were by subterfuge, to avoid the tuberculosis eradication scheme and to get around the eradication of the disease from our livestock, I have been prompted to intervene.</P>
      <P>Experts are sometimes described as people who know more and more about less and less.  I am afraid I must classify Senator Quinlan not as an expert because he seems to know less and less about more and more.  When he comes to suggest that we should adopt the B.C.G. vaccination scheme with our cattle, he is just showing he has not the faintest idea of the position. He is dealing with matters about which he knows nothing.  B.C.G. vaccination, as we know, relates to the vaccination of the human subject to prevent subsequent infection by the tubercle bacillus, but that must be carried on in perpetuity while there is a danger of tuberculosis.  If his suggestion were adopted and if it were successful&mdash;which it would not be&mdash;we would have to vaccinate all our cattle in perpetuity with the B.C.G. vaccine in order to prevent subsequent infection. The thing would be fantastic. Twenty-five years ago, I carried out a <i>post mortem</i> on an animal vaccinated with B.C.G. against tuberculosis. Therefore, the Senator is wrong in believing nothing has been done in connection with that.  The animal was extensively affected with T.B.  To my mind, at that time, B.C.G. vaccination against T.B. was not the thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that in years to come, some system of vaccination against bovine T.B. will be developed.  I am <Col N="961" /> not saying that could not occur.  However, to suggest that in order to eradicate bovine T.B., we should vaccinate our livestock against subsequent infection is simply grotesque and is not the approach I would expect from a person who classifies himself as a scientist and derides others who do not take the scientific approach to such matters.  I should not like Senator Quinlan's remarks to be taken seriously in the Press or outside. Subsequently, he referred to other matters which I shall not deal with now.  We can read his remarks afterwards and possibly we shall find in many cases they are ridiculous, too.</P>
    <P>He referred to the dead meat trade. Undoubtedly, that would be the ideal thing, if it could be developed satisfactorily. When the price of cattle goes up, the tendency is towards live export, and when the price of cattle falls, the dead meat trade is the only outlet for the beef exporters. Any Government would be faced with difficulty in trying to develop the dead meat trade, while our live trade, especially the store trade, is conducted on such different lines.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Government and the Minister are well aware that it was what is called the American box beef deep frozen trade that facilitated our dead meat exports during the past year and not the carcass beef trade to England.  It also resulted in our acquiring a considerable amount of American dollars.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan compared the beef trade with the development of our dairy industry.  Of course, one is entirely dependent on the other.  We all know the old phrase about the land for the people and the bullocks for the road.  Now the people have the land and the more bullocks we have for the road, the better.  We cannot produce the bullocks for the road if we have not the dairy herds to produce them.  It has been mentioned that there has been an increase of 5.3 per cent.  in the number of heifers in the country.  That is a magnificent achievement when we take into account our efforts to eradicate bovine T.B. which necessitate the <Col N="962" /> elimination of a large number of dairy cows.  As the eradiction scheme proceeds in the dairying areas, more milch cows will have to be eliminated. Therefore, I was very glad to see an increase of 5.3 per cent. in the number of heifers.  The Senator also mentioned the activities of An Foras Talúntais.  They are endeavouring to get each cow to produce two calves instead of one calf.  That is what is called twinning.  The more calves we can produce, the more store cattle we can have for export, and the greater our export trade of fat cattle, the better for the country.  That is how I look at the development of our agriculture, so far as livestock is concerned.</P>
    <P>One matter which I try to publicise as much as possible is the development of the cheese industry.  I am a cheese-eater myself and I always try to convince people it is the best thing they could eat.  If the people of this country ate more cheese habitually, it would, at this time when we have to subsidise our butter exports, relieve the Exchequer and relieve the people of a lot of their ills.  Cheese is a magnificent food and when we travel outside the country, we see the extent to which it is eaten by other people.  However, I merely refer to that casually in passing.</P>
    <P>What brought me to my feet was Senator Quinlan's remarks.  He engaged the time of the House for a long period and gave an erroneous impression.  He compared the costs of the agricultural schools run by the State and those run by religious orders. That is a fallacious yardstick&mdash;he used that phrase himself&mdash;and he should know it.  One cannot compare the amount voted to the Department's schools with the amount donated to the privately-owned schools.</P>

Another matter he referred to was irrelevant because it is being dealt with in the Dáil at present.

      <P>I always like to hear Senator McGuire speak.  He always says some very relevant things. The Senator referred to the hostility between private enterprise and State enterprise.  My understanding of State enterprise, as it has operated up to the present, is that State enterprise had to do the things which private enterprise either could not or would not do.  I instance Bord na Móna, the E.S.B., Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann and Irish Shipping.  Ceimicí Teoranta was not actually a success. Nobody would touch any of these enterprises.  Nobody would touch the Glenamoy Peat Development project, which was under discussion here some time ago.  The position is that the State has to do things which private enterprise could not or would not do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Fund Bill gives us an opportunity every year to discuss every aspect of government and its working.  In that regard, some of us show an ability to deliver twin speeches, and even sometimes quin speeches.  I was interested in the remarks made by Senator McGuire in relation to private enterprise and the possibility <Col N="964" /> that opportunities might be given now to private enterprise to take over or participate in some of the existing semi-State organisations.  I noticed that he would not touch C.I.E.  I wonder why.  Does he think that private enterprise might not be able to operate as well as C.I.E.?  Perhaps it is because he thinks no money can be made out of it.</P>
      <P>I was rather interested in his reasoning. He seems to think it would be a good idea for private enterprise to enter into undertakings now which have been set up by the State.  He used the phrase &ldquo;private enterprise by way of State guarantee.&rdquo;  I think what the Senator meant was that there is money available for investment, but there is a dearth of enterprise, that the State should provide that enterprise and should also guarantee the capital, and the profits on that capital.  If that is private enterprise, it is completely divorced from what I thought constituted private enterprise, with emphasis on &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I should like now to refer to the statement of the Taoiseach when he intervened in the debate on the Vote on Account in the Dáil.  He rightly pointed out that the Estimates embodied in the Central Fund Bill show three main heads of increased expenditure. One of these&mdash;this is the one in which I am particularly interested&mdash; is the higher pay for civil servants, teachers, Garda and the Army, which, in all, amounts to over £2,000,000 in a full year.  The Taoiseach chided the Opposition for the situation which has developed.  As he expressed it, successive Governments here have in a large measure surrendered their freedom of action in respect of remuneration of public servants by their acceptance of the various arbitration agreements now in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of chiding the Opposition.  I think the Taoiseach should be congratulating himself and his Government. For the first time, for quite a long time, the Government, in the discussions on salary and wage increases for their servants, faced up to realities, accepted their responsibility and agreed to the increases in negotiation. These increases were not awarded by <Col N="965" /> any arbitrator.  They were agreed in negotiation by both sides.  The Taoiseach and his Government are to be commended on facing up to realities and accepting their responsibility.  I am told by trade union colleagues that the good example set by the Government in December was quickly followed by most semi-State undertakings and claims submitted by the trade unions in respect of the employees concerned were quickly and fairly satisfactorily settled.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach went on to say that the recent increases in wages and salaries including, I presume, the increase in the case of the Government's own servants, were not occasioned by any increase in the cost of living.  I have more respect for the Taoiseach, his ability and his experience, than to imagine that he was mistaken.  I am sure that, before the Government decided to negotiate and make an acceptable offer in respect of the claims on behalf of their own servants, they were fully aware of the statement of claim and the reasons for it.  The reasons for the recent round of wage and salary increases&mdash;the 7th round, as it is called&mdash;are clearly related to the change in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>It would be no harm to remind Senators of what happened after the 1957 Budget.  As a result of the action taken by the Government then, there was a fairly substantial increase in the cost of living.  Trade unions were urged, and encouraged, by the Taoiseach, who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce, to exercise restraint for the benefit of the economy as a whole.  The trade unions did exercise restraint, did enter into top level negotiations and discussions with employers' organisations and did agree, in the interests of the economy as a whole, not to seek increases higher than a maximum of 10/- per week&mdash;a maximum which in no way compensated for the change in the cost of living since the previous adjustment in wages and salaries.  The trade unions did exercise restraint and did respond to the appeals made at that time.  It is an undoubted fact that many of them, because of their organisational strength, could have forced increases <Col N="966" /> of a much higher level than the 10/- maximum voluntarily accepted.</P>
    <P>The trade unions behaved with a commendable restraint; they behaved in what some of us regard as a very responsible manner, having been told there was a crisis in the economy and having been asked to pull together and accept this lowering in the standard of living in the interests of the economy as a whole.  The employers and the Government certainly did not suppose that the trade unions were accepting a permanent reduction in the standard of living of their members.  That was a voluntary maximum accepted by the trade unions in the interests of the nation, and in the interests of the economy, to permit the economy to recover.  It was in everybody's mind that when the economy had recovered the trade unions would seek to restore their former standard.</P>
    <P>The seventh round of increases, which was referred to by the Taoiseach, was based on the change in the cost of living since the fifth round increase.  The sixth round, the flat increase of 10/-, was a partial compensation for the change in the cost of living accepted at that time in the interests of the economy.  When the trade unions thought the economy had sufficiently recovered, they came back in the seventh round for a recovery of the standard of living of their members. It was clearly based on the cost of living.</P>
    <P>I recollect reading in the newspapers a report of the statement of claim lodged by the Civil Service Organisations with the Government. It was clearly stated that it was a claim for a 12½ per cent. increase on the 1955 standard of salaries, by reason of a change in the cost of living since that time, less the 10/- flat&mdash;or 7/6d., I think, for females&mdash; which was accepted after negotiation by the organisations, I think, about 1958.  We can put it out of our minds that, when the Taoiseach was speaking in the debate in the Dáil, he was in any way misled, or in any way in error, as to the basis of the seventh round of increases initiated in the autumn of 1959.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="967" /> Another relevant point about these increases, and it was a welcome point, was that they had been negotiated quickly, satisfactorily and with very little industrial disturbance.  I find it difficult to think of strikes which have arisen out of the claims being pursued by the trade unions in the seventh round increase.  There may have been one or two, but they have not been widespread.  That, of itself, seems to me to be a recognition of the merits of the claims, made by the trade unions, and it is also an indication of the ability of industry, generally, to meet those claims.  In those circumstances, and with the restraint to which I have referred following the 1957 Budget, the trade union movement would have expected some recognition by the Taoiseach and the Government of that restraint, instead of being pilloried in the Taoiseach's speech as the bad boys and the people who, because of the action they have taken, will bring ill to the economy of the country.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that an attempt is being made and will be made to make the trade unions the scapegoat for the failure of the Government to redeem their pre-election promises and possibly also the scapegoat for what the Taoiseach apparently envisages as the gloomy outlook for the economy in the next year.  Reference was made in the Taoiseach's speech to the effect on the cost of living of the increases secured by the trade unions.  I accept, and every realistic persons accepts, that in quite a few industries and services, it is inevitable that increases in prices will result from increases in wages.  For example, reference was made by the Taoiseach to the bakery trade, but, in the whole economy it is clear that the increases secured by the trade unions can be absorbed without any increase in prices.</P>
    <P>I say that for two reasons: first, the level of profits being made by employing organisations and, secondly, the improved productivity as a result of co-operation between management and employees.  I notice that some up-to-date information with regard to the level of profits was given by Deputy <Col N="968" /> Casey in the Dáil.  At column 471, volume 180, of the Official Report, he pointed out that of some 150 public companies who publish their trading accounts, approximately 50 of those publish them at the end of the year, 31st December, so the results of those 50 are not yet available, but of the other 100, their accounting year ends on some other date during the year. Deputy Casey said that he had looked at the trading result of 93 of those public companies and in respect of those 93, he says:</P>
    <P>...taking the financial year 1957-58 as against the financial year 1958-59 their increase in profits amounted to 42 per cent.</P>
    <P>I notice he challenged the Taoiseach, the Government or anybody else to dispute those figures and I do not see&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be glad to look them up because this information comes from the trade union movement and, so far as I know, it is correct and was not taken out simply for propaganda purposes.  It is clear that there has been that increase in profits.  I am not criticising firms for increasing their efficiency and making their profits.  The point I am making is that there was that ability to absorb the increased wages.  The trade union movement cannot be blamed or criticised, after accepting the restraint since 1957-58, for moving in 1959 to try to recover the standard of living for their members when we have this improvement in industry and business generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, in regard to productivity, I notice in an article published in the <i>Irish Times</i> by Mr. Garrett Fitzgerald that improved productivity in 1959 went half way towards wiping out the impact of the seventh round upon production costs.  He estimated that if the same rate of improvement continued in 1960, the cost per unit of <Col N="969" /> output at the end of that year would be no higher than at the end of 1958; that, on the other hand, if the growth of productivity is reduced, if it is only half the 1959 rate, the labour cost per unit produced would have risen by only 2 per cent.  in two years.</P>
    <P>He goes on to explain that that does not necessarily mean that there would be an increase of 2 per cent.  in the price of the end product.  As a high proportion of the goods consumed here are imported, the increase in the general price level of goods would not be 2 per cent.  but one-third of one per cent.</P>
    <P>I must point out here that Mr. Fitzgerald was, as he said himself, relating these figures to manufacturing industries only.  However, other wages and salaries outside the manufacturing industries have risen, as, for example, those of civil servants.  Some people seem to assume that civil servants are a sort of archaic body composed of people who are reluctant or opposed to improving methods, improving organisation, cutting costs.  My experience is quite the contrary.  I do not deal with civil servants but in the trade union movement I deal with reorganisation.  It is a fact that if a clear, intelligent picture can be put across to the workers, they are always keen to make the job more efficient.  There is always that natural pride in doing things better, in getting a better result.  I feel sure the situation must be the same in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>From what I know of the leaders of the Civil Service organisations, I think that, in ability and intelligence, they rank very high.  I should imagine there would be anxiety and readiness to co-operate amongst the ranks of the civil servants to improve productivity and to increase efficiency and thereby lessen the eventual cost to the Exchequer of the increase in wages and salaries granted to them by the Government.</P>
    <P>In all these efforts to improve productivity, it must always be remembered that the initiative must lie with the employing organisation, that the initiative must lie with the management. <Col N="970" /> I think that point was made previously.  I was rather surprised to hear Senator McGuire say today that the trade unions should be ready to co-operate to increase productivity. It is not generally known but it is a fact that for years the trade unions had to press against the opposition of some employing organisations to have the National Productivity Committee set up in this country&mdash;I think one of the last countries in Europe to set up a National Productivity Committee.  I suppose people would think that that would be because of the reluctance of the trade unions, of the opposition of the trade unions. Instead, the opposition was from the other side.  The trade unions had to press for years and to express an anxiety to have a National Productivity Committee set up.  It is now set up and we need not go back too far but let bygones be bygones.</P>
    <P>The point must be made clear that employing organisations or employers cannot pontificate and say that the trade unions must be ready to co-operate to increase productivity.  They are ready all the time but the initiative and the planning is the responsibility of management and of the employing organisation.  You will find that where they know their job, where they know what they are talking about, where they have intelligent initiative, there is generally no difficulty whatever in getting the co-operation of the trade unions and the workers represented by those trade unions.  They should remember, however, that the aim should be to increase productivity and not to increase unemployment or increase emigration.</P>
    <P>I do not want to appear critical of employers or employers' organisations. I think there is a need&mdash;I shall come back to this again&mdash;for co-operation all round to improve the economy of the country.  In my time in trade union affairs, I have dealt with one particular body of employers.  I often say hard things about them.  I often fight with them.  I was shocked on an occasion some months ago when there was a national gathering of employers and trade union representatives to find that the employers I had been dealing <Col N="971" /> with were in fact 20th century, whereas many of those in Ireland are mid-Victorian. I was really horrified at their attitude&mdash;people who quite obviously imagine that workers are some sort of inferior beings and that employers are from some other planet but do not live here in Ireland at all. The more quickly they change that attitude, the better for themselves and the better for the people they are employing. There is a need in this country not alone to have adult education of workers and of trade union representatives, and we do our best in that respect, but there is also a very clear need for the education of management and employers.</P>
    <P>I referred to the increase in the cost of living which the Taoiseach says will result from the increases secured by workers.  It should be noted that this seventh round started in the early autumn of 1959.  Quite a body of workers had secured their increases before the end of 1959.  That must have influenced the Government in agreeing at negotiation level in, I think, the week before Christmas to give an increase to their servants.  They were probably influenced by the fact that there had been this general movement in wages and salaries, certainly wages, in outside industry.  They are to be complimented on facing up to realities and accepting their responsibilities. Now they make me wonder whether they did accept responsibilities at all on that occasion because I notice that when the Taoiseach was speaking he reminded us as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When I was speaking in the Adjournment Debate last December, I said that there was no factor operating, or likely to operate in the foreseeable future, which could cause the upward movement in prices to be resumed, except a general increase in wages.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reference is Column 321 of Volume 180 of the Official Report. When I read that, I said that he must have been talking about December, 1958, because already, in 1959, he was agreeing to an upward rise in wages for all the employees in the State, but no.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="972" /> I find that debate was on 10th and 11th December, 1959, and, I think, already they were in the process of making offers to the representatives of their civil servants.  I should imagine so because the agreement was announced just a few days before Christmas and at that time, apparently, the Taoiseach was saying that there was no factor operating which would lead to an increase in prices except a general increase in wages to which he and his Government apparently agreed at that time and rightly so.</P>
    <P>What has happened in regard to prices?  This round of increases, as I have said, started early in the autumn of 1959.  One would expect by the time the mid-February consumer price index came to be published, that if it were to affect prices, it would have already given some such indication. In fact&mdash;the Minister and his colleagues have boasted about this&mdash;the mid-February figure shows no increase. There may be a fractional element but it is still expressed as 144. May I ask the Minister am I wrong again?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was 144 before there was this seventh round of increases at all.  It was 144 in November and 144 in February.  Where were all these price increases?  When are they to come?  I hope the Taoiseach was not giving them the green light because that is certainly the impression he gave me when I read his speech.  As I said before, some charges are bound to increase&mdash;transport, for example. The increase in transport charges was taken into account in arriving at the mid-February figure, so that has been disposed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that certain undertakings are only too anxious to find an excuse to increase their prices.  Last year, I happened to be prosperous enough to buy a suit.  I hope that after the 1st April I shall be able to do likewise. Anyway, the tailor from whom I bought the suit last year sent me a note some few weeks ago to say that in accordance with the increases in wages in the tailoring trade their prices, in common with those of many other <Col N="973" /> firms, would be raised by approximately 10 per cent.  on and from the 1st January.  If I went in now it would be all right.  He would not charge me 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>I felt inclined to congratulate the union representing the tailoring employees in the city on getting an increase of over 10 per cent.  if the tailor was going to increase his prices by 10 per cent.  Labour is not the only element that enters into the price of the end product.  I found it fantastic.  The employees had got an increase but they had not got anything like a 10 per cent. increase.  You will find the sort of businesses which are only too anxious to avail of every excuse to step up their prices.  I thought it would have been more statesmanlike for the Government to advise firms to restrain any increase in prices and try to avoid an increase in prices by improving productivity and by absorbing wage increases in their profits where it was possible to do so, instead of pointing to what the Taoiseach referred to, I think, as the inevitable rise in prices.</P>
    <P>I think that is a very poor attitude for the Government to adopt. To my mind, it certainly is not very wise.  I say that because the trade unions cannot be expected to be restrained or responsible when they see other groups without any restraint and without that sense of responsibility. If they see employers, if they see traders, increasing their prices needlessly&mdash;I stress the word &ldquo;needlessly&rdquo;&mdash;apparently with the encouragement and blessing of the Government, then the trade unions will react and they are not again going to accept voluntarily a reduction in the standard of living of their people.</P>
    <P>Since I read it I have wondered what was the purpose of the Taoiseach's speech and why he took the line he did.  It could well be that he was preparing the ground for a future announcement by the Government of subsidies to agriculture.  I may say that if certain sections of agriculture need help, then, I for one would not oppose assistance if it was necessary and helpful but such subsidisation, such assistance, should be advocated and argued on its merits and not by <Col N="974" /> way of an attack on the trade union movement for trying to restore the standard of living of their people.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement should not be criticised&mdash;I am making this point strongly&mdash;for endeavouring, and largely succeeding, to restore the standard of living that their members enjoyed prior to the election of this Government.  We cannot accept that because the Fianna Fáil Government are in office the standard of living of the trade union members must necessarily be lower.  One of the results of this line being adopted is that to me, at least, it seems to tend to set one section of the community against another.</P>
    <P>It may be good politics to go to the farmers and say: &ldquo;It is all the fault of these trade unions, of the organised industrial workers who without regard to your needs have increased their purchasing power.&rdquo;  I know that in the trade union movement there is a great deal of respect for farmers and farmers' organisations, particularly the younger farmers.  We regard them as intelligent, go-ahead and really fine types.  The trouble may be, of course, that they do not get into a position to operate their farms until they are far too old.  I have been impressed by the work done by such voluntary rural organisations as Muintir na Tíre, Macra na Feirme, the I.C.A. and Muintir na Tuaithe.  These voluntary organisations have, in my opinion, been doing a great deal of good for the farmers and for life in the rural community.</P>
    <P>With the good work which they are doing, and with what is obviously a better standard of farming, I am surprised to find that there has been this drop in farm revenue. Whether that is real I do not know because I noticed, subsequent to the Taoiseach's speech, that when the census of stock on the land at the end of the year was published it showed there was a big rise as compared with the previous year.  In other words the stock, in another sense of the word, was higher.  It was not sold but it is still there and still represents wealth and I hope it will be sold at good prices later on.</P>

      <P>I am not entering into a discussion or argument about farming and the effects and evils of the drop in income for the farming community.  What I say is that it is most unwise for any Government to start putting one section of the community against another.  I am afraid that is what they are attempting to do in blaming the trade unions for doing what was their duty and what it was manifestly right to do in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>This Government has been calling for cooperation and the Taoiseach has been very prominent in that respect.  I think he has been getting cooperation.  He has been asking for cooperation from all sections of the community to improve our economy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The younger generation especially are not too interested in that.  They want to get on with the job of trying to improve the country. I hope that that is still the attitude of the Government but I doubt if it is the attitude of some Ministers.</P>
      <P>I have referred at length to the Taoiseach's speech and I shall leave it at that, but I read, with a sense of horror, a speech made by another Minister reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 22nd of this month.  It was a speech by the Minister for Defence. Apparently &ldquo;defence&rdquo; is now interpreted as defence of the Irish language. The Minister for Defence has his views and I am sure they are sincere views.  He is entitled to them but this is the sort of thing he is saying:</P>
      <P>The descendants of the people of Dublin Castle are still amongst us and the people of the generation which had carried on the fight for national ideals were growing old.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="976" /> He then introduces the words &ldquo;fifth column.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The fifth column against the language and against nationality was now preparing to fight.</P>
    <P>An attack, according to Deputy K. Boland, on the Irish language was:</P>
    <P>coming from people who purported to be educational experts,&mdash;</P>
    <P>I do not know who these are&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;from politicians who pretended they were working for the welfare of the nation, even though there was not an atom of nationalism in them. It was also coming from a new organisation that was non-political in name but whose object was to do away with the independence of this country and place us once again in the British Empire.</P>
    <P>If you read that 30 years ago it would be too bad.  Are we or are we not becoming an adult democracy?  This sort of nonsense is deplorable from a Minister of State.  As I said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I say, I hoped we were becoming an adult democracy <Col N="977" /> and I think we are.  There is a feeling amongst the younger generation that once a Government is elected that, even though they may not support the Party from which that Government is drawn, they are prepared to cooperate and work with that Government. Somebody remarked &ldquo;sometimes&rdquo;. Perhaps that is so but there is an increasing inclination to work with the Government, that it is the rightful Government, that we should support it and work with it.  I am beginning to doubt, however, whether the present Government, in spite of what they said about cooperation, really want cooperation and are not more interested in scoring Party propaganda points.</P>

      <P>I would not do that. I am not able to do it, unfortunately. Anyway, I have not got the responsibility of the Government nor the responsibility of a Minister.  I say, and I want to stress it, that there is that readiness among all sections of the community, and among the trade unions, to cooperate with the Government, irrespective of whether they are Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour. They are the Government rightly elected and the people to whom I have referred are prepared to co-operate with them.  Yet the Leader of the Government misinterprets the reason for the last wage increases and he is attempting to blame the trade unions for whatever ills he might foresee. I hope those forebodings will not be realised.  The trade union movement is still prepared to co-operate but it will be an evil day, indeed, if by reason of Government intervention or encouragement, or what might be interpreted as that, prices are to be increased when there is no need to increase them.  If that happens, there will quickly be an eighth round of increases.</P>

      <P>I should like to say something, first of all, about the Department of Education and to refer to the fact that although we have a first class organisation, the Central <Col N="978" /> Statistics Office, for the compilation of statistics, facts and figures, the Department of Education is singularly lacking in certain statistics relating to that Department.  Even those figures that do appear are three years late. The Department of Education produces its report at least two years late, sometimes three years late.  I should like to make a plea to the Minister, and through him to the Government, for a production of more up-to-date facts and figures about education today.</P>
      <P>Why could we not be told, at least, what happened in our schools and educational system for the year 1958-59, ending in July 1959, or the year before that?  Is it part of Government policy to keep us in ignorance of present facts on education?  I make that point and that criticism on the grounds, not of detail, but of general Government policy, of general Government failure to be concerned with what is going on now.</P>

      <P>When an attempt is made to find out what is going on now, there is always a coverup. Either the facts are not available or the Minister says he is not going to spend the money necessary to find out.  We in this country do not know how many classes of over 50, or over 60 or over 70 exist in Dublin or in Cork, or how many classes are held two in a room or three in a room. When a responsible Deputy asks the Minister for such figures, the Minister says: &ldquo;I do not know what the figures for overcrowding are, but I can give you an average for Dublin or for Cork.&rdquo;  The average for Dublin, when you divide the number of teachers into the number of pupils, turns out to be 43 to a class and the Minister is content with that kind of information. There may be tiny classes and monstrously big classes.  Not only is the Minister not prepared to give an answer, but he is not prepared to find out.  Why?  Because he is afraid of the facts he might discover.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter would arise more relevantly on the Appropriation Bill.  The Senator has mentioned the point that there may be 43 in a class.  If the Senator were to make the point that classes ought to be smaller, it would be relevant, but I doubt if this kind of case is relevant on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, the point I am making is that in order to decide whether classes ought to be smaller, you must really know what size the classes are and you cannot really do that unless you know the facts.  I pass on from that having made the point that unless you know the basic facts you cannot plan for education.  If you produce a report two or three years late, then you are not doing your duty as a Minister or your duty as a Department.</P>
      <P>I come now to Government policy regarding school buildings and I would suggest that Government policy is mistaken by reason of the fact that it does not recognise in practice the urgency of providing more space for schoolchildren.  It provides overlavish schools in tiny quantities instead of producing what might be called utility schools with a life much less than these big lavish establishments but which would fulfil the immediate needs of children now.  I should like to see the Government turning to the production of utility schools and utility training colleges with the purpose of dealing now or within a measurable time with the problems of overcrowding in classes.  I would suggest that Government policy is to spend over lavishly on too few schools. Over-lavish expenditure in this way leads, in fact, to smaller school space being provided per £.  If you spend £5,000 or £6,000 per classroom on a new school, you are not from the point of view of the children getting value for the money; you are providing far too little space for the expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see a plan for the relief of overcrowding on the basis of the pressing needs of the children.  I have indicated that the Minister does not know the facts and I would like to urge him to find them out.  The Council of Education has urged the necessity <Col N="980" /> of having no class, now, as soon as possible, of more than 40 children and, as soon as it can be managed, none over 30.  How the Minister can pretend to pay attention to such a recommendation unless he knows what the facts are, I do not know.  I do not know how he can even move towards that figure unless he knows what is the position.</P>
    <P>That derives to some extent from what I call our system of dual irresponsibility.  If you criticise the Department you are told: &ldquo;We have not got the facts because the school managers have not given them to us.&rdquo; An example of that is when you ask for details.  If you criticise a manager for not performing his functions as you think they should be performed the manager says: &ldquo;We can do nothing; the Department will not help us and we have not got funds.&rdquo;  This system of dual irresponsibility means a passing back and forth of the buck and of responsibility and very little is done. There are exceptions of course, but in fact a system whereby the blame can always be put on the other fellow, on the other element, on the other section of our education management, is a bad one.</P>
    <P>A good deal is spoken in this country about parents' rights and a lot of lip service is paid to parental rights, but the Department of Education has no machinery at all for consulting the opinions of parents.  I should like to suggest&mdash;I do not want to develop the idea at length&mdash;that the Department would be well-advised to encourage the setting up in relation to national schools of parent-teacher groups, advisory bodies, councils, committees &mdash;they need not be given a pompous title&mdash;but some place where parents' opinions might be voiced and where they could listen to the problems of the teachers and <i>vice versa.</i>  If such groups were set up in relation to primary schools, the results would be excellent and we would be indulging in active service on behalf of parents' rights instead of being content with lip service regarding reforms and remedies.</P>
    <P>With regard to criticism on matters of education, Fr. Perrott, I think, the head of Mungret College, has said <Col N="981" /> that parents were too often reluctant to criticise because the schools were either managed or run by a religious order.  He said, quite rightly, that if parents felt an injustice was being done they should not be scared of criticising.  I suggest that an individual parent might be more diffident about doing that in those circumstances than a recognised committee or advisory council of parents.  Parents should have some such machinery.  They should be invited to give their opinions about the school and to come and listen to some of the problems that arise on the other side.</P>
    <P>The problem of heating and cleaning schools is one about which some parents feel very strongly without realising what is the basis of expenditure. In the Estimates, one of the items where there is a reduction this year is £7,000 for heating and cleaning primary schools.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to turn to the question of the Universities.  I noticed with some distress that the Minister is reported as saying in the Dáil that he is opposed to any kind of amalgamation between Trinity College and the National University, or University College, Dublin, because of certain facts which he put before the Dáil which, in my opinion, were not correctly interpreted.  The way in which he put it was that the Irish people will remember that during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries Irish Catholics who wanted to attend Trinity College could not do so without abjuring their faith. It should be stated that the disabilities to which Catholics were subjected were done away with as far back as 1793 up to which time it was necessary&mdash; quite wrongly and without any justification&mdash;to take a form of religious oath.  Such an oath continued in Oxford and Cambridge, as I understand <Col N="982" /> it, up to 1890 and for that reason Lord Acton, instead of going to an English university, went to Munich.</P>
    <P>I think we can at least recognise the fact that in that matter, while in earlier centuries Trinity College was very much in the wrong, it was, in fact, 100 years ahead of Oxford and Cambridge in removing this disability placed upon Catholics.  I think it is only fair to remember that.  I had a great-uncle, Fr. Eugene Sheehy, who was educated at the Irish College in Paris because if he had gone to Maynooth, he would have had to take an oath of allegiance to the British Crown.</P>

      <P>I was saying when we adjourned that it was certain that Trinity College was not in fact excluding Catholics in the 19th century, that they were not excluded by any Trinity ban or any ecclesiastical ban any more than the students of the Sorbonne are now.

I noticed with interest that, according to the Minister, it is the Government's intention to set up a new University commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend expanding on it, my main point being that it would be a pity if the commission were to be set up on the basis that the Belfield principle has already been accepted, because it seems that the whole University situation ought to be reviewed by such a commission, if it is to be set up.  On the point of the possible co-ordination of the universities, it seems to me that the Minister ought to be interested in lines along which this might be established.  I should like to make the point that although in certain subjects co-ordination would not be either valuable or feasible, for the simple reason that the lecture rooms in both Universities are already full, in other fields and subjects, it might be quite possible to establish, by co-ordination, a degree of specialisation as between the universities, and establish a basis for co-operation and co-ordination for particular subjects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="986" /> Now I should like to turn to the Government policy on the allocation of grants to the Universities.  I should like to make the point that under various heads, the Government decide to subsidise people coming into this country, rightly, I think&mdash;tourists, foreign investors, and so on&mdash;because they bring money into the country.  We subsidise them, in fact, through Bord Fáilte, through various development projects, and so on.  In fact, we are subsidising tourists who come into the country to spend, perhaps, a few weeks here, but I think we are failing to see that a strong justification can be made for similar subsidisation of overseas students who come, not just for a few weeks, but for four years to our Universities, bringing money in with them.  The point has been made several times here by my colleague.  Senator Stanford, and it seems to me to be a very sound one, that, in a sense, in supplying University facilities which are sufficiently good to attract overseas students, we are attracting people to the country, who, during their four years or more of residence, are bringing quite a lot more money into the country than their equivalents among tourists.</P>
    <P>Speaking for my own University, I can say that quite large numbers of overseas students are attracted by what Trinity College has to offer.  We are proud of that fact and proud to welcome them.  We also remember that for the country they represent a big financial asset.  Therefore, that is a point that should not be forgotten in whatever policy is laid down by the Government for the allocation of funds to Universities.</P>
    <P>I should also like to make the point briefly, <i>en passant</i>, that our very buildings in Trinity College are part of the national architectural heritage. I am aware, of course, that there are some utilitarians in our midst who would like to remove the very green from College Green, on the ground that cars could pass faster if you just reduced it to a pavement, but I am certain that that is not a majority view and it is not a Government view.  It is symbolic of the utilitarian attitude which could be <Col N="987" /> disastrous, were it to be given greater power as well as expression.  In other words, these buildings of Trinity College in the heart of Dublin are part of all our heritage, the heritage of Dublin, the heritage of Ireland.  Their upkeep entails a considerable expenditure. It is worth doing, not merely from the point of view of Trinity College, but anyone thinking about it will recognise the fact that it is worth doing from the national point of view.</P>
    <P>It is true it is sometimes said, rather longingly, as it were, that Trinity College has got a magnificent central site bang in the middle of the city, but it is also true that credit must be given to the successive Boards of Trinity College down the centuries for preserving that site and not selling it out as building land.  It is something which we value.  It is something which, I think, Dublin and Ireland value and some credit should be given to those who have preserved this well of green in the heart of our city.</P>
    <P>I suggest, arising out of these various factors and considerations, that the grant to Trinity College is, in fact, far too small.  I do not think that the grant to the National University is in any way exaggerated.  They get £793,000 and could well make the case for getting quite considerably more, but, in comparison with that figure, the £163,000 granted to Trinity College seems to me to be less than what is required.</P>
    <P>I want to pass from that point and turn finally to the question raised by Senator Quinlan.  He raised the question of our foreign policy, our external affairs, and he talked about the attitude of our representatives at the United Nations and made an attack upon our Minister for External Affairs because he had the audacity to suggest, and to support by vote and speech, that the question of the admission of China to the United Nations should be placed on the Agenda.  I feel that Senator Quinlan in making the kind of speech that he did is seriously underestimating the impact of Irish foreign policy, small and all as we are, upon the United Nations</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="988" /> It is very easy, as a Deputy did in another place, to sneer at Ireland because, by reason of our policy, he said, all we have succeeded in doing is to win the undying friendship of the Dalai Lama, but, in fact, if the Leader of Fine Gael makes that point in all seriousness, does he not want us to have the friendship of the Dalai Lama?  Who is hitting the Dalai Lama at the moment if it is not communist China?  And in suggesting earlier than the question of China's admission to the United Nations should be on the agenda, are we not in a ten times stronger position to make the case against the aggression against Tibet?  It is all very well to sneer at the Dalai Lama but is it the undying friendship of those who are hitting the Dalai Lama that Deputy Dillon wants?  I think it is a cheap sneer and the kind of thing that does no good to Fine Gael and Fine Gael policy.  The Fine Gael attitude as exemplified by Senator Quinlan, though he is not a member of Fine Gael, does not do him justice and does not do them justice as an adult Party.</P>
    <P>There is no question that Ireland in the United Nations has spoken up with courage and in accordance with conscience on a number of issues, upon which other big and important nations would have preferred us to keep our mouths shut.  I have no sympathy with the policy which says: &ldquo;Let us be good boys.  Let us not irritate the United States; let us not irritate the United Kingdom.  Let us just go to the United Nations and be a &lsquo;yes&rsquo; nation doing what we are told.&rdquo; If we can do nothing but say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; every time the United States or the United Kingdom want us to vote in a particular way, we might as well be represented at the United Nations by a post card; there is no point in sending a delegation.</P>
    <P>I am very proud of the fact that as a small nation without military power, we have been cutting ice in the United Nations by reason of the fact that our delegates there have spoken honestly in accordance with their conscience.  Senator Quinlan says we should act as the conscience of the world, and so on.  Are we not <Col N="989" /> being a bit smug if we think that Ireland can be the conscience of the world?  Should we not occasionally examine our own conscience and wonder whether the fight against Communism would not be more effectively carried out in terms of economics and social reform, in the field of economics, in making war on poverty, disease and under-privilege, rather than in making flowery speeches attacking our first-rate delegates in the councils of the Parliament of the world?</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan has glib phrases about &ldquo;Communism versus the rest&rdquo;: the aim of Communism was &ldquo;world domination,&rdquo; and so on.  However, does he really feel that Ireland by merely pronouncing itself as anti-Communist on every occasion is really serving the anti-Communist cause?  I find it difficult to reconcile the professions of Christian compassion which were mentioned by Senator Quinlan with his attitude towards the Communists. It seemed to me that he was speaking with hatred in his heart and not with pity and compassion.  He even went so far as to say in effect: &ldquo;It is all right.  We need not worry about the H-bomb because we believe in God.&rdquo; I would ask him in all seriousness to think that the wrath of God might be provoked by the overweaning arrogance of man.  It is a dangerously irresponsible thing for a member of our Parliament to stand up and say: &ldquo;Do not worry about atomic warfare. Do not worry about nuclear weapons.&rdquo; I believe that some protest should be made against that irresponsible attitude of mind when it is expressed in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I salute the courage of our representatives at the United Nations.  It took courage for them to support the question of China's admission being put on the agenda.  A great deal of fuss was made about it in circles that complained about our attitude, forgetting that at one and the same time &mdash;I think in the same debate but certainly within a few weeks&mdash;Ireland, having perhaps angered or distressed the United States and the United Kingdom by the attitude she adopted on China, was angering and distressing <Col N="990" /> the Soviet Union by the unequivocal statements she was making about Hungary and Budapest.  I feel proud as an Irishman that, despite the Soviet Union with all its power, we could stand up and speak about Budapest and, at the same time, despite the United States and the United Kingdom, we could stand up and speak about the question of whether China's admission should be discussed or not.</P>
    <P>If we were simply to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and wave the right flag when we were told to do so, we would not be playing our part as a nation at all.  Our record is one of which we can feel proud and if we compare it, for instance, with the record of the United Kingdom, which long ago recognised the Chinese Communist Government and which yet abstained from voting on the question of putting the admission of Communist China on the agenda, we can only conclude their attitude was wretched and contemptible and our attitude was courageous and bold.  I resent the attitude of those who try to make Party political capital by attacking our delegates for taking an entirely honourable stand in the United Nations and one that has won respect from all sides there, irrespective of whether they differed from us on a particular issue.  I believe the status of Ireland has been enhanced.</P>
    <P>I do not think all the credit for this goes to the present Government because when the Coalition Government were in office, the then Minister for External Affairs, Deputy Cosgrave, spoke courageously in the same spirit, not being prepared simply to be tied to the apron strings of the greater Powers.  Consequently, I entirely agreed with the Taoiseach when he explained to the Liberals of Cambridge not so long ago that it was Ireland's right and duty to say in the United Nations what we thought of the French attitude in Algeria, of the attitude of Israel, Britain and France in Suez, the attitude of Russia in Budapest, the attitude of Britain in Cyprus, Kenya and Nyasaland, and the attitude of South Africa at home.</P>
    <P>I feel we were absolutely entitled to speak according to the dictates of our conscience on all those things and I feel that the Taoiseach in postulating <Col N="991" /> our rights to criticise those other countries was basing his argument soundly.  I felt disappointment, I must say, that almost in the same breath, he was telling the British that they had no right to say anything about the export of horses; that it was a purely local affair.  Other nations are not to look at us, show photographs of us or criticise our policy but we have the right to go to the ends of the world to criticise them.  I support the view of the Taoiseach that we have the right, and that our friends must accept it, to criticise them when we feel criticism is due but I feel there is a counterpart of that which is that we accept criticism when our friends feel that it is merited.</P>
    <P>I want to refer very briefly to the question of Government policy on the export of live horses.  I am not satisfied that our policy of indifference to the fate of these horses, once they are sold, is justified and I feel that our indignation at the adverse publicity results from the fact that we do not like being judged.  I should like to ask what is the Government's policy on this?  The Government's policy, I feel, ought to be changed.  The Government's policy is that they are not prepared at the moment to make any protest to the French Government.  They are not prepared to express any special concern over the fate of our horses once they are landed and sold.  I think they have been extremely slow in the making of recommendations arising from a report that it took two months to bring out.  Three months after the <i>City of Waterford</i> disaster, the Government said in the Dáil the other day that they were still working on the formulation of new recommendations arising out of this disaster.  We are very touchy about outside criticism but we feel ourselves free to criticise other nations.  On the second point we would be more strongly justified if we were not quite so prickly when we ourselves are criticised.</P>
    <P>Quite frequently we hear people getting up in this country making statements and moralising generally about &ldquo;pagan Britain&rdquo; and the immorality <Col N="992" /> in various countries of the world. Now we are being judged and we do not like it.  I believe the best way to avoid that is to change Government policy in this matter.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said he is in favour of the dead meat trade and I believe that such a trade will, in fact, be built up.  I was interested to note that the dead meat trade in horses from Britain to Belgium in the last year amounted to a sum of money equivalent to £330,000 on horsemeat.  A trade like that can obviously be built up.  I should like to feel that the Government are not content to say: &ldquo;We would like it to happen&rdquo;, but are going to take positive action to see that it happens.</P>
    <P>I should also like to see them take positive action to end the attitude of callousness and indifference to what happens to these horses after they have been sold.  I should like to see them actively interested in setting up the ancillary industries from which all our people would benefit.  I venture to forecast, if I may, that when this trade is set up, at some future date not very long distant, somebody will get up and say after it has become successful: &ldquo;What a splendid Fianna Fáil idea this was.  Do you remember, way back in 1960, how the Taoiseach spoke in favour of the dead meat trade?&rdquo;  Then, a Fine Gael speaker will get up and say: &ldquo;Why was not this done years ago?&rdquo;  I should like to conclude on that point for this evening urging the Government to start planning actively on this issue now, to end the scandal which continues to stink in the nostrils of the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Book of Estimates published this year has given a great shock to the people.  One was entitled to expect that the Government, in its third year of office, would try to redeem some of the glowing promises made in 1957.  It generally takes a Government a couple of years to adjust itself to the task of governing. Good results are expected after that but instead of an improvement, the position has worsened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government promised to relieve unemployment, to stop emigration, <Col N="993" /> to increase production, to raise the standard of living and to reduce taxation.  That has not happened. The position is much worse now than when the previous Government left office.  The unemployment figure has not altered much, if any; emigration is going on at the same rate as before and people are finding it very difficult to live and there seems to be no hope of any improvement in the future.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, in the Dáil recently, said that taxation was still high and that there was nothing that could be done about it&mdash;a pretty statement after all the glowing promises of 1957. Taxation is the most serious feature, to my mind, of all our problems and if a stop is not put to it in the near future it will drive all decent people out of public life.  I can envisage the day when local bodies will refuse to strike a rate.  These authorities are being described in the Press as a bunch of spendthrifts.  Local rates are increasing alarmingly and as far as one can see there is no hope of curbing the increase.</P>
    <P>I maintain that the Government are solely to blame for this.  They are pushing on to the local authorities annually greater financial burdens and obligations which they should shoulder themselves.  The extension of institutions and the appointment of additional officials should be financed solely by the central Government. Each month a new order comes from the Department of Health or the Department of Local Government demanding improvements and extra officials.  The ratepayers are at their wits' end to meet these new obligations and the Government are utterly regardless of their plight.</P>
    <P>I thought when the White Paper on Economic Expansion was issued, that money would flow <i>ad lib</i> for expansion and development.  So far, we have not seen any of it.  I wonder what has become of the £250,000,000 mentioned in that White Paper.  It is significant that in that White Paper, Mr. Whitaker, who was responsible for it, stated in the last paragraph that no Minister in any Department was <Col N="994" /> responsible for anything in it.  Obviously that is the fact.</P>
    <P>I come now to the main industry, agriculture.  Nothing has been done for agriculture.  The plight of those living on farms is very bad.  It is as bad now as it was during the years of the Economic War.  The Government are responsible because they made no attempt two years ago to renew the 1948 Trade Agreement with Britain and they allowed European competitors to gain an increased foothold on the British market.</P>
    <P>It is said that the cattle trade is a total loss and that the non-operation of the T.B. eradication scheme is responsible for that.  If that is so, the Minister for Agriculture will have to bear full responsibility because he made no effort of any kind to settle the dispute between his Department and the veterinary surgeons.</P>
    <P>I emphasise once more that the Government are solely responsible for the economic position of the country to-day. Indeed, it would be worse were it not for the fact that the Government did make an effort to adopt the policy of the inter-Party Government. Unfortunately, they had neither the desire nor the ability to implement that policy properly.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention just a few of the very beneficial schemes operated by the inter-Party Government, schemes which were abolished when the present Government took office. Section A of the Land Project was abolished.  That was one of the most beneficial schemes ever operated here. It gave a number of farmers an increased acreage on which to rear cattle or grow crops.  I ask the Minister to restore that scheme.</P>
    <P>Again, the Local Authorities (Works) Act was very beneficial to farmers.  A great deal of land which had hitherto been under water for nine months of the year was drained and restored to fertility.  I know areas in which this scheme did just as good work as any work done under the Arterial Drainage Act.  I can instance my own county, a county intersected with innumerable small rivers. Excellent work was done there.  If this scheme had been continued all those <Col N="995" /> rivers would be drained just as competently under the Local Authorities (Works) Act as any drained under the Arterial Drainage Act.</P>

      <P>I sat here last night listening to Senator Lenihan.  He informed us of all the increases in the Book of Estimates, from the beginning to the end.  He told us about the increase in industry and industrial employment. He conveniently forgot to mention that there was a very notable decrease in agricultural employment. He also told us about increases given to agriculture.  These increases were never more necessary.</P>
      <P>I come from a rural area.  Do the Government realise what is happening in rural Ireland to-day?  I agree with Senator Roddy when he says that this country was never, since the Economic War, in such a serious condition as it is to-day.  I hold there is complete stagnation in agriculture.  I defy contradiction that that is so.  Good reactor cattle are being sold in fairs and marts all over the country for as little as £5 per cwt.  In the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> last week, and in other papers too, there were accounts of the various markets. Dropped calves, according to report, are being sold from £3 10s. to £5 per head.  That is unprecedented since the Economic War.</P>

I know that the people on the opposite side will admit that at one time our cattle trade was one of the biggest items in our economy.  That is not the position to-day.  More money is to be voted this year for the eradication of T.B.  That is welcome.  I agree that every step must be taken to wipe out that scourge.  There are, however, snags.  Possibly these can be overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One snag is that in a non-clearance <Col N="996" /> area, where a man co-operates with the scheme to the fullest extent, he may find he has so many reactors. He has no market for them.  What is he to do?  One small farmer in my own area tested five cattle.  All five were reactors.  He is left with those five reactors on his hands.  He does not know how he will meet his rates and other expenses this year, and his expenses this year are heavier than ever before.  That is an aspect of the matter that needs serious consideration.</P>
    <P>Again, there is the man in the dairying industry.  I am sure Senator Lahiffe will agree with me that the instructions given are that these cattle are to be bought by weight.  It may well be that buyers will be able to buy a big beefy cow, with no milk capacity at all, from one farmer; a neighbouring farmer with a cow yielding 600 or 700 gallons will get the same amount, or perhaps not quite so much, for his good milch cow.  That is quite wrong and some steps will have to be taken to remedy the position.  There should be a differential between a valuable milch cow and one which is not so valuable.</P>
    <P>The statements I have made are true.  There is ample proof for them. Nobody can deny facts, and those are facts which I have stated.  The Government are greatly to blame.  As somebody said before me, some agreement should have been reached long ago, in order that we would be assured of a market for our cattle. That is my opinion.</P>
    <P>Pigs were always a very valuable asset to the small farmers and the cottiers of this country.  The small farmer depended to a very large extent on the pig trade to balance his economy.  It would seem now that he would want an architect to plan pigs to suit the factories.  If a pig is over 11½ stone and under 14½ stone&mdash; say, he is worth £17 15s. at £8 a cwt. &mdash;the factory will give only £6 10s. a cwt., which means £3 loss or a bigger loss if he is over 14½ stone.  When the same unfortunate small farmer or some labouring man's wife goes in to a merchant for a lb. of rashers, he or she will be given a lb. of back rashers at 4/6 per lb., and will not <Col N="997" /> be told whether it is off a fat or a lean pig.  That is something which should be looked into very soon in the interests of the producer and the consumer.  As I have already said, if money is being given in a big way towards agricultural production and the marketing of our produce, it is greatly needed.</P>
    <P>Potatoes will be sold this year in Westmeath and Meath for as little as £3 per ton, and even if they go a little higher, there are no opportunities now other than that the potatoes will go to a factory in Ballina and be sold again for £6 per ton.  It is too bad that that is the only market left to the farmers of Ireland for their potatoes. It is really too bad, because potatoes are not a crop that is easy to manage. You will never find a lazy farmer growing many potatoes.</P>
    <P>Let us get away from farming and take the business of the rural community in the rural towns.  I know of three public houses which were sold in small towns lately, and the average price per public house&mdash;believe it or not&mdash;was £500.  That, surely, is a sign of decay in rural Ireland.</P>

      <P>I was speaking to the chairman of the chamber of commerce in one of the largest midland towns recently, and he assured me that the months of January and February, 1960, were the worst months in the business life of that town for 25 years.  I merely mention these facts &mdash;and they are facts of which everyone from the rural areas must be aware.  I appeal to the Minister before it is too late to take notice of what I say.  We are painfully aware that the working people are emigrating as fast as they can and that if something is not done, and done in the very near future, to help the small farmer, he, too, will be seen on the emigrant ship.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Government have been in office for <Col N="998" /> three years and we now have an opportunity of reviewing their work. This Bill also provides us with an opportunity of ascertaining the manner in which they have kept their promises during the past three years.  On the other hand, we know from the figures before us what the Government are doing, and what they intend to do in the year ahead.  We all remember the promises made before the last election.  Never in the history of this country were so many promises made as were made at that time.  Never was so much expected by the people from a Fianna Fáil Government, and never was so little done by them to redeem the promises they made then to get into office by hook or by crook.</P>
      <P>In this Bill, the Minister is seeking to extract from the pockets of the people the largest sum ever asked for by a Minister for Finance.  There is no denying that everyone in the country suffered a profound shock when they heard the figure of £123 million. We all know that the people are already overtaxed and are unable to bear any further taxation.  The increase in the total requested for the next financial year is £7,900,000&mdash;7 per cent. increase in taxation&mdash;and it is very doubtful if we have even a two per cent. increase in production. This figure is £13½ million up on the figure for the year ending March, 1958, without taking into account the £6½ million saved by the abolition of the food subsidies.  A sum of £9 million was saved by the abolition of the food subsidies; the Government gave over £2½ million in relief; therefore, they saved over £6½ million.</P>
      <P>If we take all that into consideration, the increase is now £28 million over the figure for the last year of the inter-Party Government.  Many people want to know when will there be an end to this increased taxation and when will the rake's progress stop. It is time the Government remembered that it is often the last straw that breaks the camel's back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to read what the Taoiseach had to say about taxation away back in 1953, when, as I say, things were much better than they are to-day, and taxation was £28 million <Col N="999" /> lower than it is to-day.  In the Official Report of 8th May, 1956, at Column 49, the Taoiseach is reported as having said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In 1953, the Fianna Fáil Government, of which I was a member, took a decision that taxation in this country had reached the danger limit.  We announced that we had made up our minds on that fact and that, so far as we were concerned, there would be no increase in tax rates above the 1953 level.  We made it clear that, if any Budget difficulty arose, that difficulty would be met by a reduction of expenditure and not by increasing the burdens on the taxpayer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the Taoiseach speaking when taxation was budgeted at £28 million less than we are budgeting for here to-night and, on that account, I think it is relevant to the debate.  If, in 1953, the Taoiseach thought that the people could not bear the taxation then imposed on them, surely I am entitled to say to the House that the people of Ireland are not able to bear an additional burden of taxation to the tune of £28 million, in 1960?</P>

      <P>No one can welcome a counter irritant as a substitute for a cure and I cannot welcome this Bill because that is precisely what it is.  The country needs a dynamic Government who are prepared to work hard and lead the people and if they work hard and lead the people then perhaps they can lead us to better times.  They should devote more time to the work of their Departments and less to running around the country attending dinners and making after-dinner speeches.  Everything in the garden may seem rosy at an after-dinner speech but it may not seem quite so rosy the next morning.  The majority of the present Government are too old and too staid.  We need young men at the helm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I admit that. Young men won the last war and perhaps young men will save this country. The Fianna Fáil Government remind me of an old farmer sitting in the chimney corner of a derelict farmhouse who is hoping that with the help of God and money from Aunt Maggie he will turn the corner somehow.</P>
      <P>Our people have never been lacking in energy or in courage but they need direction and control.  Unfortunately, they are not getting direction from the present Government.  When the present Taoiseach, Deputy S. Lemass, spoke recently at Inchicore, he proclaimed, for the first time, that the keystone of Fianna Fáil economic policy is the British market.  That sentiment represents a very big change in the outlook of that Party.  It is a pity they did not utter that sentiment 30 years ago.  If they had, perhaps we would be a wealthier country today and indeed some innocent blood might not have been spilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1001" /> At one time, those who preached the importance of the British market were told they were guilty of high treason and sabotage.  They were told we would not feed John Bull. They were accused of being ranchers and Imperialists.  Fianna Fáil even went so far as to say that the British market was gone and gone for ever and thanks be to God.  I remember that when the President was Taoiseach he attended a meeting in Arva at which he said that the cattle trade was finished and he advised the farmers to keep bees.  We are all glad that, even at this late stage, the Fianna Fáil Party have been converted to the importance of agriculture and of the British market in our economy.</P>
    <P>Last night, Senator Lenihan talked about all the foreign money that is now coming into the country.  He brought back to my memory the self-sufficiency policy which we had at one time when we were to burn everything British but their coal.  Deputy Aiken, the Minister for External Affairs, said that even if every ship on the seas was sent to the bottom we could do without Britain and the rest of the world.  We remember the Control of Manufactures Act which was introduced in 1932 by the Fianna Fáil Government. It kept foreign money from coming into this country for a long number of years.  It is grand to see that at long last they are converted and, in this regard in any case, are moving in the right direction.  Perhaps it is better late than never.</P>
    <P>On this side of the House, we have always held that Ireland is primarily an agricultural country.  We have always claimed that if the people on the land are wealthy, the whole nation will be wealthy.  Our leaders have stated on a number of occasions that the standard of living of every person in this country depends upon what our farmers and their labourers can take out of the land and export profitably. Now, the Fianna Fáil Party agree with us in that matter.</P>
    <P>We have 12,000,000 acres of arable land.  In a country with a population of 2¼ million, that represents five acres for every person.  I agree with Senator J.M. Sheridan that not since the days <Col N="1002" /> of the economic war have our farmers been in such a bad plight.  Instead of an improvement in their conditions, things are worsening.  Nobody can deny it.  Even the Taoiseach admitted it last week in the Dáil during the debate on the Vote on Account.</P>
    <P>Last year, our farmers had to sustain a drop in cattle prices of £12½ million.  Our farmers are bringing cattle from cattle mart to fair and nobody asks them where they are going with their cattle, especially the store cattle, the small cattle.  The small farmer is the backbone of the country but if present conditions continue the majority of them will have to put the lock on their door and emigrate.  If that happens, it will be a bad day for the community in general.</P>
    <P>As we all know, the cost of living is increasing steeply for our farmers. Their rates, taxes and expenditure are increasing every year.  They are now getting only the 1953 prices for their produce.  Compared with 1958, cattle prices last year were down £10 to £15 per head; lamb prices were down £3 to £5 per head and those for ewes were down at least £4 to £8 apiece.  I saw ewes being sold at Ballinrobe Fair for £1 each.  People could do nothing with them.  They do not call them &ldquo;sheep fairs&rdquo; now but &ldquo;sheep wakes&rdquo;.  I saw them sold at £1 apiece.</P>
    <P>The Government are to be blamed for the price of pigs.  The last Minister fixed a guaranteed minimum price of 235/- per cwt.  The Minister for Agriculture, when he came back to power in 1957, thought the farmers were getting too much and he cut the guaranteed minimum price for Grade A pigs to 230/-, a cut of 5/- per cwt. It took the previous Government a long time to try to build up the export of pigs.  In 1947, we exported over £7,000,000 worth of bacon and, judging by what we know from the Book of Estimates, the export will be very small this year.</P>
    <P>Milk was reduced by the present Government by 1d. per gallon.  We all know what the unfortunate farmers' wives and labourers got for their turkeys last year, despite the fact that there was a sum of <Col N="1003" /> £250,000 set aside for marketing about three years ago.  We were told with a great flourish of trumpets what was to happen and what was not to happen.  Farmers' wives suffered severely.  Turkeys were sold last year at a loss.</P>
    <P>Things are very bad for our primary producers.  If the farmer goes down, the whole country will go down with him.  In 1953, the farmers received 29.4 per cent. of the national income.  On the last occasion, the Minister questioned some of the figures I gave but if he looks at page 8 of the <i>Statistical Survey</i> for 1958, he will see that 25 per cent.  of the national income was received by the farmers in 1958.  Last year, it was reckoned they received less than 24 per cent.  If the income of our primary producers is to continue dropping and their overhead expenses and rates to continue to rise there is no denying that they will be crushed out of existence in a very short time.</P>
    <P>Let us contrast the state of affairs that exists in this country to-day with the promises made in 1957.  Then the people were led to expect that the subsidies would be maintained, that there would be no increase in food prices, that we would have vigorous measures to solve our economic problems and that immediate action would be taken to provide employment.  The Government were to get cracking.  There was a £100,000,000 plan to provide 100,000 new jobs.  The farmers were promised better times.  Instead, our people got dearer food.  The subsidies were removed. There were increased hospital charges and there are over 70,000 people still unemployed.  Emigration has not been stemmed to any great extent.</P>
    <P>There are fewer people at work to-day. There are fewer houses being built.  In our county, where we were building 200 and 300 cottages for a long number of years, there are two in course of construction at the present time.  We have been sending up plans for the past three years to the Minister's Department.  They are being sent back to us because they are too costly. They want the scheme changed.  At the <Col N="1004" /> same time, the Minister gets up and says there is money available to pay this grant and that grant.  It is very easy to give grants to cover the building of two cottages in the County West-meath where we should be building a couple of hundred houses.  The need is still there for them but the plans have not been sanctioned by the Department.  If the Minister looks that up, he will find it is two and a half years since we submitted them and they still have not been sanctioned.</P>
    <P>Fewer homes are being built.  The Local Authorities (Works) Act was scrapped and still expenditure is higher.  That Act gave much-needed employment.  I think it was money well spent because it was spent on the drainage of land.  By draining land and making it better, you were helping to increase production which is so vital for our economy.  The double byre grant was scrapped.</P>
    <P>I heard Senator Lenihan blaming the inter-Party Government for falling down on the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme.  Let me say that the inter-Party Government had the scheme prepared in 1951 when they left office.  Fianna Fáil were three long years in office up to 1954 and they did not introduce the scheme.  It was Deputy Dillon who then introduced the scheme and got it going. The scheme was held up for the past three years because there was a dispute between the Minister and the veterinary surgeons.  Neither Senator Lenihan nor any other Senator should try to put the blame on the inter-Party Government.  If Fianna Fáil were so concerned about it, why did they not start the scheme from 1951 to 1954?  We all know that Britain started it over 25 years ago and that America started it over 30 years ago. If they devoted the same amount of energy to the eradication of bovine tuberculosis as they did last year to the attempt to get rid of proportional representation, it would have been much better for the country.</P>
    <P>The price of wheat, despite all that we are told, is down 10/- to 12/- per barrel.  Barley, last year, was 10/- per barrel less than it was in 1948.  Last <Col N="1005" /> but not least, despite all the promises the Government made, they abandoned price control in this country.  That also had serious effects on our economy.</P>
    <P>The dairying industry is being crippled.  There is no denying that. Instead of getting the increase the dairymen were led to believe they would get when the inter-Party Government were in power, they got a reduction.  I was in Limerick and I saw a Fianna Fáil T.D. putting up posters calling upon the people to march in Dublin to protest against an increase in the price of milk. People were led to believe that if Fianna Fáil were returned they would get this increase.  In return they got a penny less.  The price of calves is down £10 to £20 per head.  That represents a further reduction of from 2d. to 4d. per gallon in the price of milk.  It all depends whether the cow is giving 400 gallons or 800 gallons of milk.</P>
    <P>We are told that 1957 was a dreadful year.  It is supposed to have been a disastrous year for this country. We all admit that in 1957 there was an economic crisis.  You had the Suez crisis and certain action had to be taken by the Government.  It was taken and it left our economy in a healthy state when the present Government came into power.  If we go back to 1957 we will find that our exports reached an all-time record of £131,000,000.  That had increased from £35,000,000 in 1947, an increase of £96,000,000.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the Minister for Finance can contradict any of the figures when he is replying. He told me the last time that some of the figures I had quoted were wrong.  I am going to quote some of them again.  I think the Minister will find they are correct.  They are taken from the official statistics and they cannot be denied.  We had an all-time record of exports in that year. Unfortunately, the present Government in three years have not been able to reach the record that was then created of £131,000,000.  In 1957, for the first time in our history, we had <Col N="1006" /> a surplus of wheat.  It was not achieved by filling ten fields with inspectors but it was achieved because the farmers had confidence in the Minister they then had that he would give them a fair crack of the whip, that he would stand up to the millers, or any other monopoly or section of the people who tried to exploit them. He did that at all times and even compelled the millers to take the wheat during the year of the very bad harvest.  For the first time in our history, in 1956, there was sufficient barley grown for ten months of the year and we had to import very little Indian meal.  We exported £7,000,000 worth of bacon.  We exported butter to the tune of £4,000,000.  There was very little butter exported last year and according to the figures before us, the Government do not expect very much to be exported this year.</P>
    <P>In 1947, there were 3.9 million cattle.  That increased to 4½ million in 1957.  It is slightly higher to-day and the reason it is higher is that the farmers have their cattle on their hands and cannot sell them.  We all hope that the Government will be able to negotiate a first-class agreement with Britain and that the farmers will be able to sell their cattle.  Indeed, the farmers and the people cannot understand the delay in announcing the terms of the present trade agreement and are waiting anxiously to know them.  In the past, they were generally announced around the end of February. It is now almost the end of March.</P>
    <P>In 1957, we had 1,000,000 pigs.  That figure had increased from .45 million in 1947, but unfortunately to-day it is down to 852,000.  There was a decrease of 95,500 in 1959 compared with 1958, a decrease of 10.1 per cent.  If we are to progress at all, we must export more cattle, sheep and pigs.  The small farmers are depending to a very large extent on the export of pigs and as I say, the number is down ten per cent. I do not think we can be proud of that.</P>
    <P>In regard to sheep, the figures increased from 2,000,000 in 1947 to 3.4 million in 1957 and now stand at 4.4 million.  We have there an increase of 5.7 per cent, but again, unfortunately, in this case, it is due to the <Col N="1007" /> fact that the farmers are unable to get a market for their pigs.  I hope that in any future negotiations with Germany or France, or any European country, the Government will be able to get back the market which we had with France and with Germany for the export of our sheep.  We lost that market in the past few years.  We are buying over three times the amount from both France and Germany that they are buying from us.  If the Minister's officials are not able to get favourable terms for us from the French Government or the German Government, it is up to our Ministers of State to leave the dinners and the after-dinner speeches behind them and go over to France and Germany, as Deputy Dillon and Deputy Morrissey did in 1948, and secure for the farmers and the people the markets which are needed so badly.  There is no denying that we have a first-class produce to sell to these people, if we could only get the market.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan spoke last night about the disastrous year of 1956 and 1957.  Yet, if you look at the figures in the Book of Estimates, you will find that in those disastrous years, according to Fianna Fáil speakers, in 1957, £18,064,828 was spent on electricity development.  According to the Book of Estimates before us today, we intend to spend only £12,354,243, a reduction of £6,000,000 compared with the disastrous years we were told about.  If we look at the figures for the number of men employed by local authorities on the building of houses, we find that in 1957 there were 6,147 employed.  In January, 1960, there were 1,781, a decrease of 4,366 in the numbers employed by local authorities on building houses.  Yet the Fianna Fáil members of the county councils and Fianna Fáil Senators are as silent as can be on those figures.</P>
    <P>I remember Senator Colley shedding crocodile tears a few years ago over what was supposed to be happening in Dublin.  There was supposed to be nobody employed in 1956/57; yet in those years there were over 4,000 more employed by local authorities than in January, 1960.  On the land of this <Col N="1008" /> country, if you take the people employed on it and the farmers' relatives, there were 90,826 employed in 1956 and in 1959, after two years of the Government getting cracking, after the promise of 100,000 new jobs for the people, we had 78,296 people employed on the land.  That is a reduction of 12,000 after three years of office by the Government.  Those figures cannot be denied because they were recently given in the Dáil in reply to a question.</P>
    <P>Let me now turn to local authority houses.  In the nine months from the 1st April, 1956 to the 2nd March, 1957, the amount paid from the Local Loans Fund-and I want to emphasise it because people come in here and tell us that there were debts left which had to be paid, and if they do not believe the figures they can be found in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> of 5th March, 1957&mdash; was £8,550,000.  In the same period in the current year, the amount being paid by this Government is only £3,450,000.  That is how the Government are getting cracking&mdash;by spending £5,100,000 less on housing this year.</P>
    <P>Certain organs are claiming that the inter-Party Government left debts which had to be cleared up.  The inter-Party Government accepted and paid for a Local Loans Fund capital programme of £18,064,828 in the same year.  I see some people smiling. They do not seem to believe those figures.  They can check on them and they will see they are correct.  I shall repeat the figure: £18,064,828, which compares with the figure of £10,733,152 in the current year.  This £18,000,000 was paid by the inter-Party Government. The facts are known; yet people deliberately mislead for political propaganda purposes.</P>
    <P>Let us take the Land Project.  This is an agricultural country.  We want to export more.  We want to improve the fertility of our soil.  If you look at page 217 of the Book of Estimates, the provision this year is £521,000 less than the provision in 1956-57.  Yet we are told by certain speakers that these were disastrous years.  In 1959, there was a reduction of 137,000 in the wheat acreage compared with 1958. I had better give the figures: In 1958, <Col N="1009" /> 418,900 acres and in 1959, 282,000 acres.  That was a reduction of 32.6 per cent.  in the amount of wheat grown in the country, and that was at a time when the apostles of wheat production were in power.  The acreage of beet sown was down from 84,000 to 69,000 in 1959.</P>
    <P>Nobody can deny that 1959 was the best year we ever had.  The weather was ideal in the spring for ploughing, harrowing and sowing.  Despite this, there was a reduction of 18.3 per cent. in the acreage of beet sown.  Yet we are told that everything is all right, that the people are having a wonderful time and that the country is going ahead.  In 1959, the total of corn crops, including wheat, oats, barley, rye, etc. was down 9 per cent. from 1958.  Root and grain crops were down by 3 per cent.  Figures have already been given in the Dáil to show that between 1956 and 1958, there was a reduction of 32,000 in the number of people at work.</P>
    <P>We are told about the debts and the chaos the inter-Party Government were supposed to have left; yet we have it on record from the Taoiseach that when the Fianna Fáil Government took office, the balance of payments problem had already been resolved.  Speaking in the Dáil on 14th May, 1957, two months after the Fianna Fáil Party came back into office, the Taoiseach who was then Tánaiste, dealing with the action taken by his predecessors in office in connection with the balance of payments problem, stated at column 51 of Vol. 161:</P>
    <P>I did not think they were dealing with it the right way but we certainly recognised their obligation to do something about it and as a result of the measures they took that balance of payments problem was solved for the time being.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we have it on record from the head of the Government that he admits the balance of payments problem was solved by the action of his predecessors.  When Senator Lenihan comes into this House and makes the accusations he made yesterday, does he not believe the words of his own leader?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1010" /> Let us turn now to unemployment and emigration, two of the things which, we are told, provide the acid test of any Government.  Not since the days of the Famine have there been so few people at work out of the total population as there are at present. Worse still, the Government seem to be blind to all this and accept this catastrophic and unnatural state of affairs with complacency.  They regard as cranks anyone who calls their attention to it.  I have already given the figures in respect of the number of people employed on the land&mdash;12,000 fewer employed on the land.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil, on 18th March last, Volume 180, column 9, Deputy Corish asked the Minister for Local Government to state the number of men engaged in house building by local authorities on the nearest available date and on similar dates during 1959, 1958, 1957 and 1956.  From the answer given we find that on 31st January, 1956 6,147 people were employed and on 31st January, 1960, the number employed was 1,781, a reduction of over 4,000.</P>
    <P>Another significant reduction in the Estimates is the reduction of £17,000 in respect of children's allowances.  By that figure, the Department officials admit there are fewer people in the country and that fewer children will be born in the years to come.  The reason, of course, is that our people are flying from the country.  Deputy Lindsay in the Dáil, at Column 349 of Volume 180, gave figures for county Mayo.  He pointed out that in April, 1957, there were 81,855 persons on the register for Dáil elections. In April, 1959, there were 78,818, a drop of almost 3,000 in those last two years.  Those people had families.  The majority of those 3,000 people over 21 who emigrated from Mayo may also have brought wives and families with them, so perhaps over 5,000 people have emigrated from Mayo alone in those two years.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Ciosáin here yesterday challenged us regarding the cost of living.  He stated that there was no increase in the cost of living since Fianna Fáil came back into power.  He said that no one on this side of the <Col N="1011" /> House had anything to say about the cost of living and he wondered why. Of course he conveniently tried to forget that Fianna Fáil were in office in April, 1957, when they introduced their Budget.  He would love people to forget that and he knows that people have short memories, but I want to mention those figures because I mentioned figures about the increase in the cost of living here last May and the Minister for Finance challenged me on them, stating my figures were completely wrong.  He stated that the cost of living had increased by exactly the same number of points under Fianna Fáil as under the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>I have gone to the trouble of getting exact and correct figures and I want to refute that allegation.  In 1948, when the inter-Party Government came into office, the cost-of-living index figure stood at 99.  They were three years in office and when they were going out in 1951, the cost-of-living index figure was 109 points, an increase of 10 points in three years. Fianna Fáil came in then with the cost of living at 109 points.  They introduced their famous Budget in 1952 and when they were going out of office, the cost of living stood at 127, an increase of 18 points.  The inter-Party Government came back into office in 1954, the cost of living standing at 127 points, and they went out in March, 1957, with the cost of living at 135, an increase of eight points in their three years.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil took over in March, 1957, with the figure at 135 points and after their Budget of 1957, in May, 1959&mdash;the Minister for Finance disputed the figure with me&mdash;the cost of living here stood at 147 points, an increase of 12 points.  With the 10- and 8-point increase over two terms, the inter-Party Government had an increase of 18 points in six years.  With their 18- and 12-point increase over two terms, the Fianna Fáil Government had an increase of 30 points.  So, taking increases from 99 points to 147 in May, 1959, the Fianna Fáil Party were responsible for an increase of 30 points and the inter-Party Government <Col N="1012" /> were responsible for an increase of 18 points.  Those points are in the official statistics and it should be remembered that during the inter-Party reign, we had the Korean War and the Suez crisis.  The Minister may laugh, but despite that fact, he tried to convince us here the last time that the cost of living increased by the same number of points under both Governments.  I challenge him to produce figure to show that.</P>

      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party appealed to housewives.  Fianna Fáil must be the housewives' choice, they said, because the soaring cost of living was robbing the wage packets of their value.  These are the words that got the Minister for Finance into the office he is in to-day&mdash;those promises, as well as the promises made at Belmullet by the man who is now President of Ireland and the promises the Taoiseach made at Dungarvan two years before being elected, that they would retain the food subsidies.  In the Dáil, a question by Deputy M.J. O'Higgins revealed that since 1957, out of 190 items calculated in the cost-of-living index, 149 had increased in price following increases in 1947: food had gone up by 11.5 points; clothing by 2.4; housing by 7.6; drink and tobacco <Col N="1013" /> by 10.1; durable household goods by 2; and other goods and services by 6.6. What the Fianna Fáil Party are trying to do is to say nothing about the increases that occurred during their reign in 1957-58.  They are telling the people now that the cost of living is coming down but that is because they put it out of sight, sky-high, with the all-time record of 147.  We do admit that it has been reduced at the present time, but if it is reduced, it is at the farmers' expense because smaller prices are being paid for potatoes and other food at present.</P>
      <P>Senator Lenihan here yesterday made an attack on the Fine Gael Party and the inter-Party Government in regard to the tuberculosis eradication scheme.  Senator Lenihan spoke about things &ldquo;that have an integrating effect, that help to bring our people together,&rdquo; but I think it is generally admitted that statements like those help to divide our people and I think it is very important that on this question our people should be united at present-and there is no denying that they are. There is not a committee of agriculture in Ireland, no matter what Party control it, but is co-operating actively with the present Minister in his efforts to eradicate bovine tuberculosis.  I think the Minister cannot deny that.  He has been invited to different committees and all the members of those committees have supported him wholeheartedly in his efforts.  I think it is a shame that Senator Lenihan, who knows very little about agriculture, should get up in this House and make those statements.</P>

      <P>This is a very important point and I think it is very unfortunate that Senator Lenihan, or <Col N="1014" /> any Senator, should try to blame or cast aspersions on any Party as regards bovine tuberculosis.  All Parties throughout the country are working together and co-operating with each other, and are prepared to help any Minister who may be in power in his efforts to eradicate bovine tuberculosis.</P>
      <P>I have little else to say except that I should like the Minister to tell us how much of the £250,000, set aside a few years ago to improve our marketing facilities, has been spent.  It is very essential and very desirable that we have proper marketing boards, but we do not seem to have them nor do we seem to be interested in them. Whatever has come over the Government we were not even represented at the trade fairs recently held in Brussels, in England and other countries.  If you take up the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> of last week, it will be seen that bacon from Kenya is fetching the same price on the British market as is ours.  The price of our bacon has reached an all-time low level, 10/- below what the Hungarians and the Poles are getting, and 15/- to 30/- below what the British farmers and Northern Ireland farmers are getting for their bacon.  If this money was set aside, it is time it were spent and that some results were shown.</P>
      <P>Many people claim that we are spending £10,000,000 on jet planes.  I think it would be much better if we had a plane service from Ireland to London, to the best market in the world, which is on our door-step, to fly vegetables, cream, fresh meat and things like that to that market.  It would be much better if the money were spent in that direction.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I think it is time we had a Buy-Irish campaign, not for one week, or for one day in the year, but for the whole 52 weeks of the year.  If we had, we would go a long way towards offsetting our adverse trade balance.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Donovan was the first speaker.  In comparing expenditure this year, he said we had Supplementary Estimates last year, and suggested that surely I could not say there would be no Supplementary Estimates in the coming year.  On the contrary, I mentioned a couple of Supplementary Estimates in the Dáil that we were certain to have, and so I am not unaware of the fact that we may have such Estimates.  He compared the Estimates of 1957-58&mdash;that is, the Estimates prepared by the previous Government and which were taken over by me in their printed formwith the present Estimates.</P>
      <P>I should like to remind the Senator that though I eliminated food subsidies and gave some compensation for social welfare, making a net reduction of £5.5 million, that year I had to increase taxation by £3.5 million and, as well, I had to face a deficit at the end of the year of about £5.8 million, so that the bill that was presented to my Government when we came into office would have required, if we were in a position to afford it, £14 million additional taxation.  We did not, of course, impose that additional taxation and I do not know how the present Opposition could have met that bill.  They would give one to understand that they would not have taken off the food subsidies but I do not know how otherwise they would have got that £14 million.  I should like to hear from them how they would have done it.</P>

That was a remarkable achievement for any Government after the mess that was there when we came into office, faced with finding £14 million either by additional taxation, by having deficits or some other way.  We managed to do it.  We succeeded and I am quite sure that the members of the other Parties did not think we would succeed.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Donovan said he expected the cost of living to go up from eight to 10 per cent.  in the near future.  I will say it is expected that the cost of living will go up. Bread has already gone up in price and other items have gone up in price, but I am not inclined to think that Senator O'Donovan is right.  I do not think the cost of living will go up as much as eight per cent. in the coming six months or, indeed, in the coming 12 months.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Brien pointed out in his speech that increases in wages without increased productivity must lead to increases in the cost of living.  I would advise Senator Murphy to read the observations of these two economists, Senator O'Brien and Senator O'Donovan, and see if he finds any fault with them.  However, I shall come back to Senator Murphy in some observations later on.</P>
      <P>The cost of living figures were dealt with by Senator L'Estrange.  I should like to point out that the official figures which are taken for February each year&mdash;of course they are taken every quarter&mdash;were as follows: in 1954, when the Fianna Fáil Government came in, the figure was 124; in 1957, 135 and in 1960, 144&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;so that actually during the three years of the Coalition Government the cost of living went up by 11 points and in our three years, up to last February, even though we took off the food subsidies, the cost of living went up by only nine points.  Therefore I do not think we can be tackled too strongly on the cost of living issue alone.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Donovan also quoted the Taoiseach as saying in the Dáil that in the matter of increases for civil servants it was one of the first acts of the Coalition in 1954 when they came in to give an increase to civil servants. As Senator Dr. O'Donovan pointed out, the Taoiseach was not altogether correct because they did not give that increase until 1956.  That increase was given as a result of a promise made during a general election and, if we were to try to explain our defeat in 1954, and take up the time of the Dáil and Seanad in doing so, we could say that was one of the reasons we were defeated in 1954, because the Coalition Government promised to give an increase to civil servants.  We have given it to them with no election at all in mind so we cannot be accused of political motives in giving the increase at the present time.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Donovan talked about the past year and said that there was some confusion in my mind because I had taken refuge in the bad year for conditions in farming.  Some of the results of that year occurred in 1958 and some in 1959.  Anybody who knows anything about agriculture will not dispute that in that very wet year of 1958, we had very bad crops, a very bad corn harvest, very bad yields of wheat and fairly bad yields of barley and of oats, bad yields of beet and other products, and then we had bad winter feeding of cattle in 1959, even more than in 1958.  Milk yields also suffered more in 1959 than in 1958.  To that extent, it is permissible to say that the bad year had its effects in both years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Going on to foreign trade, Senator O'Donovan again took up the Taoiseach in saying that there was a <Col N="1018" /> difference in the approach to foreign trade in 1947-48 and at the present time.  The Taoiseach talked about the horse trade that we had at that time, and I think he was quite right.  In 1947-48, when we sent our delegates to negotiate with any foreign country, it was a question of: &ldquo;How much will you give us if we give you something?&rdquo; Britain said to us: &ldquo;Give us so many cattle and we shall give you so much goods.&rdquo;  We both spoke of things we wanted badly from the other.  They said: &ldquo;Give us so many eggs&rdquo;, and Deputy Dillon was so carried away that he said he would drown them in eggs, and that was what they wanted.</P>
    <P>Conditions are different now.  They do not say: &ldquo;If you give us so much cattle, we shall give you so much coal&rdquo;, nor does any foreign country speak like that.  Germany or France will say: &ldquo;The conditions are these: we have a tariff of so and so, and whatever you can send in over that tariff is welcome&rdquo;, and we shall say the same to them.  It is not so easy&mdash; in fact, it is more difficult now that these combinations of Sixes and Sevens are formed to alter these tariffs. There was some hope before that of getting them to change their quotas and allowing certain numbers in, but that was the only hope and of course quotas are disappearing now in the liberalisation of trade.  For that reason, there is very little we can do with those Continental countries.  I can talk about the British later.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien made a very interesting speech and one has to agree with most of what he said.  He said that if our national income has not a bigger increase than 3 per cent.  our taxation is too high.  I must say that I would at least put it to Senator O'Brien to dispute that point, that we should at least separate current expenditure from capital expenditure in that connection.  If current expenditure year after year&mdash;one must take one year with another&mdash;were going up more than the national income, then we would be running into trouble, but as a matter of fact, it is not.  It is keeping more or less in line with the national income all the time, so that things are not so bad in that respect as one might think at first sight.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1019" /> He went on to say that our problem was that we were living so near to Britain, that it was, of course, a good thing from the point of view of unemployed people and emigrants to have a place to go to, but it made it more difficult for the national economy, which is quite right also.  As he pointed out, wages tend to find the same level here as in England, but at the same time costs are a little less favourable to us because our industries are smaller.  All that is very good, and it only points to the fact that we must try to cut our costs as well as we can to be able to compete on the foreign market, because, as he points out, any expansion means export, and to find a place on the export market, we must be able to compete.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien said that he was not worried about the balance of payments. He was very worried about the balance of payments when I came in first after 1957, and it is a great achievement, again, for the Fianna Fáil Government that you have a very critical economist as far as we are concerned like Senator O'Brien who says that he is no longer worried about the balance of payments. It is a great tribute to this Government that we should have that position after three years of Government.</P>
    <P>Taking a period of three or four or five years, because you will have variations from year to year, we find that our current expenditure has remained almost constant since prewar. It remains about 20 per cent. of our national income all the time.  Of course, it must be remembered that in that expenditure, you have such things as social welfare, health and education. After all, everybody would expect whatever Government are in office to keep expenditure on those headings at least in line with what we could afford; in other words in line with national income.  These are very big items, forming a big proportion of our total expenditure.  Looking at it in that way, if we keep our expenditure in line with national income, we are doing fairly well and, in fact, doing what we should do.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien thought that our <Col N="1020" /> standard of taxation was too high, and might have the effect of discouraging industry here.  Our taxation on industry is not too high.  I think it does not unfavourably compare with the taxation on industry in any other country Our terms are good on the whole and particularly good on any products produced for export.  There is no income tax on these.  I do not think we should have any worries on the score that our taxation is so high as to discourage industry.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Ó Ciosáin when he said that he could not see what was the foundation for these pessimistic speeches of Fine Gael.  Some of them have been delivered since he spoke, and it is very hard indeed to see justification for them.  As he pointed out, unemployment is going down and employment going up.  I hope to give some figures on that point, too.</P>
    <P>I want to say with regard to exports that as compared with 1956-57, our exports last year were 21 per cent. higher.  That was remarkable in this way: it was, if you like, because we had a big increase in industrial exports, and if cattle had been going out normally, our exports would have certainly reached the highest level of all in 1959.  But, cattle did not go out in 1959, for various reasons.</P>
    <P>One reason given here is the tuberculosis regulations in both countries.  I do not think that explains the matter entirely.  Cattle came through the Winter of 1958-59 in very bad condition and were not fit for export early in the year.  Then, as the year went on, being a very dry year in England, there was no great surplus of grass there and the usual Autumn demand did not come.  We have the cattle in the country, according to the census now, and we hope we will be able to get rid of them profitably this year.</P>
    <P>Going back to the surprise of Senator Ó Ciosáin at the pessimistic speeches, it is hard to understand them unless it is a Fine Gael complex, which perhaps it is.  It is hard to understand that complex on the facts.  If we bring in a Budget, as we did this time last year, and take a chance, as I was accused of doing in both Houses last year, on getting in revenue which <Col N="1021" /> was not likely to come, and if in fact much more revenue comes in than we budgeted for, that shows revenue comes from somewhere; somebody must be paying that revenue.  The yield from income tax has not, indeed, gone up very much but has gone up a bit.  It came principally from tobacco.  If people are smoking more, smoking being a semi-luxury, and if people are taking more beer and spirits, the consumption of which went up slightly also, it is not a sign of bankruptcy in the country.  It is at least a sign that there is some resilience in the country in regard to revenue.  Since the State was established it is the first time that two Budgets in succession have been balanced-not only last year but balanced this year again.  We have only another ten days to come and we know now that our Budget for 1959-60 will be balanced.</P>
    <P>I think it was Senator O'Donovan who more or less complained that the banks were not as kind to people in 1956 as they were last year.  Banks, I suppose, have their own reasons for that and I do not like to answer for the banks.  At any rate, there was more credit available and that is a good thing as far as the country is concerned.</P>
    <P>There are other factors which could be quoted to show that everything is not as bad as might be painted by Fine Gael.  When some of the speakers on the other side were talking about farmers representing the milk suppliers, they talked about Fianna Fáil henchmen and Fianna Fáil racketeers and so on.  As I said before, when there are four-fifths of the farmers supporting Fianna Fáil consistently, even through the Economic War, in spite of Blue Shirts and everything else, it is only natural that some of their representatives will be Fianna Fáil when they come to Government Departments.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Quigley took a part in criticising the Taoiseach's speech.  He said the Taoiseach was talking about the £2,000,000 that went to civil servants.  He said it was a very small proportion of £123,000,000, which, indeed, it is, but it is a big proportion of the increase of £4,000,000 and the Taoiseach was only trying to explain to the Dáil, which I think a Taoiseach is bound to do, how this £4,000,000 arose.  If I sat down here as a dummy I am sure Senators on the other side would attack me if I could not tell them why this £4,000,000 increase was needed.  The Taoiseach was doing that.  He said £2,000,000 came by way of increased salaries, which is true.  In fact, the Taoiseach was too modest in his figure because it will be more than £2,000,000.  However, £2,000,000 will do.  Then he went on to the other figures.  Social welfare accounted for another £1,000,000; pensions for £400,000, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley stated that this increase to civil servants was due to increases in the cost of living.  The Taoiseach said&mdash;this is in reply to Senator Murphy also&mdash;that it was the first time that in these categories of wages the people who got the increases got a higher standard of living.  That is the Taoiseach's opinion.  He did not say it was all a higher standard of living at all, or anything like it.  As a matter of fact, we all know that there was an element in it of cost of living and I suppose, as Minister for Finance, I would have to say that I could not agree to give the civil servants these increases unless I was convinced that there was a large element in it of increased cost of living because I suppose the taxpayers would say that I was not fit to hold that office if I did <Col N="1023" /> otherwise.  But, the Taoiseach was of opinion, and he has a right to his opinion, that the increases generally more than cover the increased cost of living, and that is as far as he went in that respect.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley spoke about the small farmers and he said there was £220,000,000 laid down in the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> His idea was that it should all go to the small farmers.  On second thoughts, he would not agree to that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us say it should be devoted to a great extent to the small farmers.  He complained that he does not know what our policy is with regard to the small farmers.  He said it should be possible to make a dramatic improvement in the standard of living of those farmers.  A guaranteed price for wheat, he says, is no use to them.  I quite agree. The price of cattle, he says, makes no great difference to them.  Whether the price of calves goes up and the price of cattle down or the price of calves goes down and the price of cattle goes up makes very little difference to them too.</P>
      <P>The suggestion he made was that nearly all these small farmers keep a couple of pigs and the aim should be to enable them to increase the number of pigs to twenty.  It is a good idea.  There are various schemes in operation with regard to credit for piggeries and for manures to improve the land for the production of crops to feed pigs, and various other schemes.  Small farmers may not be able to go from two pigs to twenty in one year but I am quite sure that if they took advantage of the various schemes they could reach twenty pigs in two or three years if they thought it was a profitable matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator said that with higher production farmers could take a lesser <Col N="1024" /> price, which is good economics, and that the same guaranteed price would not be necessary.  That is all very good. I certainly welcome any suggestion from any Senator in a case of that kind but I do not see why at the same time the Senator should sneer at Scéim na Muc because it was at least an honest attempt to deal with the Gaeltacht and it was more or less on the lines laid down by the Senator for the small farmers generally.  Even though a scheme like that is put up by Fianna Fáil, I would ask Senators at least to let it pass.  If they are not inclined to go to the country to recommend it to everybody, I would ask them at least to let it pass and let it have a chance.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley criticised the Taoiseach for sending circulars out to local authorities asking them if they had any suggestions to make with regard to development.  Why does the Senator want an insertion in these circulars to the effect that the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;In God's name, have you anything to offer us?&rdquo;  He never said any such thing.  It just shows the prejudice of Senators on the other side against anything that may be done by the Taoiseach, by Ministers or anybody else on this side.</P>
    <P>I have often argued that if Senators opposite are not satisfied with the way things are going&mdash;it is quite obvious they are not satisfied with the way things are going and they want to improve things&mdash;it would be better to take the facts as they are rather than manufacture falsehoods and argue on them.  You would never get anywhere on that.  You must take the facts and argue on them and see if you can make things better than they are.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley and Senator L'Estrange made a biassed attack on Ministers going to dinners.  Every Minister has gone to dinners in his time.</P>

Take the case of the Minister for Agriculture going down to Waterford.  I remember when I was Minister for Agriculture a man would come to me and say: &ldquo;Why do you not come down to such-and-such a place?  You do not know what is going on in Limerick.  You do not know what is going on in Waterford.  Come down and see.&rdquo;  I was accused in the Dáil and Seanad of being out of touch with things, as was the Minister for Agriculture. If I had to deal with a beet factory I could deal with it 100 times better when I saw it.  If the Minister for Agriculture went down to see, say, a plant for the pasteurisation of milk he was doing his job by looking at it, and if the people of Waterford said to him: &ldquo;Will you have lunch?&rdquo;, do you think he would say: &ldquo;I am going over to the hotel to have lunch on my own&rdquo;?  Do you think he would be so rude as to say he would not have lunch with them?  Is it not time to stop that demagogery?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Donegan went on to say that there is no great opportunity for increasing prices for farmers. He is right.  He is right in saying the only way to give some benefit to the <Col N="1028" /> farmer is to increase his production without increasing its cost.  That is behind the policy of giving a subsidy on fertilisers and if there were other methods of that kind that could be introduced, they would be all to the good.</P>
      <P>Senator Donegan said that Fine Gael decided to relieve, the small farmers of the cost of administration.  I had not heard that; they may have.  I am not denying it, but it was never passed on to me.  As a matter of fact, only recently, I got some complaints about the cost of administration and it is a very serious matter because while big farmers, we might say, could afford it, in the case of the small farmer, if he tries to get a loan from the Agricultural Credit Corporation and if his administration has not been taken out, the loan cannot be put through.  It applies in other ways also.  It would be a great thing if they could administer a little more cheaply.  All the cost is not due to Government Departments: a fair amount of cost comes in in other ways, but I am having the matter examined.</P>
      <P>I do not know if I could agree with the Senator that free loans would be better than grants in many cases: perhaps they would, but I should like to see that examined fully.  The Senator made a suggestion which I have often heard before and which I think deserves consideration&mdash;would small farmers not be better off away from the Land Commission completely if they got help instead to enlarge their holdings by loans and so on?  These are all things which merit consideration.</P>
      <P>When Senator Donegan came to the matter of trade between Britain and ourselves, he suggested that we should lower the tariffs on all industrial goods coming in and try to secure the same terms as British farmers in the British market.  That is the obvious sort of thing that any Government would look for and all I can say at the moment is that to get an agreement of that kind, you need two people&mdash;not one&mdash;and that is the big trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Barry spoke about the cost of central and local government.  This Book of Estimates deals only with central Government and does not, in <Col N="1029" /> fact, deal with non-tax revenue.  Then, you have local government finance as well.  Taking them all together, local rates have gone up three and a half times on average since 1938-39 and central taxation has gone up by about four times, but we are actually giving five times as much to the local authorities. The amount we are giving local authorities has gone up from £5,000,000 to £25,000,000.  We are giving them more than they raise themselves, so that we have kept step with expenditure since that time and in fact we are giving a little more than we gave them in 1938-39.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  The Senator spoke of health charges.  I do not know what the health charges were in 1938-39 but I know when I was bringing in the Health Act, or rather, since I brought it in, all the local authorities combined were contributing at that time and I think the figure would be about 40 per cent.  up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Barry says it is up 150 per cent.  in Cork.  Going back to 1953, before this Bill was brought in, the amount contributed by local authorities has not gone up 50 per cent., somewhere between 40 and 50 per cent. altogether in that time, while central Government has contributed millions more.</P>
      <P>Senator Burke wanted to know if between now and Budget time, I could cut down these Estimates.  He would be surprised if he saw the cuts we have already made and I am afraid we cannot do any more.  I do not know where we would look for any further cuts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point was made by more than one Senator that if we could give the same amount of money to the development of agriculture as we give to industry, agriculture would do well.  I have not got the figures here but I am convinced that if the figure is properly brought out, it will be found we are <Col N="1030" /> giving much more to agriculture year after year than to industry.  Take all the import levies, duties, the degree of protection, and you will find that agriculture is much more protected than industry.  Take the amount of loans and you find that much more goes to agriculture.  Take grants, and again, very much more goes to agriculture. Therefore, I do not think it fair to say that if all the money going to industry were to go to agriculture, it would be quite a different story.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire suggested that we should restore ancient monuments to their original state.  I do not know much about that but I know that all archaeologists do not agree on that.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Senator that there should be no antagonism between State and private enterprise.  It is wrong that people in favour of State enterprise should attack those in private enterprise and say certain things would not happen, if it were left to State enterprise.  It is equally wrong for people in private enterprise to accuse State enterprise of carrying on by way of high protection and so on.  Both types of enterprise are doing the job as best they can and should be allowed to carry on.  I agree that State bodies are responsible to nobody, unlike private companies, and there are no shareholders and it is something that must be examined very fully but it is a matter for which it is not easy to get a solution.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire said he was talking to the Indian Ambassador in London, Madame Pandit Nehru, who said that she spent 90 per cent. of her time attending to trade matters. I am quite sure our Ambassador in London spends 90 per cent. or more of his time on trade and less than 10 per cent.  on political matters.  I do not know whether the same could be said of our Ambassadors in other countries but in most countries they do spend a good deal of time attending to trade matters.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words about Senator Murphy's speech.  I think it is very unfair for a Labour Deputy to describe the Taoiseach's speech as pillorying the trade union movement. I wonder could Senator Murphy, or <Col N="1031" /> the Deputy who made the same attack, let me see a marked copy of the Taoiseach's speech from which he gathered that impression.  There was no such intention nor was there anything in this speech in any way to support that view.</P>

He did not lay any blame whatever on the Trade Union Congress or on the Labour Party for getting that increase, but he spoke about what the result would be.  He quoted one member of the T.U.C. as saying that nothing was going to happen and said that he must be very naïve if he thought that because in his opinion, the Taoiseach said, there was going to be an increase in the cost of living.  He knew at the time that the price of bread was going up, and that was one reason.  Bus fares had gone up.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach knows these things but, according to Senator Murphy, he must put his head in the sand and say: &ldquo;Everything will be all right; do not mind about that increase in pay.&rdquo;  He must not tell the Dáil what will happen as a result.  Is that not ridiculous?  What sort of talk is that to come from a Labour Senator or from anybody else?  The Taoiseach spoke of what might happen and his next point was that farmers, naturally, would be looking at these increases and saying: &ldquo;What about us?&rdquo;  Of course the farmers were certain to get a demand from the farm labourers for an increase in their wages.</P>

      <P>The farmers knew they would get a demand.  What they are giving may be disgraceful, but, if they were to give more, where would they get it?  The Senator puts his head in the sand.  The Taoiseach asked where would the farmers get the money if they gave this increase in wages.  He pointed out that the increase would have to be put on to the price of food or met out of taxation by way of subsidy. Somebody must pay, irrespective of whether or not the Senator believes that.  Somebody must pay every increase and that increase must come ultimately either in the price of food or through the medium of an increase in taxation.</P>
      <P>That is all the Taoiseach said and, because he said that, he is accused of attacking the trade union movement.  I never heard such nonsensical and childish talk in my life.  It may suit the Labour Party to attack the Taoiseach and say that he is no friend of Labour. That may be a political stunt.  If it is a political stunt, good luck to the Labour Party but they will not get very far with it.</P>

      <P>The Senator quoted Deputy Casey.  Deputy Casey tried to prove the same point as Senator Murphy, namely, that employers could pay the increase and need not ask for it from anybody&mdash;C.I.E. excepted, of course.  Deputy Casey, as quoted by Senator Murphy, said that he examined 90 companies and they were up by 40 per cent.  The Revenue Commissioners examine all companies. They have told me what to expect next year.  According to the figures they have given me, they are not expecting to get a higher increase in tax revenue than ten per cent.</P>

      <P>Deputy Casey made his point in the Dáil.  He argued in much the same fashion as Senator Murphy; he said the Government should say nothing about an increase in prices; they should keep quiet, and see the prices did not go up.  In order to show where the money would some from, he said companies were making a 40 per cent. increase in profits.  The increase is only ten to 15 per cent.</P>

      <P>He said the Taoiseach was trying to set one section against another; that was his object.  The reason behind his speech was simply to set Labour against Fianna Fáil; he has been trying to do that for years, but he has never succeeded yet, and he will not succeed now.</P>
      <P>With regard to the delay in publishing educational reports, I shall inquire into that.  It is wrong that they should be so long delayed, but there must be some good reason for it.  I shall try to find out what the reason is.  It is not right for Senator Sheehy Skeffington to say that we are delaying these reports intentionally because we are afraid to produce them.  That kind of comment really leaves me cold.  We are not afraid of Senator Sheehy Skeffington or anybody else.  We are not afraid of anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1034" /> I was inclined to agree with Senator Sheehy Skeffington that it would be better if we had more utility schools&mdash; that is, if we spent less on the individual school and did more&mdash;but I found, on investigation, that we would not do any more and it would be bad economy in many ways.  There were several reasons advanced against it and, in the end, I capitulated.  All we can do now is to get more money to build more schools.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheridan made the usual point made by people in the country about the farmer going into the fair and selling his pigs.  The pig is downgraded by the buyer.  Later the farmer goes into the shop and he pays 4/2d. for a lb. of rashers.  It is very difficult to cope with that type of mentality.  It is very difficult to fight that and, at the same time, improve the pig industry. We must export top quality bacon if we hope to hold our markets, or get more markets.  They are very particular in these markets as to the type of bacon they will take.  We can produce that bacon only in a certain way and, if we meet with that sort of interpretation of our efforts, it will eventually become impossible to make any headway at all.</P>
    <P>I should like to give some figures now with regard to the pig population. In 1951, when Deputy Dillon became Minister for Agriculture, the number was 557,000.</P>

In June, 1957, Deputy Dillon went out of office once more and he left us 900,000.  The pig population went down during his three years.</P>

      <P>Apart from the figures being wrong, the Senator talked about beet as if he were talking to a lot of ignorant people.  He said the acreage went down.  What are the facts?  There are four factories working full-time from the middle of October to January. <Col N="1036" /> Last year or the year before, there was as much beet as they could take and, as a result, then, the acreage went down while the yield went up.  Is that not what everyone is calling forincreased production from the farms? Senator L'Estrange does not like that. That is really progress, to get more beet from the same acreage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a rather complicated measure and I do not know whether, at this hour of the night, the Seanad would like me to expatiate at length upon it because I have already spoken at length in the Dáil and, presumably, most of the members of the House have read what has already been said there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to establish special health authorities in Cork, Dublin, Limerick and Waterford.  I may say that objective was very forcibly in mind in the year 1952, when a letter was issued by the then Minister for Health to the local authorities concerned in these areas.  Since that period, there has been a great deal of debate, discussion <Col N="1037" /> and correspondence, between the Minister and these authorities.  I think I can say that seldom has there been a measure to which so much consideration has been given before it it was introduced into the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The secondary objective of the Bill is to assimilate the existing organisations for the treatment of mental illness to the general health services. The Minister for Health is, naturally, interested in securing the unification of these authorities in order to produce coordination of the various functions in a way which will enable them to render better and more convenient services to the public for whom they are intended.  He is also naturally anxious to secure, where he can, economies in the administration of the services.</P>
      <P>An extraordinary situation exists, I may say.  The city of Dublin is perhaps a leading case in point.  Here in the city and county of Dublin, almost 25 per cent. of the total population of the State resides, and, of the 706,000 people who constitute that fraction of the population, practically 36,000 persons may be assumed to live within the city of Dublin and the borough of Dún Laoghaire, their immediate suburbs and districts contiguous to them.  In other words, one can say 95 per cent. of the population of the city and county of Dublin is essentially a single population unit.  I think that fact is almost a coercive argument for unifying the administration of the health services in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In actual fact, in respect of these 700,000 souls, there are no less than seven authorities concerned with the operation of the health services, some providing similar services for the people in their own administrative areas, some providing separate services of all kinds, but all tending to overlap in one way or another, causing a great deal of confusion and inconvenience. To some extent, that position may be said to be obtaining also in the case of Cork, but not by any means in so marked a degree.  In Limerick and Waterford, we have two areas consisting of the county and county borough, two administrative units where there is not so great a degree of overlapping, but there is this <Col N="1038" /> fact that the population of both those areas is very much smaller, for instance, than it is in the case of some of the administrative counties.</P>
    <P>In the case of Limerick, the total population of Limerick city and county in 1946 was 138,000.  In the case of Waterford, it was 74,000.  Yet both these local administrative units are carrying a whole paraphernalia of health services as independent entities.</P>
    <P>The whole proposal, briefly, is to provide for the city and county of Dublin, the city and county of Cork, the city and county of Limerick and the city and county of Waterford, one health authority in each case which will administer all the services, and we hope, administer them very economically&mdash;in such a way that the services will be more readily available to the people and that some economies in their administration will be secured.</P>
    <P>It will be understood, particularly in the case of Dublin, that in many instances where a person is seeking to secure general hospital services, he may first have to go to the Dublin Corporation in order to prove that he is entitled to avail himself of these general hospital services and, when he has proved his entitlement to the services, as soon as the question arises as to whether or not he is to be charged for these services, he has then to turn to the Dublin Board of Assistance. Therefore, in respect of that simple matter of securing admission to hospital, we have two independent authorities with their two separate offices and two separate staffs dealing with the one individual.  That is one of the things which we hope will be eliminated by this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I should perhaps refer, that is, the question of the staffs of the existing health authorities.  Naturally, they have not been unconcerned as to what might happen to them in the change.  Apart from the question of remuneration, which will not be affected, there is the fear of impaired prospects of promotion, the fear of being transferred to another centre or the fear that their status may in some way be depressed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1039" /> All these are questions primarily for the persons who will be the managers of the new authorities.  The issues, however, were particularly raised in the Dublin area and I arranged for the matter to be discussed between my Department and the City Manager.  The City Manager, I understand, has been in conference with representatives of the staffs concerned on the Dublin Corporation, with particular reference to the loss of promotion prospects.  As the discussions are still in progress, I do not wish to say anything more at present, but I assure the House, as I have assured the Dáil, that my attitude and the attitude of the City Manager towards the staff who will be transferred will be sympathetic.  I am sure the same can be said for the managers of the authorities in the other areas affected by the legislation.</P>
    <P>I should hope that the Seanad will be content with that brief explanation of the Bill and, as Senator Hayes suggested, on the Committee Stage, I shall be prepared to deal at greater length with the various points of detail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>As an inhabitant of one of the areas the Bill will affect, I welcome the Bill, with, I confess, a note of desperation in my voice.  The note of desperation comes from the fact that I am a member of the local council which is trying to make the existing health legislation operate. Whatever hopes this Bill brings, they must be more than pious hopes.  We must make the new Act work or, if we do not, we shall have to get rid of it and of whatever is there already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the premise that the services the Bill will provide could not possibly be worse than what are there, we must give the Bill a trial but if it does not work, we should tear up the whole thing.  The explanatory memorandum says there has been inefficiency and confusion under the present system.  That is a complete description of the way the Act has worked. It is a very painful confusion of bad planning and, as a result, I think the various councils have been run very close to bankruptcy.  The ratepayers <Col N="1040" /> are not much better off.  On the whole, the people who are sick, I think, are not much better off than they were.</P>
    <P>I do not subscribe to the notion that all the services deteriorated but certainly some groups of people seeking help have not been able to get the help they would have got before the Health Act came along.  I said last night that the cost of health services in Cork increased in ten years from £175,000 to £530,000.  It is a fantastic and frightening growth.  It tends to injure and destroy the fabric of local government because all other local government purposes have been snowed under as a result.  If there is any prospect of remedying the matter through this Bill, then I want this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware of the position in Cork city.  It is the fault of the inhabitants of that old city that, for years, they have been thinking of extending the city boundary but only the City Council have done anything. The Minister is aware, too, that there has been overlapping in the areas controlled by the South Cork Board of Assistance.  We hope he will rationalise the situation.  It is a most dreadful jig-saw.  If the new authority can sort it out, I am all for the new authority.</P>
    <P>The statistical population of the city of Cork, as it is at present geographically described, is 80,000 but the real population is somewhere about 120,000.  The suburbs on the periphery of the city contain the difference.  These are well-off citizens.  They make very few claims on health or social services. They are ideal inhabitants for the authority in whose area they live.</P>
    <P>I want to make this plea to the Minister.  In the interim period, whilst the extension is being carried out, there are obvious difficulties for Cork city because, in the city proper as we now have it, too few carry too many of those who demand such services.  The city is an ill-contrived place because of this spilling-over of the authority of the county.  Until that is made right, there are certain&mdash;the Minister knows what I mean&mdash;delicate problems on which we might have trouble with our <Col N="1041" /> colleagues on the county council.  The Minister understands the position.  I want to express my gratitude for his help.</P>
    <P>It is not completely inappropriate to express the hope that the great regional hospital project in Cork has finally been shelved.  I have spent four years trying to achieve this result, with the assistance, indeed, of a notable member of the Government Party.  However, £60,000 has been spent on the project.  This is one example of the kind of planning done under the previous health services.  That money has been spent on planning and on ground purchase.  We should forget the scheme.  We should throw it into the River Lee and let it go to the tide. Let us sell the site but let us not go ahead with that scheme because I believe we cannot afford it.  It is as simple as that.  I and, I am sure, the Minister, in our private affairs, would not dream of spending money if we could not afford it unless it were absolutely essential for our existence. This regional hospital is not essential. If anything, Cork is an over-hospitalised area.  We should employ that simple yardstick to all such proposals &mdash;I want to stress &ldquo;all&rdquo;&mdash;until we can afford them.</P>
    <P>I have been regarded as speaking in this House in the rôle of a very constant pilgrim to the Wailing Wall. We are in trouble in this country because I think we are living beyond our means and spending too much.  Organisations can protect themselves but the large unvocal section of our people are unorganised.  The load of taxation is crushing them.  We have this health service.  I hope this Bill will make it work more efficiently.  If it does that, I hope, at a lower cost than the cost of the present service, I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>If one accepts the present organisation of the health services as the ideal, then I think that probably this Bill is to be welcomed. There has been a great deal of confusion in the minds of the people as to the organisation of the health services, particularly in Dublin and Dublin county.  In so far as this Bill helps <Col N="1042" /> to rationalise what is, to my mind, a very defective system, it is to be welcomed. If a few years ago somebody had got up in this House and said that the services in Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Galway were inefficient and led to confusion on the part of the public, I wonder whether such a statement would not be branded as extravagant.</P>
      <P>I have no great hope, I must confess, even when this measure of rationalisation of the health services in the different counties to which it is to apply takes place, that the individual, when he is sick in bed in hospital and when he is in the outpatients' department, will get a particular advantage.  I have known cases of people who were sent as public health patients by dispensary doctors into hospitals in the city of Dublin.  I know one case of a person who met with an accident about one o'clock in the afternoon involving a fracture of the collar-bone.  On going in for an X-ray, that person was greeted with a complaint that he should have been in earlier because the X-ray department shut down at 5 o'clock, as if the person could influence the time at which accidents take place.</P>
      <P>It struck me very forcibly that some extra money could be provided to make the place where people in the out-patients' department have to sit, oftentimes for long hours, more comfortable, more presentable and less draughty.  That would do a great deal to improve the lot of the individual who wants to avail of the public health services in this city.  If this Bill were designed to achieve a reorganisation in these important details for the persons who want to avail themselves of the public health services satisfactorily, I would give the Bill unqualified approval.</P>

    <P>I oftentimes wonder whether those charged with the administration of the health services&mdash;I confine my experience to Dublin simply&mdash;would go about and see what the unfortunate people who are in a state of ill-health or are not feeling well have to put up with from the point of view of interminable delays, lack of information as to what they should do and uncertainty <Col N="1043" /> as to their rights at the various hospitals they have to attend.  I hope that with the establishment of a single authority in Dublin and, perhaps, in the other places, Cork, Waterford and Limerick, there will be one central authority who will have the whole duty, burden and responsibility which they cannot shelve on to any other authority of seeing to these very important details that so much affect the dignity very often of the unfortunate people who are in need of treatment.</P>
    <P>I would hope that, when this is got out of the Minister's way, he will be able to organise things in such a way that the personal element that enters into the administration of the health services will be taken care of to a much greater extent.  If the people operating these health services only observed a modicum of ordinary courtesy you would not have some of the bitter complaints and recrimination one hears from poor people at the present time who know they are poor and feel that there is no other service available to them.</P>
    <P>I had hoped to have the opportunity of raising a number of matters at this stage in relation to certain sections of the Bill but I forbear from doing so on account of the attitude the Minister adopted in not delaying the House unduly because of the time of night, but since the Minister referred to the question of staff, that is one of the matters I am concerned about as a member elected on the Labour Panel.  I feel bound to comment upon the matter at this stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the staff in the various authorities are very concerned about their future position.  I must say that reading the Bill I felt it was extremely unsatisfactory in relation to the provisions being made for staff who are to be affected by this piece of legislation.  I should have thought that there would be a clear declaration contained in the sections dealing with the transfer of staff that the staff to be transferred to the new authority would not suffer any worsening of conditions of service.  I should have thought that the Minister could go somewhat further, that <Col N="1044" /> where people do, in fact, suffer a worsening in their prospects of promotion, which is bound to happen in a service which is amalgamated, some kind of compensation similar to that which is found in other statutes under which people are affected in regard to employment would have been made available to them in this measure.</P>
    <P>That is important for this reason: If we transfer staff from one body to another and they are badly affected as far as their future is concerned by the change, you will not have the contented staff administering the health services you should have. Above all, I think in relation to health services, you must have a staff who are working at maximum efficiency and who have no reasonable grounds for dissatisfaction and grievance.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that this is a matter which has already been raised by the staff themselves but he says it would be primarily a matter for the new authorities.  That is immediately where I part company with the Minister because the position of existing staff in these different statutory bodies is being affected&mdash;and very probably adversely affected, in some instances&mdash; by an enactment of the Oireachtas.  If the position of the people is being adversely affected by an enactment of the Oireachtas, I think the Oireachtas has a duty, as it has undertaken in other cases, to offset the adverse effects created by its own legislation.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to consider the possibility, even at this stage&mdash;and I believe he has gone a great distance in satisfying demands in the Dáil&mdash;of providing some statutory basis for the provision of compensation to people who will be adversely affected in their future prospects by this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the attitude of the county managers, the heads of health authorities, and his own attitude, will be sympathetic.  While I have no doubt that the Minister, being the good natured man he recently declared himself to be, will be sympathetic, very often, a Minister's resources do not go as far as his sympathy and in these circumstances the sympathy is not worth a great deal. <Col N="1045" /> Either the Minister should ask the Oireachtas to invest him with authority or, alternatively, he should invest the new authorities which are to be created under this Bill with resources from which to meet the justifiable claims of people who will be adversely affected in their future prospects by this piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>I abhor the thought of having people operating this legislation who would be prejudiced from the start because of the adverse affect the legislation would have on their future prospects.  They will be operating a service which requires the maximum of goodwill and efficiency.  There are other matters on which I should like to speak on this stage but perhaps they can be dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill because it brings the authorities in the different areas together and in so doing produces an average cost for the Health Act, as far as impact on the rates is concerned.  In my view, this is a good thing but there are grave anomalies and grave disparities in the burden which is placed on the ratepayers by the Health Act by virtue of the fact that some areas are poor areas and other areas quite rich.  For instance, take two areas which are not being dealt with in this Bill as concrete examples.  In Louth, where I am a member of the county council, a penny in the £ brings in about £1,000. There are two large urban populations and this, of course, results in a very heavy impact on the ratepayers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly, then, I <Col N="1046" /> shall say that, in my opinion, in the seven authorities in Dublin, there could be a different impact on the rates by the Health Act more than in another.  For instance, in one of the authorities which has a large residential area in which middle-class people reside and with many above the middle income group, the impact on the rates will be relatively small.  If one takes an area in which great numbers of people in the lower income groups reside then the impact would be very large.  Therefore, the joining together of these authorities levels out the charge and makes it follow that an application for a service from a person in one area, having identical income and commitments, will not be refused or accepted in another area as at present.</P>
      <P>This is a good arrangement and the point I want to make is that before another decade has passed, the Minister will have to go further and bring other authorities together as he is doing in this Bill.  I believe it is quite wrong that outside the scope of this Bill authorities should be in a position that they can do far more for the people of a rich area than for a poor area.  I believe the Minister will have to take more steps to bring the whole country into line as he is doing in the case of the major boroughs.</P>

I shall then perhaps be able to satisfy him that the fears he expressed for the staffs he mentioned are not well founded.</P>
