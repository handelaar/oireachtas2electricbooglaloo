      <P>I have notice from Senator Donie Cassidy that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Government to restore Lough Sheelin Lake to its former pollution-free state.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator John Connor of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to reveal his attitude to the proposal of the Western Health Board to confirm the size of Roscommon County Hospital at 100 acute surgical-medical beds.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Maurice Manning of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to compensate the former employees of Irish Shipping in view of his promise made in that regard in June 1985.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator David Norris of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The use of public funds to support the manufacture of mercury soap in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1344" /> I regard the matters raised by Senators Cassidy, Connor, Manning and Norris as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator Cassidy's motion and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m., or earlier if the business ordered is concluded before then. Senators Connor, Manning and Norris may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>Before I announce the Order of Business for today, may I just remark that the Seanad is sitting at a time when the nation is under a cloud because of a number of incidents which happened during the past number of weeks on this island?  First, it behoves me to send a very sincere and deep expression of sympathy to the relatives and friends of those who died in the carnage in Enniskillen in the past few days.  There is nobody in the world &mdash; and it does not make any difference from what side of politics they come or from what country they come &mdash; who could not but abhor the cruel murder of the people of Enniskillen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not alone was there the cruel murder of the people of Enniskillen, but there was also an attempted murder of children on the same day in the west of the North of Ireland, where a bomb did not go off. There were attempts on the lives of other people in the North on the same day. The sympathy of this House has to be expressed, as I have said, to the people who are directly involved and to the families of those who died and, indeed, to the families of those whose injuries will be with them for the rest of their lives. Sympathy must be extended equally to the people of the North of Ireland.  We must assure them that there is nobody in this House who could express anything but abhorrence for what happened.  It was not done in our name.  Nobody can suggest it was.  Equally, we must ensure that in the coming weeks nothing we do <Col N="1345" /> will give any sympathy, or sign of sympathy or help, to the perpetrators of that hideous crime.</P>
    <P>When I say that, we have to refer to the cruel interference by kidnappers with the health of dentist John O'Grady.  Savages would not perpetrate the injuries that were done to him.  We must admit that throughout this country there is a very small minority of people who helped in the carrying out of that kidnap, whether it was by supplying safe houses, or by not going to the Garda and suggesting that they were in the areas, or by supplying motor vehicles.  It is a fact that motor vehicles were used as decoys in many areas.  There were a very small number of people involved.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that people outside the country or, indeed, people inside the country would not consider that the people who were involved in that kidnap had the sympathy of anybody.  They are butchers, terrorists and people who have no regard for law and definitely no regard for life.  The problems we have in this country will not be resolved by getting down to the level of animals.  Animals only, we have to say, would carry out the indiscriminate killing and the indiscriminate carnage that happened over the past couple of weeks.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to say I sincerely hope that never again will I have to stand up in this House and express sympathy or emotion for the people of any part of Ireland because of crimes such as those that were committed over the past few days.</P>

      <P>Before calling Senator Manning, the Chair would prefer if the leaders of the groups would just express sympathy towards those people and not make a very broad, wideranging statement on the matter.  I would appreciate the co-operation of my colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I will confine myself to what happened in Enniskillen.  The other matters raised by the Leader of the House are properly the subject of a full <Col N="1346" /> debate in this House later today.</P>
      <P>In the long catalogue of horror over the past 17 years on this island, few events can have generated such total revulsion as the massacre of innocent, decent Irish people, gathered together to solemnly honour their dead in Enniskillen last Sunday.  Our hearts and our prayers go out to the families and friends of those so shamefully slaughtered in the name of Irish unity.  Coupled with our heartfelt sympathy, however, our unambiguous condemnation of the Provisional IRA and their political facade, Provisional Sinn Féin, must go out from this House. Condemnation in words is not enough. We must show our sincerity in deeds.</P>
      <P>The sneaking regarders, the providers of safe houses, the purveyors of hatred and of the double-think must be shown that there is no place for them in our society.  The sickening hypocrisy of Sinn Féin must be shown for what it is.  The intention of the bombers was to kill and to maim.  No words of apology or regret can change that.  Finally, I call upon all people on both sides of the Border to give full and unfettered support and co-operation to the police forces on both sides of the Border in bringing the perpetrators of this and other crimes to justice. On behalf of the Fine Gael Party in the Seanad, I want to extend our heartfelt sympathy to those who so needlessly suffered and died last Sunday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Chair will allow me a little licence.  I feel that I am here as the only person, unrepresentative though I may be, belonging to one particular tradition of Irishman.  Last Sunday, I had the honour to be invited to address Orga Fianna Fáil in Galway. It was not until I was returning that I heard on the radio the news of what had happened in Enniskillen.  Since then, in spite of all the grief and the horror, at time I have felt inspired by some of the things that have been said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The moving account of Mr. Gordon Wilson of his last minutes with his daughter under the rubble is a tribute to the courage and forebearance of the people of Northern Ireland as a whole.  Grief and <Col N="1347" /> tragedy similar to his have afflicted many people in our small part of this island. Yet seldom have the words of one man testified so poignantly to the capacity of the human spirit for goodness.  His moving statement in which there was no rancour and his simple faith in asking God's forgiveness for those responsible for the deaths of all those people in Enniskillen and for those injured at last Sunday's memorial service included the words: &ldquo;Father, forgive them for they know not what they do&rdquo;.  This, surely, was a monument of man's humanity to man.  Another great person, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, in his Nobel prize-winning lecture, concluded in the seventies that violence uses falsehood for its justification and that falsehood sows the seeds of more violence.  Until all of us in Ireland can ask ourselves the most profound questions about our attitudes in relation to those most opposed to our point of view, our deeply rooted falsehoods, one about the other, will not be exorcised and the cycle of violence will not be broken.</P>
    <P>On 11 November 1987 in Seanad Éireann, I appeal that we should all ask what have we, our families and our tradition, done to create the state of mind, the historical legacy, the hardness of heart and the social condition which, on top of approximately 2,500 deaths &mdash; some which I saw with my own eyes &mdash; and 30,000 casualties, culminated in Sunday's massacre.  As I stand here in Seanad Éireann, perhaps alone but hopefully to be in the future not a lone voice out of my tradition in the North of Ireland, I must start by asking forgiveness for my role and the role of any of those of my tradition who could identify with me, for attitudes and actions through history which have led to the resentment, the guilt, the hatred and the bitterness that brought us to this present point of violent impasse.</P>
    <P>There cannot be a family in Ireland who have not suffered grief through loss of a loved one in the First World War, the Rising, the Anglo-Irish War, the Civil <Col N="1348" /> War, the Second World War, peace missions and in the past 18 years of strife in Northern Ireland.  This day, 11 November, has a special place in the folk memory for many Irish people.  Yet, like so many things in Ireland today, the symbolism, the pantheon of heroes associated with this day, may also be a source of division among us when it might be an opportunity for healing.  On the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month in 1918, my father, along with what remained of the 80,000 Catholic and 50,000 Protestant Irishmen who had gone to fight with Britain, came out of the hellhole of those dug-outs in Flanders.  In the 1939-45 war the 40,000 Northern Irishmen who joined up as volunteers to fight the forces of Fascism were joined by 60,000 Southern Irishmen.</P>
    <P>Every year, like most families in Northern Ireland, I have worn the poppy as an emblem of remembrance.  I have never worn it in Seanad Éireann because I am aware that the same poppy has been perceived as a symbol of imperialism in the Republic.  I have no doubt that not everyone would wear the poppy like Gordon Wilson, the father of the young nurse, as an emblem of remembrance, thanksgiving and forgiving.  It is because of my respect for this House and the honour done to me by the Taoiseach and his predecessor, and because of the terrible sensitivities and misunderstandings that still exist in Ireland in relation to the bitter legacy of our history that I have never worn the poppy here.</P>
    <P>We need trust, courage and a new symbolism if we are to move to give all Irish people the self-confidence to build a new country of independent people recognising their inter-dependence.  We also need symbolism.  I trust, therefore, that this poppy, which I have never worn but which I hold now in this House, will be seen not as a symbol of imperialism but rather as an emblem of remembrance, repentance, thanksgiving and forgiving. I will now offer you this poppy, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, and may I say how proud I am to stand before you and before this great flag which, as I have said before <Col N="1349" /> in this House, represents an emblem of peace.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Senator Robb left his seat, approached the dais and presented the Leas-Chathaoirleach with a poppy.</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Members applauded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>After hearing those very moving words from Senator Robb, I feel a little inadequate for the task given to me by the Labour Party.  Nevertheless, I feel I must go ahead with it.  No matter what language we use to condemn the perpetrators of this atrocity, this deed of elemental savagery, and no matter how harsh are our words or how elequently we voice our condemnations, the terrorists will be in no way convinced.</P>
      <P>However, having said that, it is imperative that we never fail to condemn these appalling deeds, always with the thought in mind that we will get the understanding of the people of the North and get the words across to them that the perpetrators are not acting in our name.  We must use every opportunity and every forum to condemn in the strongest possible way the appalling callousness of the Provisionals and other terrorists, in the hope that our collective feelings will somehow penetrate to some degree the minds of those ambivalent people, North and South of the Border, to an extent that some, at least, will prise themselves loose.</P>
      <P>Words are wasted also on people who provide safe houses, whether they are proprietors or people who rent houses. Nevertheless, we must condemn them also.  They are directly guilty of increasing sectarian provocation.  Therefore, our words calling on them to re-think their situation would be wasted.  Every time we get an opportunity we must come out as strongly as possible to condemn such deeds despite the fact that many people may think words are not sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having heard Senator Robb today, the power of words certainly has shown itself here.  There are two very significant developments as a result of the Enniskillen <Col N="1350" /> bombing.  One is the degree and the length to which the Catholic Church are now prepared to go in condemning the Provisional IRA and their associated organisations.  In an unprecedented way, the Soviets have now taken it on board. It should go on record that we congratulate the Soviets for taking a stand also.  There is a question of an increase in the resources to be made available to the Garda.  The whole question of security must be examined.  Unless we can give the Garda more resources so that the term &ldquo;no hiding place&rdquo; will have real meaning, many of our words will be wasted.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying, in association with Senator Robb, that it is a sad day when people who come together for the sake of remembering their own dead &mdash; and some of the people at those remembrance day services would be very old people and very young people &mdash; could be the victims of somebody who could sit down and calculate how to do the maximum damage.  In the South of Ireland we have recognised the need to commemorate the memories of all who fell in all wars.  When we think of our own soldiers who are giving their lives in the interests of peace in Lebanon, the Congo and other places, and of the terrible difficulties they are faced with, it is sad to think that we could have been commemorating them as well as everyone else.  That is, in fact, what we were doing in other places.  Somebody could have made up his mind to put a bomb there and blow us to pieces while commemorating our own Irish soldiers who died.</P>
    <P>We should not hesitate on any occasion to condemn in a collective way the deeds of any terrorist organisation.  We should send a message from the Seanad to the people of Enniskillen expressing our total abhorrence of Sunday's events.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with the sympathy expressed to the families of those so brutally killed in Enniskillen.  I was at that funeral yesterday. I can tell the House that it was a sad occasion.  No words could express <Col N="1351" /> the great faith and courage of Gordon Wilson.  I had the pleasure of being brought back to the hotel to join the family.  Mr. Wilson was very composed and accepted that Marie is with God.  I just said: &ldquo;when, oh when, will we, the people of this country, realise that we have all got to unite to beat terrorism?&rdquo; When you attend such a funeral you see the sadness created by those callous cowards &mdash; and they were nothing else. Religion, regardless of what side you are on, is something sacred in this country and that was a religious ceremony.  Anybody who interferes with anybody's religious beliefs should never be forgiven. From the bottom of my heart I condemn them.  I hope, as many people said yesterday after the funeral, that this is the turning point.  Perhaps people have at last seen the ruthlessness and the callousness of those desperate people.  I hope all of us from this day forward will ensure that they are put out of existence.</P>
      <P>I would also like to pay tribute to the Garda on the release of John O'Grady. When I heard that those people amputated that man's fingers with a hammer and chisel my mind went back 34 years. Nobody here knows the pain and agony of a lost limb.  I remember holding my arm and the dreadful pain in it.  I cannot bear to think of the pain and agony John O'Grady suffered because of ruthless, heartless criminals who must all be condemned. They must be run to the ground. Everybody &mdash; and I emphasise everybody &mdash; must play their part in ensuring that wherever they see them they report it and assist the Garda to bring them to justice.  No matter how many years sentence they get, it will not be sufficient for the hideous crimes they have committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Senator Robb for his very moving speech and to say how honoured I am to be sharing this House with him.  Great grief was caused to everyone when we heard of the awful desecration on Sunday in Enniskillen.  It is a grim reminder that this small country is to continue to be torn apart by insane division based on <Col N="1352" /> religion and cultural background despite all the efforts of people of peace all over the world.</P>
      <P>That any organisation could so arrogantly perform such a callous act and issue such an offensive statement as that which we heard yesterday can only lead one to a sense of despair and hopelessness. Are all the efforts of politicians in the past few years in the New Ireland Forum, with the Anglo-Irish Agreement to mean nothing?  Are the contributions of cultural and sports groups, the trade unions and the young people to mean nothing because they are in conflict with these self appointed murderers in the IRA, the INLA, Sinn Féin and any other so called political wings?  Are all these efforts towards reconciliation, co-existence and the bringing of the kind of normality to life in Northern Ireland most people can take for granted in other countries to count for nothing?</P>
      <P>Sunday's atrocity has shown what the terrorists think of our aspirations along that line.  We must say to these violent people once more: &ldquo;You do not speak for us.  Desist from doing so&rdquo;.  Also we must say: &ldquo;We do not want you in our Irish community.  We do not want you regardless of what passport you carry any more than we would want to unite with terrorists and fellow travellers from Lebanon, Latin America or anywhere else.  Your brethren, I feel, are in the violent communities of the world, not here in the Twenty-six Counties.  You identify only with those who trade in guns and the tools of destruction and cause the loss of human life and the maiming of so many.  You are so dehumanised.  You do not speak the language of ordinary people.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would like to send my sincere sympathy and that of my family to the people of Enniskillen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Members of the House I, too, was somewhat humbled by the contribution made by my colleague, Senator Robb.  I know I speak not only for the Members of this House but for people throughout the country in conveying to Senator Robb, and the <Col N="1353" /> tradition he represents in this House so honourably, our sincere commiseration and condemnation of what happened in Enniskillen.</P>
      <P>I know that the Wilson family are natives of County Leitrim; Gordon Wilson's father lived in Manor-hamilton and sadly died some years ago and was well known in the county mainly through his fishing activities.  County Leitrim perhaps, in recent years, has attained a certain notoriety for other events.  I know I speak for the overwhelming majority of the people of that small county when I say that the sense of loss we felt for the people in our sister county transcends any attitudes or feelings of a political nature.</P>
      <P>I grew up in a small community, like many of the small communities in Northern Ireland where there are other denominations.  I live across the road from a Methodist Church.  Our community has always had both Church of Ireland people and Methodists within it who have taken a full and active role in that community.  I number among my friends people from across the religious divide.  Like many towns and villages throughout Ireland, North and South, this community has people within it, families going back to the first Great War, people who were, particularly in the West, members of the Connaught Rangers and who in their way went out to fight for the freedom of small nations and for the nation that then was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the political reality of the sensitivities Senator Robb spoke about in relation to the poppy, but growing up as I did with that knowledge of people I knew and whose families I know, who had for the highest of motives gone out to fight in the first World War, I could never really understand why when 11 November came around even the most basic representation of the sacred remembrance of their cause could not be manifested in the Republic.  Perhaps the symbolic presentation of the poppy to the Leas-Chathaoirleach in the House today might go some way towards breaking that old mould despite the political differences <Col N="1354" /> there are in this island and despite the reality of part of our country being occupied by a foreign military force.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to dwell too much on what is a very sad occasion for this House and through it a very sad occasion for the country generally but I would ask one thing.  There should not be an over-reaction to what happened in Enniskillen. I have been attending a trial in London of people I believe to be innocent of the crimes of which they have been accused and convicted primarily as a consequence of an over-reaction in the seventies.  I say that in the context in which the debate so far has taken place. Speaking as I do as a representative of the people of County Leitrim, I offer my most heartfelt and sincere commiseration to the families and the friends of those who were murdered last Sunday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of those I represent I can only concur with the words which have been said already.  It is difficult to follow on the comments of some of the speakers, in particular Senator Robb and Senator Farrell with their personal experiences.  Nevertheless, we feel in some sense we have failed. We have failed in many ways.  I recall holidaying just outside Enniskillen about 18 months ago and when I noticed that mine was the only Southern car in a very large, well-appointed and beautiful caravan park, I thought to myself how much we had failed.  Every time I cross the Border from the North I think how far removed our armchair republicans and our pub politicians are when it comes to recognising the reality; how far we have failed to explain to people that the difference between the Methodist from Enniskillen, the Presbyterian from Ballymena, the Protestant from the Shankill and the Catholic from Cork is really only a sub-cultural difference in the greater scheme of things and in the way that we should be operating as a nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we have seen this week in Enniskillen is, as has already been said, totally and utterly unacceptable.  It is unsupportable <Col N="1355" /> in any way, shape or form.  It is shameful in every way.  It is an act of extreme cowardice and it is important to stress this as well to people who pretend to put some sort of a value on courage, etc.  It was an act of cowardice; it was an act against people who were in no way able to defend themselves.  It was an act against people who were innocent of whatever might have happened whenever, wherever.  Undoubtedly, we have also failed in that we have failed to root out and to identify those people who purport to support the campaign, whatever that might be, but who oppose its effects. There can be no distinction.  People who support what those cowards are about are also responsible for the action that took place there last weekend.  There can be no doubt about this.  We must accept some share of the blame in that we have failed to convince our nation of those facts.</P>
    <P>We must look for unity of a different kind.  We must look for unity of determination, unity of spirit and unity of understanding.  We must again trot out the best definition of education which is to create tolerance and not just the tolerance of remaining cool about what happened on Sunday because that is easy enough to ask for: the real tolerance is tolerance of differences in other people's point of view.  We have failed miserably to do that.  As a nation we have spent more time looking at, creating, seeking out, identifying differences rather than looking at what we have in common and working towards what we have in common.  I am not just talking about geographical unity here.  I am talking about unity of determination to achieve a quality of life.</P>
    <P>I have spent a fair amount of time in the North of Ireland and I have always found a most admirable people, people who have shown extreme resilience to factors over which they have no control. It is important also that we should recognise that the vast majority of people in the North, no matter which political viewpoint they hold, abhor violence of this type and abhor the happenings of last <Col N="1356" /> Sunday.  There is no support for that kind of event.</P>
    <P>As a nation we must ask ourselves: how much longer can we suffer this kind of atrocity?  As a country how can we ever think, how can we ever contemplate, how we can ever believe that killing can unify?  Where have we failed in giving this message to our people?  As public representatives we must not only condemn out of hand these actions but recognise that, as long as these and other such actions continue, we have failed.  We have a duty to look into our hearts to find a new direction, to find a new road and to look to a future of people who are supportive of each other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my colleagues in extending sympathy to the families, friends and relatives of the people who were murdered so brutally in Enniskillen this week-end.  Sadly for Ireland, we have many problems down here in the South such as the unemployed.  I ask the question: will this help to create a livelihood for our young people who are unemployed, in the light of the publicity it has got throughout the world?</P>
      <P>They are nothing short of cowards and I condemn them.  I would like to remind anybody with a double think towards their aim that their ambition is to overthrow the institutions of the State here if they get their way.  People should be aware of this.  What has happened across the Border in the past week is frightening. Our very independence is at stake.  It is time for everybody to stand up and be counted because anybody who remains silent is as responsible as the people who were involved in that terrible massacre last Sunday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With your permission, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, I would like to pay tribute to a neighbour of mine, Detective Martin O'Connor from Cahir, who was so brave in carrying out his duty last weekend.  I wish him a speedy recovery and extend every sympathy to his wife and family.  I would also like to pay tribute to all the other gardaí and to the three brave ladies who were kidnapped over the weekend, <Col N="1357" /> one of them from Tipperary, for the courage they showed.  I wish all our gardaí every success.  We owe this to them.  They are in the front line.</P>
    <P>The people of Tipperary are proud of that young detective.  He did not think about himself.  He went in, in the interests of the nation and the people, to root out those horrible men of violence.  Men like him will continue to bring honour to the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1970 we witnessed bombing tragedies in the northern part of our country and also on one terrible Friday, in our own native city here in Dublin, but what distinguishes what happened at Enniskillen last Sunday from all the other bombing tragedies is that the people of Enniskellin had gathered to commemorate their dead.  This commemoration of the dead is a noble tradition. It finds its basis in the Old Testament &mdash;&ldquo;It is a holy and a wholesome thought to pray for the dead.&rdquo;  Yet, while these people were doing that traditional act, men of violence placed a bomb to take their lives.  Let us look for a moment at those whom those people were commemorating.  They were Irish men and women who served in two World Wars to save this country and western Europe from the tyranny of Hitler and is it not sad that our own country now is suffering from another kind of tyranny?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have one promise from Almighty God, that is, that evil will never triumph over good.  Before last Sunday this country and the world had never heard of Gordon Wilson.  I believe that he is an instrument now being used by Divine Providence to portray to the world what is good as against what is evil.  His statement afterwards showed a wonderful New Testment sense of charity and forgiveness. His words, and I am sure the words of many families, are like a beacon of light in a terrible darkness that covers this country.  I believe also that what Gordon Wilson's words manifest is probably the courage and symbolism that Senator Robb speaks about.  I hope, and I know, that his words will touch the hearts of all civilised men and women and <Col N="1358" /> turn them from what is bad to what is good.</P>
    <P>I know Senator Robb was deeply moved by what he was saying.  Some years ago a young boy who was working in a sawmill in Mountnugent, County Cavan, had his arm severed.  He was rushed to the local Cavan hospital but they had not the facilities to deal with the problem.  They searched the public houses in Cavan town for ice and packed his arm in a box and sent it along with the young boy to a hospital in Belfast. Nobody asked his religion and for 14 hours a team of surgeons worked to stitch back that limb, and succeeded.  Yet, in our midst there are evil men who can take up a gun or plant a bomb and not just take a limb, but take human life and many human lives.  I tell that story to distinguish between what is good and what is evil.  I also tell it today to pay tribute to Senator Robb and his colleagues for the wonderful contributions they have made in the past and are making today in helping to patch up human bodies that have been mutilated by the men of violence over the past 20 long years.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I would like to thank the Irish Catholic Bishops and other Church leaders for their unambiguous statements and I hope what they said will be listened to and practised by all people who proclaim themselves Christians.</P>

      <P>I would also like to join in extending my sympathy to the families of the people who were so indiscriminately and savagely killed in Enniskillen on Sunday.  Like my colleague, Senator Mooney, I live about 15 miles from Enniskillen and I have been there on many occasions to use their sporting facilities and otherwise and I know many people there.  We had Leitrim connections among people who lost their lives.  Marine Wilson's grandfather came from Leitrim.  My next door neighbour lost his first cousin and her husband in the atrocity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Robb explained the way people feel.  It is very sad that we have to <Col N="1359" /> make statements like this in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The perpetrators of this cruel deed and their supporters are unfit to live in a civilised society.  I ask anybody who knows where those people are who planted that bomb, or any other bombs, to come forward and help in the inquiries so that these wrong doers are put behind bars and not allowed to participate in society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very solemn day. Everyone in this House has been moved in particular by the words and the historic gesture of Senator Robb.  I am particularly glad that it was so graciously accepted and unanimously approved by this House.  This kind of gesture afforded to us on such a sad occasion is a small beginning on the road of reconciliation and I speak also out of the Southern branch of the tradition which Senator Robb so ably represents in this House.</P>
      <P>Like everybody else I was almost moved to tears by the interview with Gordon Wilson but the saddest thing of all in that interview &mdash; there were many noble things in it, for example, where he spoke of the fact that he and his wife had the grace on the evening on which their daughter was killed to pray for the perpetrators of that appalling act &mdash; was when he said he was glad his daughter had not been left with a shattered body in a wheelchair to survive for decades as an irrelevant codicil to this vile struggle. I think today of the many hundreds of people, with many of whom Senator Robb will be familiar, who have been marginalised in the most unspeakable way and who it is so easy to forget, the people who over the past 15 years have been placed in wheelchairs and who it is so easy, except on tragic occasions like this, to forget about altogether.  It is a solemn thought that a parent can say he was glad his child did not survive in this terrible condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to echo what the other Members of this House have said with regard to the persons involved in this atrocity and in particular what Senator Fennell said.  We want no part of these <Col N="1360" /> people; they do not speak for us.  Perhaps it would be appropriate for the Government to consider what practical measures can flow from this.  I am not thinking of the re-introduction of the death penalty; I think it would be an absolute mistake.  It would be wrong for us to allow ourselves under the pressure of emotionalism to sink to the level of barbarity of these people.  But they speak for us, they presume to speak for us.  Is it not possible to exclude them from our company, to withdraw the previleges with which they have been provided and to find some legislative method of withdrawing the privileges of citizenship from them?  In my book, they most certainly are not Irishmen.  I do not wish in any sense to be political in a partisan or party sense on this but I cannot help reminding the House that every member of Sinn Féin as well as the IRA is implicated in this.</P>
    <P>I remember over the past couple of years how every member of this party was asked to support the policy of the military struggle and the chilling phrase, &ldquo;the Armalite in one hand and the ballot box in the other&rdquo;.  It is futile for persons like Mr. Adams to attempt now to conceal the arm that holds the Armalite because we have seen it and its consequences all too clearly here over these past sad days.  Perhaps the most significant thing that this House can do unanimously today is to extend our heartfelt sympathy to our brothers and sisters in the Northern section of this island.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The feeling in this country this week after such a vicious week last week, particularly in the South, left an unbelievable feeling of revulsion in our society.  Even from people who I will admit were aware many times before of the bad accidents and incidents in the North there was an extraordinary reaction last Sunday.  The incidents in the South in the previous week proved that the violence was coming closer to us and it is now very close to us.  Many Senators have said this.  I got the feeling that it only happened around the corner, I think there is a message in this.  There is a message in the sadness down South all <Col N="1361" /> last week because of the kidnapping and the shootings and then in something like this happening.  The perpetrators say they represent the people of Ireland or the people of Southern Ireland and want to do these deeds on behalf of us.  The people of Cork I was talking to in the past two to three days do not have that feeling.</P>
      <P>I offer all the bereaved relatives my prayers and the prayers of all the people of Ireland.  The people of Cork wish to be associated with that.  Senator Doyle has summed up the message for us: we all have a responsibility.  We must stand up not alone in the case of this incident but every incident that happens and make no apologies for letting our words go forth from places like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to extend my sympathy to the families of the people who were killed and hurt.  Like Senator Robb I was at the same conference and when somebody said a bomb had gone off, I must admit we did not pay much attention because so many bombs have gone off but when the true horror became known, like Senator Cregan I felt it had happened just around the corner.  I was shocked at the sheer carnage.  There have been so many incidents of this type in Ireland in the past few decades and it is always the innocent who suffer; it is always the people who are standing around, or people who are having a meal in a restaurant like the Abercorn, or people who were attending a wedding at Le Mans, or people who were marching peacefully on Bloody Sunday, always the innocent.  That is really what is so sad about it.  I do not know where it will end but I suppose as long as Britain continues to occupy six of our counties of Ulster, that occupation will always spawn so-called freedom fighters whose avowed aim is to unite the country but whose methods will only serve to push us further apart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For once I share Senator Robb's sentiment that they may, with this bomb, unite people rather than put them apart. For the first time ever I feel, and most of the people I talked to feel, there is a new <Col N="1362" /> awareness of the need to adopt peaceful means for reunification because that is the only way we can go.</P>
    <P>I will end by saying how sad I am at what has happened.  It is only when it touches home that it really hurts.  I would also like to express my best wishes to the young detective whose wife works with me.  If I knew what violence was like that morning before her husband was shot &mdash; I had coffee with her and she was in great form &mdash; the afternoon spelled a different picture.  All of us in this House must fight in every way we can to stop these terrible tragedies occurring in whatever way that we can.  Thank you.</P>

      <P>I think we should all of us from this tradition and from all traditions in this island, look very deeply into ourselves about the whole question of violence, not just this violence but all violence.  We have to break a spiral that is threatening to engulf the world, a spiral of violence, a spiral of armaments, a spiral of hatred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe there is any cause in this country which could justify what happened last Sunday.  There is something else.  Senator Robb &mdash; and I say this as one who values him as a close and dear friend &mdash; said something that Mr. Wilson said and somebody else said who has not been mentioned, a brother of Detective Garda O'Connor, on Sunday night on television.  It is nearly as important that we be careful how we react as it is important that we condemn.  Detective Garda O'Connor's brother can talk about his <Col N="1363" /> mother feeling for the families of those who perpetrated that awful attack and almost murder of her son.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are at one remove, however we may feel, however outraged we may be quite justifiably, have an equal obligation to remember that if we begin to be brutalised by this sort of violence they have won a victory.  We must not allow ourselves to be brutalised, we must respond with the capacity of a democratic society, with all the resources of a people who choose freely to respond but without the brutality those people invite from us and, many people will say &mdash; and I can understand why &mdash; deserve from us. What they deserve from us is the proof that we will not be made like them.</P>
    <P>On another occasion, and the occasions are becoming all too frequent, I quoted Terence MacSwiney:</P>
    <P>It is not those who can inflict the most who conquer; it is those who can endure the most.</P>
    <P>What we must do is prove that not only can we endure but we can endure with our democratic values and with our Christian values intact.  Nobody has taught us that lesson better than Gordon Wilson and the brother of Detective O'Connor.  We have values inside in us, in ordinary people, and often ordinary people make politicians look quite small by their unthought out, spontaneous reaction of generous Christianity.  That is what we badly need in our society now, the courage to say yes there are moral absolutes and these moral absolutes have been outraged by recent events, but, yes we are still bound by those same moral absolutes. When we respond and how we respond will be firm, vigorous and perpetual but it will not be their methods; it will be the methods of people who believe that civilisation is a worthwhile value.  I associate myself with all the remarks of sympathy by my colleague.</P>

      <P>There simply are no words I can add to those which have already been said in condemnation of what happened in Enniskillen.  I should say that <Col N="1364" /> today I have felt some sense of hope because never before in my admittedly short six years career in the Seanad have I heard all sides of the House break into spontaneous applause in response to that great gesture of conciliation from Senator Robb.</P>
      <P>I am encouraged by the obviously honest, sincere, unanimous response to what happened in Enniskillen.  I hope we may act positively and unanimously in rooting out from our midst those responsible for this.  I will not in any way try to introduce a measure of discord but maybe out of this we could remove the feeling of ambivalence, to which the garda on the programme on Sunday referred, towards the terrorists of this country.  I echo the sentiments of Senator Norris when he said that surely we must in all honesty look at the activities of those who work under the guise of a political party to support the gunmen.  These to me are one and the same people.  These people should in honesty be looked at because this is not normal political activity.  Those who purvey hate in our community, whether through literature which they freely distribute and sell, whether through bookshops, whether through phoney political parties, must be looked at.  We must see whether these activities should be allowed any longer because they are destructive and supportive of the disaster that happened in Enniskillen at the weekend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to say I have no intention of being disruptive of the business of the House.  I realise and appreciate very much, as we all do, the time we have spent already today discussing what is a central issue in our lives and the life of this country at this moment.  I also appreciate that some of the business ordered for today and tomorrow, in particular the Air Navigation and Transport Bill, is a matter of some urgency.  The other matters ordered are important but not earth-shattering. In view of the events of the past couple of days I think it would be not just appropriate but pressing that this House should have an indepth discussion on the current security situation.</P>
      <P>Already on the Order Paper there are two motions which have become relevant and urgent.  Motion No. 44 in the names of Senators O'Toole and Norris refers to extradition.  My group would like to see the position on extradition clarified once and for all in this House at this point.  We see that motion as a matter or urgency because we have seen over the past week or so, and we saw at the weekend in Galway, an orchestrated campaign to convey misinformation on this subject.  It is appropriate in this House that now is the time to have the position spelled out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Item No. 50 on the Order Paper has also become even more urgent since I tabled it last Friday.  We now have very definite evidence that the source of the guns and the bomb equipment is Libya. <Col N="1366" /> This is a matter of great public importance. This country wants to know very clearly what is the relationship between our country and Libya, what is the relationship between our Government and Libya, what is the relationship between our Taoiseach and the leader of that country, given that it is now clear that the source of these deadly weapons is from that country, that there is interference in a murderous form on an unprecedented scale in the internal affairs of this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I discussed this matter before the sitting of the Seanad with Senator Manning.  We have already had words on what happened in Enniskillen. There are serious underlying issues about what happened over the past two weeks which we have not debated and which are very important.  The Dáil debated these issues yesterday at some length.  It is appropriate, now that we have expressed our sympathy to the relatives of those who died in Enniskillen, that we should take our responsibilities seriously in the Seanad and that the Leader of the House should allow an opportunity to debate the very serious underlying issues such as extradition, Libya, the role of Sinn Féin in the House tonight.  I do not mind if the Leader of the House says there is no time.  It is so important that we should sit an extra three or four hours if necessary. It would be wrong if as a House we were not allowed to debate one of the most appalling weeks in the history of the State.</P>

Therefore, I agree with Senator Manning.  We should find a way and I appeal to the Leader through you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, to find a way to enable the issues to be debated.</P>

      <P>Everybody in this House is in sympathy with the wishes of people to discuss matters appertaining to what happened in this country over the past fortnight.  It is a matter for the Government to decide on the issue of extradition. The Taoiseach will be making a statement on that in good time and we will have an opportunity after he makes the statement to discuss that matter here. A motion is down for discussion and I presume it will be reached.  The underlying issues mentioned by Senator Ross and Senator Ryan have not gone astray from the Government party either.  I will not allow a debate today but, when the Taoiseach makes his statement on extradition, we can have a debate in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards item No. 50, it is a motion put down in the normal way and signed by three Members of the House.  I do not want to go in depth into that issue.  The Government, the Garda, the Army and the Department of Foreign Affairs are investigating everything that had to do <Col N="1368" /> with the purported attempted importation of guns.  When we get the full details on that it may be that a debate can take place.  I do not think it would be appropriate to go into detail in this House or, indeed, in the Dáil on matters pertaining to the very serious crimes that happened over the past few weeks.</P>
    <P>The Garda Commissioner met with the chief police officer in the North today. The new commissioner has a very serious task confronting him.  He and the Government are looking at the matters raised here and being raised in other places.  I do not think that the time is appropriate and I do not think we would gain very much by getting into a short discussion here, whether it be for two, three or four hours, on the matters raised. Having said that, we do perceive that they are being raised in a serious manner in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Leader of the House is saying that matters which are being discussed in every public forum in this country from the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Hour&rdquo; to John Bowman to Brian Farrell are not appropriate for Members of this House I must, with respect, disagree with him.  As I have said, I do not want to be disruptive but unless I can get an assurance from the Leader of the House that time will be set aside, even tomorrow, for a number of hours for a debate on the underlying causes of our present distress, I am afraid we will have to oppose the Order of Business today.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport (Mr. Lyons) Denis Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport (Mr. Lyons)</NameTxt>
      <P>Táimse ag iarraidh ar an Seanad glacadh leis an mBille seo chun go mbeadh sé ar chumas an Stáit seo glacadh go foirmiúil le dhá Chomhaontaithe maidir le hiom-par feola, táirgí déiríochta, éisc agus earraí bia meatacha eile ar talamh ó aon tír go haon tír eile san limistéar ollmhór idir Tuaisceart na hEorpa, láimh leis an gCiorcal Artach, agus cósta na hAifrice Thuaidh.  'Sé sainchuspóir na gComhaontaithe sin ná cuidiú le fás agus borradh i dtrádáil idirnáisiúnta bia &mdash; má chomhlíontár na caighdeáin iompair agus trealaimh atá leagtha síos 'sna Comhaontaithe ní chuirfear aon bhac ar iompar idirnáisiúnta de'n chineál sin.</P>
      <P>Cuireadh téacs na gComhaontaithe faoi bhráid Tithe an Oireachtais agus tá glactha leis an téacs ag Dáil Éireann go foirmiúil tré Rún speisialta a ritheadh faoi Airteagal Fiche Naoi de'n Bhunreacht.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides the necessary framework for implementing ATP &mdash; the Agreement on the International Carriage of Perishable Foodstuffs and on the Special Equipment to be Used for such Carriage &mdash; and a multilateral agreement under Article Seven of ATP concerning carriage to and from Italy, in the seven months, April to October, each year in vehicles with side walls of a thickness not less than 45 millimetres.  The text of both agreements was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 15 October 1987 and Dáil Éireann formally approved their terms as required by Article 29.5 of the Constitution because they would involve a charge on public funds through their implementation and enforcement.</P>
      <P>The Bill enables the Minister for Tourism and Transport to make regulations from time to time to apply the detailed technical requirements of the agreements as regards standards for transport equipment and operating conditions for the international carriage of perishable foodstuffs, as such requirements are developing in line with developments in food and equipment technologies.  Such regulations will be devised in close consultation with the other Departments and other interests concerned and will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas which will have power &mdash; under section 14 of the Bill &mdash; to annul the regulations if they should consider it necessary to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill also makes appropriate provision for enforcement, as specifically required by the agreements and as was <Col N="1371" /> recommended by the Transport Consultative Commission in its 1981 report on Road Freight Haulage.</P>
    <P>Neither the Bill nor the regulations to be made under it are intended to increase costs for Irish hauliers or producers.  No disruption of proper export activity should arise from enforcement activity under the Bill.  I can assure the Seanad that enforcement activity will be cost-effective and I will be making every effort, in consultation with the other enforcement agencies concerned, to avail as far as possible of existing inspection arrangements in relation to perishable foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>Thus, the Bill may be summarised as providing the necessary legal basis for the examination or testing of transport equipment for compliance with ATP requirements and any special further requirements of any multilateral agreement under Article Seven of ATP, and for the certification of equipment complying with those requirements, and for effective enforcement.  The comprehensive Explanatory and Financial Memorandum gives a detailed commentary on the provisions of the Bill as well as the general background to it.</P>
    <P>As regards accession to ATP, Article Eleven of ATP provides that accession by a state to ATP will not take place until one year has elapsed after that state has deposited its instrument of accession with the United Nations, which is the parent body of the Economic Commission for Europe which launched ATP and is charged with its monitoring and development. Enactment of the Bill is all that remains to be done now to enable Ireland to deposit its instrument of accession, since the terms of the agreement and of the Bill have already been approved by Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Ireland must first become an ATP contracting state before it can accede to the multilateral agreement concerning carriage in thin-walled vehicles to and from Italy which came into force on 18 June 1987.  The terms of that agreement have also been approved by Dáil Éireann and the Bill is so framed as to enable Ireland <Col N="1372" /> to implement the detailed requirements of that agreement, and any other muti-lateral agreement which may arise under ATP, as well as the detailed requirements of ATP itself.</P>
    <P>Early Seanad approval of the Bill and its enactment would, therefore, enable Ireland to accede to both ATP and the Italian Multilateral Agreement in just a year from now.</P>
    <P>In the meantime Ireland will continue present administrative arrangements for implementing both agreements, but will be making the necessary preparations to have any required revised arrangements ready for putting in place at latest when Ireland's accession to ATP and the multilateral agreement takes effect.  My intention is to have the necessary regulations made as soon as possible under the Bill when enacted, and well in advance of their operative date, so that all concerned will be fully aware of the statutory requirements and have sufficient time to prepare for compliance therewith.  The Bill enables such regulations to be made as required &mdash; they would only come into force on the day on which the Bill as a whole would become operative in consequence of a ministerial order under section 1 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>While I am, indeed, pleased to inform the House that, so far, no problems have been encountered under the present administrative arrangements and that no problems are envisaged pending Ireland's accession to the agreements &mdash; hopefully in a year's time &mdash; I must caution against any complacency in the matter by either hauliers or producers.  Without legislation Irish certificates of compliance are potentially open to challenge by any one of the other 20 European states which are ATP contracting states, with consequential risk of hauliers being delayed or refused entry at international frontiers. It is clearly in the national interest that the necessary legislation be in place at the earliest possible date.  Ireland, Greece and Portugal are the only EC states which have not yet acceded to ATP.  I understand that both Greece and Portugal are now moving towards accession and, therefore, Ireland should <Col N="1373" /> not delay its accession.  More importantly, accession will enable Ireland to be fully involved in monitoring the operation of ATP by the other ATP contracting states and in developing ATP.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned in my opening remarks, ATP is designed to increase international trade in perishable foodstuffs by freeing international carriage from local requirements where that carriage is subject to, and is in conformity with, ATP requirements.  The House and all others concerned must note, therefore, that carriage which is not within the scope of ATP may be subject to special local requirements, perhaps more stringent than ATP ones.  In other words, ATP-type requirements, or more stringent ones, may be imposed by ATP contracting states for domestic policy reasons on international or other carriage of perishable foodstuffs into or through their territories where the carriage is, strictly speaking, outside the scope of ATP itself &mdash; for example, carriage of foodstuffs within one state only after a sea journey of 150 kilometres or more from another state; international carriage by containers without transloading of the foodstuffs before or after a sea journey of 150 kilometres or more between states.</P>
    <P>My message to hauliers is that they should be fully aware of any such local requirements for carriage outside ATP if they are not to be unnecessarily delayed at frontiers or refused entry, with consequential severe cost penalties, including, perhaps, loss of export business.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the vital economic policy objective of the Bill, namely, to give a timely fillip to the maintenance of high standards in the carriage of Irish perishable foodstuffs and help to sustain and enhance the reputation of Irish foodstuffs in foreign markets.</P>
    <P>Our exports must be maximised in order to regenerate the national economy by providing worthwhile new employment opportunities for our people.  Not only do we need to safeguard our existing exports of perishable foodstuffs, already exceeding £1,000 million a year, but we need to increase them substantially.  That will only be possible if all concerned <Col N="1374" /> endeavour to ensure that foodstuffs reach the market place in the top condition and time which the customers require. Obviously, there must be no shortfall in quality of foodstuffs at loading but from then on the quality of the carriage arrangements is crucial, especially for long international journeys.  If Irish hauliers maintain their equipment to the best standards they can help to maximise exports and secure new international business, as well as serving the home market, where quality is no less important.</P>
    <P>Having received complaints about the off-condition of Irish perishable foodstuffs on arrival in export markets, particularly meat, the Transport Consulative Commission, in its 1981 report on Road Freight Haulage, recommended that the State should accede to ATP as soon as possible and effectively enforce it in order to ensure that Irish refrigerated vehicles are maintained to internationally acceptable standards and that they are not delayed or refused admission at frontiers. It is earnestly to be hoped that Irish international hauliers have fully taken the Commission's message to heart, a message which a few months ago the Minister had the opportunity to reconvey to many of them at the annual general meeting of a representative body of theirs.</P>
    <P>The Bill, providing as it does for the implementation of ATP by the State, serves as a reminder to hauliers to operate to acceptable standards internationally &mdash; and indeed nationally &mdash; and I, therefore, commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are certainly not going to delay this Bill.  The Minister has stressed the urgency of putting it through. Indeed, he has indicated that we are one of the last countries to accede to the ATP. It is of extreme importance, however, that the greatest of care is taken to ensure that as a result there are no added costs to hauliers.  The Minister has indicated to us that there will not be a cost to hauliers but there has been no indication that there has been any consultation with the hauliers or their representative body.  I <Col N="1375" /> would like to think that the Minister or his Department has had some consultation with them.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that we are living in a world today when our competitors are only too ready to point out any suggestion of any irregularities.  Indeed, they can so feed the media that, even though it is only a suggestion, it is then taken as something positive.  We cannot afford to run this risk.</P>
      <P>In stressing those two points, I am certainly not going to delay the proceedings here today.  I hope we can get Second Stage completed today.  I do not know if it is the Minister's intention to take other Stages today; it is not indicated on the Order Paper.  I see it is the Minister's intention.  I will not delay the proceedings here.  However, I hope the Minister will give some indication of what discussions they have had with the hauliers in regard to making the necessary arrangements and, if there have not been any discussions to date, that there will be in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief in welcoming the International Carriage of Perishable Foodstuffs Bill.  The agreement to which this legislation refers was reached as far back as 1976 and now operates, as we have heard the Minister outlining here today, in over 20 European countries, including nine of the EC states.  Regrettably, Ireland is one of three EC states which has failed so far to formally associate itself with the agreement. I am very glad that today we are putting that right, after the Bill has already gone through the Dáil.</P>
      <P>It is very important that Ireland as a quality exporter of foods, should ensure in all aspects of our exports that foodstuffs are produced to the highest possible quality and are maintained and kept at those highest possible standards &mdash; internationally as well as at home &mdash; when they reach their destination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One interesting fact that emerges from the material supplied to us on this matter, which it is worth drawing some attention <Col N="1376" /> to, is that in the administrative arrangements which operate to date we have included some arrangements for private testing.  I believe that is entirely worthwhile. When this legislation is passed I hope private testing will be continued and expanded, because we all accept that this is no time for imposing additional administrative burdens on the State.  This is the first instance I have heard of where testing arrangements are made on the basis of private and State co-operation. It is a laudable precedent.</P>
    <P>The ATP was devised with the aim of increasing international trade in perishable goods.  That is why the agreement is important to us here today.  It is vital for Ireland because we need to be able to show that we are at the top of the market in all our operations.  It is also vital that we should use this agreement to our advantage.  We should not only ensure that all temperature controlled vehicles in use and registered in the Irish State are taking Irish goods abroad of the highest quality, but we should more actively police the operations of the non-Irish registered vehicles within the State. We should also police the return of these vehicles with a view to ensuring that they are not used as a means of dumping excess products from other countries on the Irish market.</P>
    <P>Enforcement of the law in this area is important and, therefore, the legislative arrangements in this Bill are very important. Sadly, when you try to operate on an administrative or voluntary basis, you will find there will always be a rogue operator.  It only takes one rogue operator to destroy the reputation that has been built up at great cost to the majority of those concerned.  The rigours of the law being implemented in this legislation should apply to all trading in this area.  I note that the legislation and the agreement itself do not apply to long sea journeys. They apply to sea journeys of up to 150 kilometres and therefore to sea journeys between ourselves and our nearest neighbours.</P>
    <P>This draws to my attention the fact that this is a particular area of transport where <Col N="1377" /> we are deficient.  We will soon be discussing important legislation in both Houses which will deal with Irish shipping in general.  It is extraordinary that we, as an island nation in the food export market, do not have a single refrigerated vessel on the Irish register.  Perhaps this legislation and the legislation which we will be discussing will cover this in the future.</P>
    <P>Like Senator McMahon, I do not wish to detain the House in putting through this Bill.  As the Minister has stated, it will not be enacted for 12 months after the Bill has been passed by both Houses.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other points in the Minister's contribution to which I would like to refer.  One is his message to the hauliers that they should be fully aware of any local requirements for carriage outside the ATP.  If they are not to be unnecessarily delayed at frontiers or to be refused entry, there should be an advertising campaign to the hauliers to highlight this and to ensure that they are fully aware of the requirements that will be necessary.  As the Minister quite correctly pointed out, we have exports from this island of ours of £1,000 million, and possibly in the foreseeable future will have a percentage increase of 20 per cent to 25 per cent on that.  We all know how important exports are to the economy and how industry depends on exports to provide jobs for the future.  The whole thrust of Government policies, no matter what Government are in power, bears a relation to this Bill.  Therefore, I welcome it and commend it to be finalised here today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>My intervention will be very brief on this, because it is a Bill which Senators on all sides of the House can support without any great difficulty. The overall objectives are ones to which we would all subscribe.  I have only one point to make about this Bill, that is, that it is very similar to a great deal of legislation which we, in both Houses and as a Parliament, have been enacting over the past number of years.  We pass legislation which seeks to attain desirable <Col N="1378" /> objectives but we have very little within the Bill which will enforce the main provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>In the other House, when this Bill was being debated, the speeches were wide-ranging, dealing with quality of foods, dangers of radiation, dangers to certain foods within the vehicles in which they were being carried, dumping, road hauliers and so forth.  But the one point in that debate which was not answered by the Minister then &mdash; and I hope it will be possible to have it answered today &mdash; was on the question of enforcement.</P>
      <P>In concluding his speech on Second Stage of this Bill in the Dáil, the Minister said:</P>
      <P>The detailed arrangements for enforcing the Bill have yet to be decided.  The intention is to avail in so far as possible of the existing inspection arrangements in relation to foodstuffs and complying to the transport law. The Department of Tourism and Transport would be the agent with the other enforcement agencies with that in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What surprised me is that today in his speech the Minister is fairly bland on what he has to say about enforcement. The Bill also makes appropriate provision for enforcement but it does not actually specify what way it will be enforced.  I realise that it will be 12 months before this Bill comes into effect and I also accept that there will be consultation between the various enforcement agencies; but it should have been possible &mdash; and perhaps it will be possible today &mdash; for the Minister to give us some indication about the way in which this enforcement will take place.  As I say, we are a great country for drawing up legislation, but we tend to fall down very much in terms of enforcement.  If the Minister could tell me today what progress has been made in working out the details of enforcement, I would be a bit happier; or, indeed, if it has not been done, perhaps he will give an undertaking to come back to us before the Bill comes into effect to let us know what the <Col N="1379" /> arrangements are.  Otherwise, I have no difficulty in supporting this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport (Mr. Lyons) Denis Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport (Mr. Lyons)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to thank Members for their contributions and co-operation in ensuring the speedy passage of this legislation through the Seanad.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question raised by Senator McMahon, it is proposed to take all Stages of this Bill now.  He also raised the question of consultations with the road haulage organisations and so on, and I can confirm to him that consultations have taken place on an ongoing basis since 1978.  The Senator also raised the question of extra cost, and I want to reiterate what I said in my opening address: there will not be any additional cost to hauliers arising out of this matter. Senator Cassidy raised the question of testing.  Testing, as he outlined, will continue in both the public and private sector.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning referred to enforcement. I acknowledge that in the Dáil debate on this matter the Minister was questioned about enforcement along the lines the Senator outlined, and the Senator asked what were the ongoing developments from that.  Since the matter was raised in the Dáil, the Minister for Tourism and Transport has written to the Department of Agriculture and Food and to the Department of Health in regard to the enforcement of these regulations.  I hope the Senator is satisfied that that matter of enforcement is being pursued. I believe it is essential and I accept the point the Senator is making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are not clear on enforcement, it will be a toothless Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  That is acknowledged.  Any legislation must have an element of enforcement in it.  We accept the Senator's point and we agree with it.  This is being worked on to ensure that enforcement procedures are in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cassidy raised a point about long sea haulage and short sea haulage. <Col N="1380" /> This ATP Agreement is mainly about road and rail but, of course, it can apply &mdash; and I have indicated that &mdash; to intermediate short journeys of 150 kilometres involved in transport between countries. A short sea journey is regarded as part and parcel of road and rail transport.</P>
    <P>Basically, these were the questions raised by Senators.  The only thing I would add, in relation to Senator Manning's question about enforcement, is that there is no wish by anybody to duplicate enforcement.  That is why other Departments involved in the enforcement of the standards to ensure the quality of these goods during carriage have been contacted to ensure that these goods reach their destinations in good condition. That is why there has to be liaison between the Departments involved, Agriculture and Food and Health &mdash; Health because of the point made by the Senator about contamination and so on from outside influences &mdash; to ensure that enforcement is in place, because the legislation on its own would not be sufficient without this element of enforcement. I compliment Senator Manning on raising that point, because it is a vital one.  We accept without any reservation that enforcement has to be part and parcel of this legislation, and it will be there within the 12 months until we become fully integrated members of ATP.  The necessary regulations to include enforcement will be in place by then.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's assurances, but would he not agree that it would be preferable if the enforcement procedures had been worked out before the Bill was brought into the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>That point is valid.  Its validity stems from the fact &mdash; and this point was made by Senator Cassidy &mdash; that 20 other countries have already acceded to ATP.  One could ask the question: what have we been doing that we have not been on a par with those countries?  We have lagged behind.  But now we are getting in there.  We have almost 12 months to ensure that enforcement will be <Col N="1381" /> included by the time we become part of the ATP.  We have that much time to ensure that enforcement procedures are part and parcel of the legislation.</P>

However, as a general rule the Chair feels it is not in the interests of the orderly conduct of debate in the House nor is it fair to other Members to have to accept late amendments.

      <P>These two amendments are designed to meet the case made by Senator O'Toole on Second Stage that aircraft operators should not be penalised for flying into or from an aerodrome without being aware that the licence or authorisation for the aerodrome is deemed to have been revoked under section 10 (3) of the Bill, with the lapse of the aerodrome's insurance cover.  These amendments are proposed for acceptance in lieu of his amendment to section 10.  The first amendment does so by extending the power of the Minister for Tourism and Transport under section 9 of the Bill to prohibit by notice in writing aircraft from landing at or departing from aerodromes in certain conditions and to prohibit also aircraft landing at or departing from an uninsured area.  This amendment will ensure that all aircraft operators are put on notice not to fly to or from uninsured aerodromes and any breach of that prohibition would be an offence punishable by the substantial penalties provided for in section 27 of the Bill up to the following maxima:</P>
      <P>(a)  on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £1,000, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or,...</P>
      <P>(b)  on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding £50,000, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years,...</P>
      <P>I should also say that the actual fine to be imposed in any case, would be for the court to decide subject to these maxima. The second amendment is consequential on the first one.</P>

We have the benefit of the parliamentary drafts people and that is why it is proposed for acceptance in that format in lieu of Senator O'Toole's amendment but it meets the same point.

It leaves it without doubt, and it re-emphasises the fact.  It is important in investigations into aircraft tragedies or accidents that we do not scare the nation by publishing everything.

      <P>These are drafting amendments. The reference to sections 40 and 41 of the Bill should appear in section 27 (2) and not 27 (1).  Sections 40 and 41 of the Bill create the offences of impersonating an authorised officer or an authorised person and giving false alarms. Therefore, sections 40 and 41 should be listed in section 27 (2) of the Bill which prescribes penalties for certain offences. However, sections 40 and 41 were inadvertently listed in section 27 (1) which creates certain offences and prescribes penalties therefor.  I commend these amendments to the House.

      <P>I should like to comment on this amendment.  Its purpose is simply to provide for the formal repeal of the remaining provisions of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1961, which are spent at this stage.  These provisions related to the repayment to the Exchequer of advances made by Aer Rianta up to the early sixties and long since repaid in full.  In other words, the amendment tidies up the Statute Book and the Bill provides a suitable opportunity to do so.  We are now availing of that opportunity.  The Second Schedule to the Bill already provides for the repeal of other spent or obsolete statutory provisions, as was indicated on Second Stage.</P>

      <Col N="1389" /> That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to amend the Local Government Acts to ensure that local authority employees, who are put on short-time working, will be treated as a special case and do not suffer any reduction in their entitlements to pensions or gratuities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Labour Party put down this motion it was against the background of the 9 per cent reduction in the rates support grant to local authorities in 1987.  Now with the announcement of a further 14 per cent reduction in the rates support grant which, coupled with inflation of 3 per cent and a 2½ per cent increase in pay the cut in real terms will be close to 20 per cent for 1988. These two cuts are having horrendous effects on local authorities in terms of the services which they provide and in terms of their levels of employment.  One of the local authorities of which I am a member, Waterford County Council, would require an extra £1.9 million in 1988 to retain services at the 1986 level.</P>
      <P>Waterford County Council have a water charge of £85 which, I understand, is the highest in the country.  Yet this year Waterford County Council had 230 of their staff on short time working.  Waterford County Council have a very narrow commercial rates base and, therefore, are exceedingly vulnerable to cutbacks in domestic rates support grants and in particular in agricultural rates support grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The representations from the unions in Waterford County Council have been responsible for this motion appearing on the Order Paper.  Basically, the motion is concerned with pension and gratuity entitlements of local authority employees who have been involved in short time working or in lay-offs.  I have established from the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union that in the present year six local authorities, where they have <Col N="1390" /> members, have been involved in short time working.</P>
    <P>The Irish Transport and General Workers' Union are the major union involved with local authority employees. Indications are that at least ten local authorities will be involved in short time working in 1988.  This is an area which I ask the Minister to clarify.  Is it part of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, which is being voted on by individual unions at the moment, that we are to have no compulsory lay-offs in local authorities? Would the Minister clarify that this is the position?  Certainly, in the local authorities I have knowledge of, short time working is a very distinct possibility.</P>
    <P>Getting back to the substance of the motion, in effect local authority employees must have 200 days' service in one year to qualify for full pension and gratuity.  Normally, local authorities would have 260 service days in the course of the year.  They pay superannuation contributions on the extra ten days, but these days are absolutely no use to them as they cannot carry them over into another year when they may be short. For pension purposes, a full year's service brings entitlement to 1/80th of pension and 3/80ths of gratuity.  However, each day lost under 250 days will result in a loss of 1/250th of pension and gratuity entitlement.  Where local authority employees have opted for short time working rather than redundancy they are being unfairly penalised.  Not alone do they suffer loss of wages, but they also lose pension and gratuity rights.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil amendment which has been put down to this Labour Party motion needs to be clarified.  Is there a categorical guarantee from the Government that, where a local authority do not achieve sufficient redundancies or early retirements to provide within their budget the required money for a full year's pay for the remaining workforce, short time working or lay offs can be avoided?  I know from senior trade union officials that redundancies or early retirements will not be accepted where lay offs would occur in the remaining workforce. In fairness to local authority employees, <Col N="1391" /> there is an urgent need for clarity.</P>
    <P>Senior trade union officials have communicated to me a great concern because local authorities cannot pay salaries for all of 1988.  Service charges will not yield any significant additional amounts where charges are already high and budgets have been devastated by the Fianna Fáil cutbacks.  Local authorities are being destroyed.  Consequently, the services which the community now enjoy will either be withdrawn or diminished to totally inadequate levels.</P>
    <P>New local authority housing is virtually stopped.  I am a member of Waterford Corporation.  No new starts were made in 1987, nor will any new starts be made in 1988.  In Waterford County Council I understand that, instead of the 50 houses we built per year during the term of the last Government, five houses per year will be built.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to the recent circular regarding local authority loans. Forty per cent of local authority loans are being pushed off into the private sector. I understand that the local authorities will get only 60 per cent next year compared with what they got this year and £55 million is to be provided by the banks and building societies.  Obviously, the people who will come back to the local authorities for loans will have most difficulty in meeting the requirements of the banks, and hence will have a lot of difficulty in reaching repayment targets for the local authorities.  Now that the fixed interest has been withdrawn, taking a £21,000 loan there could be a swing of £90 in interest repayments per month. This would be absolutely devastating to people earning under £10,000 per year.</P>
    <P>Roads and infrastructure generally are being underfunded.  We did not have any surface dressing done in Waterford County Council last year.  There was no site cleaning done on roads.  It is a matter of pride to all members of Waterford County Council how well our roads have been kept in the past.</P>
    <P>In general, I submit there is little logic in the redundancy and early retirement <Col N="1392" /> package.  People going on early retirement will have to be paid their pensions. There will be the loss of the PAYE and PRSI contributions to the State.</P>
    <P>Another area to which we should apply ourselves is national investment in our local authority housing stock, which is a huge investment.  At the moment there is a cutback in the maintenance of these houses.  We are failing to service our investment.  That brings a consequent loss to the State as well.</P>
    <P>Our roads are deteriorating and, more important, the development role of local authorities is also being undermined.  A circular was issued by the Minister in August seeking that local authorities would put more resources into pollution control.  This is hardly possible when we will, very obviously, be losing engineering staff.</P>
    <P>There is one small river in County Waterford on which there are 80 potential pollution sources.  To monitor each of those, even three a day would be quite reasonable.  We do not have the resources, much as we would like to do even that, much as we support what the Minister is seeking to achieve.  We must have the resources to do it.</P>
    <P>I believe that, if local authorities are to have any future, we need a new revenue base.  In recent days we have had the returns on the market survey carried out on behalf of the ICMSA regarding the land tax.  It emerged that two-thirds of farmers were in favour of the land tax. The legislation exists already for the land tax.  According to the farmers' own figures, about £30 million a year is going to accountants to have farmers' accounts processed.  An average of £460 each is being paid by farmers for their accounts. One in four of these would not have any taxable income and would have no tax to pay.</P>
    <P>In the days when we had agricultural rates small farmers were always to the fore in paying their rates.  They had a very honourable record on prompt payment. Speaking to small farmers in my own area, I have been told they would be very much inclined towards the idea of the land tax and that land tax should be paid <Col N="1393" /> to local authorities as an addition to other sources of funding.  People paying the tax would see, at close hand in terms of county council services, a return on their money and see what their money was actually doing.  We have an undertaking from the Government that the idea of a property tax will be looked at in 1989.</P>
    <P>I submit that the damage done in 1988 will create a situation which is virtually irretrievable.  It will be impossible to get back to the standards, staffing levels and services we are providing at the moment. If the Minister and the Government have given an undertaking, which, I understand, was given during the talks on the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> that there will not be any compulsory layoffs with local authorities, could the Minister give an undertaking that he will exercise his ministerial discretion regarding the loss of service time of local authority employees?</P>
    <P>For instance, if local authority employees lose service time through strike action, it is invariably a condition of resumption that those service days will not be lost for pension and gratuity purposes. If there will be no compulsory or mandatory redundancies, and where local authorities opt for keeping their workforce together in expectation of the day when further finance from some other source will be available, be it a property tax or the reintroduction of the land tax, and where local authorities decide on short time working or lay offs, surely in terms of natural justice the people who opt to hold their jobs and to stay at work, should benefit.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot of criticism about people not having the will to work.  When we are talking about people who actually want to hold their jobs, surely the Minister for the Environment, who is the relevant Minister, should help those people and grant them the justice of holding their full pension and gratutity entitlements.</P>
    <P>I am horrified at what is happening to local authorities.  The days of town commissioners are numbered.  Town commissioners &mdash; and I am a member of Tramore Town Commission &mdash; are not spending authorities, as such.  Bodies like <Col N="1394" /> the Tramore Town Commission, where political divisions are left aside and people gather together around the table to promote various projects on behalf of the area, can be quite successful as pressure groups.  If they are not there, an impossible situation arises for county councils because you will have people in the community going to county council officials and saying: &ldquo;I represent so and so&rdquo;, with no particular mandate.</P>
    <P>I also believe that the smaller urban councils are in real trouble.  Some of them have staffs as small as three and, with the redundancy package on offer, if people opt for the redundancy package or for the early retirement, how can they possibly continue?  On present funding and on present trends there is no way local authorities can continue beyond the next couple of years.  I put it to the Minister that he has a responsibility to these good and faithful servants whom some people like to castigate.  In my experience they are a very efficient and effective workforce. Because the Government unilaterally decide to withdraw funding and to renege on a commitment given in 1977 when rates were withdrawn &mdash; and Fianna Fáil were always to the forefront in saying that central Government should provide sufficient moneys for local authorities &mdash; there is a responsibility to these people.  They are people who have already lost pension entitlements and gratuity entitlements.  The Minister has discretion to regularise that position.</P>
    <P>I also ask him to clarify the ongoing situation.  Will there be mandatory lay-offs where local authorities operate inside their budgets?  Where they do not get sufficient redundancies or sufficient early retirements, will he throw to the wolves, in terms of their pension entitlements and their gratuity entitlements, the people remaining on the staff?  These are people who have a commitment to the work ethic and a pride in what they do.  Both Houses of the Oireachtas should do everything possible to help.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion in the name of the Labour Party Senators.  We chose this motion, not because it is one <Col N="1395" /> of the euphoric subjects that abound every day about all the various cuts in education and health and so on.  We are concerned, in consultation with staffs and staff representatives in the local authority area that, because of the fundings which have been notified by the Minister and his Department to the county managers and the county council members by way of their rate estimates, it is inevitable that some members of staff in the coming year will be on short time working.  We are concerned that, because of this situation which is outside their control, it is possible that with a loss in the number of days, their entitlements under the Superanuation Acts will be jeopardised.  The Minister accepts this in the amendment from the Leader of the House.</P>
      <P>It is noted that only paid service is reckonable for superannuation purposes under the local government superannuation code in accordance with a superannuation principle.  We know that. That is why we have put down a motion requesting consideration of the amending of the Act to take into account the very special circumstances that will arise.  It is inevitable that it will arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are satisfied that a precedent has already been set by other public service bodies in the semi-private sector or semi-State sector.  Bord na Móna in particular have had short time working.  Following the disastrous weather of 1985 and 1986 certain sectors in Bord na Móna were forced to go on short time.  Part of the settlement at the time to accommodate the workers in the industry was that, if the workers agreed to go on short time to get the board out of their difficulties, some of that short working time would be reckonable for superannuation purposes. That happened in Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta too.  It happened in the Thurles beet factory in particular where workers on short time were told their service was protected for superannuation purposes, in the knowledge that the employees would be returning to the service as soon as finances improved or work was available.  We are not looking for anything spectacular in this regard.  We <Col N="1396" /> are looking for something that has already happened in the semi-State sector.</P>
    <P>We have had discussions with the professional people representing the workers in this area.  I am the son of a road worker and very proud of it.  I am very proud of the fact that he was dedicated to his work all his working life.  I know how hard they worked in the days when they had to break stones for a living.  They did not grind them as they do now with big machines.  I note that the Minister is talking about the voluntary redundancy package and the early retirement package he is offering to people on the basis that there is nothing compulsory about it. Looking at the Estimates it is inevitable that managers will be requesting unions to ask members to go for early retirement or voluntary redundancy.</P>
    <P>As my colleague Senator O'Shea said, if voluntary redundancies are not accepted and if in the striking of our rates &mdash; and you will find responsible Labour Party members on councils &mdash; within the parameters laid down by the Department, and taking into account the reduction in the rates support grant, which would not double or treble water charges or cripple small shopkeepers and others in the rateable valuation sector, the manager does not have sufficient funds to retain his full workforce he will be forced to put some of them on short working time.  In such circumstances it is not unreasonable that, in the interests of fair play, we should ensure that time lost to them would be reckonable for superannuation purposes.</P>
    <P>While I am certain these things will happen I sincerely hope I am wrong and that this time next year the Minister will have proved his own point.  The reduction in the environmental budget is almost £100 million in the Book of Estimates in page 31.  It is £93.859 million.  In the rate support grant there is a reduction of 12 per cent, now reckoned to be 14 per cent.</P>
    <P>The new figure for 1988 is £225 million. It is a reduction from £256 million.  We have to take that into account.  If I go to the capital budget and look at the amount of money that has been allocated for road <Col N="1397" /> improvement schemes there is, in fact, a reduction of over £16 million for roads for this coming year.</P>
    <P>It will be argued that in road repairs, especially major road and primary road works and by-passes which are all vital, the actual employment content might not be as great as some of these figures would indicate.  A lot of machinery is used, but there is a nucleus and a hard core in the workforce that will be required on the national primary road section of all the county councils.  They would be considered to be permanent employees.</P>
    <P>The public are aware of the fact that the Government published a national road plan, going into the nineties.  Either the Minister is reneging on that plan or reneging on a previous Minister's commitment to ordinary servants.  I am sorry to have to use that word but that is the word used by the Department for employees in the sector of local authorities who are not, in fact, officials, county managers or county engineers, but ordinary road workers.  They are referred to under the Act as &ldquo;servants&rdquo;. They were given a status by a predecessor of the Minister's, Deputy Liam Kavanagh, in writing and honoured by the Government of the day.  I hope it will be honoured by the Minister and by this Government.  Employees have some rights in the area of expecting to continue to work in the jobs which they have and in which they are performing well.  Unless they misbehave they should be considered to have some form of permanency of employment if at all possible.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is saying there will be no compulsory redundancies and a previous Government said that for the first time road workers would have a semblance of permanency in their workplace, we have a problem.  The Minister would want to address it as the motion requests him to do.  By ministerial order he could try to ensure that in circumstances outside the control of the employee, account would be taken of their very special circumstances for pension purposes.  Their pensions are small enough when they retire after years of hard work which is <Col N="1398" /> often criticised, as Senator O'Shea stated, by the public at large.  They do important work on county roads and on minor roads.  We do not have enough people doing that kind of productive work to stop road flooding, to clean county roads and remove bushes from them, to get flood water off them, to stop aquaplaning and to prevent road accidents and all the things we would like to see done.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have our support for employing workers where they can be seen to be giving a service to the people. People are prepared to pay for the service. In the past, 99.9 per cent of ratepayers across the whole spectrum &mdash; in my own county in particular and I am competent to speak about this &mdash; paid their rates which funded local authorities effectively.  This left a lot of discretion to members of local authorities on how to spend that money effectively and efficiently.  Because of the change that has taken place and the withdrawal back into central Government of the system of funding of local authorities, the Minister has removed some of that control.  This is why we are saying that, with the controls he now has within his Department and by ministerial order, we hope he will take account of the sentiments we are expressing in the motion.  This is not an unreasonable request and we sincerely hope that, when the Minister is replying, he will confirm the points made by Senator O'Shea and take on board the reasonable case we are making which would not cost very much money and accept a principle that has been accepted in the semi-State sector already.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following: &ldquo;takes note that only paid service is reckonable for superannuation purposes under the Local Government Superannuation Code, in accordance with a superannuation principle, which applies to pension schemes throughout the public service generally, and recognises <Col N="1399" /> that action has been taken by the Minister for the Environment in the implementation of the voluntary redundancy/early retirement package to facilitate the termination of existing or proposed short time working by local authority employees.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The granting of pensions or gratuities to local authority employees is governed by the statutory provisions of the Local Government Superannuation Revision Consolidation Scheme, 1986, and the Local Government Superannuation Act, 1956.  In accordance with those provisions and in line with the superannuation principle which applies to pension schemes throughout the public service generally, only paid service is reckonable by local authority employees for pension or gratuity purposes.  The question as to whether periods of absence due to the operation of short time working arrangements should be allowed to reckon as pensionable service by local authority employees was considered in 1982 by the Working Party on Local Authority Superannuation and an amendment of the existing provisions was not recommended. The question was also raised during the periods in office of previous Administrations and, after full examination, it was accepted that it would be inappropriate to change this fundamental superannuation principle.</P>
    <P>The amendment outlines the statutory position and shows the Minister's concern that short time working by local authority employees should be terminated as soon as possible and it indicates the action he has already taken in this regard.  The contributions by the two previous speakers were fairly wide-ranging, I should like to refer to some of the aspects they covered in my brief contribution.  I understand Senators are limited to ten minutes. I do not think anyone would question my sympathy for local authority workers. Senator Ferris mentioned that his father was a local authority worker.  My father was a local authority worker also, so I have something in common with the <Col N="1400" /> Senator.  Not alone that, I have experience of working on the roads of County Meath with a shovel.  Many people may feel it is a pity that I got beyond that point.  Later I reached a stage where I was designing the roads, and many of the main roads, of County Meath.  Indeed, at that period I was a member of a union.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Shea mentioned that the union in County Waterford are responsible for this motion.  I was a member of Jimmy Tully's union &mdash; the Federation of Rural Workers.  I left it as a fully paid-up member.  I have a record in the House of calling a spade a spade and in paying tribute where it is due.  I realised even then and understood the great work the union had done.  I was a shop steward in that union.  I was conscious at different times of the good work they did and I saw, during that period, the union bringing dignity, not alone to the roadworker, but to the families of the roadworker.  I have always acknowledged that fact.</P>
    <P>There cannot be any doubt about my sympathy for the roadworker.  Indeed, Senator Ferris mentioned the &ldquo;stonies&rdquo;&mdash; I did not work as one, but I saw them working.  Shortly before my time, many of them came from the West and they worked hard and were not very well treated.  They worked with their hammers by the side of the road and got badly paid for it.  The &ldquo;stonies&rdquo; with the chisel sometimes carved out objects that are works of art now.  Tribute has been paid to them in <i>Stone Mad</i> and in other publications. The &ldquo;stonie&rdquo; who worked hard in those periods by the side of the road and got badly paid for it, deserves a tribute. I would like to pay tribute to all local authority workers.  Nobody would question the contribution they made and unfortunately, they were very wrongly the butt of jokes over a period.  They had certain skills which are irreplaceable; they did marvelous work.</P>
    <P>While being concerned in this particular area, the Government must have concern on a broader front.  In dealing with employees of local authorities we must bear in mind that very many people are unable to get employment of any kind; they must be considered.  This area of <Col N="1401" /> legislation requires updating or amendment of some kind.  We must look at other areas such as short time for example.  My staff are on short time; there is a general problem there and this area might be looked at.  In the area of redundancy, for example, where an employer is reimbursed to the extent of 60 per cent, a case could be made to increase this amount so that the employees could get better terms and more time would be allowed per year. Many reforms in this area could be considered, not just one type of employee.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Shea referred to local authority loans and the arrangements the Minister has made with regard to contributions by the building societies and the banks.  I welcome that.  That will do great good.  Also the Minister indicated that the fixed interest clause will be changed.  Again, I welcome this because obviously when interest rates go down it is to the advantage of those who borrow that the rate would not be fixed.  I look forward to further clarification of this scheme.  Those in the construction industry and people who want to build houses will welcome it.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to cover everything. Roads have been referred to and also their deterioration.  I want, as I have done before, to congratulate the Minister on the great improvement in roads.  There was a period when it was impossible to travel, particularly on county roads because of potholes.  We had a debate in this House in that regard.  By reason of the fact that he made finance available for that problem, the Minister has overcome it.</P>
    <P>I would like to spend some time on the question of farmer's tax but obviously I do not have enough time.  I was one of those who felt that the land tax would be a great asset to farmers, but again I was one of a large number of people called to the Beechmount Hotel in Navan by farmers to canvass against that provision. I felt that the genuine farmer would benefit from the land tax and that not all those who own land are farmers.  I would like to develop that theme but obviously I do not have enough time.  When this <Col N="1402" /> option was available to farmers and they canvassed against it, it is hard to understand now why they are going back on that.  We all share the Minister's concern about this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank all those who have contributed so far to the debate which is of particular interest to me.  The debate may have strayed a little from the original wording of the motion but it is all interesting and timely in so far as many of our authorities are concerning themselves with the estimates at this time.  I will confine myself to the motion and to the amendment.</P>
      <P>The introduction of measures such as short time working is entirely a matter for each individual local authority having regard to the level of their work programmes and the financial resources available to them.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I would like to make it clear that I am anxious to see that any short time working which has been introduced by local authorities should be ended as quickly as possible.  It would also be my aim to ensure that the need for such measures in the future is avoided if at all possible.  With the foregoing in mind in particular I take the view that the implementation of the Government's voluntary redundancy early retirement package in local authorities must, as a priority, assist in bringing short time working to an end.  In mid-October I authorised local authorities to offer the terms of the package to all grades of staff, including eligible staff now on short time working except key staff or those required to maintain essential services. The redundancy early retirement terms provide for a range of different benefits depending on the length of service, age and whether the staff concerned pay full or modified PRSI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to authorising local authorities to offer the terms to all grades of staff I have also sanctioned the immediate application of the terms to sufficient numbers of eligible staff across all grades to facilitate the termination of any exist-at <Col N="1403" /> ing or proposed short time working arrangements.  In that connection I have also asked managers to co-operate with the implementation of the terms of a code of practice on security in employment for local authority non-officer grades first issued to local authorities in November 1985.  As Senator Ferris rightly said it was introduced by Deputy Liam Kavanagh at the time.  That code is voluntary and non-statutory.</P>
    <P>Its initial aim was to regard 85 per cent of those in non-officer grades, generally those with more than two and a half years of service, as permanent, that is, that they should not be subject to measures such as short time working which any local authority found necessary to introduce. Such measures would first affect employees employed in a temporary capacity, that is, those with less than two and a half years of service before those regarded as permanent could be affected. The code also set out a procedure to be followed in all short time working situations which arose.  All local authority managers are currently taking action to implement the voluntary redundancy early retirement package.</P>
    <P>In the context of preparing the 1988 local authority estimates I asked each manager to submit a report to me on the measures he proposes to take to maximise savings on manpower costs together with the target number of voluntary redundancies envisaged in the local authorities under his control.  I have received a number of these reports and I understand that the remainder will be submitted to me over the next few weeks.  In the meantime I understand that the terms have now been offered to all staff.  I must emphasise that the terms are applicable across all grades and will not be confined to any one category of staff to the exclusion of others.</P>
    <P>After the target number of redundancies has been identified and the level of interest in the terms among the staff has been ascertained, managers must submit detailed proposals for implementing the package to my Department for sanction.  I have asked them to do this <Col N="1404" /> as quickly as possible.  In the meantime I have told them that, if there is any case where surplus staff have already been clearly identified and they are satisfied that other options such as redeployment are not available, proposals to apply the terms immediately in such cases in advance of their overall proposals for the local authority concerned should be submitted to my Department for urgent consideration. An immediate decision will issue on any proposals to implement the package in such cases.  Proposals for a few local authorities to implement the package on the foregoing basis have already been sanctioned.</P>
    <P>As far as any planned short time working in local authorities is concerned, I have made it clear to managers that I expect that, rather than going down that road, any local authority planning such an arrangement should instead ensure that their voluntary redundancy terms are implemented immediately to the extent necessary to avoid short time working. As far as short time working which is already taking place is concerned I have also emphasised to managers that I want the immediate implementation of the package to make an early impact on reducing and phasing out sooner rather than later such short time working.  I am confident from discussions which I have had with managers in this regard that their full co-operation will be forthcoming. I have asked them to keep me informed especially of progress in implementing the package in the counties affected.</P>
    <P>Detailed negotiations with staff interests on the implementation of the package will take place at local level.  It is important that as much co-operation as possible from the staff should be encouraged in view of the voluntary nature of the scheme.  At the suggestion of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions with whom I had discussions in this matter, I am also making arrangements for consultations centrally between the interests involved on any general problems that may arise.  There are early indications of a considerable degree of interest from local authority staff in the <Col N="1405" /> voluntary redundancy early retirement measures.  It will not, of course, be possible to determine whether the number willing to accept the terms is sufficient until all staff who have been offered the package have responded to it and have been given an indication that the manager concerned is willing to accept the particular application.</P>
    <P>Staff will also be advised of the precise amounts payable to them under the scheme before being asked to make a final decision.  I confidently expect that there will be a sufficient take-up of the scheme to ensure that local authorities can in a planned way match staffing levels with their requirements and available resources and, in particular, end arrangements such as short time working which are unsatisfactory from many points of view.</P>
    <P>In so far as the superannuation aspects are concerned, the principles which govern the reckoning of service under the local government superannuation code do not differ between officer and non-officer grades.  The principle involved in the motion before the Seanad is that a member of an officer or non-officer grade is not entitled to reckon as pensionable service any period in respect of which he is not paid.  This is in line with the position in the public service generally and it would not be appropriate for me to seek to amend the existing provisions in this regard.</P>
    <P>Many improvements have been made to the code over recent years.  For example, major improvements were introduced in 1977 and 1984 as a result of the implementation of the recommendations of the Joint Working Party on Local Authority Superannuation.  The reckonability of periods of absence due to short time working as pensionable service was one of the matters considered by the working party in 1982 but a change in the existing position in this regard was not recommended.  Representations have also been received in my Department on a number of occasions in recent years on the same point and successive Ministers have, after full consideration, accepted that it would not be appropriate to change <Col N="1406" /> the present statutory position.</P>
    <P>One of the results of the improvements introduced in 1977 is that an employee may now reckon all his service days, subject to a maximum of 250 in any year, where previous he could not reckon service days in any financial year in which he had less than 200 service days.  By way of clarification I would like to say that, while unpaid absences due to short time working are not reckonable, an interruption of employment in such circumstances does not deprive a pensionable employee of this pensionable status or lessen his accrued superannuation entitlements.</P>
    <P>It is important to understand that the whole concept of local authority superannuation is based on the fact that it is service-related and in the case of an employee a service day means a day on which he works in a whole time capacity for a local authority or is granted paid leave.  His conditions of employment take account of this position.  The various employment protection measures and the redundancy payments Acts apply to local authority non-officer grades on the same basis as employees generally and they are assured of full benefits, for example, unemployment and pay-related benefits under the Social Welfare Acts.  While ideally employment should be without interruption, this is not always possible. The overall position regarding security of tenure of non-officer employees is that their employment and conditions of service are matters for each local authority.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the difficulties which short term working creates for employees and their families and I am concerned to ensure that anything which can be done to reduce short term working to the minimum is done.  For this reason I asked local authorities to make a special effort in this area and to avail of every opportunity presented to them through the implementation of the voluntary redundancy early retirement package to terminate existing or proposed short time working by local authorities employees. I am satisfied that this is the best approach to alleviating the problem, including its consequential effects on superannuation <Col N="1407" /> and I am confident that the efforts of local authorities in this regard will bring about a noticeable reduction in the amount of short time working over the coming months.  Go raibh míle maith agat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>When I saw this motion I went to the Library to have a look at the legislation governing the superannuation of local authority employees and I discovered that, apart from a private Act of Dublin Corporation and Dublin, Limerick and Waterford City Management Acts, there was no specific statutory power to give non-officer employees &mdash; I dislike the word &ldquo;servant&rdquo;; I am glad the Minister did not use that word in his speech tonight; our legislation does unfortunately categorise officer and servant &mdash; a pension prior to the Act of 1948.  Part III of that Act provided that legislation and that was superseded in total by the 1956 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1948 Act attempted to provide a superannuation scheme not only for non-officers of urban bodies, the bulk of whom had permanent employment, but also for the non-officers of county councils, a high proportion of whom had no permanent status at that time and would not have full employment each year.  The normal criterion for accruing pensionable service is that it be full time and permanent. If the superannuation scheme insisted that local authority employees and county council workers would be full time and permanent, very few of them would qualify under the legislation up to then.  The Act of 1948, accordingly, provided that service of 200 days or more in a year would be regarded as pensionable service but it also laid down a number of conditions which were removed by the 1956 Act.  These conditions were replaced in the 1956 Act by a single simple objective, namely, that non-officers would have to have 200 days service to qualify for pension rights. Indeed, it might interest Members to know that for a contribution of 4 per cent &mdash; that was a halfpenny in the shilling &mdash; the non-officers would then be entitled to <Col N="1408" /> a pension of one-sixth of the pensionable remuneration on that date of retirement multiplied by the number of years reckonable service, subject to a maximum 40 years.</P>
    <P>There were two schemes introduced, as far as I can ascertain, one in 1977 and 1986.  The pension and gratuity rights were changed under these schemes. Under the 1986 superannuation scheme the number of service days which constitutes a service year amounted to 150. We come to the kernel of the motion tonight when we look at the legislation regarding what is reckonable service.  A service day is a day on which an employee is at work, or is paid, or is on sick leave subject to one year's sick leave absence in every four years.  An employee could not be credited with a service day on a day on which he absented himself from work other than on sick leave, or on any days during a period of short term working.</P>
    <P>The Minister has quite clearly indicated in his speech tonight that he is in touch with city and county managers. I was in touch with my own personnel department in Dublin Corporation and, even though we are suffering certain effects from cutbacks in local authority funding, I am glad to know there is no one in Dublin Corporation on short time working.  This is a problem with other local authorities as Senator O'Shea has indicated here tonight.  I have been aware of that for some time also.  The Minister indicated that he is urging City and County managers to avail of the early retirement and redundancy package to cut out short time working and eliminate that problem.  I hope the Minister is successful and that sufficient people will apply because the very important word is &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There will be some people in the local authority service who might want to stay on, who might be on short term and might hope, in a better economic climate which the Minister's Government promises, that they would get back to full term employment and may not be anxious to take the early retirement or voluntary <Col N="1409" /> redundancy.  If early retirement and voluntary redundancy is going to be as attractive as the Minister says, then many people will take it up; and that might leave only a minority of people who will want to stay on on short term with the hope of getting back.</P>
    <P>Particular consideration of their situation would not be a great burden on the State.  What the motion is asking &mdash; and I certainly support the principle &mdash; is that people on short term employment in that category, and who are not anxious to take up the redundancy package or early retirement, be given credit for the time they are on short term employment, so that even though the short term employment affects their weekly or monthly wage at present it will not affect their pension and gratuity rights when they reach retiring age.  That is a reasonable request and I fully support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the contributions of the Senators and the Minister with some interest.  I learned with concern from Senator O'Shea that local authorities are being destroyed.  That should not surprise us as much as we might immediately imagine, because I have read the Irish Constitution a number of times and I have had to talk on it a few times.  One of the things that has amazed me in a remarkable document, which deals with individual rights in considerable depth, is that I cannot either find or interpret any clause which deals specifically with local government; but I am sure I stand to be corrected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two extremely interesting clauses.  Article 15.1.3 allows for the Oireachtas to sit outside of Dublin and Article 15.2 allows for the creation or recognition of subordinate legislatures. Although I have been critical of parts of this Constitution, as many Senators have been, the document as a whole is a remarkable document which has already got tailor-made for us the means of decentralising Ireland and also accommodating different aspects and different traditions of Irish life.  What we have not got is the next stage.  There is allusion to county councils.  I do not see the words <Col N="1410" />&ldquo;urban council&rdquo; in the document.  There has not been sufficient attention paid to the need to develop power right down to where the people actually work.  If one were to make a main criticism of the Constitution it is, in a sense that, if it has failed people it has failed them because of that omission, because after all in the last 50 years the Irish people are now &mdash; at least we hope &mdash; adequately educated. We should therefore be able to take on board responsibility for decision-making where we live and where we work and we should be trusted to do so.  It is the liberation of the energy that is at present tied up inside the people that will be one of the answers to our problems as we move into the future.</P>
    <P>As far as the particular problem of the moment is concerned, in the short term certainly we all recognise the dilemma of the State finances and we all have to acknowledge, whether we like it or not, whether we are critical of it or not, that the present Government are certainly taking the bull by the horns, so to speak, and are determined to take action.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to Senator Doyle.  He quite rightly makes a plea for those who want to remain in local government service and who are remaining so, not with the idea of having a cushy part-time life but with perhaps the prospect that things will work out for the better and that they will eventually be able to anticipate a more full-time existence. May I suggest that the pension might be able to bridge the gap between the Minister and Senator Doyle if one considers what is done in the national health service?  A pension is given on one-eightieth for every year served taking the average of the last three years of service. That would allow for the possibility of an upturn in the economics.  It would allow for the possibility of the part-time work at present.  A person would have to gamble, because in a sense he would be taking on trust that there was going to be an upturn; but it would allow him to anticipate the possibility of having a reasonable pension at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>As far as the Minister's proposals are concerned, there is an attempt made to <Col N="1411" /> produce pleasantly structured unemployment. By that I mean the voluntary aspect has been emphasised.  There are people who like to take up the opportunity to change their employment if that is feasible; there are people who like to retire early and make use of the time that is left to them and who feel that the pension they will receive will be adequate to meet their needs.  But there remains those people to whom both Senator O'Shea and Senator Doyle have referred.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the comment made about two-thirds of the farmers being in favour of land tax.  It is appalling that £30 million goes to accountants &mdash; and I would have to question that because it seems such a huge figure &mdash; and that the average farmer pays £460 per annum to his accountant.  If the farmers are prepared to pay land tax to the local community I will conclude by suggesting that one might look at the system of taxing in the country in conjunction with what I have said about the need to decentralise and push out quantums of power to where people actually work and live.  Consider the following model; if 10 per cent of the total taxes of the people went to the capital, if 20 per cent of the taxes collected in the region went to the regional capital, if 40 per cent of the taxes collected from people there went to the local district or local community, you still have 30 per cent left for redistribution by the centre or region to be moved from the prosperous communities into the more deprived communities.  It is in that type of rethink of the whole taxing structure, in conjunction with a look at the need for a new article in the Constitution in relation to the need to decentralise, that the long-term solution will come and which will give the people about whom Senator Doyle is concerned a more likely prospect of regaining full employment in the service that they wish.  I do not want to go into the mathematics of it but I have just given that outline &mdash; have I any time left?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief.  I would like to second the amendment and to say at the outset that I welcome the Minister's comments here this evening. There is obviously merit in the motion. One imagines that the state of play as we currently know it is effectively the result of the deliberations of the joint working party on workers' superannuation.  The joint working parties, who by their very nature are concerned for the wellbeing of workers in any aspect of industry, had an input and despite that fact the regulations has not been changed.  The deliberations in 1982 by the same joint working party again decided it should not be changed.  In the climate of the day to contemplate changing it now would be most unwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has, very definitely, adopted a much more pragmatic approach in making serious efforts effectively to eliminate the principle of part time working.  I represent a local authority with 2,500 employees and I can say we do not have any employees on short time and never have had over the duration of my term as a member of the county council in Cork.  Therefore I cannot comment on it with any degree of knowledge.  The approach being adopted by the Minister is obviously the correct one, that is, to eliminate the concept altogether.  While it might be Utopian to <Col N="1413" /> strive to have a situation in which every local authority had no workers on short time, it is one we should aspire to.  The <i>modus operandi</i> being introduced by this Minister is the right one, that is to pursue voluntary redundancies which will in time produce a slimmed down and much fitter local authority than we currently have and this phenomenon of road workers being on short time with monotonous regularity in some counties will hopefully be eliminated.  That, as I said at the outset, is the Minister's intention.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made his position abundantly clear to county managers in relation to the even handed approach he will be insisting upon in relation to the appropriation of the various categories of persons who will be accepted for voluntary redundancy.  They will not all be county council road workers.  In many county councils, the planning staffs and sanitary services staffs and all the engineering staffs, architect staffs and so on, increase and increase while the number of workers doing the physical work of maintaining and servicing our road network decreases.  That phenomenon is in evidence in every county council where gradually over the years the numbers of road workers has steadily decreased.</P>
    <P>We are producing various pieces of legislation and it is very evident from the track record of this Minister in the short duration he has been in office that he intends to produce a lot of legislation. That is very welcome.  I instance as a case in point his very welcome comments over the weekend in relation to the need for and his desire to control pollution.  When I was a member of Cork County Council some years ago, we got new legislation in relation to litter control and, on the very same day, we got a letter from the then Department of the Public Service indicating that there was no change in the situation in relation to staff or employee recruitment.  How in those circumstances do you pursue the implementation of a new piece of legislation like the Litter Bill?</P>
    <P>Public authority members comment almost on a daily basis on the disarray in relation to litter, dumping and so on.  Yet, <Col N="1414" /> in tandem with the arrival of a new piece of legislation in relation to control, we have advice that we may not employ any people.  We would all laud the Minister's desire to be even handed in relation to the appropriation of the voluntary redundancy package but he should be mindful of the fact that, in our desire to implement other legislation, such as the Litter Bill, for example, implementation requires additional staff or a meaningful redeployment of staff.</P>
    <P>Certainly amongst the unions in Cork County Council, there is willingness to enter into meaningful dialogue with regard to relocation of workers from one category to another.  The unions appear to be quite happy.  Management can resolve the problem if there is a reasonable approach across the board.  There is this desire, I have no doubt, to approach the matter fairly and to ensure even-handedness in the voluntary redundancy packages.</P>
    <P>The difficulty of funding is the ultimate problem.  The way the Minister has approached the problem of the shortfall in funding generally is to be welcomed because all Departments have been expected to take their share of the chop. It is quite obvious that the Department of the Environment have taken almost more than their fair share.  Some of the innovative moves the Minister has made in recent weeks are to be welcomed, certainly in the areas touched on by Senator O'Shea.  I do not agree with the Senator's point.  I had occasion to argue the toss with a member of his party yesterday at a council meeting.</P>
    <P>The provisions in relation to the SDA loans are long overdue.  It is all very well to talk about when loans get back to 15 per cent and 16 per cent, but the logical conclusion is that the effort to be cost effective is a superfluous exercise from day one.  It should be pursued only on the basis that the spiral will continue to go down rather than up.  At the moment it is quite permissible for people to negotiate loans from any of the normal building agencies on better terms than they would get from their local county council.  Why should they not avail of them?  That move <Col N="1415" /> by the Minister is to be welcomed.  It should also be said that the concept of obtaining a loan to build a new home from a banking or house-building agency is not new.  It is not a concept that the Minister dreamt up.  That has always been in existence.  I was quite surprised to hear members at a local authority meeting recently saying it was a new phenomenon.  It certainly is not.</P>
    <P>Let us approach the matter honestly. A person or a couple wishing to purchase or build a new home should be provided with every facility to avail of lower interest rates where possible.  It will be incumbent upon the Government and the Minister to ensure that the rates stay down.  We should not be negative in political debate.  There were people at our meeting yesterday talking about 20 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister would love to come in here this evening and say: &ldquo;Yes, no problem. We will consider this for superannuation purposes.&rdquo;  Of course, it is not easy.  I am making the point that I welcome the Minister's approach this evening.  He is endeavouring to be evenhanded and his ultimate desire, and I have no doubt the desire of every member of a local authority would be the total elimination of short term working.</P>

Listening to Senator Ferris you would think this problem arose within the past six or seven months since the Fianna Fáil Government got into power.  In the past number of years a directive was sent to all local authorities to ensure that for every three made redundant only one <Col N="1416" /> replacement could take place irrespective of sector.  I am very glad the Minister has introduced voluntary redundancy.  I am delighted with the working and hope the Opposition will not try to turn it into enforced redundancy.  As a Senator mentioned this evening, it gives an ideal opportunity to a local authority worker to opt for the voluntary redundancy early retirement package and possibly use the money to go into business.  I am delighted in particular that this voluntary redundancy scheme is not just for the man on the ground with the shovel or the pick, that it starts at the top.  The last time we spoke about the reform of local government I said it might be no harm to look into some of the cupboards where the cobwebs have been for a number of years.</P>

The Minister mentioned that we seemed to have strayed from the substance of the motion and I will try to be as relevant in summing up, in deference to the Minister who in certain ways could be accused of not remaining totally relevant himself in his reply.  However, that is a small point. One point I would make to the Minister is that at present 250 service days are required for full pension and gratuity entitlements; that 260 days would be the norm; and there are ten days per year for which local authority workers would be paying a superannuation contribution. Those days are absolutely useless to them.  I put it to the Minister that those days or the accumulation of those days could be used to make good the years in which they had been short time working. In other words, if somebody missed, for instance, 50 days in a particular year, if he had five years of working ten days extra could the regulation be changed so <Col N="1417" /> that those days could be used to make good the 50 days in the year in which he was short?  Just a small point which I would ask the Minister to clarify.  I understand from senior trade union people that a commitment has been given in talks with the Minister and senior trade union officials that there will not be compulsory lay-offs in local authorities; in other words, there will not be compulsory short time working.  There is no question of an undertaking being given to unions that there will be no compulsory short time working in 1988?</P>

      <P>It would be just as well, a Leas Chathaoirligh, if I refer the Senator to the earlier part of my contribution.  It sets out pretty clearly the arrangements I had with the unions in so far as short time working is concerned.  With the idea of reducing that and clearing it up and bringing back those who have already been let off, I agreed to apply the package to all grades in all local authorities, not just the ones named by the county managers, so that those who would take up the package could be replaced by those on short time and brought back.  That is the essence of what I was saying this evening.  It is very important and I hope the Senator understands it because it means that those who are on short time and who do not wish to take redundancy will be brought back into the service.</P>

      <P>The word Utopian was used by somebody on the other side. There is no way in my view that local authorities will get sufficient redundancies or sufficient early retirements to obviate the necessity to revert to short time working.  The Minister has not yet stated whether or not any undertaking was given to the unions.  I would like to go on to another point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying that it was a Utopian aspiration.  In regard to social welfare paid while persons are on short time working, someone who has two children is about £4 less well off per week when he is in receipt of social welfare and on short time working.  That is a more general point.  It seems crazy where somebody who has been a net contributor under this scheme to the Exchequer is on short time working, he is only £4 worse off.  One of the comments made by Senator Robb, although not relevant to the motion, about the distribution of taxation away from the centre &mdash; something in which I would have a lot of interest &mdash; deserves comment.</P>
      <P>The pundits are telling us that by the year 2000, 50 per cent of jobs will be in the tourism, leisure related area.  If we are running down local authorities, if roads tend to get into a much worse state &mdash; and no one can deny that is happening and will continue to happen in a big way &mdash; this certainly makes our country less attractive for tourists.  In a way we are probably eating the seed potatoes in the sense that we are neglecting our base and a very important part of our infrastructure. A question which the Minister did not refer to is the discretion he has under the Bill to allow pension entitlement for periods of short time working. We know, for instance, that when a strike happens and service days are lost, the Minister has discretion to grant those days as service days.  If his aspiration is reached and there is no short time working in 1988, could the Minister in that context consider regularising the situation for people who have suffered reduction of pension and gratuity rights heretofore?</P>

      <P>If I can refer to what Senator O'Callaghan said regarding local authority loans, I have never seen myself as being a knocker but that is up to other people to judge.  The point I want to make is that local authority loans are available to persons with an income under £10,000, persons who are just out of the reach of local authority housing and a subsidy situation had existed, with these loans, certainly with the SDA loan. With the maximum ordinary loan being at £21,000, if we take the lowest interest rates we have had in the eighties and the highest interest rates, there could be a swing of £90.00 per month on interest repayments on those loans.  This is absolutely horrendous and absolutely at variance with the whole spirit of SDA loans, with the whole spirit of loans for local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no denying that the type of client who will be going to local authorities for loans from here on will be those who have not succeeded in getting loans from banks or building societies. They are persons who have a lot more <Col N="1420" /> difficulty in repaying.  The income limit of £10,000 is too low, but that is another point.  Many persons for instance were housed under the £5,000 surrender grant introduced by the last Government and there are persons who up to now could have availed of the existing loans.  We are removing from such persons the opportunity to provide their own houses.  That cannot be good and it is something that I cannot support.  I feel I am not being destructive in making that comment. That is an absolutely constructive comment and an honest and realistic comment on what is happening.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Fianna Fáil amendment is a noting amendment, and I have no doubt but that when we come to vote on it tonight that Fianna Fáil Members will support it.  However, I would ask the Minister, if he achieves his objective of there being no compulsory lay-offs in local authorities to review sympathetically the situation of the people referred to in the motion who have already lost entitlement.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Adjournment I have received notice from Senator D. Cassidy that he proposes to raise the following matter: the need for the Government to restore Lough Sheelin lake to its former pollution-free state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Lough Sheelin is a lake of 4,600 acres bordered by the counties of Cavan, Meath and Westmeath.  Three quarters of the lake and its catchment are within the administrative county of Cavan.  It was renowned internationally as a brown trout fishery, offering trout of very high average weight to keen fly anglers.  It was fished by a large number of overseas anglers, particularly those from Great Britain, Germany, France and <Col N="1423" /> most of the rest of the Continent.  Its renown as such a fishery led to the establishment of hotels and guesthouses in the vicinity to cater for the expanding tourist demand.  The lake was noted for the quality of its dry fly fishing, and particularly for its mayfly fishing, which taxed the capacity of the hotels and guesthouses to cater for the number of anglers seeking to fish the lake.  Subsidiary industries, such as boat building, repair and tackle supply, sprung up in the area to cater also for the anglers' needs.</P>
      <P>In the late 1960s it became evident that the water quality of the lake was deteriorating and this deterioration became acute with the first severe algal bloom in 1971.  Investigations at the time showed that the algal bloom, which turned the colour of the water a pea soup green, was due to excessive enrichment of the lake by nitrates and phosphates containing the effluents originating in the catchment.  Further investigation revealed that the nitrates and phosphates were mainly emanating from the uncontrolled proliferation of intensive pig production units in the catchment area. Estimates at the time equated the annual output of slurry in the catchment with the sewerage output of a city with a population equivalent to that of Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite continued investigation and discussion with the Government agencies no effective policy for remedial action was adopted.  By 1972 the problem was already so acute that some of the main angling characteristics of the lake such as the mayfly and sedge fly patches had disappeared, destroyed by the algal blooms.  Little happened by way of remedial action with the exception of an occasional prosecution taken by the fishery board whenever it was possible to gather sufficient evidence to sustain a prosecution.  The water in the lake continued to deteriorate and by 1979 it had reached a crisis situation, which prompted the Inland Fisheries Trust, the forerunner to the Central Fisheries Board, to publish a report in the same year setting out vividly the future prospects for the lake as a game fishery.  The <Col N="1424" /> report was entitled <i>Nutrification of Lough Sheelin</i>&mdash;<i>a Critical Stage.</i>  It can be very briefly summed up in its final sentence: &ldquo;The indications are that Lough Sheelin will also cease to be a viable trout fishery within a few years unless positive measures are introduced to halt the ingress of excessive nutrients in the lake.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is appropriate at this stage to explain the effects of the nutrification of the lake. Excessive nutrients cause a growth of algal, turning the lake water into a blue or green colour, later turning brown with a purification of the algae.  The discolouration of the water shuts out the sunlight and prevents it from reaching normal plant life in the bed of the lake. As a result the plant life dies off as do the insects and fauna which live in and on the plants.  These insects and other fauna are the main components of the food chain of the fish.  It is the insects and other fauna which give the lake its reputation as a game angling centre. Losses of the fauna have resulted in a serious deterioration in angling and has resulted in a decrease of stocks of fish with evidence to suggest that at least two years' production of young fish have already died of starvation.  The behaviour pattern of the remaining stock of fish has been altered in such a way that the attractiveness of the lake as a game angling centre has been seriously affected, if not irreversibly damaged.</P>
    <P>This is also true of Lough Derravarragh, where the algal blooms have been spread downwards from Lough Sheelin and are likely to continue downstream to affect Lough Ree and Lough Derg, which are also on the Shannon system.</P>
    <P>Consequent on the publication of the Inland Fisheries Trust Report, 1979, local interests made an appeal to the then Taoiseach, Deputy Charles J. Haughey, which resulted in the setting up of an interdepartmental committee to examine ways and means of dealing with the then estimated 35 million gallons of pig slurry being produced annually in the Sheelin catchment area.  This was the first time that an effort was made to come to grips with the problem.  The committee made <Col N="1425" /> three main recommendations in 1979: (1) the introduction of a transport subsidy scheme to remove excess slurry from the Sheelin catchment area; (2) co-ordinated efforts by the local authority, in consultation with the agricultural services, to effectively control the spreading of slurry in the catchment of the lake; and (3), increased monitoring of the lake conditions by the Inland Fisheries Trust now the Central Fisheries Board.</P>
    <P>The Government accepted the recommendations of the committee in September 1980 and announced the introduction of a transport subsidy scheme and additional monitoring of the lake conditions.  The transport subsidy scheme was an interim measure to enable the pig producers and the recipients of the excess slurry to come up with a scheme funded entirely by the producers themselves. That is very important nowadays, that the scheme must be funded entirely by the producers themselves when the initial period had finished.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food, who must accept responsibility for the creation of the problems, supplied the services of an official to co-ordinate and record the movement of slurry from the catchment area.  A management committee was set up under the auspices of the Department of Fisheries to manage and control the scheme.  The resultant action taken during the ensuing four years while the scheme lasted had a dramatic effect on the quality of the water and on the flora and fauna of the lake. Whereas water visibility was down to one metre and all the vegetation on the lake bed had died off except for a narrow bank in a very shallow area, by 1984 the improved water quálity had resulted in the weed bed re-establishing itself to a depth of 12 feet.  This showed without doubt that removal of the slurry from the catchment in a controlled manner had the desired effect on water quality.</P>
    <P>The vegetation which had died off began to be re-established, the water became clear, visiting anglers reappeared and there was high hopes that the lake was returning to normal.  Regrettably, at this time in 1984 a number of things <Col N="1426" /> happened which subsequently had a disastrous effect on the lake.  The Government of the day, the Coalition, decided to terminate the transport subsidy scheme without replacing it with something concrete or effective.  The services of the coordinator were curtailed, the Department of Fisheries opted out of their responsibility for the lake and handed over the task to the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>This transfer of responsibility from the Department of Fisheries to the Department of the Environment is something which should not have been allowed to happen.  It may have been administratively convenient but unless the Department with responsibility for inland fisheries is allowed whatever powers are necessary for the protection of these fisheries, it is my opinion that the outlook for our inland fisheries is extremely bleak indeed and the potential capacity of these fisheries to contribute substantially to our attractiveness as a tourist destination will be allowed to slip away from us.</P>
    <P>Under the aegis of the Department of the Environment a new Sheelin slurry management committee was then established and chaired by Cavan County Council.  Correspondence ensued between the various agencies concerned and the local people, and grave doubts were conveyed to the Government about the effectiveness of the new arrangement which was to be introduced.  The Government's response to these representations was given in a written reply in the Dáil, Questions Nos. 578 and 588 on 13 December 1984 by the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Kavanagh, and I quote:</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the orderly manner in which transitional arrangements leading to the transfer of responsibility to the pig producers have been implemented provides an ideal basis for the continued protection of the lake, given a co-operative and responsible approach by the producers.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, I must now state that the new arrangements made at that time did <Col N="1427" /> not work.  It is claimed by the producers that they are transporting a certain amount of slurry out of the catchment, but in the absence of a full-time co-ordinator it appears that there is no person in a position to say what amount of slurry is being removed and what is going out.</P>
    <P>Recent reports from the Central Fisheries Board confirm that the lake is now as bad or worse than it was in 1979, and it is evident to me that the agencies concerned failed to maintain the progress made between 1980 and 1984.  I believe that the Minister must now initiate an investigation into what went wrong from 1984 up to now.  He must take whatever steps are necessary, even at this late stage, however unpalatable they may be to the various interests, to ensure that the terms of my motion here tonight are listened to.</P>
    <P>The technical advice available to the Department of Fisheries, the Department of the Environment and indeed Cavan County Council indicated that if Sheelin was to be returned to normal, or at least to what it was in 1984, the following suggestions were made: (1) to remove 20 million gallons of slurry from the catchment area &mdash; that is 20 million gallons and it is not a misprint or an error of mine &mdash; (2) spreading of the remainder of the slurry produced must be confined to the period from April to September, inclusive, spreading during that period to be in accordance only with crop requirements and the soil moisture deficit.  Other authorities &mdash; for example, An Foras Talúntais, ACOT, the Central Fisheries Board and many other eminent people &mdash; are unanimous in their view that slurry should not be spread during the period from 1 October to 31 March in any particular year.  This technical advice is freely available to all, including the local authority, which has a statutory responsibility for the enforcement of the Water Pollution Act, 1977.</P>
    <P>Despite the technical advice from these respected sources Cavan County Council have continued to allow the spreading of slurry during periods for which prohibition is recommended.  I believe that <Col N="1428" /> the executive of Cavan County Council have failed to implement the provisions of the Water Pollution Act.  I am aware of one occasion at least when notices served under section 12 of the Water Pollution Act, 1977, which were issued to a number of persons in the Sheelin catchment prohibiting spreading of slurry during the recommended periods of six months, were withdrawn and subsequently re-issued but covering a shorter period of three months.  The grant of planning permission for a new multipound extension to a meat plant within the catchment, without ensuring the provision of an adequate effluent treatment plant and thus causing further pollution shows scant concern for the well-being of Lough Sheelin.</P>
    <P>Following investigations by the Central Fisheries Board this company has been prosecuted and convicted on four occasions for causing pollution in the Sheelin system.  This is the type of action which makes what is said in this House and in the Dáil irrelevant and brings our pollution control provisions into disrepute. Our concern for places like Sellafield must now sound hollow when we do not take action in matters over which we have control.  A well known and respected angling journal has commented adversely on the position and I will give an extract from their comment:</P>
    <P>Judged by the number of readers who have written to me complaining about the pollution situation in Ireland, fewer English anglers will be travelling to these fishery places next season.</P>
    <P>Someone in England sent a letter to a friend of mine in Castlepollard stating that he would not be bringing his 12 or 14 friends next year because this lake had deteriorated so badly.  It was for that reason I put this motion down here because it was of such a serious nature.</P>
    <P>The current situation is completely unacceptable.  At a time when our Irish angling could be sold at a premium on world markets and when it is necessary to maximise the return from our natural resources, we are well on the way towards <Col N="1429" /> the destruction of this unique lake.  I was pleased recently to hear the Minister express his concern at the level of water pollution now occurring but, in my opinion the Minister's sentiments are not being translated into action on the ground.  If the Minister wants to follow through on his expressed intention of making the polluter pay, the mind boggles at the size of the claim he would be lodging with the polluters of Lough Sheelin.  A once thriving tourist industry in the Sheelin area is now in disarray with guest houses closed, hotels virtually out of business and hundreds of unused boats tied up in their moorings.  This is the reality of the situation today.  I want to know what the Minister proposes to do. Various proposals aimed at coming to grips with the Sheelin problem have been made over the years most of which have been ignored.  I should like to pay tribute to Deputy Haughey.  Had the action he took in 1980 to 1984 been continued, we would not be standing here this evening talking about this pollution.</P>
    <P>To summarise this lake was the best trout lake in Europe in the fifties and sixties.  The biggest investment ever made by the Inland Fisheries Board was made on this lake to get rid of pike and to specialise solely in trout.  The pig producers came into the area and this part of Ireland is now the biggest pig producing area in the EC.  I am not against people who have investment in pigs.  They are to be commended and in fairness they are all determined to play their part if they are given some sort of planned arrangement for the future.  The mayfly has gone completely off the lake.  The 1980-84 scheme, when it was initiated, was a tremendous success.  They took it up to the rich lands of County Meath and it is of great value to the farmers of those areas who do not have this slurry.  The position now is that Bord Fáilte have decided to take what 25 years ago was the best trout fishing lake in Ireland off the tourist map as a recommended place where tourists should fish.  That speaks for itself.  I thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, for allowing me to put the motion here tonight and I thank the Minister for <Col N="1430" /> coming in to listen to the problems I had to put forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Senator for his contribution and to assure him, and everyone else in the House, that I share the concern about the condition of Lough Sheelin.  I am aware that the water quality in the lake has deteriorated recently.  I am concerned about the implications of this for tourism and angling in the area.</P>
      <P>The problem in the lake has historically been associated with the spreading of pig slurry and there is little doubt that this has been the major source of the nutrient load entering the lake and the adjoining streams.  The introduction of a slurry transport scheme in the lake in the early eighties was initially subsidised by the State as an incentive to encourage responsible action by the pig producers. This scheme was later funded by the pig producers themselves and brought about a big improvement in the condition of the lake.  The pig producers, by agreeing to serve on the Lough Sheelin management committee, showed a willingness to play their part in ensuring the survival of the lake as an important fishery and for some time it looked as if the lake would be fully restored to its previous healthy condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, recent wet summers resulted in a deterioration in the water quality from 1985 onwards.  This deterioration has occurred notwithstanding co-operation by all concerned and adherence by most of the pig producers to the terms of notices served on them under section 12 of the Water Pollution Act, 1977, prohibiting slurry spreading over certain winter months.  Officials of the Department and Roinn na Mara met with officials of Cavan County Council and members of the Sheelin management committee earlier this year to consider the situation.  It was agreed that slurry management plans for each of the main pig producers in the Sheelin catchment area should be prepared with guidelines regarding spreading rates, timing of applications and suitability of land.  With the assistance of an officer of the farm <Col N="1431" /> development service of the Department of Agriculture and Food slurry management plans for the major producers in the area have now been finalised.</P>
    <P>These plans will form the basis of a major attempt to minimise the nutrient input into the lake.  The plans quantify the situation in each holding, identify on maps the land suitable for slurry spreading and limit the amount of slurry which can be spread to 2,500 gallons per acre for grazing land per year and 2,000 gallons per acre per cut of silage.  These application rates are subject to the phosphorus status of the soil being suitable for spreading.  Farmers will keep an accurate log book of slurry transactions relating to their holdings and these will be available for inspection on request.</P>
    <P>Cavan County Council have issued 44 notices under section 12 of the Water Pollution Act prohibiting the spreading of slurry during the months of November, December, January and February and restricting spreading during October and March to periods when ground and weather conditions are suitable for safe spreading.  I have been advised that the council will rigidly enforce these notices and, where necessary, will prosecute for non-compliance as has been done in the past.</P>
    <P>The extent of the problem and the difficulty in maintaining the water quality of the lake in a satisfactory condition, despite the efforts of the pig producers in the recent past, has resulted in other sources of nutrient inputs into the lake being re-examined.  Cavan County Council have required an industrial plant, which discharges into one of the main streams feeding the lake, to install phosphorus removal equipment which will significantly improve the quality of the effluent discharged.  The council recently met with cattle farmers in the area and pointed out the contributions that slurry from their activities is making to the nutrient load in the lake.  They issued notices under section 12 to 135 cattle farmers in the Cavan area of the lake prohibiting land spreading of cattle slurry from November to mid- January as an <Col N="1432" /> additional measure to assist in the lake's recovery.  Conscious of the need to be even-handed in all their dealings the council are presently examining the need for improvements at their own sewage treatment works at Ballyjamesduff as well as examining other possible sources of nutrient inputs into the lake.  Unfortunately, it is not only the pig producers who are causing the trouble in Lough Sheelin.</P>
    <P>I am confident that this co-ordinated attack on the sources of nutrient input into the lake will help restore the lake to its former glory.  However, it would be remiss of me if I did not take this opportunity to inform the House briefly of the proposals the Government have to improve water pollution control generally. Following the large number of serious fish kills which took place this summer, a special Cabinet sub-committee chaired by myself and comprising the Ministers for the Marine, Agriculture and Food, Tourism and Transport and the Attorney General was established which recently completed its deliberations. The Government recently approved the committee's comprehensive and integrated programme of measures to combat water pollution particularly from agricultural activities.  I will deal with some of those now.</P>
    <P>County managers will be requested to organise task forces comprising local authorities fishery boards, farm development services and ACOT personnel to survey farms for the purpose of indentifying potential sources of water pollution. Initially the task force will identify priority areas for inspection taking account of rivers which have been affected by pollution, Bord Fáilte's brand marketing programme for fishery waters, other beneficial users of water and so on. All of the information already available to the farm and fishery agencies will be available to assist in identifying priorities and personnel drawn from the different agencies involved will carry out the inspections on the basis of a standard survey form.  Appropriate follow-up action will be taken under the Water Pollution Act where pollution prevention <Col N="1433" /> measures are required, or under the Planning Acts in the case of unauthorised developments.</P>
    <P>While the primary purpose of the surveys now proposed will be to detect potential sources of agricultural pollution the task forces established by local authorities will also be reporting on industrial activities where necessary.  The Department of Agriculture and Food will arrange for the production of a new brochure containing advice, guidelines and standards for farmers on the collection, storage and disposal of animal slurries, silage effluent, milk parlour washings and other soiled water.  The brochure will be distributed to all farmers by next spring.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food, and in particular the local farm advisory services available through ACOT, will step up the emphasis on environmental awareness education issues relevant to farmers.  Discussions will be held with farming organisations to impress upon them the need for information, education and other programmes directed at their members and designed to ensure compliance by farmers generally with proper standards and procedures.  Education and enforcement: one without the other will not work.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have already been encouraged by the Department to establish committees.  Committees will be established in every county council area to co-ordinate the drive against pollution from agricultural activities.  These committees are in place in many areas.  They include representatives of fishery boards, angling clubs, farming sector, environmental groups and tourism interests. They seek to prevent pollution through greater awareness and co-operation. Those counties that have not got them will be directed by me to have them. Efforts to increase awareness of the risks of pollution generally will be pursued through the schools.  If our young people do not understand the importance of the environment and are not educated to appreciate and preserve it, we are wasting our time starting anywhere else.</P>
    <P>Regulations will be made to restrict further the scale of agricultural developments <Col N="1434" /> which can be undertaken without planning permission.  I am going to change the rules about exempted developments.  Apart from these measures, the Government have also approved the general scheme of the Water Pollution (Amendment) Bill, 1987.  The main features of the legislation will be an increase in the maximum fine on summary conviction to £1,000, an increase from £250; and £500, an increase from £100, for every day on which the contravention is continued, the increases to apply both to the Water Pollution and the Fishery Acts, a new maximum penalty on conviction on indictment of £25,000, an increase from £5,000; and £5,000 from £500 for every day on which the contravention is continued and/or imprisonment for a period of up to five years.  It was two up to this.  The increases will apply to both Water Pollution and to the Fishery Acts which are being given the increased powers and penalties as well.  An amendment to the good defence provision of the 1977 Act puts a greater onus on the person charged to prove that he could not reasonably have foreseen that his act or omission would cause pollution of waters.  That has been one of the reasons put forward by local authorities for their inactivity in pursuing these matters up to court prosecutions.  I am removing the good defence section 3 (3) of the existing Act.</P>
    <P>There is a strengthening of the local authorities' power to serve notices regulating practices such as silage making and animal slurry spreading which, in their opinion pose a risk of water pollution. This will enable more effective control régimes to be implemented in areas such as the Lough Sheelin catchment and that new arrangement is particularly aimed at dealing with the situation that has been referred to by the good Senator Cassidy.</P>
    <P>There will be an extension to any person of the right to apply to the courts for an order seeking the mitigation or remedying of the effects of a pollution incident.  I am making explicit provision for remedial measures such as the replacement of fish stocks and the making good of consequential losses suffered by <Col N="1435" /> any person or body as a result of the pollution.</P>
    <P>There will be a review by local authorities of effluent discharge licences at any time where there are reasonable grounds for believing that any of the beneficial uses of water are significantly threatened.  A lot of the pollution in this country comes from excesses under the existing licences granted to allow effluent to be discharged into receiving waters. There will be a new provision allowing for registration by local authorities of specified agricultural operations, activities, practices or uses of premises in its functional area, or any part of it, which in the opinion of the authority constitute a risk to water pollution, with power to attach conditions and to prohibit or to require the discontinuance of a particular activity.  There will be provision for appeals and for offences involving failure to register or to comply with any conditions set by the local authority.  This provision will also be of special significance to an area such as Lough Sheelin.</P>
    <P>Senators will see from this general outline programme that the Government are committed to the preservation of our waters as an amenity for all our people. It would be selfish and shortsighted of us to permit the continued pollution of our rivers and lakes.  They are too precious to be taken for granted.</P>

      <P>One of our great assets when marketing this country abroad, both from the tourist perspective and from the viewpoint of selling our agricultural produce, is the image of a clean, unpolluted country.  I believe there is very <Col N="1436" /> little deliberate polluting of our waters going on.  A lot of it springs from ignorance of what is happening when effluent is allowed to run into a stream, lack of knowledge as to what the proper farming practice is, lack of understanding as to the damage that can result from pollution being allowed to run down into a stream. I am concerned that farming communities recognise the value of a clean environment because, inevitably and eventually, their own produce has to sell on an open market where it gets the best price when it can be established that it comes from a clean environment.  They have a vested interest and from my discussions and consultations with the farming communities and the farming organisations they are absolutely committed to co-operate in everything I propose doing to deal with this matter over the next couple of years.</P>
      <P>It will not be possible in the short term to eliminate all fish kills and pollution. Some of that pollution is created by industry, local authorities and farming activities.  But we will make a start; and if we are determined and stick together and if the local authorities pursue this new legislative framework I am giving them to tackle this, then we can achieve the desirable results.</P>
      <P>The programme myself and my colleagues in Government are now putting in train will ensure that this image of a clean, unpolluted environment will be maintained and indeed improved upon.  I know that I have the unanimous backing of the House and the Dáil in all matters concerned with the improvement of the environment.</P>
