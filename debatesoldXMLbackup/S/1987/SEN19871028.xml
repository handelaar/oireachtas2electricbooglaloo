      <P>I have notice from Senator Katherine Bulbulia that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to restore funding to the County and City Infirmary, Waterford in order to ensure that the people of that area have an adequate surgical and medical service.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Maurice Manning of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach to clarify the situation concerning the recent reported illegal exports of archaeological artefacts and to assure the House that all steps will be taken to ensure that the full provisions of the National Monuments Acts, 1987, will be implemented.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Brendan Ryan of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The continuing practice of the Department of Social Welfare of requiring members of the travelling <Col N="796" /> community to &ldquo;sign on&rdquo; at employment exchanges between 11.30 a.m. and 12 noon on Thursdays.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Seán Haughey of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to take an early decision to replace the Dublin Dental Hospital given that the present premises are outmoded, unsatisfactory and unacceptable and that the building of new dental facilities proceed without delay at St. James's Hospital, Dublin.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Bulbulia, Manning, Ryan and Haughey as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator Bulbulia's motion and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m., or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.  Senators Manning, Ryan and Haughey may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>
    <P>I want to remind Senators that the Cathaoirleach requires written notice to be given of the matters again or else they will lapse.</P>
    <P>Before we proceed to the Order of Business, with regard to the short notice for item No. 2 on the Order Paper may I put the Chair's position on record?  Under Standing Order 25 the Chair has discretion to allow a motion to be moved on shorter notice than the required four days.  I have exercised this discretion in relation to this motion, No. 2 on the Order Paper, which was tabled only yesterday, as an exceptional measure in view of the fact that, (1) the bank holiday intervened in the period of notice and, (2) my understanding is that the subject matter of the motion was made known to the Government Whips last week.  I have allowed shorter notice on this occasion as an exceptional measure and I have no intention of dispensing with the usual four days' notice in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended to take the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987, and item No. 2.  I accept Senator O'Toole's apology for the late reception of item No. 2. It will be an indication to him that it is not always possible for either Government or Opposition to order business as it should be ordered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to question the situation regarding motions.  My interpretation of the rule is that it has to be of national or general importance.  I believe that if there is a hole in the roof of a school building in Carrick in County Donegal, it would be unfair of me to come in here and ask the Seanad to note the urgency of making repairs to a school roof in Carrick.  We should have some guidelines.  If we go on singling out hospitals and schools we will end up dealing with potholes in by-roads.  I ask for some guidance on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to the Senator that item No. 2 does not fall into that category.  I take it the Senator is referring to motions on the Adjournment.  The practice in that regard is the result of long experience and the procedure there is well known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, may I say on behalf of my party that we profoundly disagree with the points made by the last speaker?  In the absence of Question Time in this House the motion on the Adjournment is the only device open to the ordinary Member to highlight a grievance, however small it may be.  It is one of our most fundamental <Col N="798" /> and most cherished rights.  We would resist any attempt to change that long standing practice.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business I would like to ask the Leader of the House if, in view of the very heavy load of legislation ahead, he can give an early indication of what Bills will be taken in the coming weeks and in what order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I am also concerned about the comments of Senator McGowan particularly as the Standing Orders of the Seanad and its business are the subject matter of discussion by an all party committee.  It is inappropriate to be critical of the existing method of ordering the business.  We have lived within the existing statutory regulations laid down for the orderly running of the House.  Members must have recourse to some method by which they can raise items relative to their constituencies or otherwise.  Until such time as the committee, which the Leas-Chathaoirleach chairs, has reported to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and reported finally to this House, it is unfair to criticise Members who use this formula.</P>
      <P>Regarding the points mentioned by Senator Manning, as there are many all-party motions on this Order Paper in which many of us have a common interest we ask the Leader of the House, in view of the heavy workload and the fact that he may intend sitting for an increased number of days, is it possible to sit longer hours also to deal with some of the all-party motions particularly in the area of minority rights and the minority religious rights of such people as the Baha' is in Iran and indeed, the Jews in Russia?  Perhaps the Leader of the House will address himself to the problem of trying to deal with them without interfering with his responsibility for getting legislation through the House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Leader of the House ask the Minister for Finance to inform this House on the allocation of moneys from the National Lottery?  Deep concern has been shown publicly, particularly <Col N="799" /> by sporting bodies.  I would appreciate it if the Leader of the House would ask the Minister for Finance to inform this House when allocations are to be made.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask for some information and guidance from the Leader of the House as to when item No. 44 on the Order Paper will be taken, the motion from Senator J. O'Toole and myself which reads:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann in the exercise of the powers conferred on it by section 13 of the undermentioned Act declares that the Extradition (Euro Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, shall not come into operation on the 1st day of December 1987.</P>
      <P>Bearing in mind, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, your own comments on the way in which this House wishes to deal with matters of urgent national priority, it is certainly the view of Senator J. O'Toole and myself that this is a topical matter, it is a matter of some urgency.  It is a matter on which all Members of this House will have a considered and deeply felt view.  I would greatly welcome the opportunity now to go into the reasons why I support it but I anticipate your severe ruling in the matter so I will resist the temptation.  I believe there will be a general acceptance that this is an area of foreign policy in which the Seanad can play an important role.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I associate myself with the question raised by Senator Norris?  In the light of the obvious attempts of a foreign power to influence the decision of the Oireachtas, it is important that the Oireachtas should assert itself, discuss this matter and take its own <Col N="800" /> free and independent decision, uninfluenced by the influences of other countries who seem to think they have a right to rule our affairs.</P>

      <P>I agree totally with the last two speakers and I ask the leader of the House if he can give us an assurance that the representatives of no foreign power will be able to usurp the authority and the democratic process of this State. The last time we had that was in Grattan's Parliament.  I do not know whether any people were offered knighthoods over the weekend but perhaps he could make that point clear to us as well.</P>

      <P>I will start with Senator Manning.  There is a heavy load of business ahead of us and tomorrow morning we will give an indication as to what the order of priority will be over the next couple of weeks.  We will be sitting for three days from now on and it is intended to get through as many of the items on the Order Paper as is possible within the next few weeks, taking into account that we have a certain amount of legislation on the Order Paper already and further legislation will be coming to us in the next few weeks.  It may be that we will deal with Government business on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and, as heretofore, go on on Thursday to deal with reports from committees and anything else on the Order Paper.</P>
      <P>Regarding Senator Ferris' query about all-party motions and other motions on the Order Paper, if he will leave it until tomorrow morning we will give as detailed an answer as possible.  I can guarantee that we will get to all the motions as soon as possible.  I will address Senator Cregan's query in another place. As to the wish of Senators Norris, Ryan and O'Toole to have item No. 44 on the Order Paper discussed, that item will be addressed as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could define &ldquo;a member of a company&rdquo;. I do not think it is defined anywhere in the Bill.  What exactly is meant by &ldquo;a member of a company&rdquo;?  It is not in any of the lists in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no definition in this Bill. Neither is there in the Principal Act of 1963.  It is commonly understood to be a shareholder of a company.  That is the closest I can go to giving a definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that might be the case and I am slightly worried about it.  I am not raising an objection in any sense but reading down through the Bill there are times when it also obviously covers a director.  Does that mean it is only a director who is a shareholder?  I am looking for an assurance from the Minister that there is no problem in the Bill.  Perhaps at a later stage the Minister might bring in a definition that a member of a company is either a shareholder and/or a director.  It might be something that would be worth while doing.  I am not 100 per cent certain of it but it seems to me that there is a slight weakness in later sections on account of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a good point and we certainly will look at it but for the purposes of this section, a member is a shareholder.  A director who is not a shareholder, in my view, would not be a member as such.  That is something I will have a very close look at.  Membership means holding shares in the company. That would seem to exclude a director who does not hold shares.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In places where there is a reference to a member of a company, directors should also be included. Whether that should be done by the inclusion of &ldquo;director&rdquo; at that point in the text or whether it should be done by defining &ldquo;member of a company&rdquo; as a shareholder and/or a director, I do not know.  I do not wish to pursue it any further.  I just raised the point and I ask. the Minister to take it on board.</P>

    <P>Government amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>In page 12, between lines 37 and 38, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  The reference in the Ninth Schedule to the Principal Act to sections 165 to 173 (investigations) of that Act shall be construed as a reference to Part II of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a somewhat technical amendment.  The effect of it is to apply all of the provisions of Part II of the Bill to unregistered companies. However, we are not really doing anything new here since section 377 of the Principal Act of 1963 together with the Ninth Schedule to that Act already apply the existing investigation provisions to such companies.  However section 6 repeals sections 165 to 173 since they are effectively being replaced and expanded on by the provisions in Part II of the Bill. It is necessary now to reapply the new investigation provisions to unregistered companies.  That is the effect of the official amendment.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, the renovation work is becoming quite audible in the Chamber and it is extremely distracting.

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Chair can do about it.  The <Col N="804" /> House and the Members took the option of continuing in this Chamber while the work was proceeding.  We anticipated and we were told that there would be some inconvenience.  We will have to continue for the moment and see whether that is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Bulbulia.  I am a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  This matter was discussed and the inconvenience was being here.  The noise level was discussed separately and we were given an indication that it would be kept as low as possible on sitting days or, if possible, there would not be any.  On the amendment, I recognise that £200,000 is an amount of money which can be easily eaten up by a financial investigation into a company, but it sounds, to me, like too much money to have to put up and I want a number of points clarified.</P>
      <P>Is this to be put in the form of a bond of some description, or is this an actual hard cash amount of money that has to be put up before somebody can seek an investigation of a company?  I agree that the sum of money should not be a mickey mouse amount so that somebody could create aggravation for a company simply by asking for it to be investigated.  There should be a substantial amount of money but I do not think it should be prohibitive, and this is prohibitive.  If the Minister were to ask me why I picked the sum of £50,000 I am afraid I could not give a very cogent response.  I feel that £200,000 is far too high a figure and because the figure is so high it takes from what was intended to be achieved by that section. How was the figure of £200,000 reached? I am proposing £50,000 which is a far more reasonable figure.  I know it sounds like a Dutch auction, that we just move down until we find an acceptable figure, but how many people can put up that kind of money?  I know in a very large company one-fifth of the shareholders would not have a huge difficulty in finding that amount of money.  How is it intended to work?  Is it a bond or actual cash and if it is cash does the Minister think it should be so high?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Those are very good points.  It does not have to be cash, or it does not have to be a bond.  We are trying to give the court the maximum leeway and, as long as the court is satisfied that it is covered for that amount, the court can then decide how to get themselves covered for that amount whether in cash or in bond.  The sum of £200,000 was selected about as scientifically as the Senator's £50,000.  It is a maximum figure.  The court can settle on £50,000, £40,000, or £30,000, or whatever they like.  Secondly it is based on experience &mdash; the best way to base many decisions. A very small and, indeed, infinitesimal number of investigations have been undertaken to date, two since 1963, and the cost involved in those ran to figures of that order.  So it is based on experience. To put an upper limit of £50,000 on it would mean that it might not cover a lot of the costs involved.  But I stress that it is a maximum figure and there is nothing to stop the court taking a more lenient view if they wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the interesting things about this figure is the remarkable unanimity between two very different bodies about it.  I have two submissions in front of me, one from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the other from the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies in Ireland.  There is not an awful lot in both submissions that coincides.  There is more than I expected, but there is not an awful lot.  One of the things they both agree on is the figure.  I fully accept, as I am sure Senator O'Toole does, that there has to be a deterrent to people maliciously seeking investigations into companies.  As that stands it appears to me that bona fide persons seeking an investigation into a company will be legally committed to the procedure before they are aware of the scale of the bond they will have to enter into.  This will deter large numbers of people from even beginning the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, a trade union might have good reason to seek an investigation into a company through an official.  It appears to me, from the way it is worded, that <Col N="806" /> the court will first of all agree to the application for the investigation and will then proceed to fix the figure for which the person will have to give security.  That will mean that people will have no prior knowledge of the scale of the security they will have to give before they are committed to the process of applying for an application.  That of itself will deter people.  That is one of the problems with such a large figure.  If people knew they were operating in the region of Senator O'Toole's figure of nought to £50,000 it gives them an order of magnitude within which to operate.  A figure of nought to £200,000 will deter people because there will be an element of uncertainty all through the early stages of initiating an investigation.  People will not know what scale of security they will have to fix until after they have made the application. That is the problem with such a large figure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Senator's concern about this.  I should put firmly on the record that section 7 (3) says:</P>
      <P>...the court may require the applicant or applicants to give security, to an amount not exceeding £200,000.</P>
      <P>I have to stress that that means the court may decide there is no security at all needed.  They may inform the applicant that they are not in a particular case looking for any security for any number of reasons which will be left to the court. It may be they feel the person has not got the funds; it may be that they are not warranted, or it may be of serious national importance and so on.  There are a number of circumstances one could imagine.  The court can decide to have security lodged up to £200,000 but that also means that the court has the option to decide on not having any security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point the Senator made about the knowledge the person has as to what he or she is getting into before they get into it is a valid one.  The steps would be that the person would apply to the court and, at the stage when the court <Col N="807" /> are deciding whether to appoint the inspector, the court have to decide whether to seek the bond or cash.  At that stage a judgment has to be made by both the person bringing the case and the court.  The court have to decide how much security they should be looking for. They will have to estimate what they think the size of this would warrant. Courts are used to that sort of thing and could take professional advice.  I am happy that a person who feels at that stage that the sum demanded is too great has the option not to proceed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister think about rewording subsection (3) before Report Stage so that it actually says that what will happen is precisely what he described would happen?  I am not too worried about the upper limit of the figure.  I accept the range of discretion. However, the Consultative Committee <Col N="808" /> of Accountancy Bodies says that the possibility of that scale of security may deter people with quite legitimate grievances from seeking redress through the courts.  They may be worried that they will have no way of knowing in advance what is the scale of the commitment of security that will be required. It would be much better if people could have a procedure whereby they would know before they were legally committed to any course of action what was the scale of the security they wanted.  Otherwise people will not be prepared to take the risk.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly consider that matter.  I see certain practical difficulties as to how we might set that up.  It is only when one goes to court and all the evidence is available that the estimates crystalise and one gets an idea of what the likely costs will be.  We would want to make sure that this procedure is available to everybody.  We are talking about companies that are actually in existence.  We are talking about somebody going to court and sending in an inspector which is quite an intrusion and this might or might not be appropriate. Anyone who takes that course of action would want to take it seriously.  It may be a company with large employment and the very fact of such an appointment becoming generally known through the grapevine or wherever might damage that employment.  We have to be very careful about that.  A balance must be maintained to make sure that we scare off vexatious complaints but that we can accommodate serious ones which may not have the funds to facilitate the case being heard.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for that and since he has all the expertise of his own Department and that of the Attorney General available to him he is far more likely to come up with a proper draft than I would.  Therefore, I will leave it to him to have a look at it.</P>

    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="809" /> SECTION 8.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 8 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again the Consultative Committee on Accountancy Bodies raised the question of the intent to defraud in subsection (1) (a) and talked about the difficulty of proving that.  Later on they used the phrase &ldquo;wrongful or insolvent trading&rdquo; as what they would regard as a more provable offence and one that is more open to objective analysis. I take their point.  Anywhere you get involved in a judging intent you are actually as much assessing motives as you are assessing activities whereas wrongful or insolvent trading is based on the facts available to a company at a particular moment.  A company ought to have the obligation, not just to avoid intending to defraud people, but also to avoid reckless behaviour when they know that the company are in or approaching an insolvent position.  The phrase in section 8 about &ldquo;intent to defraud&rdquo; is far too generous in many ways to the company because it is a difficult concept to enforce or to prove and will leave enormous leeway.  When I hear the accountancy profession saying things like that, given their expertise, it is well worth considering whether a different form of words and a more precise offence ought to be inserted to replace that.  Again I ask the Minister to think about it so that what he intends can actually be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the same concern as Senator Ryan on this point and like him I have no answer to the problem. It is simply a difficulty with the phrase &ldquo;intent to defraud&rdquo;.  In so many other parts of the Bill details are specific and clear but this is one where there is great difficulty.  I notice that the consultative accountants group did not come up with any better phrasing when they drew our attention to the difficulties in all of this. I wonder if the Minister and his officials might see before Report Stage if there is some way in which this section could be <Col N="810" /> spelled out a little so that people could have a clearer idea.  I do not have a great deal of confidence that it will be possible to achieve any great improvement on what is there already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On the same point, in the Cork report in Britain, they used the term &ldquo;wrongful trading&rdquo; as a generic term and included as wrongful trading intent to defraud.  One of the ways in which they set about defining what that might be was in a situation where there was clear intent.  I take Senator Ryan's point on this.  I do not know how one can prove intent.  They gave the example of where a company were clearly technically insolvent in the sense that their liabilities were greater than their assets and that they had no prospect of paying off their debts.  If they took on more debts which they clearly were not in a position to pay off that would be seen as wrongful trading.  In other words, if the company were technically insolvent and if they were to liquidate and all their assets were put against their liabilities, they would be in debt and would not be in a position to clear off those debts.  If, at that point they went ahead and took on more responsibility which they could not discharge, that would be seen clearly as wrongful trading. It seems that is nearly a definition of this.  I am not saying it answers the problems raised by the previous two speakers but it is something that could be taken on board, giving at least one or two examples of what might definitely, if proven, be considered to be wrongful trading or intent to defraud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could say in a general way to reassure Senators that every point made by Senators will be taken on board between now and Report Stage because this is, perhaps, one of the most complicated pieces of legislation that has come before either House in many years.  It has been on the stocks for a long time.  Various Governments have had bites at it.  We are now on Committee Stage which is a very technical, difficult stage.  I want to give Senators a general assurance that we need all the input into <Col N="811" /> this legislation that we can get.  It is not political legislation.  It needs every point that is available.  That is the spirit in which I want to see this legislation put through the House.</P>
      <P>Section 8 allows the Minister to apply to the court to put an inspector into a company.  It gives a list of the circumstances in which he may do that. There is a list here of degrees of sinfullness, as it were, and one can draw the line anywhere.  We have chosen to draw the line in three areas.  At the end of paragraph (a) there is the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; which means that the affairs of the company were being conducted or have been conducted with intent to defraud.  That is just one circumstance.  Another circumstance is:</P>
      <P>(b)  that persons connected with its formation or the management of its affairs have in connection therewith been guilty of fraud, misfeasance or other misconduct towards it or towards is members;</P>
      <P>I would interpret &ldquo;or other misconduct&rdquo; as serious wrongful trading.  Perhaps there was a case for inserting this but we will have a look at it.  It goes on to state &ldquo;or&rdquo; that its members have not been given all the information which they might reasonably expect.  We started at the top of the ladder and said that the Minister may go to the courts to have an inspector put in if there are circumstances suggesting fraud, or intent to defraud, or misconduct, or information not being made available to members which might be reasonably expected.  In those three areas there is an escape and I am reasonably satisfied that no Minister or no court would use it lightly.  It is broad enough, particularly the phrase &ldquo;or other misconduct&rdquo;, to allow the Minister to go to the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past it has been very much of a sledgehammer when Ministers have had to consider the appointment of an inspector which has happened on two occasions only since 1963.  Arguably it is much easier for Ministers to decide to apply to the court because the Minister is only <Col N="812" /> initiating it and the court then has to make a decision on it.  I take the points but I am happy that this section allows the Minister, in circumstances suggesting misconduct, fraud and so on, to go to a court of law and seek to have an inspector to be brought in.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Section 9 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 10.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 3:</P>
    <P>In page 14, line 44, to delete &ldquo;account&rdquo;, and substitute the following &mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;account; and in this subsection `bank account' includes an account with any person exempt by virtue of section 7 (4) of the Central Bank Act, 1971, from the requirement of holding a licence under section 9 of that Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 10 (3) as it is presently worded gives the inspectors wide powers in relation to the investigation of a directors' bank account into which money has been paid arising from loans to him by the company which are prohibited under Part III of the Bill, and any transaction between him and the company which is discloseable in the company's accounts under Part III but which was not so disclosed, and any act or omission on the director's part which would amount to misconduct.  However, it has been suggested to me that we would need to ensure that limiting the scope of section 10 (3) to a director's bank account would not allow an unscrupulous director to escape examination merely because he deposited his money in some other similar type of account.  This would probably be an account maintained in financial institutions other than licensing banks, for example, a building society or a credit union.  This is a sensible suggestion and the amendment provides for this by expanding the definition of &ldquo;bank account&rdquo; to include accounts with, for example, the following: the ACC, ICC, Post Office Savings Bank, Trustee <Col N="813" /> Savings Bank, building society, credit union, Industrial and Provident Society, Friendly Society, Investment Trust Company and unit trusts.</P>

      <P>I want to apologise because this question should more properly have been asked under the definitions but the definition that I am interested in is referred to in this section. It is a reference to books and documents. In the definition, &ldquo;books and documents&rdquo; include accounts, deeds, writings and records made in any other manner.  Is the Minister satisfied that includes all forms <Col N="814" /> of computerised records?  In other legislation we have dealt with in relation to records there has been a specific reference to computerised records, electronic data collections, and so on.  I am a little surprised that there was no specific reference in this Bill to electronic data records and so on.  It is implied in the definition but I would like to be assured that the Minister is totally satisfied that that is exactly what the courts will interpret it as.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I share that concern and I wonder if we might not save ourselves a lot of bother at this stage if we could spell out that definition to include all the various items referred to by the last speaker.  I would also like to know from the Minister the basis upon which he can give us this assurance.  It would save us a lot of bother at this stage if that point could be taken on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider putting that phrase into the legislation on Report Stage but perhaps I could remind the Senators of section 3 where it says under &ldquo;Interpretation&rdquo;:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;books and documents&rdquo; and &ldquo;books or documents&rdquo; include accounts, deeds, writings&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>I underline the following phrase:</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and records made in any other manner.</P>
      <P>Records made in any other manner to me include computerisation.  I do not see how that cannot include computerisation but I will certainly ask the legal people to have a look at it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the vagaries of legal interpretation, it might be a simple matter on Report Stage to include these words to preclude any doubt in the future.  Most of our judges are sane and sensible, but there could be the odd occasion when a judge, whose thinking is still rooted in Victorian or Edwardian practice, might refuse to take this sort of thing on board.  Stranger things have happened in the law courts and this is <Col N="815" /> a small insertion which might preclude some trouble later on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I will certainly consider putting in a reference to computers in section 3.  I might insert: &ldquo;records made in any other manner, particularly computerised data&rdquo; or something to that effect.  I would like to make a comment on section 10 because it is important in dealing with the business of bank accounts of directors to say to the directors of companies or those who might want to become directors of companies that we are trying to achieve a balance here.  It is not intended to engage in any sort of witch hunt.  If somebody is invited to become a director of a company he has nothing to fear provided he is behaving professionally and properly towards his customers, creditors, workers and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was getting to that. I want to say to directors that they have nothing to fear.  A number of people have said to me over the past couple of weeks that the fact that their bank accounts can be got at would scare off directors.  I want to stress that directors who obey the law and who go about their business in a professional manner have nothing to fear.  This is designed to prevent abuse of limited liability.  The extension of limited liability is still given to people and it is expected that they will treasure it.  It is intended to prevent abuse so this will not affect the majority of directors who are responsible people.  I want to stress that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are trying to get a balance in this legislation.  I do not want to make it difficult for people to become directors of companies and to go on and create employment by being directors of companies. Someone has to take responsibility and we want to make sure that we have directors who take responsibility. At the same time, it is to weed out the cowboys in the system.  It is important at this stage in this discussion to put that firmly on the record.  Responsible directors have nothing to fear but there is a <Col N="816" /> warning in this Bill from the Oireachtas to the cowboys in the business.  That is the message from the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not going to be a contentious discussion but am I reading in what the Minister says a code for telling directors that, whatever the inspectors discover, they will not tell the tax man? Is it essentially a signal to the effect that we are talking about company law rather than taxation law and any breaches of tax law are not going to be noticed in this sort of investigation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  In section 10 where bank accounts can be got at I am saying that I do not want this to be interpreted by directors as reasons for not becoming directors.  They have nothing to fear provided they are behaving responsibly.  That is my only message. There are other sections dealing with who information can be given to.  Perhaps we will deal with that question under those sections.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of what the Minister has said &mdash; and I welcome his assurance &mdash; I just have a general point which is not specifically relevant to this section.  In many ways it is almost too easy to become a director of a company at present and, on the other hand, many people are frightened away because of the pitfalls.  When this Bill goes through both Houses and finally is law there is a need on the part of the Minister's Department and the various professional bodies involved to ensure that the full duties and responsibilities of directors, as incorporated in this legislation and others, are made clear to people in a way which they can readily understand.  There is a great deal of ignorance at present as to what the duties are and sometimes people who are directors find themselves in trouble not out of any sense of criminality or ill-will but often out of a sheer culpable ignorance as to what their responsibilities were.  I remember talking on an earlier occasion to the Minister on a different Bill in this House and making this same point on the need for Government <Col N="817" /> Departments to ensure that there is the greatest amount of clarity and that the regulations and the responsibilities are as widely known as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse what Senator Manning said.  In the light of what the Minister has stated and bearing in mind that it is Government policy to encourage entrepreneurship, obviously if that policy is to be successful people who involve themselves as directors of companies must be made aware of the law.  It is vitally important because this legislation is so complex and so far ranging in its implications that the Department and the Government have an obligation to ensure that existing directors, but more important potential entrepreneurs, are made fully aware of their responsibilities and obligations under this law.  Might I further suggest that, perhaps at some future stage down the road when this legislation has eventually been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, whenever a company is being registered or whenever a director is registering a business name, a leaflet outlining the more important and relevant aspects of this Bill as they pertain to the obligations and responsibilities of a director is sent out as a matter of course from a particular date.</P>

      <P>I know there are already a large number of people queuing up to write books on the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987, long before it becomes an Act.  There will certainly be plenty of would-be entrepreneurs trying to make a few bob out of the Bill itself.  That will be greatly welcomed.  Secondly, I know a number of seminars are being organised by various professional institutions over a period to make sure professionals are well aware of what is in the Bill.  Thirdly, the debate on this Bill as it goes through this House and through the Dáil will highlight a number of details.  I will take on board Senator Mooney's suggestions about the Companies Registration Office informing people who apply to register companies of their responsibilities.  The important thing to remember is that when people are applying to form a company <Col N="818" /> they do so with proper advice.  The onus is on the people giving the advice to make sure that they are fully briefed.  It is very complicated legislation.  I would not advise anybody to go at it without some professional advice when it comes to the formation of companies.  It is important to get it right from the start.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 11.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 15, subsection (3) (b), between lines 32 and 33, to insert a new subparagraph as follows:&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(ii)  any employee of the company or trade union representing employees in the company.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>From my point of view I have a real, philosophical problem with this section as it stands.  It is a problem which underlines many of the problems in Irish industry today.  Every day we hear about the need for redundancies or about companies or employees being in trouble.  This always creates a very aggravated response from the workers.  At a time when we are discussing the whole area of the social partners, when the Government wish to discuss their books with the general trade union movement in a microcosm, it is fair to suggest that at the end of an investigation, the workers in a particular company would also have access to information on the state of the company. I appeal to the Minister to take this matter on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rights and the responsibilities of the owners of the company also extend to their employees and it would appear to me that an extension of that would certainly be that the workers in the company should know the state of the company. Taking it further than that it is in the interests of good industrial relations that the workers should be made aware of any problems within the company.  I suspect that information concerning the problems that have arisen over the years <Col N="819" /> came out of the blue when management went to the workers and said: &ldquo;We need 40 redundancies&rdquo;.  If the workers were closer to the working of the company, and to the problems of the company and were made to face up to the problems at all levels there would not need to be a unilateral approach to problems.  There could be a multilateral approach in which the workers would take their responsibility for the working of the company, the product of the company and the marketability of the company as well as everybody else.</P>
    <P>By not making this slight amendment to the Bill we are excluding the workers from knowing what is happening in the company.  At that level there is also a question of their right to be aware of their own future prospects.  The workers in a company have a very strong vested interest in making the company work and in making the company successful; the vested interest for them is their future employment and future stability.  I would certainly like to hear the Minister say he will take these points on board and concede that the workers are an interested group.  It would be quite difficult to see a full report from a company which did not in some sense refer to the workers or employees of the company.  It would be a small step.  Applying for that kind of information could only be in the best interests of the company as well as in the workers.  I do not see whose interests would be damaged by adding this.  Taking it from the most selfish point of view there is no group I can think who would lose by taking on board this idea, if not these particular words.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information and in the light of what Senator O'Toole has been saying I ask for clarification of the words in subsection (3) (v):</P>
      <P>any other person whose financial interests appear to the court to be affected by the matters dealt with in the report...</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Just to elaborate on what <Col N="820" /> Senator O'Toole said, it is possible to argue, in the construction that is here, that it would be possible for the employees of a company to receive copies of such a report.  In some ways, this amendment is as much symbolic of a view of the rights of employees as it is actually a necessary legal condition.  Under paragraph (c) the court may, if it thinks fit, cause any such report to be printed and published.  But it may not see fit and it need not make available copies to all the other people either.  The principle here is to recognise that the employees are an important equal partner in the determination and in the concern about the welfare of a company.  Paragraph (6) (v) refers to any other person whose financial interests appear to the court to be affected by the matters dealt with in the report and it goes on to talk about a creditor of the company or body corporate.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that in a definition like that, the employees are not recognised as persons whose financial interests appear to the court to be affected by the matters dealt with.  They are obviously people whose financial interests are vitally affected, probably more so than virtually any creditor.  It is simply a philosophical point to recognise what we all believe to be true, which is that an employee's rights are affected by these things as much as anybody else's and their future and security is affected.  We should simply incorporate that point by recognising them as a vital interest group to whom such information may be made available.</P>

      <P>I agree that generally workers should be made aware of any problems within a company and that they should be aware of the outcome and the workings of any investigation.  I am sure that their interests are covered under subsection (3) (b) (v) and we do not want to make it any more complicated than it already is.  We could go right through the Bill and insert words in every section but, if the Minister can assure me that their interests are protected under that <Col N="821" /> section, I will be reasonably happy with it.</P>

      <P>Part II of the Bill must be taken as a whole when talking about this question, because in Part II there is provision for example, to investigate the proper ownership of the company.  The workers in a company are entitled to know who is the owner.  If there is a question of liquidation workers' claims have got to be established.  There would not be any problem in putting in that provision.  Nowadays it is a regular feature of many companies that wages and conditions are worked out on the basis of consultation and discussion of information made available to the workers. Information such as trading arrangements, profits and losses and so on are put up on graphs for the information of workers.  The political difficulties companies are encountering are very often revealed so I cannot see any great difficulty in putting this provision in, particularly if we are talking about democratising industry to a greater extent.</P>
      <P>For example, if we talk about increasing democracy in local government by reforms, we could not let things go wrong for local government employees and not disclose information to them.  The consumers are covered to some extent when we talk about corporate bodies and, in fact, everybody is covered, with the exception of the worker who actually sells his labour to the company and who is dependent on that for his livelihood.</P>

      <P>The section as drafted says at subsection (3) (b) (v) that a report may be made available to any other person whose financial interest appears to the court to be affected by the matters dealt with in the report whether as a creditor of the company or body corporate or otherwise.  I am happy that that includes employees of the firm.  It can include also many other people who are not named.  For example, it could include the IDA or an individual bank branch.  I am reasonably satisfied that &ldquo;any other <Col N="822" /> person&rdquo; would cover the point Senators are making.</P>

      <P>I have listened carefully to the debate and probably there would not be any disagreement with the points made by the proposer of this amendment. It is a philosophical point and there is an important principle involved.  As in the earlier part on definition, the inclusion of an extra word or two which would recognise by their inclusion the role of the employees and their rights would not damage the Bill.  It certainly would not leave the IDA or other people feeling discriminated against.  It would meet the point made by the proposer and it would strengthen the Bill.</P>

      <P>Following on that point, on what the Minister said and on what Senator Hillery said, I believe that Senator Hillery will see the need better than most people for good industrial relations in any company.  Before his entry into the debate I made the point that I believe good industrial relations are built on this type of thing as well and that I wanted employees brought in for that reason.  In response to the Minister, it could well be said that you might interpret the workers' interests as being included in &ldquo;any other person who has financial interests&rdquo; etc., but you could also interpret it as including some of the other people referred to earlier in the <Col N="823" /> Bill, any member of the company, for instance.  A member of the company need not necessarily be mentioned because a member of the company could be included as a person whose financial interests would appear to be affected by the report.  There is no doubt that every member of the company would be affected financially in the same way as each worker.</P>
      <P>I am asking the Minister why can we not put in employees if we have a special line there for the member of the company? This is an important point.  I am not just trying to push my own amendment. Perhaps the Minister might talk to me about including the words &ldquo;or worker&rdquo; in subparagraph (v) so that it reads &ldquo;any other person or worker whose financial interests&rdquo; and so on.  Could that perhaps be taken on board without creating a new section?  It would not change the section in any remarkable way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Employees are not just another body who might be affected. They are always and on every occasion vitally affected by these activities.  This is where they ought to have equal recognition with the members of the company because in many cases their interests are far more vital and fundamentally at risk than perhaps many members of the company whose livelihoods may not depend on the company.  A member of the company is not necessarily depending on that company for his livelihood, whereas an employee is, by definition, dependent on the company for his or her livelihood. The only proper way to recognise the importance of this investigation to the employee is to enshrine his right alongside the right of members of the company to know what is going on.  Otherwise, we are effectively saying: &ldquo;We recognise that they have an interest, but it is a subordinate interest&rdquo;.  That is not the case. The emphasis within this would look much better and be much better if employees' rights were recognised overtly and not implicitly.</P>

      <P>Subsection (3) (b) (ii) says: <Col N="824" /> any person whose conduct is referred to in the report.  If it was necessary to include in that report some behaviour of a trade union official, would he then be entitled to the information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if a person is referred to in the report, he would be entitled to a copy of it.  Having listened to the discussion, I will undertake to think again about this section.  At the risk of being contentious, and I do not wish to be, I will share some of my thoughts with Senators.  The list, so far, deals with individuals: a member, a person, the auditor, or the applicants.  I have no wish to exclude an employee.  I wish to ensure that a person who works in a company affected by this has access to that information. I would be a little concerned about being over-generous in regard to the general body of employees.  I say that without trying to be contentious.</P>
      <P>The whole question of the company's future is at stake here.  If an inspector goes into a company and makes a report, if that report becomes a major public issue on the financial pages it could bring down the company.  That would not be our wish.  What I am trying to do here is to make sure that any individual who reasonably should have the report can have it.  I do not want to give it to a broad group of people, which would be tantamount to giving it to the public.  I say that, without in any way suggesting that if you give a report to a broad group of employees you could equally give it to a broad group of employers and it could be a major public issue.  It is important to remember that this may be a company that is trading.  The inspector's report may not be so damning; it may be a constructive report.  I am not worried about an employee who is entitled to a report having it, or a member of the company or a person who is mentioned in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder whether Senators really want to make such a report public and whether if you have a large number of employees you are not, in fact, making the report public.  I say that without in any way suggesting that employees by definition <Col N="825" /> would make something public.  We all know that if you make a report available to a large number of people it will become public.  These are comments off the top of my head, rather than having thought about the Senators' debate.  I will consider on Report Stage putting in a reference to &ldquo;an employee&rdquo;.  I will come back to Senators on that.  It is not my wish to exclude individual employees if they wish to have the report, but I am concerned about confidentiality.  The whole future of companies is bound up with the business of what is written in financial papers and elsewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister has said but I am now somewhat baffled by the purpose of this section.  As far as I can see, nowhere in the section is there any enjoinder as to confidentiality. It is just as possible in so far as keeping the report confidential is concerned that some of the other groups who have got it may well have an even greater axe to grind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the other hand some of these groups could leak information. Even in politics things are leaked occasionally.  Even parliamentary party meetings occasionally find their proceedings reported.  I am not clear as to why, if in the first place the wording would allow an employee to make an application to have access to the report, the Minister now seems to be suggesting that this is a discretion and that an employee would not have that right.  I am confused.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Senator's point.  Subparagraph (v) says &ldquo;any other person&rdquo;.  Any other person could be an individual employee.  Under that section an employee could get the report. Senators have impressed on me the need to actually use the word &ldquo;employee&rdquo;.  I am undertaking to rethink this and perhaps insert it on Report Stage, but I am slow to broaden it to a group of people <Col N="826" /> by definition because with any group of people, you are into difficult situations.</P>

      <P>In the light of all that has been said will the Minister confirm that, even if he were to accept the amendment stating &ldquo;an employee&rdquo;, the key words are at the beginning of subsection (3): &ldquo;the court may, if it thinks fit&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;.  Despite the points raised by Senator Manning in relation to confidentiality and the Minister's remarks about the inherent dangers in a wide publication of a report of this nature, the court may decide in its own judgment that the report is not to be published or, indeed, to be given to any of the people listed in this section. Will the Minister confirm that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to reveal a certain suspicion that somehow employees are perhaps less to be trusted than other groups.  We must remember that among the people mentioned here are the applicants for the investigation. There is no reason to believe that, if people have applied for an investigation into a company, they can then be expected to observe total confidentiality if the courts see fit to give them a copy of an inspector's report which perhaps does not reflect well on the company. There is no reason to believe that all the members of the company may take a similar view.  One thing the employees of a company have is a fundamental vested interest in the survival of the company, far more than many of the people referred to here.  People make mistakes, but it is wrong to suggest that the employees are somehow going to be less careful about the information available to them as a group, or to their trade unions as a unit, than other people.  It flies in the face of their self-interest.  Their self-interest is that at all costs the company should survive.  We will find that most trade union members and employees will be singularly unhappy if a company is put into a position, by an <Col N="827" /> investigation like this, where it has to be wound up.  That would not be in their interests.  Therefore, their own interests will dictate that they will behave extremely responsibly because their future is at stake.</P>
      <P>There is a view abroad that Irish employees have been responsible for the closures of a large number of companies. It is a view that has no objective evidence to support it.  So this argument of confidentiality is not a good one on which to exclude the right of the trade unions to have access to a report.  I would be concerned that if the Minister, on the grounds of confidentiality, restricts this right to an employee, he is inherently restricting the right of that employee to make it available to his trade union.  If the Minister does not intend that, he ought to refer to the trade unions as having the same rights as the employee. Otherwise there is no point in simply concentrating on the individual employee.</P>
      <P>The other thing to remember is that this is a matter for the court's discretion. The court may decide not to supply it to anybody.  Does the court have the discretion, if it thinks fit to furnish the report, to choose between the groups listed under paragraph (b)?  Can it give the report to some but not all of those groups?  If it decides to make the report available does it have to make it available to all of the people referred to in paragraph (b)?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will start with the last point.  As I read the section, the court could decide to make it available to some and not all.  The phrase &ldquo;the court may if it thinks fit&rdquo; clearly implies that if it does not think fit it need not give it to a particular person on the list.  It is wise to leave that discretion with the court.  All I can do on Senator O'Toole's amendment is to undertake to have a very close and sympathetic look at it between now and Report Stage.  We are not trying to edge out of this very important involvement of both the trade unions and the employees in a company.  I just ask the <Col N="828" /> Senator to take on board my worry about getting groups involving large numbers of people into legislation.  It could be any class of persons, not just because they are employees.  We are all employees of one sort or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to hear that.  I was determined to push this to a vote, but I am quite pleased with the very positive response from the Minister. I look forward to the Minister taking this on board, and to hearing how he can deal with it on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>I understand the Minister's initial points on this section, but I do not agree that there could be a problem because the vested interests of the workers would militate against any irresponsible action with the report.  I take a great interest in the stock market and in the way it works. It is not unusual for a shareholder investing in two companies to invest in two companies competing with each other. People who dabble in stocks, dabble in an area which they understand, be it oil, industry, or catering.  A shareholder of company A which has just been investigated is entitled to the copy of the report on company A.  If that report reads very negatively about the future trading prospects of company A, that night he will be on to his stockbroker and will sell all his shares in company A and transfer them to company B.  I make that point because, it is certainly privileged information which could be used irresponsibly.  I am not saying it would be but I am just balancing the Minister's initial point.</P>
      <P>The people mentioned here could also be people who could create difficulty for the company by creating a lack of trust or a lack of confidence in their future prospects by leaking that information. The Minister will have to take on board the point made by Senator Ryan that the people with most to lose if the company fold would be the actual employees of the company.  Perhaps that should concentrate our minds on agreeing to include them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point made by Senator Mooney is absolutely right.  The courts may decide not to publish in the very best interests <Col N="829" /> of the company.  I do not have any objection to that.  Decisions have to be made at various times and it could well be that it would be wrong to publish the report and that discretion should be allowed to the court.  I certainly take on board Senator Manning's point that confidentiality should be highlighted a bit more if that is what is intended in this section.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister clear for me the very last sentence in paragraph (b) (v) &ldquo;any other person... as a creditor of the company or body corporate&rdquo;?  Does it mean a creditor of the body corporate?</P>

      <P>I just wanted to clarify that.  I will leave it at that point and look forward to Report Stage.  I see that the Minister makes a distinction between the trade union and the employee.  In all fairness, an employee, perhaps on the ground floor of a company, would very often need the professional advice of his or her trade union before the report would make any sense to him or her, but we do not need to address that point.  If the Minister is prepared to address the point relating to &ldquo;worker&rdquo;, other legislation covers the area I am talking about and I accept that that would be a very good middle point to reach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I will conclude on this section with an observation more than a point.  The points made by Senator O'Toole about shareholders having conflicting interests could unfortunately also be true of the workforce.  It is not inconceivable that we could have a group of workers who were divided in their views about the future of the company and future control of the company and the way in which it should be run.  We have seen examples in this country in recent times of protracted strikes where the workforce were clearly divided on their stance.  I am making this point more or less to say that I have come some part of the way to accepting the complexity of the case and the difficulties which the <Col N="830" /> Minister has raised.  I would like him to reiterate or even to clarify the nature of the confidentiality in all of this.  It is not as black and white as I made it sound in the beginning.  I will finish by saying that the principle enunciated by Senator O'Toole is one I support.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 15, subsection (3) (b), line 39, to delete &ldquo;and&rdquo;, and between lines 39 and 40 to insert the following new subparagraph&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(vi)  the Central Bank, in any case in which the report of the inspectors relates, wholly or partly, to the affairs of the holder of a licence under section 9 of the Central Bank Act, 1971; and&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Section 11 (3) (b) provides that following the conclusion of investigations the court may, if it thinks fit, furnish a copy of the inspector's report to a number of parties.  These parties are listed in paragraph (b) and we have dealt with that.</P>
      <P>The next section we want to amend relates to the question of the Central Bank.  It struck us that, as well as parties with a direct financial interest in the company concerned, where a bank is amongst those whose affairs have been investigated, the Central Bank, as the supervisory authority concerned, would have an obvious interest in the outcome of the investigations.  Thus the amendment would allow the court to give a copy of the inspector's report to the Central Bank in any case where the inspector's report had to do with the affairs of a licensed bank.  It is a sensible amendment where the report has to do with the affairs of a licensed bank that the Central Bank should be included on the list of those who get a copy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise a point here which was made by the Consultative Committee of Accountancy bodies on section 13, on the question of a recouperation from specified persons including the applicants for the investigation of the expenses which arise from the inspector or the inspectors' investigation. There seems to be some sort of on the one hand and on the other hand here, and the end result does not lead to a great deal of clarity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (1) (c) refers to the applicant's liability &ldquo;to such extent (if any) as the court may direct&rdquo;. Under subsection (2) they could be required to make good any deficiency up to the amount which the security given by them exceeds the amount which they have already been required to pay by the courts.  It is the view of the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies that this requirement is unduly onerous, partly because the applicants have, in the nature of things, already suffered considerable losses.  If they make the application in the first place or if they have gone to the trouble of having the investigation started, they have already paid what the court would have deemed to have been their share of the costs of the investigation, the eventual total cost of which is outside their control.  It is the view of this body that, where the investigation will probably be a lengthy one, appropriate provision should be made for payments on account in respect of expenses incurred by third parties carrying out work on behalf of the inspectors.  I am sure the Minister has had this submission and I am sure he has considered it.  I do not have a strong view on this and I would be interested to hear his reaction because <Col N="832" /> they are a responsible and authoritative grouping.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have considered it and my officials have discussed that with the accountancy bodies.  I want to make it clear for the record that in no circumstances will anybody be asked to pay more than the figure of £200,000, if that is the figure set by the court.  In no circumstances will anyone have to pay more than the amount set as the security. If the security is set at £60,000 that is the most you will have to pay.  I appreciate that the wording of section 13 (2) has to be read once, twice or even three times to make that clear because it says: &ldquo;... if the court deems it just and equitable to do so, be required to make good the deficiency up to the amount by which the security given by them under section 7 exceeds the amount, if any, which they have under that subsection been directed by the court to pay ...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That means the shortfall between the security and the actual costs.  It is the shortfall that has to be paid over and the maximum that will have to be paid in any circumstances is the actual security figure of £200,000, £50,000, £60,000 or whatever. Perhaps we could have worded it a little more clearly but that is the legal interpretation of it.</P>

It is a continuous complaint, not just of lay persons like myself, but of skilled and able lawyers, that the language used in legislation is unnecessarily complex.  I have heard very able lawyers in ten seconds redraft sections and make absolutely crystal clear what was intended by the section without losing any of the legal refinements that were necessary.  If competent, professional bodies are misled by the way something is written that is a very good case for rewriting it in a proper and intelligible way.  There is no reason legislation that passes through the Oireachtas should not be intelligible to a person who bothers to read it a couple of times.</P>

      <P>I rise without any great convictions but simply to ask the Minister why not: The intent of sections 14 and 15 <Col N="834" /> is to investigate the true ownership of a company.  That means findings as to fact by inspectors.  I do not have strong feelings on this but the accountancy bodies have suggested that people who feel aggrieved by those findings as to fact ought to have a right of appeal to the courts.  That opens a process of lengthy litigation.  Investigators can make mistakes and they can come to erroneous conclusions.  I do not know if it is ever possible in human affairs to reach absolute certainty.  I do not know any other area of human life where it is possible to reach absolute certainty and I doubt that it is possible here either.  Perhaps the basis for appeal is implied in the section but it is not clearly stated and this leaves people with a reasonable sense of grievance.</P>

      <P>The issue that I spoke about on section 8 arises here.  Section 19 (2) (b) states: &ldquo;... the affairs of the body are being or have been conducted with intent to defraud&rdquo;.  The same questions arises in relation to the difficulty of proving such intent.  Section 8 suggested that a company were guilty of wrongful or insolvent trading in a situation where debts were being incurred without reasonable prospect of their being paid. That seems to be more precise and more capable of being proved and, therefore, more likely to be a deterrent to improper behaviour.  I have long held the view that the most effective deterrent is the likelihood of being caught because the likelihood of being caught involves the likelihood of being penalised.  That depends on the capacity to actually prove that something was being done.  When you get involved in proving intent you are involved in subjective judgments and, therefore, the likelihood of a case being proven is that much less.  I ask the Minister to think again about the wording in that section.</P>

It is a sort of pecking <Col N="836" /> order of wrongfulness where there is fraud, or where the affairs are being conducted for fraudulent purposes, or where they are being conducted in a manner which is unfairly prejudicial to some of its members.  There seems to be enough there to catch most circumstances but I will have a look at the details of the wording.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Reckless trading&rdquo; is not defined by the Bill nor is it defined by any other legislative provision.  Recklessness is a concept known only in the criminal law and in that field there was been a wide divergence of views and opinions as to what form of conduct could be described as reckless.</P>

      <P>Section 21 provides for the confidentiality of any information obtained under section 19, the ministerial power to require production of books and documents, or section 20, entry or search of a premises by warrant.  Broadly speaking, no information or document obtained under those sections may be published or disclosed without the company's previous consent in writing unless (1) it is required for one of five specific reasons generally to do with the commencement of legal proceedings of one kind or another, or (2) it is disclosed to one of the competent authorities listed in section 21 (3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The competent authority listed in section 21 (3) (c) is &ldquo;an inspector appointed under this Act by the Minister&rdquo;. While the Minister will retain some power to appoint inspectors under section 14, the investigation of company ownership, and section 58, the investigation of share dealings, the general function of appointing inspectors to investigate a company's affairs is being moved to the court.  It is as logical to allow relevant information to be disclosed to an inspector appointed by the court under section 7 or section 8 of the Bill as to <Col N="838" /> inspectors appointed by the Minister under section 14 or section 58.  Therefore, the purpose of this amendment is to remove the words &ldquo;by the Minister&rdquo;.</P>

Therefore, the amendment provides that, where any information concerned relates to a licensed bank, the Central Bank will be a competent authority under section 21 (3) and information which would otherwise be confidential may be communicated to them.  The reason the existing paragraphs (f) and (g) are repeated in the amendment is that, because we are adding a new paragraph (h) to the subsection we have to move &ldquo;and&rdquo; which currently appears at the end of paragraph (f).</P>

      <P>With the state of my hair at this stage any hat is comfortable.  The disclosure of information assembled under these sections is obviously something that could be a very serious threat to the wellbeing of a company.  It is a very serious offence and quite rightly is such. In terms of commercial considerations, the future of the company, market confidence in the company and a number of different areas, disclosure of that information is a very serious offence.</P>
      <P>I went looking for the penalty in the section.  The penalty is a fine not exceeding £10,000, or a term of imprisonment not exceeding three years.  Far less serious offences, for example, taking a car without the owner's permission, are subject to far more severe penalties.  The maximum imprisonment for taking a car without the owner's permission, or being in a car knowing it to be taken without the owner's permission, carries a penalty of five years.  Imposing a maximum penalty of three years, as referred to in section 184, has a little bit of the classic idea of a white collar crime being somehow more acceptable and less reprehensible than other forms of crime.  An upper limit of prison sentence of three years for an offence like this completely understates the seriousness of the offence.</P>

      <P>I do not imply that there is any impropriety in this but considering the kind of fees that the economist research service charge people for far less sensitive information, and information that is often public knowledge but which somebody has assembled, £10,000 could be a very minor consideration in terms of the commercial value of material like this.  I do not want to preclude discussion on section 184 but there are generalised penalties specified for a range of offences.  I have one gone through the Bill and identified each offence covered by section 184 but this offence seems to be one of such gravity that it ought to carry a greater fine.  Perhaps the Minister could consider between now and Report Stage the possibility of introducing a penalty considerably in excess of what is in the section and a prison sentence of up to five years.  Five years &mdash; which in terms of the Criminal Justice Act has a particular intent &mdash; is far more representative of the seriousness of the offence.  I do not want to enter into a long discussion on this but it is a very serious offence.</P>

      <P>Various references are made throughout Part III of the Bill which we are now moving into, starting with section 24, to &ldquo;recognised&rdquo; banks. Section 24 (1) defines the term &ldquo;recognised bank&rdquo; as the holder of a licence under section 9 of the Central Bank Act, 1971.  It has been pointed out to me that the term &ldquo;licensed bank&rdquo; would be the more normal term when referring to the holder of a bank licence and this amendment makes the necessary change in section 24 which contains definitions for the purposes of Part III.  The term &ldquo;recognised bank&rdquo; is used in sections 32, 33, 36, 38 and 39, which are all in Part III of the Bill and consequential amendments are necessary to change the term in those sections to &ldquo;licensed bank&rdquo; also.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 24, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be subject to your ruling on this but I am talking about section 24 in the context of the objectives of Part III.  The Explanatory Memorandum reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part III of the Bill contains a series of detailed provisions to deal with recognisable situations where a company director might be tempted to put his personal interest before that of the company.  The main emphasis in this Part is on the question of loans to directors and other similar transactions... The Bill proposes, subject to certain limited exceptions, to prohibit all companies, both public and private, from making loans in excess of £2,500 to their own directors and members of their families or to other companies in which those persons have a controlling <Col N="842" /> interest and, in addition, to require them to disclose in detail any loans made.</P>
    <P>It refers there to all companies, both public and private but in section 24 (1) (e), a &ldquo;relevant company&rdquo; is defined as meaning:</P>
    <P>a private company limited by shares which fulfils at the date of the last annual accounts any two of the following conditions &mdash; (i) the amount of its turnover exceeds £2,500,000, (ii) that its total assets exceed £1,250,000, (iii) the average number of person employed by the company in the financial year to which the last annual accounts relate, which average number must be certified by the auditor of the company, exceeds 50.</P>
    <P>That means that any company which does not meet two of those three conditions is not covered by the provisions of Part III.</P>
    <P>The number of companies that do not meet those conditions in the manufacturing area amount to thousands. According to the figures supplied to me by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, approximately 80 per cent of all manufacturing companies in Ireland employ fewer than 50 people.  There are over 2,000 small IDA grant-aided companies with fixed assets of less than £500,000. Therefore, a large number of private companies are exempted from the provisions of Part III, or I am missing something in Part III, or the Explanatory Memorandum is missing something.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that large numbers of companies of the kind most lay people associate with a lot of malpractice in the area of company activities are actually exempted from the provisions of Part III which, as the memorandum says, are to do with situations in which a director might be tempted to put his own interest before that of the company.  For example, all the smaller builders who have gone into liquidation under very dubious circumstances, that half the country must have experience of at this stage, are companies which would come within the terms of paragraph (e) and, therefore, <Col N="843" /> would be exempted from the controls and provisions of Part III.  I would like to ask the Minister why this is so.  I know the reason has to do with the provisions of other company legislation about disclosures, and so on, but this is in relation to malpractice and people misusing their positions as directors of a limited company with all the privileges that implies.  I can see no good reason why all companies should not be covered by the provisions of this Part.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with loans, it includes all companies.  It is in relation to the more legal area of quasi-loans and credit transactions that the threshold has been suggested, the threshold of turnover of £2.5 million, total assets of £1.25 million and the number in regard to those employed.  Those thresholds are taken broadly from the Fourth Directive type of thresholds.  The only explanation I can give is that in the area of quasi-loans and credit transactions it is very much a pragmatic and practical type of approach to the thousands of companies that exist &mdash; very small private limited companies. It is one thing to forbid loans and to make some attempt to police it, but there was a feeling that it would not be practical to attempt to get involved in the whole area of quasi-loans and credit transactions, involving thousands of companies with perhaps thousands of transactions but that we should start by tackling the straightforward loan and that we would have some chance of policing that.</P>
      <P>This is a practical approach to what we can police.  We felt there was no point in bringing the legislation into disrepute by laying down something we had no chance of policing in the short term unless we invested substantial resources in it.  It is a matter of doing the best we can on the loan front without getting into the other area which is an endless piece of string &mdash; it is hard to know where it stops and where it starts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the commonsense and logic behind what the Minister is saying at one level but, even if the resources are not available to police <Col N="844" /> such a provision in the case of every company, does it not seem reasonable in a situation where a company fails because of the carry ons referred to here, quasi-loans and things like that, that at least those in the company who are responsible for that are guilty of an offence under company law even if it is only in a <i>post hoc</i> situation, that when a company has failed and this sort of information becomes available after the event at least those who have behaved in this way would be guilty of an offence?  Even if we do not have the resources to police it and enforce it in a way that can prevent such happenings, can we not at least ensure that people who do these sorts of things are guilty of an offence?</P>
      <P>If these quasi-loans did not affect a company's capacity to trade and to operate within the law, we would not be worried about them.  I must presume that those sorts of things are ways of impinging on the capacity of a company to trade properly and, in the long term presumably, threatening the interests of creditors and employees.  If those things are wrong, we can at least ensure that when they are done and they cause a company to collapse, the people who are responsible for doing them are guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>As it stands, if a company of that scale is jeopardised by this sort of practice the people who do it are not guilty of an offence.  That is not to say that it would be possible to police, according to my figures, of the order of 75,000 plus private companies in the country.  I am not saying that.  What I am saying is that if those things are wrong, they should be wrong for everybody.  Even if it is not possible to police all of those companies in advance at least where companies collapse and those sorts of practices emerge, people should be guilty of an offence and that is all that would be involved in deleting these exemptions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no major problem with this provided it is sensible for us to actually make it stick.  Just to be clear, the only authority that can pursue an offence would be the authorities, the <Col N="845" /> State, so that in making it an offence, it would be putting quite a burden on the State to try to police and pursue and take action.  The point which the Senator makes is a valid one and certainly worth thinking about of the case where an offence is presented to you, where it is a fall out from a situation and it is on your plate, then obviously you can police that one because it is there waiting to be policed. It is a fine judgment as to whether you should have a piece of legislation which, quite frankly, we are unable to police for a considerable time and whether you just enact it on the basis that if one turns up then you chase it.  I am not sure whether that is the wisest way to look at the legislation at the moment.</P>
      <P>That is a point we should make to Senators generally, and this is very much a matter for Senators and Deputies to think about.  We are talking about some practices in very small companies which might be tightly held and might be owned by a family, might have perhaps little or no employment and one has to ask the question whether, say, a simple thing like extending a credit card to a member of a company like that, in fact, is what we want to spend our time chasing.  It is a general question as to whether that detail in small companies is actually wise or necessary at this stage, or whether we should content ourselves to make progress on the loan front.  Most Senators would be aware of very small companies with little or no employee content, whether it is essential to police that type of situation, which is what including quasi-loan and credit transaction would mean in a company with perhaps only a family working, that you could perhaps have no credit transactions or no quasi-loans within that structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am just wondering whether that is practical from a business point of view and indeed, in effect, if we could police it, if we were to make such a regulation that the smallest possible company which might be a man and a wife in a local shop and maybe a girl who comes in the morning, and if he pays one of her bills or extends her a credit card that, in fact, becomes an offence, or whether we need <Col N="846" /> to set up that kind of paper tiger.  I have my doubts at this stage as to whether we should leave that alone and confine ourselves to this.</P>

      <P>Those of us who have looked at this section have come up with the same difficulty.  I must say I agree with the points made by Senator Ryan and, at the same time, I dislike the idea of bringing in a law that might not be enforced.  I do not like the idea of just presenting legislation that might hit or miss that we could apply at some stage. At the same time, I agree with the point that he is making and I support it.</P>
      <P>I have researched this fairly thoroughly and I have come up against the same problems about the size of the company. On the day I was reading about this thing I was collecting my car from the garage. The garage is a middle sized company and it has roughly ten to 15 employees. One of the senior employees &mdash; I think he is the foreman &mdash; was talking to the owner and he said: &ldquo;I am stuck.  I want to change cars myself.&rdquo;  I knew both of them.  They came to an arrangement and it struck me that here was a sort of privilege being extended to somebody within the company who could, in fact, also come under this section.  I felt that was not really what I wanted.  I accept that there is a difficulty in trying to achieve what I would like to achieve here without handcuffing companies in many ways. The Minister's assurance is important in terms of the attitude of the State and what is intended to be covered by the company.</P>

We are probably one of the best or worst countries in the world at not enforcing so much of the legislation which we research very carefully or copy from other countries, debate very thoroughly and then ignore in practice.  I believe that the success of this Bill will <Col N="847" /> depend on the capacity of the State and those appointed by the State acting for the State to police it effectively.</P>
      <P>The Minister has raised a central point and that is the whole element of commonsense. Like Senator O'Toole, it is difficult to distinguish between laws which should be enforced in full or should be enforced in part, or should not be enforced at all.  We should not be in that business.  Nonetheless the Minister's distinction is a very valid one.  If we end up with armies of inspectors going around the country making life even more difficult for people in small businesses because a credit card of some privilege of this sort was extended, the whole spirit of this Bill will have been defeated and, much as I dislike saying so, I suspect that the success of this Bill or otherwise will depend, to a large extent, on the discretion and the commonsense of those who are in charge of enforcing it.  They live in the same world as the rest of us. They will have to be aware that it is easier, very often, to go after the small person who does not have the benefit of expensive financial advice, who does not have a series of degrees and consultants and whiz kids to tell him or her how to evade the law.  It is much easier, as we can see from the very small number of cases brought by the fraud squad over the years, to go after the small person.  It is much more difficult to go after, or at least to succeed with the big evader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point made by Senator Ryan about penalties is one to which we will all have to address our minds later on in this Bill because it raises fairly fundamental questions about equity in our whole legal system.  I take the Minister's point very much on this.  If we end up with a situation where the administration of this law is aimed at the smaller people because it is easier to get convictions and so forth, the whole purpose of the Bill will have failed. I am reluctant to give my consent, for what it is worth, to a Bill which will, I believe, depend to a great extent on the commonsense, integrity and discretion of those operating it.  It will be inevitable in this case in some parts of this Bill and I <Col N="848" /> am glad the Minister has brought this particular example to our attention.</P>

      <P>In relation to the section dealing with loans to directors, I will quote from the Small Firms Association Newsletter:</P>
      <P>Part III of the Bill deals with transactions involving directors. Section 31 prohibits companies from making loans (direct or indirect) to directors.  Section 32 of the Bill provides for technical exemptions to the effect that a sum of £2,500 may in certain circumstances be loaned by a company to one of its directors.  In certain other limited circumstances a director may benefit to the tune of £10,000 where the expenditure has been specifically approved by a general meeting of the company.  Firstly, it is suggested that the general exception of £2,500 is too low and, secondly, the condition attaching to larger exemptions are unduly restrictive particularly in the case of small companies.</P>
      <P>Basically, I might be jumping the gun a little on section 31 and section 32 but, if we get into the policing of small companies, I take the Minister's point, it will be very difficult but, also on the other hand, Senator Ryan has stated that there seems to be a lot of cowboy mentality in companies employing fewer than 50 people. That is a problem we will have to address. I know quite a number of examples where perhaps five, six or seven people are employed in a company.  They go into receivership or liquidation and they start off a new company the following week. That is one thing the Bill has to try to get rid of.</P>

      <P>In dealing with small companies and the limit of £2,500 loans to directors of small companies, as other Senators have said, this seems to be a little bit restrictive, but we must accept that the issued paid up share capital is for the productive use of the company.  This legislation recognises the need to curb <Col N="849" /> the abuse of directors borrowing indiscriminately from the company.  Is the £2,500 an arbitrary figure or is there any room to move on that figure?  Could it be, say, a £10,000 loan, or 10 per cent of the issued share capital, or 10 per cent of the net assets, whichever might be the lowest of these three figures?  We do not want to restrict small company directors because this country will be depending a lot on the development of small industry. The limit of £2,500 may be a little bit restrictive.  A repayment schedule should be registered within the company, a clear repayment schedule put down, agreed and listed to ensure that directors have a clear intention of repaying any such loans borrowed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will start by confessing to the fact which must be obvious from my contribution that I am no expert in this area.  I am, therefore, presuming that the fact that there is so much detail entered into here about loans and quasi-loans, which is not presumably contained in earlier companies' legislation, means there must be considerable evidence that this area of loans and quasi-loans is an area in which there is <i>prima facie</i> evidence of considerable abuse in the past. If there was considerable abuse and if this abuse was at the expense of other people &mdash; usually the creditors &mdash; you have to wonder about where this abuse took place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I strongly suspect &mdash; it was Senator Reynolds who said it &mdash; that companies who employ over 50 people and companies with assets exceeding £1,250,000, or a turnover exceeding £2,500,000, are not by and large cowboy companies.  They are real companies.  They are in the business of trading and, therefore, any area where they loan money to directors is probably relatively acceptable in the sense that it is probably a reasonable reward for considerable expertise and <Col N="850" /> effort contributed by a company.  But they are told they cannot do that because of our fears, apparently, about the abuses to which this could be put.  The sort of companies that tend to abuse these sort of privileges &mdash; none of us I suppose has any empirical evidence on this, but most of us would suspect &mdash; are companies that are exempted from this legislation.  I appreciate that nobody, including myself, wants every small family firm to feel there is an inspector from the Department descending to see if they are meeting the law.  One must remember that in the area of VAT, taxation and so on, all of those companies have to live with the fact that everything they do is subject to rigorous and detailed cross-checking by various agents of the State and, in particular, by the Revenue Commissioners. Therefore, the experience of having to justify all decisions about how they earn revenue, taxation provisions and so on is something they are quite familiar with.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any reason a private small company operating within the law should have anything to fear from this legislation. On the other hand, I will be quite happy to talk about small companies and reduce it down to ten employees, reduce each of the figures by a factor of five down to 500,000 and 250,000 or something like that.  It is not good enough that those who drafted this Bill, and many of those who wanted this sort of legislation introduced, should exempt the scale of companies which most of us suspect are most liable to abuse limited liability.  Limited liability is an extraordinary privilege given to encourage people to take risks, to encourage enterprise, wealth creation and, as a consequence of that, to encourage job creation.  It is not something people should be allowed to take for granted.  It is an extraordinary privilege and, therefore, it is reasonably legitimate for the community to expect high standards from people who are granted that privilege.  That is why, according to the ICTU, we should not leave 80 per cent of manufacturing industry in this country exempted from it.  I know that, by and large, it will not be in the area of manufacturing <Col N="851" /> industry that many of these abuses will take place but I am still not convinced that there is not a formula by which the number of exemptions could be substantially reduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the views of Senator Ryan.  This type of legislation, does not come on the stocks very often. It is a very difficult and complex area and we must appreciate that.  If we do not get hold of the nitty-gritty as best we can when the Bill is being discussed, it will be a long time before we will get an opportunity to put things right.  If you make exemptions to the law, as it were, by a form of acquiescence in the way you word something, eventually the law breakers shall become as powerful as the people who are keeping the law and, maybe, exceed them to some extent.  We have seen that in other directions.  I support the idea of getting into this Bill as much as possible at this time.  It will be many years before we get an opportunity to deal with the company law.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's difficulty and his advisers' difficulties from the point of view that you have to consider the safety of generalities in many cases. Because of the nature of this type of law it will not be possible to bring in enabling legislation or to fill any vacuum left as a result of this legislation.  Consequently it must be done now.  I ask the Minister to think seriously about it between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Ryan I am no expert on company law.  In a sense it is a learning process for me.  I ask the Minister to clarify section 24 (1) (e) which states:</P>
      <P>a private company limited by shares which fulfils at the date of the last annual accounts any two of the following conditions&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the amount of its turnover exceeds £2,250,000,</P>
      <P>(ii)  its total assets exceeds £1,250,000,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="852" /> Does this infer that the subsequent parts of Part III in relation to loans and quasi-loans would not apply to the large majority of companies with a turnover substantially less?  That seems to be my reading of it.  Does this section apply to a company owned by a husband and wife, or indeed, by an individual, a small operating private company which would not have a turnover of that nature?  They could in a sense give loans or take loans from the company.  Finally, as I was coming into the Chamber I heard a reference to £2,500.  Could the Minister confirm that this comes under section 32 and not section 24?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the last of Senator Mooney's points first.  It applies to loans in private companies no matter how big or how small.  Under this legislation they are forbidden from making loans in excess of £2,500.  In that regard I would like to say to Senator O'Toole and to Senator Ryan that I appreciate their desire to tidy up the whole matter. I would have to ask: how far we are moving and how quickly?  That is a practical plea in the sense that what we are doing here for the first time ever is saying that no company can make a loan of more than £2,500 to its members.  That is a big step.  We are going another step and saying that not only can they not make a loan, but in all public companies and in the large private companies and the medium sized private companies they cannot make a quasi-loan or a credit transaction &mdash; that is paying for somebody's house or giving them a credit card. The 80 per cent exclusion figure for manufacturing industry is a little misleading in the sense that the number of companies might be large.  In fact, some of the largest companies are private and are not on the Stock Exchange.  I can think of one supermarket which is a major operation but privately owned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definition of private does not necessarily mean small.  While 80 per cent of companies are out of it the bulk of the turnover in sales and economic activity of the country is captured.  We are going a long way by saying that no company <Col N="853" /> can make a loan of over £2,500 and furthermore that no large private company or no medium sized private company can make a loan or, indeed, a quasi-loan or a credit transaction.  We are not interfering with quite a large number of small companies. We think that saying to them that for the moment they cannot give loans is enough without making unreasonable requests.</P>
    <P>I understand that advances have been made in UK company law in recent years. This section is broadly similar.  We go a step further in that the UK confine it to public companies only in regard to the quasi-loans.  They do not go after the private company in that regard.  We go after the large private company whereas they go after only the public company.  It is important to remember that we have gone as far as the UK legislation in supervising any abuse in that area and we have gone a step further.  It is enough at this stage.  Wearing my hat as trade Minister in this House, two thirds of our exports come from large foreign companies.  It is important to that section of small companies we are trying to entice into exporting, marketing and developing the economy that we do not smother them completely with regulations which (a) we cannot enforce and (b) would just take up their time.  In the vast majority of cases it is only chasing paper around because they are small tightly held companies and it does not make much sense chasing credit cards and various subsidies they have amongst the members of a family.  That does not make much sense at this stage.  I do not want to smother a whole range of small companies with unnecessary big stick stuff.  That might not be necessary at this stage.  We have gone far here in saying they cannot make loans over £2,500.  This is the first time this was done and it is a major step forward, but you cannot try to pick up every small company that has extended this facility to one of its members.  That is too heavy handed of the State.</P>
    <P>Those companies should be allowed to grow and get to a stage where they have additional civil responsibilities.  They <Col N="854" /> have civic responsibilities at that level but they have additional and more far reaching ones when they get up and running. They are not as tightly held and, therefore, they have more public accountability than perhaps the tightly held small family owned company with two or three people in it.  It is unnecessary and quite impossible to get into that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to keep us here all night.  The problem is that the abuse in this area is almost definitely going to be in the area that is excluded from the provisions of the Bill.  I do not believe there are many companies exceeding the criteria mentioned in paragraph (e) who are going to get involved in dubious practices.  When people get involved in the scale of investment where they have assets of £1,250,000, and have 50 employees &mdash; they are not big companies by international standards &mdash; they have considerable levels of expertise on investment, and &ldquo;foostering&rdquo; around with dubious transactions to help out directors is not really going to be a serious business.  The area of abuse will be small companies set up by people with very dubious intent.  That is what I am concerned with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully sympathise with what the Minister is saying.  Small companies should not be tied up in unnecessary regulations drawn up by people like ourselves who will never have to live with them afterwards. I accept that but suggest that the Minister should consider taking to himself power by regulation to change those criteria as circumstances permit over the years.  There would be no concession in principle.  Apart from anything else, if we had a bout of severe inflation the figures for turnover and assets, particularly for turnover, could easily be exceeded if we had a revision to some of the years of bad inflation we had in the past.  Quite a large number of companies the Minister currently does not intend to be covered by this legislation would, without any real change in the circumstances, be taken into it.  I suggest that he should consider taking to himself power to alter those <Col N="855" /> figures by regulations as circumstances develop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>For purposes of clarification about the definitions in this section, subsection (7) on the coming into force of this Part is a slightly complex section.  I wonder if the Minister would elaborate on the meaning of it and when it will enter into force in relation to arrangement of transactions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 24 (7) provides that with one exception the provisions in this Part which prohibit the various transactions involved do not apply to any arrangement or transaction entered into before the section comes into force.  The reference to sections 36, 38 and 39 make it clear that, although the prohibitions will not have retrospective effect, the provisions in those sections requiring retrospective disclosure in company accounts will nevertheless apply to transactions which occurred before the enactment of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As mentioned above this subsection provides one exception to the rule that Part III does not retrospectively prohibit any loans or credit transactions, and so on.  This exception relates to an arrangement &ldquo;to which section 31 (3) or (4) applies&rdquo;.  These deal respectively with assignments of liability and with back to back transactions.  In those cases the transaction to which the arrangement relates, even if it was entered into before Part III comes into operation, will be deemed to have been entered into after that date.  This means that an assignment or a back to back transaction related to a loan entered into before the Bill comes into force will be caught.  Accordingly, for example, if a person wholly independent of a company were to make a loan to one of its directors before Part III comes into force, and after that day the company were to enter into an arrangement whereby the creditors' rights were to be assigned to it, for example, the loan transaction would in accordance with the <Col N="856" /> subsection be deemed to have been entered into after the coming into effect of Part III with the result that the arrangements would be in breach of the prohibition in subsection (3) of that section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having recovered my breath after having made a fool of myself, section 43 does not give the Minister any power to alter the numbers of employees. So we are simply talking about an inflation proofing for the future.  It will not guarantee that, as circumstances develop, as information comes that abuses are being carried on, the scale of companies involved can be reduced.  I accept, of course, that if subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of paragraph (e) were substantially reduced, two of the three conditions would be met.  I do not suspect that is the intention or that it will happen. I still think that, since the intention is to deal with people who abuse the privilege of limited liability, we should as a community empower the Minister to extend these controls to the extent that circumstances dictate.  As long as we have a minimum of 50 employees we are providing a large area of exemption for people.  I think it is in the area where the exemptions are provided that most of the abuses have taken place in the past.  That is my final word on it.  I will think about an amendment for Report Stage in the meantime.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Senator on his excellent recovery.  The Senator is correct in what he says about section 43.  It deals only with financial limits; it does not deal with the numbers employed.  I would still argue that that allows the Minister of the day to bring in increasingly smaller and smaller companies. If the Senator looks back at section 24 (e) he will see that it says any two of the following three, so if the Minister particularly wanted to use this device to bring in small companies he would have to change the financial limits under paragraphs (e) (i) and (e) (ii).  That would automatically bring in small companies, irrespective of the numbers <Col N="857" /> employed, because they only have to have any two of the three covered.  You could do it that way if you wished.  My attitude to this is that we have prohibited loans over £2,500 for every company no matter how big.  We should see how that works and, if necessary, the Minister of the day can always use that section, to bring in increasingly smaller and smaller companies.  Let us start with companies we are deciding on and if it proves necessary then we can tighten the noose.</P>

      <P>On a point of clarification, as I understand it this is to extend the scope to cover what the Explanatory Memorandum describes as shadow directors. In relation to subsection (2), I am not clear why the definition of a connected person would be a director of a company associated with the body corporate if, but only if, he and the persons connected with him, together, are interested in shares comprised in the equity share capital of that body corporate. It is accumulative test, in other words it must be both the director and the persons connected with him.  There may be a straightforward explanation of this but it seems that the test is a somewhat narrow one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (2) (a) defines two concepts for the purposes of various provisions in Part III, first, when a director of a company is to be regarded as associated with the body corporate and, secondly, when a director would be deemed to &ldquo;control a body corporate&rdquo;. Subsection (1) already provides that, if a director of a company is associated with another body corporate, that body corporate is a connected person of the director. Subsection (2) (a) which is the one the Senator raised stipulates how a director of a company is to be regarded as <Col N="858" /> being associated with the other body corporate. It lays down two alternative tests for determining this issue.  A director will be associated with any body corporate with which either test is satisfied.  The first test of association applies where a director of a company together with any persons connected with him or her are interested in at least 20 per cent of the issued share capital of the company, or are able to control at least 20 per cent of the voting power at any general meeting of the company.  Subsection (4) applies certain rules for determining whether a person has an interest in shares.  I do not know if that informs the Senator in any way.</P>

If the spouse of the director of the company was the person who was interested in the shares, that would not seem to be sufficient for the purposes of subsection (2) (a).  The only point I am making on this is that the director of the company and the persons connected with him must be interested in the shares comprised of the equity share capital.  There may be a good reason for it but I would like to be clearer on what that reason would be.  Will he be a director of a company associated with the body corporate if he does not have an interest but his wife has an interest?</P>

      <P>The amendment inserts the definition of a non-cash asset and net assets for the purposes of section 28.  Essentially, section 28 requires the approval of a general meeting for substantial property dealings between a company and its directors.  The kind of transaction involved would be the transfer of a non-cash asset if its value exceeded either £50,000 or 10 per cent of the company's net assets, whichever was less, subject to a limit of £1,000.  The section applies whether the director involved acquires such assets from the company or the company acquires them from him or her.  As for the definitions themselves, these are on the lines of definitions of these terms which already appear in the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1983, section 2 (1) and section 2 (4).

      <P>A company is only bound to secure shareholder approval for an arrangement where the non-cash asset forming the subject matter of the arrangement is of the requisite value, that is, if its value exceeds either £50,000 or 10 per cent of the amount of the company's relevant assets, whichever is the lesser, with a minimum threshold of £1,000.  The relevant assets for the purposes of the 10 per cent limit are the net assets shown in the company's accounts for the last financial year before the arrangement was made, unless no such accounts have been prepared and laid in which cases they are the amount of its called up share capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should note that a non-cash asset cannot be of the requisite value if its value is less than £1,000.  Accordingly, it is unnecessary for the company to seek approval for what would be relatively minor transactions.  As to the figures themselves, £50,000 and so on, it is obvious that picking any such figure for a section like this, having regard to the previous sections, was very much a matter of judgment and we could quite easily move the figures around or argue them.  All that can really be said about it <Col N="862" /> at this stage is that it seems a suitably sized sum.  It is a considerable amount of money and it is considered that shareholders should be told about a transaction of that size.</P>
    <P>A sum of £50,000 would be the absolute top limit for arrangements which would not have to be notified.  Ten per cent of the company's assets could well amount to less than that, in which case this limit would apply.  To build a figure into legislation without arrangements for it to be changed would be unsatisfactory. That again brings us back to the point I made earlier that section 43 allows the Minister to change the figures, as necessary. The figure is somewhat randomly selected but it seems to us to be a sensible figure.  It is only above that figure that you have to go to inform the shareholders at a general meeting.  We tried to keep a balance between making sure that the shareholders are fully informed and the need not to strike at an enterprise.</P>

For example, it is not clear whether it means a company on the full Stock Exchange, or whether it will include, for example, a company dealt with on the unlisted securities market, the USM, or <Col N="863" /> indeed the new market, the small companies market.  We would obviously like to have the widest possible coverage of this section.  The wording of the proposed amendment was prepared in consultation with the Stock Exchange authorites. Thus the action will now apply to the purchase of options by a director of a company of any shares which are dealt in, in any way, on the Stock Exchange, whether the dealing involved relates to the full official listing, the USM or the SCM or to any other Stock Exchange dealing facilities.  We want to get the widest possible application of the section.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to remove subsection (2) which we consider to be unnecessary. Section 29 penalises the dealing by directors of a company in options or shares of their company which are dealt with on the Stock Exchange.  Section 30 extends the prohibition involved to spouses and children of such directors.  By virtue of section 26 (1), which we have already dealt with, the prohibition in section 29 applies also to shadow directors of a company. In other words, they cannot deal in the options either.  The purpose of section 30 (2) is to provide that a person who is a shadow director under section 29, would also be a shadow director under <Col N="864" /> section 30.  However, subsection (2) is unnecessary since all of the provisions of Part III, including sections 29 and 30, apply as much to shadow directors as they do to normal directors.  For that reason we wish to remove that subsection.</P>

If there was just one exemption I could probably compile it but there are a lot of exemptions here. There are exemptions from the quasi-loans, credit transactions and there are the various thresholds.  Under each threshold, in theory, you could have different companies exempt.  I do not have a figure. It is obviously an important figure, and I will certainly put some work into it between now and Report Stage and I will try to get that information to the Senator.</P>

If we deal with it just on the number of companies, there is the old 80:20 rule which seems to apply here as it does in all walks of life, in that 80 per cent of the business is probably undertaken &mdash; and this is guesswork &mdash; by 20 per cent of the companies.  It is the amount of activity <Col N="865" /> which we are after here.  It is not meaningful to worry about the actual number of companies.

      <P>In page 33, lines 24 and 25, to delete &ldquo;director or, in the case of a guarantee or security, the amount guaranteed or secured&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;person to whom the quasi-loan was made&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a technical drafting amendment.  This amendment changes the definition of &ldquo;amount outstanding&rdquo; which is contained in the last clause of section 32 (2).  This subsection contains a particular exemption from the prohibitions in section 31 for quasi-loans for directors.  Essentially, the purpose of the exemption is to enable quasi-loans to be made to a director for a period of up to two months, provided the amount outstanding in any given case does not exceed an aggregate of £1,000.  In the definition of &ldquo;amount outstanding&rdquo; we say that in the case of a guarantee or security it is the amount guaranteed or secured.  However, the exemption in this subsection is designed solely to allow a relevant company to make a quasi-loan and not to allow such a company to enter into a guarantee or security.  For this reason reference in the definition to &ldquo;amount outstanding&rdquo; is all that is necessary and &ldquo;in the case of a guarantee or security&rdquo; is superfluous and should be deleted.  That is precisely what this amendment does.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>Larger classes, less pupil-teacher contact, a worsened pupil-teacher ratio, thousands of redundant teachers, later recognition and diagnosis of learning problems, no prospects for those at present in colleges of education, and a damaged school administration structure being the inevitable and regressive consequences of the Minister for Education's proposals as outlined in Department of Education circular 20/87 are unacceptable to Seanad Éireann which now calls for the immediate withdrawal of the circular.</P>
      <P>In moving the motion I would like to read into the record my regret that the Minister for Education has not seen fit to show up here tonight.  In a sense these proposals are so indefensible that I do not blame her for not showing up.  Perhaps it will at least keep the debate on a more rational level because at present teachers, parents and pupils are absolutely incensed at the total disregard the Minister and the Department have shown for them in the new figures put forward in circular 20/87 from the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>Larger classes, less pupil-teacher contact, a worsened pupil-teacher ratio, thousands of redundant teachers, the later recognition and diagnosis of learning problems, no prospects for those in colleges of education and a damaged school administration structure are just some of the inevitable and regressive consequences of the Minister's proposals as outlined in the Department of Education circular 20/87.  They are unacceptable and should be unacceptable to the Members of this House who now call for the immediate withdrawal of this circular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that many of my colleagues on the Government side of the House feel as badly about this as I do.  Unfortunately, <Col N="867" /> the exigencies of political life will stop them from saying what they would like to say.  I will read into the record the effects these proposals will have on the schools in the localities of many of the Fianna Fáil Senators in this House.</P>
    <P>It is time people recognised that this is not a decision taken in the cloisters of Dublin.  It is a decision which affects every school and every parish in Ireland. That is not to say that every school in Ireland will lose a teacher.  One thing that is quite clear from the debates on these cuts is that the Minister does not have a clue what effects these figures will have on the teacher population or the organisation of schools around the country. She does not seem to know where it is at, at present.</P>
    <P>The new staffing figures for primary schools are the most diabolical set of proposals that have ever emanated from the Department of Education.  They betray the commitment, vision and work undertaken by successive departmental secretaries, departmental ministries and people from all walks of life.  Even though the Minister never likes references to be made to her own family I want to include in that list of people her grandfather who did Trojan work in County Clare to improve the pupil-teacher ratio and who worked on behalf of teachers there for years.  It is work that we appreciate and I am sure the man would feel disgusted at what is happening at present.</P>
    <P>The proposals seem designed to undermine and to destroy the total fabric of Irish primary education.  The Minister apparently intends to implement these arrangements from 1 January 1988. When the enormity of these cuts comes to be realised by people everywhere, it will become apparent that the Minister could, in no circumstances, implement them.  I ask her now to consider what she is doing and to change her mind.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties with a debate like this is that one can get lost in statistics. I do not intend to do that.  I do not intend to read down through the departmental circular but for the benefit of my <Col N="868" /> colleagues in the Seanad I want to give one example.  There could be up to 418 pupils in a school which has ten assistants. With ten class teachers under the new arrangements that gives an average of more than 41 pupils in a class.  The first thing I want to warn my fellow Senators about is that the average bears no relation to the size of classes.  Unfortunately because of the way we operate the same number of kids are not born per year; nor is there the same intake per class per year.  An average of 41 pupils means that there will certainly be classes of 45 pupils and over in all schools with ten assistants where the enrolment is over 400 in the foreseeable future.  What does that mean in terms of the numbers in classes?  It means on average 5.5 extra pupils per class.  It means that there could be up to eight extra pupils in classes in schools in the future.</P>
    <P>One of the great difficulties teachers have is trying to explain to people what effect the increase in class size has.  How does one quantify it?  How does one indicate to people what it means?  If Senators can remember the last wet Saturday they were at home when their children of primary school age were around the house and they wondered what to do with them, how to keep them quiet, interested or occupied, I can assure them that in primary schools the problem is roughly 13 times worse.  That is what it is like.  Teachers have no special knack to make it less stressful for them to deal with those kinds of numbers.  They do not have any special knack to make that organisational difficulty easier for themselves.  Because of the size of classrooms and the condition of many schools this problem is exacerbated.</P>
    <P>I want to quantify what the class size means.  If a class of 40 pupils is increased to 44 pupils this is a 10 per cent increase in the size of that class.  The school year runs for roughly 10 months.  A 10 per cent increase in class size is comparable to losing a month at school.  It is comparable to holding pupils at home for a full month every year.  That is a problem that we and the educational service are faced with.  It is the duty of every teacher, parent and <Col N="869" /> elected public representative, especially the people in this House tonight, to resist the implementation of this disastrous plan by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The decision to increase the size of the class will mean an absolute drop in quality which will ultimately mean a reduction in the service provided to the pupils.  The already over-strained, over-resourced primary educational service will be reduced to chaos.  I was prepared until yesterday to resist the temptation to quote anything the Minister had said in Opposition or before that but I think it is important that I should put some things on the record.  Regrettably she is not here to defend herself because what she said has implications about the honesty of people in political life.  I will let the House be the judge of that.</P>
    <P>Over the years the quality of people entering Irish primary education was second to none.  In comparison to other European countries there is no doubt that the Irish primary teacher would rank at the top of the league in terms of quality, intellectual capacity and sheer commitment. Scotland and Denmark are the only two countries that could provide a primary teaching service as good as the Irish one.  Over the years a huge investment has been made in primary education in terms of the intellectual investment of the members of the primary teaching profession and in terms of the commitment of the same primary teachers who, as Senators will be well aware, never faltered in their commitment at 3 p.m. or whatever time their school closed.  They were always prepared to give to their community.  There is not a voluntary organisation or political party in this country who have not depended to a large measure on the voluntary contribution, commitment and involvement by the Irish primary teacher in local communities. This has been an intellectual investment and an investment in commitment.</P>
    <P>Because of the quality of those people &mdash; and I know the Aire Stáit having been reared in the house of one of these people will be well aware of what I am talking about &mdash; we have had results which are <Col N="870" /> comparable to results anywhere in Europe.  Despite having the most under-resourced, under-financed, over-stretched primary school service in Western Europe we have still managed to produce people of the highest calibre.  The investment was the intellectual capacity and the commitment of the teacher.  The price we are now paying is worn out wrecks of teachers at the age of 60 and 65 years who are not getting any thanks from the State for a lifetime of commitment, stress and making ends meet.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough and it shows grave irresponsibility on the part of the Minister.  It is irresponsible and the already over-strained and under-resourced primary education service will be reduced to chaos.  It is a clear abnegation of the Minister's responsibility for education.  It shows a horrific lack of understanding on the part of the Minister that the primary education service which seeks to serve all the pupils of the State should be singled out for the deepest most swingeing cuts of all.  It will have a disastrous effect.  It will reduce pupil-teacher contact, make early diagnosis of learning problems almost impossible and devastate what is already the most under-resourced, under-financed and overstretched educational service in Western Europe.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to imagine the effect this will have on the learning process.  The amount of time a teacher has with individual pupils relates directly to the number of pupils in the school, or in the class, who need some form of remedial teaching, support or help.  It is a fact of life.  If the teachers cannot spend time with the pupils, that time is lost and those pupils lose out.  Therefore, there will be more need in schools for remedial services. Because there will now be larger classes there will be a need for a greater amount of remedial teaching.  Because the classes are larger the remedial groups will be bigger.  I sense that that sounds contradictory so let me put it this way.  In a class of 40 pupils there could be four pupils in need of remedial attention. Because there will now be 44 pupils in a class by applying the same 10 per cent, <Col N="871" /> which is an acceptable percentage of pupils who need remedial attention, that immediately brings it up to an extra person.  Because there are more pupils in the class and the teacher has now less time to spend with individual pupils, there will be a greater need than ever for remedial attention for pupils in that class. The number will go up much higher than the 10 per cent that operated heretofore.</P>
    <P>I want to give the lie to the question of the disadvantaged.  I was sickened listening to the Minister's response day after day and week after week that the disadvantaged would be looked after and would not be hurt.  I will refer to that in a few minutes.</P>
    <P>The proposals will have severe consequences for young, qualified and fully trained primary teachers.  At present there are up to 2,000 fully qualified, fully trained primary teachers available for work but who are without full time jobs. There are now approximately 1,800 student teachers in colleges of education who will come out during the next three years with no prospects and no future in primary education.  By implementing these proposals the Minister will create a stock of almost 4,000 fully qualified, fully trained, available primary teachers who are being trained and qualified at great cost to and investment by this State, without any work and with no prospects.</P>
    <P>It was noted in the newspapers over the weekend that the primary education qualification is not being recognised in parts of England and Wales.  The most ironic comment of all was that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is now seeking recognition of the Irish qualification in Britain.  I recalled a statement made by the Minister, Deputy Fahey, some months back when he said politicians in other countries were less helpful to the Irish emigrant than they might be.  It puts it in a totally new context when the Minister for Foreign Affairs not only is encouraging people to emigrate but is now going abroad to open the path for them so that they can get out of this country more quickly.  We are creating a future without qualified young people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="872" /> The Minister for Finance spoke over the weekend about out great stock of young, highly educated and highly qualified people.  I do not know whether if the Minister is aware that even in his own constituency those young people are leaving in football teams every week.  That is the level of the movement out of the country.  It is time it was pointed out to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the rest of the Government, including the Minister for Education that they have a commitment and a responsibility to the youth of Ireland and that they are clearly turning their backs on them.  It is totally and completely unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The proposals will hit the poor and disadvantaged.  I would like at this stage to make it clear how this will happen. The Minister for Education said over the weeks that the disadvantaged quota of teachers would not be hit.  I want to explain this to my colleagues.  There is a certain staffing ratio for primary schools, the worst in Europe.  Certain schools have been designated socio-economically deprived over the years.  These have been given an extra number of teachers.  What the Minister is saying is that in the main they will not be affected.  Therefore, she can say the stock of teachers for the disadvantaged will not be hit.  That is untrue. The appointment figures for all schools in disadvantaged areas will be hit hard and teachers will lose their jobs.</P>
    <P>I want to give some indication of what I am talking about and mention some of the more deprived areas of Dublin.  Last week a survey of all teachers in north County Dublin showed drastic effects from the cutbacks.  The survey covered a total of 1,400 teachers in the north county area.  I want to stress that this is not a sample survey; it is a total survey.  An incredible 179 of these 1,400 teachers will be wasted to the primary education service in north Dublin through the application of the new appointment figures. Applying that result nationally, and assuming a teaching stock of approximately 18,670, there would be a net national loss of 2,400 teachers wasted to the educational service.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education claimed <Col N="873" /> three times over the weekend that these figures were an over-estimation.  She was incorrect.  On numerous occasions she tripped herself up and contradicted herself by saying that on the one hand there would be only 1,250 jobs lost and, on the other hand, there would be only 13,000 schools affected.  I have lists of schools where up to three jobs will be lost.  Her figures simply do not stand up.  She is totally and absolutely misinformed.</P>
    <P>To emphasise my point, a survey has been completed this week in the north city area of Dublin.  Every school and enrolment was surveyed.  The results from the north city area are slightly worse than those from the north county area. Therefore, in the north Dublin area, north of the river Liffey, where a total of 2,600 teaching jobs were surveyed, it was found that 354 teaching jobs will be wasted to the service.  I hope Senators representing those areas will take note of the effect this will have on those areas. If these figures were applied to Dublin as a totality one could expect more than 700 jobs to be lost in the greater Dublin area. If the figures are the same nationwide, and I will refer to those in a few minutes, we can expect, a striking 2,560 jobs at a minimum to be lost.</P>
    <P>I have been asked if these figures will carry from Dublin to the rest of the country. I do not know.  I made a honest extrapolation of the figures and applied them as I found them.  I made a number of telephone calls this afternoon to check out the position in particular areas.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that the Cathaoirleach would be here so that she could hear how it will affect her own area of Ennis.  I thought Senator Hillery might be here so that I could tell him about the Miltown Malbay area, I will tell the House anyway.  Of the 75 teachers in the 26 schools in the north Clare region, 15 of the posts will be suppressed.  Senator Cassidy said to me today that the Castlepollard area would not be hit too badly but I would like to tell him that of the 24 teachers in the Castlepollard area, five will lose their posts.  I hope the Senator has plenty of time on his hands to explain to them why this is necessary and why <Col N="874" /> the primary teachers, the pupils and the parents are being made to pay for mistakes somebody else made.  The people who are being asked to pay this time are not the people who had money in the good times either.</P>
    <P>In real terms these proposals are disastrous. I want to refer to Drumshanbo because Senator Mooney showed a great interest in the motion this afternoon and had some comments to make about it. Of the 11 teachers in Drumshanbo local school, which I think the Senator attended, two will lose their jobs.  Those are Maureen O'Keeffe and Dessie Doyle.  I am sure the Senator will have a good time explaining to them why their jobs are being lost.  That is two jobs out of 11.  I hope the Minister is taking note of the fractions we are talking about. Senator Farrell's local school, Grange national school, which is a six teacher school, will be reduced to a five teacher school.  Brid Leonard, a local activist in the INTO, will lose her post.</P>

Sin mar a tá agus sin mar a bheidh.  Tá aithne ag an Seanadóir ar na scoileanna timpeall na háite sin.  Tá scoil Dún Chaoin dúnta, is dócha, an scoil is cáiliúla i nGaeltacht na hÉireann.  Bhí an-troid ann leis na blianta chun an scoil a choimeád oscailt.  Bhí troid ann ó 1970 go dtí 1974 agus ina dhiaidh sin go dtí 1977.  Tar éis na blianta ag iarraidh na <Col N="875" /> huimhreacha ar na rollaí a chur suas d'éirigh leo muinteoir nua a fhostú ansan anuraidh.  The shame is tá siad san i nDún Chaoin ag cailliúint muinteoir an uair seo.  Imigh as san siar go dtí an Buailtín, Baile an Fhéirtéaraigh.  Tá siad ag cailliúint muinteoir i mBaile an Fhéirtéaraigh. Tá scoil eile thíos an bóthar agus tá siad ag cailliúint muinteoir ansin.  Isteach go dtí An Daingean go dtí Clochar na Toirbirte, tá siad ag cailliúint muinteoir ansin chomh maith.  Tá slad agus scrios déanta ag an Aire ar sheirbhís bhunoidea-chais na h-Éireann.  Ní dóigh liom gur féidir aon chosaint a chur suas ar an méid atá déanta aige.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I have broken a rule but since I was elected to this august body I have had to repeat things I said in Irish in English because, unfortunately, the message does not always get across to people.  I want what I say to be clearly and definitely put on the record until such time as we get a translation service here. Dunquin school in west Kerry fought for years to establish itself as an entity and finally got a second teacher employed there two years ago.  That school will lose a teacher.  Ballyferriter school will lose a teacher.  Muiríoch, Scoil Smerbhic and Clochar na Tuirbirte in Dingle will lose a teacher.</P>
    <P>I am making these points because people think this is an urban problem only.  It is not.  Every parish in the country is affected.  I want to issue a challenge to the Minister.  She said she rejected the INTO's view that there was not a parish in Ireland which would not be affected by these cuts.  I challenge her to list parishes which will not be affected by these cuts. No doubt that is not a challenge she will take up either.</P>
    <P>The pupil-teacher ratio in the North is 23.4 at present.  For us to achieve that figure 5,000 extra teachers would need to be employed immediately.  We would not have enough teachers available.  The Six Counties have the worst pupil-teacher ratio in the United Kingdom and that shows how far behind we are.  Were we to retain the present teaching stock and to apply the experience of the demographic <Col N="876" /> movement and trends, it would be another ten years, with a falling pupil population, before we would reach anything like the figures in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The disadvantaged and the socio-economically deprived areas are hit hard.  I want to do a scan across part of Dublin. Every school in Corduff and Blanchardstown will lose teachers.  Every school in Finglas will lose teachers.  Every school in Bonnybrook will lose a teacher. Every school in Ballymun will lose teachers. Every school in Darndale will lose teachers.  These are the most deprived areas in Dublin and the Minister dares to stand up and say that the disadvantaged will not suffer under these cuts.  These are the facts and I have the names of the teachers, the names of the schools and the enrolment of the schools with me should anybody wish to challenge them.</P>
    <P>In the north inner city area, which is considered to be the most deprived area in Ireland, only three of the many schools there will be spared the chop.  How can anybody justify this?  Are these people responsible for the problems that have been created by the financiers, by the economists, by the politicians?  Are these the people we are going to make pay for the mistakes of the past?  Who can justify the proposal to hit the poor, the disadvantaged the under-privileged, the socio-economically deprived?  It brings us back to a situation where the rich can build their own schools or buy their own education.  It creates a situation where we will have better quality education for the better off.  I do not know if that is the objective of the Minister but that is certainly where we will be.</P>
    <P>We have already, as the Minister of State knows, examples of places where the local people have got together to build classrooms or are beginning the process of building new buildings.  This might be all very well for the Department of Education and quite acceptable to them.  The fact of the matter is that this can only be done in those areas where there is enough marginal money available to do it.  The whole problem is that these <Col N="877" /> cuts will hit the poor more than others.  It also means that because of the difficulties that will be created for pupils in the learning process in schools with over-crowding, with a poor service in general, the rich can afford to buy solutions for their pupils.  The poor have to live with the problem and concentrate on putting bread on the table, or living from day to day.  It is totally and utterly unacceptable. It is disgraceful.</P>
    <P>In 1985 Deputy Mary O'Rourke said to the then Minister for Education:</P>
    <P>Will the Minister accept that she is stonewalling and that throughout the country at national school level the funding available to the management of schools to carry out their normal activities is inadequate and that they are forced to call upon parents of the children attending the schools for finance? The Minister is also aware that this is greatly to the detriment of pupils in disadvantaged areas whose parents cannot afford the finance.</P>
    <P>I agree completely.  The position has not changed as the Minister well knows but what has she done but worsen the position? I consider insulting the amendment put down to the motion tonight, to in some sense say that what the Estimates have tried to do is to relieve that situation. Also in November 1985 Deputy O'Rourke said:</P>
    <P>The Minister gave the figures for the proportion of GNP spent on education in the course of her reply to Deputy Avril Doyle.  That is irrelevant to our position because of the different age structure of our population compared to other European countries.  The figures given by the Minister refer to 1982.  Is the Minister satisfied that Ireland occupies the lowest rung on the ladder in regard to <i>per capita</i> spending on education in Europe?</P>
    <P>That is the position.  It has not changed. The Minister has just worsened it.  She has made it worse in the section of Irish education which deals with all the pupils from whatever background.  What will <Col N="878" /> she do about it?</P>
    <P>In April 1985 she said:</P>
    <P>If Fianna Fáil were in power what would they do?  The Government ask how we would go about doing what we say we want done if we were in power. I will tell the House exactly what we will do.  Fianna Fáil in Government will work towards a reversal of the pupil-teacher ratio until it is brought back to the 1982 levels.  In common with other social and national organisations we believe that the extent of provision, the standards and the achievements of our educational system must be upheld and improved upon rather than diminished as at present.  Above all we want to see true provision for the disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>Furthermore in the election manifesto of this year, the Fianna Fáil Party made the following statement:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will reduce the pupil-teacher ratio initially at primary school levels.</P>
    <P>I know it is not possible to use the word &ldquo;lie&rdquo; in parliamentary debates and therefore I will not use it but it certainly seems to me that there is a conflict of evidence at the very least in what I see there. This is a horrendous proposal; it is totally unacceptable.  It is an abnegation of responsibility.  It is a betrayal of the poor and it is something that this House should throw out and throw out with venom.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole has more than adequately outlined the appalling, the outrageous, the offensive, the unjust consequences of this policy.  There are a number of other issues to be addressed and those issues are well contained within the extraordinary amendment. This is an extraordinary amendment for a number of reasons, the most fundamental being that it is an amendment from Fianna Fáil.  As I have often reminded this House, I grew up in a Fianna Fáil household and all of my radical convictions, about justice in our society, all of my convictions about the side I was on in society, all of my convictions <Col N="879" /> about what was important in our society, spring from what used to be the view of Fianna Fáil.  All of them spring from a conviction that there are two sides in Irish society, that Fianna Fáil were on one side and other people, particularly the old Fine Gael Party, were on the other side.  That is where I learned my socialism.</P>
      <P>I learned my socialism within and from Fianna Fáil.  It was not called socialism but the instincts, the loyalties, the values, the principles and the choices were based on what were essentially socialist convictions. I knew it was Fianna Fáil who built houses for the poor.  I knew that it was Fianna Fáil who provided education for the poor.  I knew that it was Fianna Fáil who provided welfare for the poor. I knew that, behind the gloss that came on Fianna Fáil in the sixties, was the history of a party with a commitment to justice and, above all, the history of a party who did not bow before the financial institutions, before the banks and the Stock Exchanges and their judgment of who should suffer and who should benefit.</P>
      <P>What we have now in this amendment is the total abandonment by Fianna Fáil of what they claimed to stand for, what they used to stand for and what they still sometimes like to pretend to stand for on a safe occasion.  They talk about the financial realities.  The financial realities now for Fianna Fáil, for the new, right-wing, conservative Thatcherite Fianna Fáil, are the acceptance that you do not tax the powerful, you do not tax the rich, you do not tax the influential.  You do not even argue with them.  You genuflect in front of them and when they say: &ldquo;Make the poor pay for the crisis&rdquo;, you say: &ldquo;Yes sir&rdquo;.  When they say: &ldquo;Make the children pay for the crisis&rdquo;, you say: &ldquo;Yes sir&rdquo;. When they say: &ldquo;Let the children suffer because we will not have our lifestyles interfered with&rdquo;, you say: &ldquo;Yes sir&rdquo;. That is the new reality and that is the real reality behind Fianna Fáil as now constructed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have abandoned those who supported them loyally for 50 years.  They <Col N="880" /> have abandoned the working class.  They have abandoned the poor.  They have abandoned the youth because, for reasons that escape me, they have become converted to a viewpoint and a position that used to be dismissed in one word, which I will not use here, in my time as a young person in Ireland.  That is the most shameful part of what is going on in this country today.  It is bad enough that people are suffering, and that is appalling in itself.  It is bad enough that our children are suffering; it is bad enough that our hospitals are suffering but what is much worse is the extraordinary dishonesty of a party who claim to have a loyalty to justice, to the poor and to the under-privileged, walking into Government on the basis of that tradition and then glibly turning their back on those who supported them because their masters down the road in the Stock Exchange and in the financial institutions said: &ldquo;You must do it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I read last weekend that one particular right wing economist was called in by the Department of Finance to give advice about cutbacks, one particular economist who I am not permitted to name under the rules of this House, and this House incidentally is far more gentle in the way it treats people than many of those other people are in the way they treat people. But we will observe the niceties of parlementary debate.  When I discover that the Department of Finance are not satisfied with their own dose of monetarism and financial rectitude and they have to call in yet another expert from outside whose views are well advertised about who should suffer, whose views are well advertised about who should pay, whose views are well advertised about who should not pay, I have to say that the Fianna Fáil that I grew up in, the Fianna Fáil for which I had, as late as the last election, a considerable respect have abandoned what they used to stand for.</P>
    <P>Before the last election if anybody asked me how I was voting, I made it quite clear.  I said I was voting for the left wing parties and I was transferring to Fianna Fáil because Fianna Fáil were no angels but I thought they had values and <Col N="881" /> commitments and principles beyond which they would not go because of where they came from, where their loyalties lay and, at the very fundamental, where their votes came from.  What I have discovered since that election is that they have no loyalties, they have no values, they have no principles.  What they have is a total capitulation to people with whom they would not be seen or be associated less than ten years ago.</P>
    <P>That is the most shameful, sad and painful part of what this country is going through.  It is the sight of a great party with a great history and a great tradition betraying everything they stand for in the interests of I know not what.  That is the most painful part of what is going on and that is why I feel so angry and so betrayed.  I had come to expect it from the Fine Gael Party.  It was their history, it was then their tradition and it was where their class loyalties lay but I had come to expect from Fianna Fáil a moderate pragmatism of the centre, recognising at least where their support came from.  It appears now that in their new found zeal and conversion, Fianna Fáil no longer recognise those sort of things. I must say I wish members of Fianna Fáil in this House and in the Dáil would sit back and think of what their party are supposed to stand for, what they learned about their party because most of them, like myself, come from a background of a particular set of political convictions.</P>
    <P>Having thought about it they should then think about what they are doing and think about why our children have to pay when we have the lowest levels of capital taxation in Europe, why our children have to pay when we have the lowest levels of corporate taxation in Europe, why our children have to pay when agriculture still pays a pathetically low level of income tax, why our children have to pay when we have the most inefficient system of tax collection in Europe, why our children have to pay when we have an extraordinarily ineptly organised indirect taxation system, why our children have to pay while we still give out massive grants to encourage agriculture to produce more and more of the goods <Col N="882" /> nobody wants to buy and sell them at a price that nobody wants to pay, why our children have to pay for all those things.</P>
    <P>I invite the members of Fianna Fáil, or at least those members of Fianna Fáil who remember what Fianna Fáil used to stand for, to reflect on what they are now supporting because it has got nothing to do with some set of objective realities that cannot be avoided.  It has got to do with choices about who you are for and who you are against, choices about who you will tax and who you will not tax, choices about who is on your side and who is on the other side.  They are the choices this party I used to have such enormous respect for have now begun to make.  That is the context in which these decisions have been taken and that, to my mind, in many ways, in political terms, is the saddest part of the choices that have been made.  There are a series of consequences of these decisions which are even at variance with the objectives which the Government claim to be setting for themselves. Let me explain what they are.</P>
    <P>We are going to push pupil/teacher ratios in primary schools up to what can only be described as astronomical levels. This will have a number of effects, one of which in my view will be to generate a large number of qualified unemployed teachers.  When you have a large number of qualified unemployed teachers and astronomically high pupil/teacher ratios, you are going to generate private primary schools.  There is something particularly shameful in Fianna Fáil becoming the party of privilege, of private education, of fee-paying primary education which the rich will use to escape the 50:1 pupil teacher ratios that are going to be generated in many of our schools.</P>
    <P>Many of us are very proud of the fact that we have a classless primary education system in which people from different backgrounds of different abilities and income levels mix together in a very good, though pathetically under-funded, primary education system.  What we are now going to create is a parallel system &mdash; one for the rich who are prepared to pay and one for the rest who are neither able nor willing to pay because <Col N="883" /> they do not have the resources to do so. That will be Fianna Fáil's legacy.  Even more so is the other part of their legacy, that is, the fact that we are supposed to be developing in this country a culture of innovation and of enterprise.  I will say that the fundamental prerequisite for enterprise, for innovation and for anything like that is imagination and if you think that an education system which is starved of resources, which turns classrooms into control environments where the simple and only job a teacher can do will be to keep order and teach by rote, is going to create the sort of imaginative young people who are going to generate enterprise and innovation, you can only be deceiving yourself.</P>
    <P>Underlying everything here is the fact that education is not a current expenditure in the way that the fancy economists would have us believe.  Education is an investment in human capital and the most valuable resource any community has is not its land resources, its mineral resources, or its marine resources, it is its human resources.  It is quite astonishing that rather than taxing capital, or agriculture, or anything else, we will withdraw investment from our most fundamental resource.  When we do that, we cannot expect any return.  The investment is being taken out of the most important resource, the one that can create enterprise and innovation.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in terms or what this Government claim to stand for, which is to create enterprise, innovation and wealth creation in this country, the idea of withdrawing funds from education is a contradiction of that objective, which simply brings me back to the fact that I have to believe that this Government do not believe in that, that they have capitulated totally to one objective, which is to satisfy the lunatics in the Stock Exchange who can shift dramatically by 25 per cent in a week the price of shares because, in the words of <i>The Irish Times</i>, their own greed and fear dictate it.  The idea of a nation determining its policies on the basis of the creation of confidence in that sort of an element in our society says <Col N="884" /> something about the values of our Government and our society.  What we need is a Government who are willing to make us all pay for the price of the excesses that perhaps we have indulged in over recent years, although I think that is a doubtful argument.</P>
    <P>What we need are a Government who are prepared to recognise, first of all, that we are one of the lower taxed nations in Europe.  This is one of the big lies that the economists have foisted upon us.  We are not overall a heavily taxed nation. One part of our society, we the PAYE payers, are heavily taxed.  Damn near nobody else in our society is heavily taxed with the result that overall we are a relatively lowly taxed nation.  We need to increase taxation on those who pay nothing or on those who have avoided paying.  That is something which Fianna Fáil in their heyday would have had no hesitation about doing.  In the thirties when Fianna Fáil were a radical party, capital taxation represented nearly 4 per cent of Government revenue.  It now represents half of 1 per cent.  To return to the position of the hungry thirties would generate about £300 million for this country. They are the sort of figures which this country needs to avoid penalising our children and, in the process of penalising our children, stifling imagination and creativity and in the end stifling what this country needs most which is enterprise. All I can say to the Government and to Fianna Fáil is: &ldquo;Shame on you for the way you have betrayed what you used to stand for.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>I will start my contribution by commenting on Senator O'Toole's remarks about the admiration he had for Fianna Fáil and the hopes and aspirations that Fianna Fáil people had prior to the election.</P>

      <P>Senator Ryan has given a glowing picture of his education in politics and how much he admired the concern and care of Fianna Fáil.  I would only comment, without dwelling on that aspect of the motion, that he may have changed but Fianna Fáil have not.  Fianna Fáil's concern and care today are genuine and, in fact, if they were not acting as they are acting that concern would be lacking.  Fianna Fáil at present are the best Government this country has had in 50 years with the largest majority of the people who ever voted for any Government is this country.  They are conscious of that.  In every Gallup poll they are gaining support every day because, despite the criticism, which is welcome <Col N="886" /> when it is constructive, the majority of the people are reasonably well educated.</P>

      <P>The average person is well enough educated to make an assessment, to make a calculation and we can assess that the Government are getting more popular every day.  Perhaps that is not going down too well.  Like many other Fianna Fáil people, I am bitterly disappointed. I was one of the people who had great hopes that if a Fianna Fáil Government were returned to office we could do a better job, we could extend and build new schools and we could make many of the improvements to the whole education programme that are so necessary. But it did not start today.  I was on an interview board for teachers in 1983. We sat for two days interviewing 46 teachers for one post.  The 2,000 surplus teachers did not start and were not created within the past seven months.  The people know this.

      <P>I believe that when the Government took office not only was money committed to current expenditure but for the next two years.  For every promise and every contract that could be signed, money was committed in advance, not for 1988 but for 1989.  It was the same for school buildings, primary and secondary, and every commitment was carried to contract level right across the board.  The same applied to the health services and also to housing grants.  No other Government walked into a situation such as this Government did.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister.  She is a courageous lady.  She walked into a situation where no funds were available to do anything.  She had to effect economies. Not only to continue the educational programme, not only to ensure the future of those we were trying to educate but to keep the programme going, it was necessary to effect economies in the programme for education. No Government ever took office in such a bad situation.  We were living in Utopia; we were not informed of anything.  I said on numerous occasions in this House, even before the last general election, that the brochures went out with no restrictions on expenditure.  We were spending money.  A hospital was being built in Sligo costing £43 million.  We were turning on the tap costing £7 million in my region in the north west.  The ordinary man in the street had to wake up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Coalition Government were able to sign a contract for £43 million and had millions for everything.  The next day we had to lay off teachers, nurses, road workers, ordinary labourers installing telephone lines around the country and forestry workers.  Is it that the Government are so stupid or so bad that the <Col N="889" /> situation is completely slewed around? The ordinary man in the street realises that we were drifting into space with no control.  If the corrective measures were not taken the youth of this country had no future.  I come from a county where 20,000 young students are leaving secondary school with no prospect of employment.  No public representative with any grain of responsibility could take it other than very seriously.  There is no future for the young school leaver.</P>
    <P>The Government have taken very unpopular but determined measures to correct the economy.  If those measures were not taken, I would understand people being alarmed about where we were going and what we were doing.  The Minister for Education walked into an office and took control.  She has rationalised and restructured the Department and she will effect economies because, prior to the Government taking the corrective measures, the Department were spending money.  I am a member of the vocational educational committee in Donegal.  We got money to furnish a school that was not built.  Money was allocated to the County Donegal Vocational Educational Committee by a Department who did not know the school was not built.  That happened.</P>

      <P>I will have to claim injury time.  Certainly no one could claim it is a popular role for a Minister, a Minister of State, or anybody associated or connected with the present Government's campaign to put the finances of this country right.  Nobody envies the task of those who are involved.  As I said at the beginning it does not matter what language you use or how sensationally you describe the situation, you will not deflect those who are very committed and <Col N="890" /> very concerned.  They can read and they can understand.  You can list how many teachers might lose their jobs and you can list all the schools.  I could get a list from the schools and submit it to the unions.  I could read out the list and crocodile tears could be shed from Cork to Donegal.  That could be done but it contributes nothing because we do not get money out of the ground.  We have very little mineral wealth in this country.  We have no oil and we have to find enough funds to pay for the expansion in education. The Government have no difficulty in convincing the people that we are on the only course that is open to us.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister and congratulate her and tell her to keep going ahead and to make reductions where she finds it necessary.</P>
      <P>I attended a meeting in Carrick yesterday. We have been waiting for a small extension to a vocational school in Carrick for six years.  We had all the posturing. We had different contractors but there was no movement.  The Minister for Education came to Killybegs two weeks ago and there was a deputation out to meet her to present their case.  At the end of the day people have to realise that the Minister started with no funds and her budget is totally committed.</P>
      <P>This motion was put down with one intention: to be as destructive as possible in the Seanad and to take this important area of education into the political arena. I do not think it will cod anybody.  It is crystal clear that the only hope is to get our finances right.  Then there will be a future and a possibility of building up and starting again.  Signing contracts when there were no funds to meet them was leading us to disaster.  I want to compliment the Minister on her courageous work.  She has taken on a difficult job. Like the fellow taking over the pub with no beer, that was where she started.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this motion and to broaden out the subject to cover the educational aspects which incorporate the cuts in the Estimate.  I would like to point out my party's position in <Col N="891" /> relation to education and the work done by the previous Government in promoting education.  I disagree with a number of the comments made by Senator McGowan.  I hope to give an opposite viewpoint during the course of my contribution.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael, in Government and out of it, have a distinguished record in education. The recent history of our party in this area began with the work done in Opposition from 1977 to 1981 by a special party committee who produced a comprehensive policy document called <i>Education in the Eighties.</i>  Now in Opposition we have the opportunity to look back and, more important, to look forward. There was an active and productive period for education until earlier this year, a period when a broad range of desperately needed reforms and innovations were set in place.  The emphasis was on three things: (1) reform; (2) innovation; (3) special care for the disadvantaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many areas at primary, second level and third level which cry out for reform and renewal.  My party, fully aware of the huge strain on the national finances nevertheless believe that education can be developed, can be cherished, can be given special attention within reasonable bounds.  We have always been straight with all the partners in education which is only now being seen and being appreciated.  In the Estimates for education spending is down by 7 per cent which will obviously lead to bigger classes, higher fees, redundancies and so on.  The education service at all levels will be cut this year by a staggering £87 million.  Over half of the savings will come from the primary schools sector. We see cuts in pay of £42 million in the primary sector.  An unprecedented attack on our primary schools is made clear from these figures.  This in unbelievable coming from a Minister who on more than one occasion said she proposed to give priority to primary education and that the primary focus of any educational authority or any education department <Col N="892" /> must be on first level education.  It is now very obvious that all this has changed.</P>
    <P>Never before has there been such a betrayal of trust and such a cynical misuse of democracy as the performance of Fianna Fáil in the education area before and after the election in February 1987. For four and a half years the Minister opposed every measure the former Government took to improve the efficiency and logic of education spending, and called for more spending in every area.  That is totally in contrast to what Senator McGowan has been saying.  I am trying to point out to the House that we were very careful about how we spent money on education.  At a time when we were doing all in our power, with restricted resources, the Opposition spokesperson, who is now the Minister, was calling for further spending.  In particular she championed the cause of teachers' pay and led the call for giving a full £75 million to teachers.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago the Government undertook to increase the pay of everyone paid out of the public purse.  This will cost some hundreds of millions of pounds over the next few years.  Did it not occur to anyone, to put it mildly, that it was grotesque that small children starting an educational experience should be sacrificed in order to pay increases to everyone in the public service, including the teachers?</P>
    <P>I find it cynical to say the least that Senator O'Toole put down this motion expressing concern about the pupil teacher ratio, larger classes, less pupil teacher contact, thousands of redundant teachers and so on, when his union, the INTO of which he is an executive member, sat down with the representatives of the Government and agreed on the terms I have outlined, costing millions of pounds, knowing that every pound awarded to the public service had to come from cutbacks in other areas.  They have now got their answer. With an £86 million cut in education, and the vast majority of it coming from the primary sector, it is clear that the small children of this country will suffer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="893" /> Following the publishing of the cuts the President of the INTO said:</P>
    <P>The massive reduction in the numbers of primary teachers and cut in money for building and maintenance was the worst attack on the educational services since the hungry thirties.  The cut in teacher numbers would mean thousands of children being placed in classes of over 40 pupils and cuts were a betrayal of the children of the country.</P>
    <P>I cannot honestly accept that the INTO and, indeed, the other teaching unions are totally blameless in all of this.  They lambasted the last Minister for Education, Deputy Hussey, and indeed Deputy Cooney for not giving in to their demands.  Postcards were posted to every Oireachtas Member by their members&mdash; I got them and so did the Leas-Chathaoirleach prior to the election &mdash; blackmailing them into supporting their cause.  They have now succeeded in getting their way but, in my opinion, at a huge cost.  I cannot believe the teachers considered this a fair bargain.  I am sure the parents do not and, as for the bewildered children who will squeeze themselves into the classrooms to try to learn through the bedlam, they will never learn until it is too late that a deal was done in 1987 with their future because the Government needed to conclude a pay deal called national recovery.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the unions concerned in the pay deal to go back to the table with the Government and restore their credibility by finding this money elsewhere for the sake of the children of this country.  I am asking that there be no disimprovements in the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level and that school principals in large schools continue their essential development and administrative role.  I support the call in this motion for the immediate withdrawal of the circular 20/87.  If my interpretation is correct, in a ten teacher school, for example, a further 55 students over and above last year would be needed in order to retain the tenth teacher.</P>
    <P>Speaking broadly on general education policy, I have another concern in regard to the provision for adult literacy programmes <Col N="894" /> which have been annihilated by this Government.  Has the Taoiseach, the Minister or any other member of the Government ever taken the trouble to talk to the people involved in this programme? Have they any idea of the trauma suffered by people who reach adulthood and find that they can neither read nor write?  Have they any idea of the tension involved in the constant search for ways to avoid the simple business of filling in an application form? They clearly have not; otherwise they would never have reversed the decision of the former Minister, Deputy Hussey, to support in a realistic way the provision of adult literacy services.</P>
    <P>Another major area which demands explanation is the £6.5 million cut in school transport.  This implies not only further increases on a massive scale in charges but also far reaching changes in eligibility.  In plain language the parents and youngsters need to know if they will have a bus next year and, if so, how far they will need to walk to get to it and how much will it cost them.  There is great concern among parents and pupils alike that, when the small print is finally read, many pupils, now being bussed to school, will be walking next year.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that education has taken a sudden and massive blow under this Government.  This is all the more despicable because of the guarantees given to the education world by the Taoiseach two days before the general election.  He described Fine Gael's minor cuts as devastating and said it would be completely counter-productive to implement them. On March 31, budget day, Fianna Fáil's failure to understand the education area was exposed when £11 million extra over and above the minor cuts we had proposed was taken out of the system.  We are talking tonight and we will be talking tomorrow of taking a further £86 million out of the system for 1988.  I do not have to press the point any further as the facts speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael's prudent and caring management of the education budget is now being seen for what it was.  It was a realistic and expert development of <Col N="895" /> essential service for a massive young population.  This year must be the worst year in the history of the State for young people and their parents who care about giving them a good start in life.</P>

      <P>During the course of last week's Dáil debate on the 1988 Estimates the Minister for Education, referring to the cost reducing measures which have been decided on for the education area, stated and I quote:</P>
      <P>In different circumstances, these measures would not have been introduced.</P>
      <P>That one sentence sums up the difficulties faced by the Government not alone in relation to the education area but, indeed, in relation to every other area where Government expenditure has had to be curtailed.  In different circumstances there would be no need for these cost reducing measures.  In this country today there are very few people who do not concede that the situation is very serious and that the problems of the economy are so grave that the Government have no choice but to continue on the course they set themselves when they assumed office on 10 March.</P>
      <P>We as a nation have accepted that we have been living beyond our means.  We have accepted that we gave ourselves a standard of living and a level of services that we could not afford and which we were not able to pay for.  The high public spending on the provision of these services had to be paid for by borrowing. This resulted in high interest rates, high inflation and high taxation.  It resulted in an erosion of confidence, in a reduction in investment and in the outflow of capital, capital which could have been used for productive investment in the country over the past number of years.  There was no question but that the country had to change course.  This Government have taken a decision to curtail public expenditure and to reduce borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which was agreed recently between the Government and the social partners <Col N="896" /> recognises the grave state of our economic and social life.  In paragraph 4 of the introduction to the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> the following factors are identified as giving an indication of the extent of the difficulties which have to be confronted.  I quote from paragraph 4, page 5 of the <i>Programme for National Recovery:</i></P>
    <P>(a)  A gross domestic product per capita which is only 64 per cent of the European Community average,</P>
    <P>(b)  A National Debt of over £25 billion which is equivalent to more than one and one-half times of our Gross National Product and the servicing of which consumes annually one-third of Exchequer tax revenue,</P>
    <P>(c)  An Exchequer borrowing requirement of 10.7 per cent of Gross National Product in 1987 to finance both current and capital expenditure. This is among the highest budgetary deficits in the European Community,</P>
    <P>(d)  High nominal and real interest rates which are a barrier to investment,</P>
    <P>(e)  An unemployment rate of 18.5 per cent of the workforce amounting to 242,000 persons, of whom 73,000 are under 25 years of age.  This is one of the highest rates of unemployment in the European Community,</P>
    <P>(f)  Employment in agriculture which continues to decline steadily at a rate almost twice the Community average,</P>
    <P>(g)  Net emigration estimated currently at close of 30,000 and which is equivalent to the natural increase in the population,</P>
    <P>(h)  No overall growth in the volume of investment in equipment over the past 5 years compared with an increase of 20 per cent in the European Community.</P>
    <P>Paragraphs 1 and 2 read:</P>
    <P>1.  A fiscal policy which faces the financial realities is the key to putting the economy back on the path to long-term sustained economic growth.  The situation that has been developing in recent years in which the National <Col N="897" /> Debt and its servicing have been growing out of proportion to our ability to sustain them will be ended.  The National Debt/Gross National Product ratio will be stabilised in the course of the Programme.</P>
    <P>2.  This will involve reducing the Exchequer borrowing requirement to between 5 per cent and 7 per cent of GNP, depending on developments in economic growth and interest rates.  To that end, the measures taken by the Government to control and curtail public expenditure will be continued.</P>
    <P>The 1987 budget was a first step in controlling and curtailing public expenditure. It is clear today that the vast majority of people accept that the resolute way in which the Government have been tackling the country's problems has already shown results.  Financial targets have been adhered to.  Interest rates and inflation have come down.  Industrial production and exports are showing a significant increase.  The outflow of capital which has been a feature of recent years has been reversed.</P>
    <P>These are encouraging signs but the country is still faced with massively high unemployment and a totally unacceptable level of emigration together with a huge national debt figure, the servicing of which, as I stated, absorbs almost the total amount of revenue collected from PAYE.  As well as that, taxation levels are nothing short of exorbitant and these are the problems which face the Government.  It is against that background that the Government prepared their Estimates for 1988.  The Government's stated objective in the preparation of the Estimates was to secure a significant reduction in public spending while maintaining essential services at the best possible level.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the preparation of the Estimates involved very many difficult and unpalatable decisions for the Government as they sought to distribute the burden as fairly as possible across the board while, at the same time, protecting the weaker sections to the greatest possible <Col N="898" /> extent.  It was inevitable in these circumstances that education, in common with every other service, would have to carry its share of the burden.  This was recognised and acknowledged in paragraph 15 of Section IV of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which states:</P>
    <P>The Government recognise the importance of the educational system in the promotion of equity in society and will ensure, in implementing whatever adjustments are necessary in that sector because of financial considerations, that the burden of adjustment does not fall on the disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>That paragraph recognised and acknowledged that adjustments would be necessary in the education sector because of financial considerations.  I regret, as I am sure every other Member of this House does, that because of the economic situation the Government found it necessary to provide for a reduction in overall expenditure on the education service in the Estimates for 1988.  I regret also that the provision for primary education has to take its share of the overall reduction.</P>
    <P>In order to achieve this reduction a revision has been made in the schedule of average pupil enrolment figures required for the appointment and retention of teachers in national schools.  I understand that the revision in most cases will raise the pupil teacher ratio from 26.8 to 29.2 per cent.  The schedule does not provide specifically for non-teaching principals. There seems to be some disagreement as to the number of schools which will be affected but it would appear that the number will be somewhat less than half of the total number of some 3,300 national schools.</P>
    <P>While I accept that this decision will to some degree adversely affect the quality of the education service for many pupils, I welcome the fact that there will be no reduction in the number of remedial posts or in the number of concessionary posts in disadvantaged areas.  I understand also that pupil teacher ratios in special schools and special classes are not being revised. These decisions will ensure, to some <Col N="899" /> extent, that the burden of adjustment will not fall on the most disadvantaged of our primary school numbers.  However, as someone who has taught in the national school system for over 30 years I am saddened that the day has come when a Government would even have to contemplate an increase in the overall pupil teacher ratio in national schools, not to speak of having to implement such a decision.</P>
    <P>The increase in the pupil teacher ratio will undoubtedly result in larger classes in some schools.  In every class there are some pupils who require or can benefit from individual attention.  This is particularly true of those schools and those classes which do not have the benefit of a remedial teacher or of a remedial service and this is the case as far as the vast majority of small schools are concerned. Indeed, it is true of many of the larger schools also.</P>
    <P>During all of my teaching career I have taught in small schools which did not have the services of a remedial teacher. Therefore, those pupils who in another situation would have the benefit of a remedial teacher were, in effect, dependent on the degree of individual attention which I could give them.  This is the case in most such small schools.  Indeed one could say that there is no pupil, no matter how advantaged or disadvantaged in terms of ability, who will not benefit from some level of individual attention.  This is the main reason practising teachers have always campaigned for, and I am sure will continue to campaign for, smaller classes so that they can give the degree of individual attention to their pupils which they consider desirable.  It is regrettable that the national economic crisis which this Government are addressing &mdash; and addressing in the only realistic way possible &mdash; is of such proportions that the education service and, in particular, primary education has to suffer some of the consequences of the fiscal measures which have to be implemented.</P>
    <P>As a result of the cost reducing measures which have been decided on by the Government in the primary education <Col N="900" /> sector the onus of maintaining the quality of the service, as far as it is humanly possible to do so in such circumstances, will fall on the teachers in those schools which will be affected by these measures. In recent years for a variety of reasons teaching which was always a very demanding occupation has become even more so.  This is borne out by the numbers of teachers who even at a very young age become the victims of stress related illnesses.  Discipline, too, is a problem in very many schools.  Indeed, there is incontrovertible evidence that the number of seriously disruptive pupils in our schools is on the increase.  All these factors have resulted in recent years in a growing work load on all teachers.  Everybody must recognise that a lot of dedication and sacrifice on the part of teachers will be required if there is not to be a significant adverse effect on the educational achievements of the pupils in our schools.</P>
    <P>I conclude by saying I can only hope that this Government who have done so much in the past to improve the quality of the education service will be successful in their efforts to overcome the present economic difficulties and that resources which are so necessary will again be provided in the education area at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

We reject totally the Government efforts to amend it.  This indicates the total incompatibility of everything uttered by them when they were in Opposition and promised the electorate that they would do it differently.  We on this side of the House have now reversed positions with people like Senator Mullooley who, unlike some other speakers from that side of the House, made a very constructive contribution.  At least he has some experience and he admits that the Estimate for education as published is totally inadequate for the primary sector.

      <P>I am pleased to see the Minister of State here this evening but I am sure he would not think it invidious of me if I said I would have preferred the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, to attend because the matter I speak about is very serious and has grave implications for the health, welfare and, indeed, safety of the people of Waterford city and county.  My sole motive in wishing to raise the matter on the Adjournment is to elicit some measure of understanding, comprehension and sensitivity from the Government.  I know with absolute confidence that I speak on behalf of the people of Waterford when I say we do not feel that we have been met with that degree of understanding, sensitivity or comprehension.  Nevertheless, I am pleased to see the Minister of State here this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am speaking at the eleventh hour because this hospital is due to close on 31 October 1987.  I am conscious of the fact <Col N="902" /> that I speak about this hospital almost in the tones of a requiem.  I am deeply saddened, as are the people of Waterford, by what has happened to this beloved hospital which is in the heart of Waterford city and in the hearts of Waterford people.  It was built in 1785 and it was styled &ldquo;the leper hospital&rdquo; up to 1896.  The closure has been caused by the decision of the Minister and his Department to cut funding by £300,000 in 1987 and by an appalling decision to withdraw funding totally in 1988.  In other words, this measure to close the infirmary was forced on the board of governors who were not in favour of it but were left with no option but to make the painful decision to close, which comes into effect on 31 October 1987.</P>
    <P>The hospital is a beloved institution in Waterford.  I really cannot find words which are adequate to express the depth of feeling, warmth, reverence, affection and regard which the people of Waterford city and county have for this hospital and for all who have worked in it.  It is redolent of memories for every single person in Waterford.  There will be a day of mourning in the city on 31 October when that hospital finally closes its doors. Great praise is due to the matron, the staff, the present secretary-manager Mr. Jim Creagh, to the master and board of governors and to the ladies voluntary aid committee whose commitment to the County and City Infirmary knew no bounds.</P>
    <P>The withdrawal of funds and the subsequent closure of this hospital has been greeted with what I would describe as cold anger in Waterford.  A petition to keep the hospital open was signed by 36,000 people.  I was with a group of nurses who travelled with that petition to Dublin and presented it to the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, who received it graciously.  But it was to no avail. Approximately 85 staff have been offered redeployment, redundancy terms, or a five year career break.  The dislocation to the staff, to all those who supply services and to suppliers, is enormous and will never be forgotten or forgiven by the <Col N="903" /> people of Waterford.</P>
    <P>It is not merely to speak about the closure of the infirmary that I have raised this matter.  I want to illustrate the ludicrous, ham-fisted, inept, unthinking, bizarre and extraordinary way in which the health care needs of the people of Waterford city have been handled in the past few months.  It is a classic example of the bankruptcy of policy which is a hallmark of this Government.</P>
    <P>The South Eastern Health Board were faced, as were the other health boards, with a horrendous decision on the management of their finances.  Earlier in the year and long before any mention of the withdrawal of funding to the infirmary had been even whispered about, the South Eastern Health Board decided, of necessity &mdash; and they are dominated by the members of the Government party &mdash; to close 41 to 45 beds in Waterford Regional Hospital at Ardkeen.  Waterford people always recognised that the South Eastern Health Board managed a tight ship and ran their affairs reasonably well.  They were aghast that such a drastic measure was called for but stoically, recognising the dire national finanial situation, they accepted the painful decision that 41 to 45 beds should be taken out of Waterford Regional Hospital at Ardkeen.</P>
    <P>However, no sooner was this done than the decision to close the infirmary was visited on the people of Waterford.  That left the city and county denuded of acute hospital beds.  The ratio of acute hospital beds is 3.7 to 1,000 of the population as I understand it.  The city and county of Waterford has a catchment of 110,000 people and this large body of population was at that stage left with some 40 acute hospital beds which by any stretch of the imagination &mdash; you do not need to be a genius in health care, you do not need to be an expert, you do not need to have any knowledge of health care needs to know &mdash; was patently and totally absurd. There is no logic to what has happened: it is a disordered rout.  It is panicstricken, ill-planned and badly handled.  The South Eastern Health Board are engaged in a <Col N="904" /> ludicrous exercise of restoring the 41 to 45 beds taken away from the Ardkeen hospital earlier in the year.  This is subsequent to the closure of the County and City Infirmary.  What are people to think, I ask the Minister?  I say they are, quite frankly, underwhelmed by all that has happened.</P>
    <P>A geriatric assessment unit was constructed at Ardkeen hospital.  It was impossible to open and commission it through lack of funding, so it sat there. It was decided to build it in the first instance because the needs of the geriatric patients in the region were quite clearly underlined.  A geriatrician &mdash; one of the few in the country &mdash; was commissioned by the South Eastern Health Board on a part time basis to assess and review geriatric patients in this unit.  They were then to have a health care programme worked out for them and were to be so treated.</P>
    <P>The South Eastern Health Board, in order to make up for the closure of the infirmary, decided to open the geriatric assessment unit not for the purposes for which it was commissioned but for the surgical and medical needs of the region. This decision was described as disgraceful by a top medical expert, Dr. Ken Kelly, the recently retired director of community care in Waterford, a man who has no axe to grind, whose care, devotion and attention to the people of Waterford are above reproach.  He went on record at a public meeting of the South Eastern Health Board saying it would be a sad day and would be a disgrace particularly with the cold winter months almost at hand if the elderly were once more to get the wrong end of the stick by being deprived of their assessment facility.  In other words, the elderly in Waterford city and county are hostages to fortune and are subject to the maladministration, the poor thinking, lack of logic and the total absence of Government policy.  Words practically fail me, I feel so very angry and furious at what has happened.</P>
    <P>I speak with confidence knowing that my views are shared by the people in Waterford city and county.  I am not into what I call shroud politics.  I do not say <Col N="905" /> lightly people will die.  In fact, I have never said that in any debate on health care issues because I actually believe that I know something about the matter.  Mr. Gordon Watson a surgeon at Waterford Regional Hospital, Ardkeen, is not an emotional man, not a man given to headline grabbing, or a sensation seeker, but a quiet, dedicated, low key professional who was astounded at the extraordinary debacle which was taking place in Waterford city health care.  He chose to go on record saying: that because of the reduction in surgical beds, both at Waterford Regional Hospital and the County and City Infirmary, the situation would worsen to such an extent that we would have no say at all despite putting strong pressure on the Department and that, in fact, people would die as a result of this decision.  He asked: What about the poor?</P>
    <P>It is said in Waterford city that this hospital will be taken over perhaps by the VHI, a consortium of consultants, or a British interest who will provide a private clinic in Waterford city.  This hospital was specifically founded for the poor of Waterford city and county, and that is written in its charter.  It is not a private Taj Mahal type hospital.  It is a voluntary hospital for the poor of the city of Waterford and, come 31 October 1987, it will no longer be in existence.  If that was not bad enough the Government published their Estimates.  The amount of money on the capital side was reduced.  I want the Minister to say &mdash; and I know he has a script ready &mdash; whether sufficient money has been made available in the Government's Book of Estimates to enable construction on Waterford's new regional hospital to continue.  We are not like Cork where the North Charitable Infirmary can be taken away because the regional hospital is up on the stocks and running.  At Ardkeen we have almost a hole in the ground with a little bit of building, some £2,500,000 of construction. I understand some £3 million is needed in 1988.  We are left in an extraordinarily difficult position by virtue of the decision making that has gone on in <Col N="906" /> Waterford city.</P>
    <P>The capital health programme has been reduced by some 28 per cent, or 31 per cent in real terms.  In other words, a total of £43 million is being made available on the capital side.  My understanding is that Waterford, Wexford and Sligo are in contention for this £43 million. I hope the Minister can say what the allocation is for each hospital.  A contract has been signed with Waterford.  I hope that means that contract can be honoured and the hospital building project can continue without any interruption.  I would hate to think that it would be competing with Wexford and Sligo, deserving though their situations may be, for that scarce £43 million.</P>
    <P>Work started on the new hospital on 26 January 1987 and so far £2 million has already been spent.  I understand no contract has yet been signed for Sligo or Wexford and, therefore, there is no binding commitment to them.  I trust the Minister will inform me that there is a binding commitment to Waterford.</P>
    <P>Two hundred and two years of existence and of serving the people of Waterford city and county comes to an end on 31 October.  The closure of the infirmary leaves an overall reduction of 66 per cent in surgical beds.  I am sure the Minister will acquaint me with the fact that I have already brought to his attention that there is a measure to open beds that were already closed some months earlier in Ardkeen.  The Department of Health officials, despite lots of questioning, were reasonably evasive on the subject.  They talked about facilities being opened and strengthened at Ardkeen.  I want to know how, when and where.</P>
    <P>Cutbacks to the South Eastern Health Board's budget will be some three times greater next year than this year.  Ardkeen will find it very difficult to cope with the increased volume.  I remind the Minister that Ardkeen is a collection of largely prefabricated flat roofed buildings.  It was originally a TB sanatorium and if one were to drive in there today one would still think it was a TB sanatorium.  It is not a modern hospital.  It is not able to cope and it will not be able to cope with <Col N="907" /> this increased volume of patients.  I understand that the capital programme is under review.  I want the Minister to be very specific about what exactly is planned and exactly what the allocations will be.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned what has happened in Waterford is just about the most insensitive thing that could happen in health care.  I have seen a most blatant display of ineptitude and inequality.  It drives home the message that there are two tiers of health care opening up.  Anybody who has money or is sufficiently well insured can have any item of health care delivered on a plate when, where and how they like.  Anybody who is totally dependent on public health care must queue in the line.  Apart from emergency and casualty service decisions in the main are taken on your length of time in the queue, not on the medical, surgical, paediatric or geriatric priority.  That is disgraceful.</P>
    <P>I merely want at this stage to reiterate my feelings of anger and frustration at what has happened to the health care services in Waterford.  I accept the broad figures which the Government are coping with in the overall financial situation, as do my party.  I am totally unconvinced that there has been any sensitivity, any thinking, any consultation, and any awareness of the actual situation on the ground as I know it to be in Waterford. There has been a debacle, and a disgraceful situation obtains which I am deeply unhappy about.  I mourn the passing of the infirmary.  I salute all those people who down the 202 years have worked there with dedication, caring, love, conviction and concern for and on behalf of the people of Waterford.  I hope this period of Government which is devoid of hope, optimism or a basic thought-out policy will merely be a passing phase in the history of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden) Terry Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I have taken careful note of the contribution made by Senator Bulbulia and I welcome this opportunity to reassure the people of the <Col N="908" /> Waterford area that an excellent medical and surgical hospital service will continue to be available to them.  The restrictions of the difficult current budgetary situation have resulted in both Waterford County and City Infirmary and the Waterford Regional Hospital, Ardkeen, making such reductions in services that it makes little economical or medical sense to maintain both hospitals.  However, the closure of the infirmary will allow resources to be transferred to the Waterford Regional Hospital where they can be used more efficiently to maintain the level of hospital services in the area. Indeed, the hospital services will not only be maintained but will be developed when the new regional hospital currently under construction at Ardkeen is completed. I want to reassure the Senator that the Ardkeen hospital project will continue to completion as planned.</P>
      <P>As all the Senators will know, when the Government took office they were so impressed by the seriousness of the country's financial situation they realised that drastic measures were necessary. One of these measures is the restriction of public expenditure and this necessarily places limits on the amount of money which can be spent on the health services and the hospitals.  In order to contain expenditure within the 1987 financial allocation of £1,065 million, the County and City Infirmary had to make significant reductions in the level of services it provided.  It had to close 35 of its 76 beds leaving only 41 beds.  It was also necessary to let 15, and then a further 32, of its 98 staff go.  It had to cease employing locum staff and restrict its casualty services to between 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Mondays to Fridays.  The hospital also had to make arrangements for the South Eastern Health Board to take responsibility for the education of its 35 trainee nurses.  Similarly, the South Eastern Health Board have found it necessary to close 45 of the beds at Ardkeen Regional Hospital also in Waterford city in order to live within its 1987 allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will no doubt agree that it makes little economic or medical sense to maintain two acute hospitals within a <Col N="909" /> few miles of each other when in Ardkeen 45 beds have been closed and in the infirmary there are only 41 beds open. The public should be aware that both hospitals are within a relatively short distance of each other.  This inefficiency would be particularly inexcusable at present when the resources available to be spent on the health services are necessarily limited and the best value must be obtained from every pound spent on health care.</P>
    <P>In the light of these circumstances in which all the options were fully explored at a series of meetings between the hospital management and officials of my Department, I felt that, regrettably I had no other option in principle but to inform the County and City Infirmary that the hospital's funding could not be continued beyond this year.  I can assure the Senators that this decision was taken only after full and careful consideration of the situation and with a very real sense of regret.  I can only express my admiration and respect to the board and staff of the hospital who have made such a contribution to the health services in the Waterford area throughout its long history. That decision was taken reluctantly by the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon.  The board of governors deserve great respect for the dignified manner in which they faced up to reality by deciding that on financial grounds the hospital had to close by 31 October this year.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to assure Senators that the majority of the remaining 51 staff in the infirmary will be redeployed to the South Eastern Health Board and will take up employment either in Ardkeen Regional Hospital, Waterford, where additional beds are being provided, or in other vacant posts in the area.  I understand that approximately ten staff will be availing of the early retirement-redundancy package and discussions with the relevant trade union regarding redeployment and early retirement-redundancy are at an advanced stage.  The retirement-redundancy package is very generous in the present difficult economic circumstances.</P>
    <P>This regrettable loss of the infirmary <Col N="910" /> will not affect the level of hospital services in the Waterford area.  The infirmary's closure will allow resources to be redeployed to Ardkeen Regional Hospital, Waterford, where they will be used more efficiently to provide additional beds there.  Officials of my Department have recently met representatives of both the South-Eastern Health Board and the infirmary to ensure the smooth transfer of responsibility to Ardkeen Regional Hospital, Waterford. It has been agreed that additional medical and surgical beds will be provided at Ardkeen from 1 November and that existing accommodation will be adapted to provide an additional operating theatre there.  Perhaps some of the views which the Senator has quoted may have changed in the light of the decisions which have been made in relation to Ardkeen.</P>
    <P>In addition, a new extension will be built to the existing out-patients department at Ardkeen to cater for the increased demand.  In this way, the level of hospital services in Waterford will be maintained and the best possible value for money achieved.  In addition, the completely new regional hospital which is currently under construction at Ardkeen at a cost of £52 million will further develop health services in the area.  I must re-emphasise that the Ardkeen hospital project will continue to completion as planned and the people of Waterford should be very pleased at the commitment of my Department to the medical interests of the people of Waterford.</P>
    <P>This development will increase the total number of available acute hospital beds in Waterford city from 437 to 470. The new hospital will provide the southeast with a full range of regional hospital specialties in new integrated accommodation which will enable the medical care to be of the highest standard.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would once again like to express my appreciation to the board of governors and staff of the County and City Infirmary.  This hospital which was formerly a leper hospital was established by an Act of Parliament in 1896 and since then it has continued to provide an excellent service to the Waterford area. <Col N="911" /> Officials of my Department will be available at all times to discuss any issues which may arise from the board's decision as to its future.  Information in my Department states that the existing building is an actual fire hazard and it would cost approximately £125,000 to make it safe.  Again, I thank the Senator for raising this matter and I hope that our reassurance on health services will be accepted by the people of Waterford.</P>
