      <P>I have notice from Senator Paul Bradford that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to indicate when it is proposed to start a building programme at Rahan national school, Mallow, County Cork, as a serious accommodation problem will exist there in September 1987 as some of the present accommodation is extremely unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Mick Lanigan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to use his considerable influence to ensure that the United Nations renew the UNIFIL mandate in Lebanon which expires on 19 July.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Brian O'Shea of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to expand the recent decentralisation programme to include other areas than those designated in order to redress regional imbalances.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Brendan Ryan of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2346" /> The need for the Minister for Health to ensure that funds provided by him to the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children are used for the purposes he intended.</P>
    <P>I regard all matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Bradford's motion and it will be taken at the conclusion of Business. Senators Lanigan, O'Shea and Ryan may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

I understand Second Stage, and not all Stages, will be taken today?  I would welcome confirmation of that.  I certainly would wish to put in some amendments to the Bill.

These motions deal with the European Communities and it is now almost seven months since the topic was mentioned in the House.

      <P>I did not hear the radio report this morning about item No. 4.  I am not sure whether somebody leaked something to the radio programme because they could not decide we would take a particular item on the Order of Business this morning.  They could not have known before we did what the Order of Business was going to be.  We will not be taking item No. 4 for any more than one and a half hours today.  In reply to Senator McDonald's question on items Nos. 9 and 11, 15 and 17, we will discuss those matters in due course.  I am delighted he raised this point.  These items are on the Order of Business for a number of years and that particular committee did not even sit.  We will discuss those items in due course.  We may discuss them in the first week or perhaps the second week of August.  I am not too sure yet what the order will be for this.</P>

      <P>On the question asked by Seator Ross on capital punishment there may be time at a future date to discuss that matter. With regard to the question raised by Senator Robinson on item No. 2, as she knows I will endeavour at all times to ensure that all Senators get a chance to deal with legislation properly.

      <P>I take issue with the Leader of the House, especially in the presence of the Minister for Justice, on his remarks on the committee dealing with EC legislation of which the Minister for Justice was chairman in the last session, of which the Leader of the House was a very active member and Senator Robinson was a vice-chairman of one of the committees.  It was the most hardworking committee and the fact that so many of the reports are on the Order Paper undebated is an indication of the extent of the work carried out.  I think the Leader of the House may inadvertently have insulted the committee which was the most effective committee in the last Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this short Bill is to abolish the old common law action for restitution of conjugal rights.  That was an action which could be taken by a spouse who was deserted or excluded from the family home, with a view to ending the desertion or securing re-admission to the family home.  The action has fallen into disuse in this country; so far as is known no such <Col N="2349" /> action has been taken for more than 20 years now.  In England, the action was abolished in 1970.  The Law Reform Commission considered the matter in a report published in 1983 and recommended abolition here also.</P>
      <P>It appears that the action, when it was being used, was seldom taken with a view to enforcement of the decree sought, or even in the hope that the proceedings themselves would bring about a change of attitude by the spouse against whom they were directed.  Usually it was applied for as a means of establishing desertion in order, for instance, to assist or resist, as the case might be, an application for maintenance.  In a 1922 Irish case, the judge is recorded as saying that such decrees were sought in the expectation that they would not be obeyed, so as to lay the foundation for other proceedings, He said that penalties for failure to comply with an order were rarely, if ever, sought.</P>
      <P>There is a belief in some quarters that the action was one taken mainly if not exclusively by husbands although such limited statistics as are available &mdash; all of them English &mdash; suggest that the action was resorted to by wives as much as husbands. In any event, it is clearly not in accordance with present day ideas of personal liberty that any person should be ordered by a court to live with his or her spouse.  In relation to maintenance rights, I should mention that, since the 1976 maintenance legislation, the right of a spouse to apply for a maintenance order no longer depends on proof of desertion by the respondent spouse and the action now has no relevance for maintenance.</P>
      <P>One effect under our law of not complying with an order for restitution of conjugal rights is that the non-complying spouse is precluded from taking any share in the estate of the other spouse as a legal right or on intestacy.  However, since the action has fallen into disuse, this is of no practical consequence.  A spouse who has deserted the other for at least two years before the other's death has in any event forfeited his succession rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators may express surprise that a provision to abolish this action should be <Col N="2350" /> made the subject of a separate Bill.  My original intention was that the provision would be included in the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) (Amendment) Bill, 1987, which is also before the House.  However, I was advised that it would not be appropriate to include it in that Bill and, rather than wait further for a suitable Bill in which it might be included, it was decided to proceed as I now propose.  While essentially this archaic action has no practical effects, I am aware that abolition has been sought by some women's groups who find the action offensive.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to welcome these two Bills dealing with family law which are before us today and say how pleased I am that the precedent set by the introduction of the Status of Children Bill here last year is being continued by this Government.  Bringing the Adoption (No. 2) Bill and these family law Bills to this House to be passed by it before proceeding to the Dáil is recognising the special quality of debate in this Chamber and the concern with examining the detail of Bills.  It recognises that this House has the time, given more flexible Standing Orders and our shorter recesses, to deal with Bills in greater depth.  In the context of introducing important social legislation here I feel that this new initiative is a good one and I trust it will be maintained in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In welcoming this Bill and the other Bill I do so with a great sense of familiarity, having been the person in office responsible for the initiation of both of them and having done a great deal of work in their drafting.  I accept that the Bill we are discussing at present did not require a great deal of drafting.  Everyone knows that when it comes to reforming legislation it cannot just be pulled out of a hat, and one of the Bills before this House was instantly created by the relevant Ministers in this Government.  I am quite sure that the Minister does not intend to give that impression.  The Bills on the order paper, that is to say the family law Bills, and the Adoption (No. <Col N="2351" /> 2) Bill, are there because of the commitment and the work of the former Government.</P>
    <P>A great deal of in depth consideration, consultation and preliminary work on legislation was done by me in the Department of Justice.  While I am naturally grateful that this work has not been abandoned or substantially altered, as has happened after other changes of Government, and that the Government decided to bring the Bills forward, it tells us something about Fianna Fáil <i>vis-a-vis</i> social legislation.  The Minister will find that there is a good agenda of legislation in the family law area almost ready for him to introduce as compared with what I found in the Department of Justice when appointed in 1983.  Not one item of social legislation had been initiated, much less waiting in the wings ready to get the final touches and publication, as is the case now.  Fianna Fáil left a bare cupboard after them in 1981 and 1982 and did precious little in their years in office from 1977 to 1981.  Therefore, just as Fine Gael effected the transformation in Fianna Fáil's approach to the economy, I am glad to see that our influence in the area of social legislation is just as persuasive.</P>
    <P>In general the difference between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil as the main Opposition party goes rather deep.  Fine Gael in Opposition will not oppose social reform measures&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can not see the relevance of this to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which are in most instances long overdue and essential to the needs of a modem developed society. We have taken and will continue to take a responsible approach to legislation whether it is relating to legitimacy, adoption, family planning or family law reform.  We did not shirk the issue of divorce, nor will we do so in the future. These issues ought to be above party opportunism.  They are too sensitive and important in a human context for party point scoring.  We should all as legislators <Col N="2352" /> in both Houses give a lead in public attitudes to fighting intolerance, prejudice and discrimination.</P>
      <P>I turn to the Bill before us, and really it is a small Bill &mdash; one could even call it a puny Bill &mdash; the purpose of which is to abolish an old action of restitution of conjugal rights but, however short this Bill may be, it should not be underestimated. It is another step to take out of our legal system the concept that a married woman is the property of her husband.  I welcome this Bill, with one reservation which I will enter later, because there must be no area left in our laws which reflects one sex as subordinate or unequal to the other.  While laws alone will not change a society's attitude or immediately alter, for instance, the distorted perception of wives as their husbands' property &mdash; which from many aspects of the debate on the divorce referendum last year is still very prevalent &mdash; maintaining outdated concepts like this one is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>Under this action a spouse could by lawful means force the other spouse to cohabit against his or her will.  If a spouse failed to comply with a decree for restitution of conjugal rights a Statute enacted in 1813 provides for commital to prison for a period not exceeding six months for that non-compliant spouse. Indeed, husbands are on record as using extra-judicial methods to enforce their rights to their wives' company.  In the case of R. <i>v.</i> Jackson in 1891 a husband lay in wait with two other men for his erring wife as she came out of church one Sunday, seized her, took her home and kept her there against her will.  However, this less than refined manner of patching up a marriage did not succeed when a subsequent successful application for a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> set this wife free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This action was abolished in England in 1971 subject to a 1969 Law Reform Commission report which stated that it was intolerable interference with the freedom of individuals for the court to order adults to live together and that it is hardly an appropriate method of attempting to effect a reconciliation. Interestingly enough, between 1965 and <Col N="2353" /> 1967 in England there was 105 petitions for restitution and 31 decisions made, 11 to husbands and, again interestingly enough, 20 to wives.  Apparently these proceedings were brought at that time by wives seeking to take advantage of the courts' power to make ancillary orders, particularly maintenance orders.</P>
    <P>Our own Law Reform Commission in their sixth report in November 1983 recommended in favour of the abolition of this procedure and stated on page 12:</P>
    <P>International experience strongly suggests that reconciliation and conciliation are more successfully encouraged when the procedures are voluntary rather than compulsory.  We consider that more support for these procedures should be made available by the State through financial subsidy of existing marriage guidance and conciliation agencies, as well as through the creation of new conciliation services by way of pilot projects if necessary.</P>
    <P>The question I would like to ask the Minister about this Bill is why does he not go further and deal with the subject matter also included in the sixth Law Reform Commission report regarding jactitation of marriage.  A petition on a suit for jactitation is designed to prevent a person, the respondent, from making assertions that he or she is married to the petitioner. In recommending the abolition of this law the Law Reform Commission proposed replacement by a new remedy.</P>
    <P>I would like to have seen this issue included in this Bill, as was intended when I was in the Department, extending either total abolition or another remedy to give protection against false claims. While it is not an issue of critical importance, it is regrettable that when the opportunity presents itself, as it does with this Bill, we do not go all the way in dealing with the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission rather than doing it in a piecemeal way as is the case in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Fennell, I welcome the fact that the Minister has <Col N="2354" /> decided to introduce these family law Bills in the Seanad and to afford this House the first opportunity of considering them.  This Family Law Bill, 1987, is a very narrow and a very limited Bill which simply repeals and removes from our law a proceeding which had virtually fallen into disuse.  As a practitioner, I am not aware of any recent case brought before the Irish courts for restitution of conjugal rights.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the report of the Law Reform Commission, report No. 6 of 1983, and Senator Fennell has also quoted from that report.  In that report the Law Reform Commission in a footnote referred to the last reported Irish case as being in 1959, that of Hood against Hood.  They also refer to an unreported decision in 1962 in the case of D and D which was a case of a wife bringing proceedings and obtaining a decree against her husband for restitution of conjugal rights.  It is clear from the statistics which the Law Reform Commission referred to that in Britain and in this country the remedy was potentially open to either spouse but it is not of significance. Therefore although it is welcome that a Family Law Bill is being introduced here it would not be high on my priorities if I was ordering the priorities. The approach of the Law Reform Commission was correct and therefore I welcome the fact that the remedy is being removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fennell referred to a passage, which I was going to put on the record of the House, of the report of the Law Reform Commission in which they point out the importance of encouraging procedures for voluntary reconciliation between the parties and they look for more support in that area.  It would be helpful if the Minister could indicate in his reply whether, in bringing forward this rather narrow Bill to remove an old action which had fallen into disuse, he has taken on board the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission of the need for greater financial support and financial subsidy of marriage guidance and conciliation agencies and the expansion of conciliation services.  We have a <Col N="2355" /> pilot project on conciliation but I would welcome some indication from the Minister of the extent to which he places priority on this area because that would be of far more importance.  It was something that was considered in depth by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.</P>
    <P>I would welcome some indication from the Minister as to whether he accepts the recommendations of the joint committee on reconciliation, where the marriage can be brought together again and also on the technically more correct designation of conciliation where it is a question of helping a couple to resolve issues in a marriage which has broken down and where the partners are not going to come back together again but where instead of having to litigate all aspects of their family life thay are able to deal with these matters with the help of conciliation services.  We have had some initiatives in this area and I would welcome the Minister's view on the matter.</P>
    <P>Finally, because this is not a Bill on which to make long speeches, I join with Senator Fennell in asking why the Minister did not in this Bill deal also with the issue of jactitation of marriage.  As Senator Fennell has pointed out, the Law Reform Commission criticised, and did not recommend the continuation of, the present but very old and virtually unused proceedings.  They recommended their replacement by a different form.  The alternative would be to simply abolish them.  It would have seemed appropriate to have extended the Bill to deal with the two matters dealt with in the report of the Law Reform Commission.  I would welcome some indication from the Minister as to why he has only dealt with one matter.  I was going to ask him why this repeal of the action for restitution of conjugal rights requires a separate Bill but I think he had dealt with that in his speech when introducing the Bill.  He said he had originally intended to include it in the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) (Amendment) Bill, 1987. I can see that it would not be appropriate to that Bill because it is not appropriate <Col N="2356" /> to the Principal Act and to the long title of it.  In effect he was obviously advised to bring in a separate Bill to deal with it. It seems as though this Bill could have dealt with another minor reform which had been recommended by the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Robinson has said, this is not a Bill on which to make long speeches.  There are two points I want to make.  One concerns the memorandum accompanying the Bill.  As so often happens in these cases it tells us precisely nothing.  I cannot see any point in issuing explanatory memoranda unless they give us some extra information. It is interesting that at least one morning newspaper apparently misunderstood what this Bill is about.  It certainly stressed aspects of it which were not mentioned in the Minister's speech. I suggest therefore, not for the first time, to those responsible that explanatory memoranda should anticipate as it were, the main points of the Minister's speech. The Minister's speech is very explanatory. It states the case very satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>I notice that Senator Fennell instinctively welcomed the Bill as a further stage in the emancipation of women from what is allegedly a discriminated against status. This seems to ignore the information the Minister has given us, that the English experience has been that the action now being abolished was resorted to by women as much as by men.  It is time to challenge the gratuitous feminist assumption that all marital and sexual relationships are characterised by male dominance on the one hand and female enslavement on the other.  I certainly challenge that assumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill because it represents the disengagement of the State from an area in which it really has no business.  I wish the Church would move towards similar disengagements. However it seems there is an inconsistency in the Minister's statement when he says, &ldquo;In any event it is clearly not in accordance with present day ideas of personal liberty that any person should be ordered by a court to live with his <Col N="2357" /> or her spouse.&rdquo;  But is it not the effect precisely of the article in the Constitution which absolutely prohibits divorce, and the Government's insistence on supporting that article, that people are compelled to live with their spouses against their will?  Does that not represent a fundamental political inconsistency on the part of the Government?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Speeches so far on this Bill have been very brief and mine will be likewise.  I welcome the Bill.  The effects of it are not going to be earth shattering.  As I understand it, in over 20 years there has not been a case before the courts under the legislation we are proposing to abolish.  Therefore, the Bill, while on the Statute Books, has not been effective in trying to achieve whatever its purpose was.</P>
      <P>Under this legislation we are talking about bringing a couple before the courts to restore conjugal rights.  In a sense we are talking about the restoration of their marriage and we have to ask how that can be enforced.  There is no way the courts can enforce the restoration of any marriage.  If we grant the restoration of conjugal rights against the will of one partner we are talking about rape or a licence to rape.  No court, no law and no parliament would countenance that.  The case could arise, and the Minister referred to this in his speech, where, if an order is granted and one partner refuses to comply with it, that partner is in contempt of court.  The suspicion must be that in the cases where this law was applied in the past the motive was to create a situation of contempt which would be used in other courts to extract financial benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was a crude device, not to restore conjugal rights but as a motive for financial gain before the law at a future time.  In that sense we are well shut of this legal device.  If it could have played some part in the restoration of a marriage, there might have been some case for it, but clearly it could not and it did not do that. In our circumstances, the difficult task of trying to restore broken, marriages today <Col N="2358" /> rests almost entirely with the underfinanced marriage guidance clinics and marriage guidance counsellors.  Their task is a difficult one.</P>
    <P>My main point in speaking on this Bill this morning &mdash; it has the support of all people &mdash; is to draw attention to the nonappearance of that wide range of support services, of caring, advice and help, promised so glibly during the recent divorce campaign.  We have not, as yet, seen this raft of family legislation, although I have confidence in the good faith of the Minister in this regard.  I hope that during the present Parliament we will see many of the very necessary changes, upon which there is fairly general agreement among thinking persons in either House of Parliament, and many people outside, changes which need to be made and which were spoken about in the referendum debate.  What worries me even more is the silence from some of the major Church figures and spokespeople for the various Churches who promised so smoothy and so glibly during the referendum campaign to provide all the help possible afterwards.</P>
    <P>When we discuss a Bill like this it is an opportunity to reflect on that very unhappy episode in our recent history, to reflect upon the help that was promised, the very glib promises that were made and the smooth words which poured out so easily to people who found themselves in very difficult situations.  In the meantime we have had a deafening silence from the Church as to what now is possible. However, I would like the two Bills on marriage law which we are discussing this morning, to be seen as an earnest of the Minister's good intentions in this regard, that, during the course of this Parliament, we will see serious reforms in the area of family law since the divorce referendum did not provide one particular part of one answer to the problem faced by many people.  I have no intention of going over the whole referendum debate here again.  I am just making this point in passing.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is long overdue. Its effect will not be earth shattering, but I see it as an earnest of the Government's <Col N="2359" /> intention to bring in serious worthwhile reform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a brief comment on this short Bill.  Other speakers, particularly the two Senators who have an expertise in this area, made some very important comments from their experience as barristers and legislators. Far be it from me to query their expertise. That is not my intention.</P>
      <P>As a local representative I have been confronted with some of the problems being created by marriage breakdowns in rural Ireland and the fact that people are unable, for many reasons unfortunately, to live together.  The fact that similar legislation was abolished in England in 1970 does not convince me that we should follow suit.  We introduced this legislation because of a report from the Law Reform Commission and the fact that people had not been using this old common law action for the restitution of conjugal rights.  If there was any ground for the abolition of this old law, that must be it.</P>
      <P>Arising out of what the Minister said, there are a few points on which I want clarification.  As a public representative people come to me with a separation agreement prepared for them through the free legal aid scheme or some other channel, often, especially the female spouses, are totally unaware of their rights in this area or the consequences of the maintenance agreement that has been worked out for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the male spouse makes it impossible for his wife to live with him, nine time out of ten, the woman has to leave the home with no compensation and she is usually given responsibility for the children. That puts her at a disadvantage because she has no place to go.  She is dependent on relatives or friends and she is required to provide alternative accommodation for herself and her children out of the maintenance allowance, often a miserable pittance, granted in the family law courts.  That is an unfair imposition to make on the wife who is <Col N="2360" /> charged with responsibility for the children. It is impossible to get local authorities to take account of the fact that suddenly a mother and her children are homeless and there is great difficulty in getting them approved for rehousing because as far as some laws are concerned, the mother is still married and has access to the family home if she wishes to return, and put up with the torment and other unfair practices she experienced earlier.  We may not want to admit it but that is what happens.  The maintenance granted is usually £70 or £80 a week and it is very difficult for the woman to rent alternative accommodation and keep her family out of that pittance.  Many of these woman are unaware of what is facing them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons I raised the point in connection with the disadvantages that women have found, particularly in their maintenance agreements, was the need for them to provide alternative accommodation.  The reason I raised it is that since the 1976 maintenance legislation, the right of a spouse to apply for a maintenance order no longer depends on proof of desertion by the respondent spouse.  The action now has no relevance for maintenance.  Can I take it then that a spouse is entitled to maintenance while still living in her home, although not necessarily living with her husband, who is also in the <Col N="2361" /> home?  I hope I have made it clear that it can be difficult in some homes particularly as the man of the house at times precludes his spouse from the benefits of the marriage in that he almost ignores her and does not allow her any rights as regards housekeeping money or other ordinary requirements which one would expect of a happy marriage.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify if it is necessary for a spouse to leave her home and still claim in law for maintenance so that she could purchase food for herself and her children or does she have to formally leave home to get a maintenance agreement? These are some of the questions on which I have been trying to elicit information from the family law centre, particularly in the area of free legal aid and they usually respond by saying that they &ldquo;have already explained all this to the estranged woman, asking her to contact them again&rdquo;.  As a public representative who is sometimes confronted with this dilemma it is difficult to advise people properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also concerned &mdash; this goes back to the comment made by Senator Murphy &mdash; that right is not always necessarily on one side.  I am aware of a husband who has been deserted by his wife although there is no formal legal separation document and the woman is living elsewhere. The husband is still at home with his children and is unable to claim, as a married person, under the income tax code. I am unable to get anything but a single person's allowance for that man; although he is a married man, legally and morally and has a family, he is treated as a single person.  That is discrimination.  I have researched the case and discovered that the woman in this instance is not working or claiming her separate rights to tax free allowances under the tax code, although she is living with somebody else. Neither is she availing of a married allowance, even a common law married allowance, so there are anomalies in this area. Reference has been made to the previous referendum and the promises made to people about the commitment of the then Government and Opposition to legislation to assist people in difficulties.  I <Col N="2362" /> welcome the fact that there are two Bills on the Order Paper in that area.  I hope that the promises made by everybody concerned during the referendum will be fulfilled because people need assistance in many areas.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on Senator Manning's reference to the lack of assistance from the church.  My experience is to the contrary.  There are several church agencies which readily give assistance and advice, in the area covered by CURA or in marriage guidance counselling and people should request this assistance if they need it.  I hope it will not be construed from this debate that the church has not matched responsibilities in this area because I am personally aware that they have.</P>
    <P>Whereas this matter might be dealt with more specifically in the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) (Amendment) Bill, I hope that the Minister might be able to give me an indication if some of my concerns in this area are genuine.  I notice also from the Minister's speech that a spouse who has deserted the other for at least two years before his or her death has in any event forfeited any succession rights.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the legislation introduced by the Minister and compliment him on the speed with which he brought it to the House even though it is a very technical Bill.  It seems ludicrous to have a law on the Statute Book that compels two people to live together even though they may not be getting on with each other.  The penalty for not complying with that law is that they may be sent to prison.  One of the basic features of the obligations of spouses is the duty to cohabit.  Under the law, the wrongful failure to do so disentitles the spouse who fails to comply with this regulation to maintenance or succession rights.  It also infringes on their protection under the Family Home Protection Act, 1976. Where the spouse continues to cohabit, no proceedings may be taken even though one spouse is refusing to have <Col N="2363" /> marital relations with the other.  Conversely, the respondent could refuse to live with the petitioner and he or she will not be excused by supplying or offering to supply the petitioner with comfortable accommodation or financial support.</P>
      <P>One aspect of the statute worth mentioning which causes tremendous uncertainty about the present law relates to where one spouse may stop living with the other either by leaving home or by excluding the other spouse from the home.  In the case of the spouse who leaves the home, it could well be that the action for restitution of conjugal rights might be held to be inconsistent with one or more constitutional rights, the right to privacy, to earn a livelihood or the liberty of the person.  In the case of a spouse who excludes the other spouse from the home, it seems less likely that an action for the restitution of conjugal rights would be held to be inconsistent with the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Indeed, as well as an action for conjugal rights the excluded spouse would, in certain cases, be entitled to obtain an injunction ordering the offending spouse to desist from all conduct whatsoever that prevents the excluded spouse from reentering the home.  Many cases have been put forward to eliminate this legislation from our Statute Book or to amend or abolish the law relating to the restitution of conjugal rights.  As I mentioned before, it is contrary to the values in society, that we compel people to live together and that failure to do so may mean committal to prison.</P>
      <P>I have already mentioned that the action for the restoration of conjugal rights is inconsistent with the Constitution. It may not be consistent with the provisions of the Constitution, especially in cases where a spouse has left home or been excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, there might be a case to be made for the right to a maintenance order which is no longer dependent on proof of desertion by the respondent.  Therefore, the case for maintenance does not relate any longer to the existence of this law, thus constituting an argument in favour <Col N="2364" /> of its abolition.  If a spouse was sent to prison under the provisions of present legislation the consequent lack of financial support that would emanate from such a decision would render the other spouse, dependent on maintenance, even more of a pauper in terms of financial support.  The inclusion of property and succession rights no longer pertains.  As the Minister pointed out, if a spouse has deserted the other for at least two years before the spouses death, forfeiture of succession rights automatically takes place.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission in their report of 1983 advanced arguments that if we abolish the law relating to the restitution of conjugal rights that would remove the possibility of the two partners coming together again, having a change of heart and, as it were, coming to their senses.  It removes or eliminates the possibility of reconciliation.  I share Senator Robinson's view that it is much better in law to have a situation in which people can come together on a voluntary rather than a compulsory basis.  I would not share the archaic notion that we have to compel people to live together even though the manner in which they live their lives together leaves a lot to be desired.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris made a very important point.  Where there are two people living in the same house, even though in the eyes of the law they are not separated, the maintenance order is called into question because they still live under the one roof. This is an anomaly I have come across recently.  Senator Ferris mentioned to me before that he has come across cases in which the legal and social welfare systems have failed to come to grips with this lack of union, where the dwelling place still exists but, in effect, the marriage does not.  The fact that proceedings for restitution of conjugal rights have not taken place here for 20 years is sufficient evidence that they have outlived their usefulness. As the Minister explained, the relevant legal provision was eliminated in England in 1970.  As far as I can recall the provisions of that law were not invoked since 1844.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2365" /> The family law position obtaining here warrants attention, more support, mediation and conciliation in order to bring to a conclusion marriages that no longer exist or bring about reconciliation. This should be done by offering support services rather than enacting laws compelling people to live together even though in effect their marriages are at an end.</P>
    <P>As Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Senator Fennell was instrumental in initiating a mediation or conciliation service offering some support to married couples experiencing difficulty. This is the sort of support service I hope the Minister and his Department will expand thus providing people with adequate opportunities and support on a voluntary rather than compulsory basis.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  Though short, it is necessary in order to update the law in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It goes without saying that this Bill is welcome.  If I may be permitted, it is worth placing its provisions in context.  Like what used to be the law in criminal conversation &mdash; which is now extinct as well &mdash; this sort of law is a very interesting reflection on what are much flaunted in this country as traditional values.  There is an image portrayed by the moralists in our society of a society on the brink of collapse, in total decay, because all of what we understood to be traditional values were under assault; the family was under assault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one looks at the attitude of this much hankered-after traditional value society one finds inherent in it a series of laws and prohibitions, notwithstanding what Senator Murphy may say, which were offensive not only to women but constituted an extremely narrow and cruel definion of what a family ought to aspire to being.  It is quite ludicrous that the law would attempt to force people to live together simply because the law or society thought it was a good thing to do. It is quite ludicrous that a wife should ever have been, or still continue to be in some ways, treated as the property of her husband, as a thing.  It needs to be said <Col N="2366" /> that there is a considerable carry-over of that sort of value in a lot of male attitudes, in a lot of male conversation, in a lot of the sort of literature that men consume in the page three syndrome of some of the less intellectual British newspapers &mdash; an attitude of men towards women which is one of possession, of ownership, of subjugation, of control. Because those sorts of philosophical attitudes run so deeply, it is no real excuse to say there is discrimination against men too.  It is no real excuse to say that the problems within marriage are related to both partners in a marriage.  I have never understood this analysis &mdash; it applies to any minority or deprived group &mdash; that apparently the discrimination against the larger group, or the victims of the greater discrimination, somehow can be excused by saying there was a bit of misbehaviour on the other side or on the part of the other party also.</P>
    <P>It is the most awfully over-used cliché to say that two wrongs do not make a right.  The fact that some women perhaps do not play their rightful part in marriage or that other things happen which are not the fault of men does not in any way detract from the fact that we are still a male dominated society, based on male values, with assumptions about the role of men and women in society that run far deeper into the male subconscious than many of us are prepared to admit.  These little glimmers of wisdom which surface from time to time when anachronistic laws are repealed underline the depths of society's conviction that there was an order in society which was based on the primacy of the male sex.  The law in some ways encapsulates the values.  It is the more extreme manifestations only of that set of presumptions of dominance that are now being dealt with.  The fundamental, philosophical acceptance of the absolute equality of the sexes is a long way from being accepted.  For instance it is not accepted at all in my Church and will not, in my lifetime, be accepted in my Church, though my Church will waffle on for ever about the fact that its discriminations against women are not in any way discriminatory &mdash; that they are <Col N="2367" /> somehow different, because my Church's view of what God said happens to keep women in a secondary role.</P>
    <P>I say all of that because what is sometimes described as extremist feminism was mentioned by Senator Murphy.  The truth is that women have suffered economically, socially, physically and emotionally from a one-sided view of society.  The little efforts we make now &mdash; and we are inclined to pat ourselves on the back for what we do &mdash; are a long way from completing the task of the elimination of such discrimination.  There is a succession of practices that still continue. For instance, the Minister is quite well disposed and his Bill is quite progressive but he could talk to his colleagues in the Department of Social Welfare about the attitude of that Department towards women who are deserted.  The most painfully detailed requirements to prove desertion, the most painfully intimate questions are asked often by insensitive officials, both in terms of welfare benefit and in terms of supplementary welfare benefit.  The attitudes that are aspired to in legislation are very often totally absent in administrative practice.  Again, the inequality is reflected there.  It is no excuse to say that men sometimes suffer from these things too.  The truth is that, by and large, the people who have to go through these painful chores with the Department of Social Welfare are women and the fact that areas of equality in terms of income under social welfare are enforced upon us from outside the country reflects particularly poorly on us.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the fundamental deficiency of addressing the problems of inequality within marriage exclusively in terms of liberal legislation.  The fundamental problem that has to be addressed if there is to be equality within marriage is the economic dependence of many women and that reflects itself in salary, in property ownership, unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance and many areas like that.  Even where there is a postulation of equality, there is no such practice built in.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2368" /> The fact is that a dependent spouse is entitled to a smaller unemployment assistance income than the spouse, who tends predominently to be male.  If a couple separate the husband is left with the single person's allowance, the wife who is dependent on him gets an allowance equivalent to about £20 a week. That is quite extraordinary.  She has to live on her own, she gets the children's allowance as well but what she gets is substantially less than what the husband who has to live on his own will get.  There is no logical or rational justification for that.  It is fundamentally a view of the order of our society.  We are a society where value by and large is measured in terms of price and in terms of price women are undervalued within the philosophical presumptions of our society.</P>
    <P>This sort of Bill also invites us to reflect on the sort of society we are.  We are a society much given to long speeches about traditional values, the sanctity of the family and so forth.  We are a society much given to talking about ourselves as being somewhat superior to what we, in our more extreme flights of fancy, tend to describe as pagan Europe.  But the truth is, of course &mdash; that we are worse at supporting our families in terms of hard cash, of support services, of housing, in terms of all of those things than any other country in western or northern Europe.</P>
    <P>I know the argument can always be made that we are a poorer country but given that we regard these as the central values of our society it would be much easier to accept these central values of our society if our child benefits, our family income supports, housing, advice and all those things were seen to be part of an overall social strategy to sustain the family which we regard as the bedrock of society.</P>
    <P>In fact, the opposite is the case.  We have a structure in terms of welfare and housing, accentuated by the combined decisions of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael in recent times, which undermines the capacity of families to survive together, which deprives them of income support, which deprives them of hospital support, which will deprive them of educational <Col N="2369" /> support, which will deprive them of a whole series of advice and assistance that a family under stress needs and we do that in the interests of what we regard as an acceptable economic philosophy.</P>
    <P>The whole economic philosophy this country accepts attacks and undermines the family far more than any so-called dangerous radical like myself or Senator Norris or Senator Robinson who are often lambasted for undermining all our traditional values could ever do.  If I could undermine Irish conservatism as effectively as I am somehow accused of, I would be delighted to do so.  Unfortunately I cannot.  The economic philosophy pursued by this Government and advocated by the major Opposition party will undermine many very fundamental Irish values far more than anything I could every say.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill as far as it goes. However, I was a bit disturbed by the remarks attributed to the Minister that he did not have much in the line of proposals coming up in the area of dealing with the problem of marital breakdown.  This was attributed to him in the other House: it is a bit difficult talking about the other House when we are in the other House, but the Minister knows what I mean.</P>

      <P>I am not a lawyer and, incidentally, I want to repeat something I have said frequently here.  I do not think that Members of either House of the Oireachtas should apologise for the fact that they are not lawyers.  I have a very simple view of this.  If legislation cannot be presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas in a way which makes sense to the Members of the Oireachtas, it should not be legislation.  Legislation is the fundamental function of the Oireachtas and legislation should, therefore, be intelligible to the Members of the Oireachtas and they should not have to apologise because they are not specialists in the writing of law.  The writing of law is a different thing from the process of development of legislation.  Perhaps the Minister would have a word with the parliamentary draftsman about the fact that simple English is preferable to complicated English and it does not necessarily make the law any less precise.  I would look forward to that in what I am sure will be a large body of legislation from his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since we are talking about the question of conjugal rights and of families, I want to say that one area where the Minister could be very constructive would be in the area of the enforcement of maintenance orders; since he mentioned that in his speech I feel free to do so here.  People I know who have had maintenance orders made against their husbands will tell you that there is a certain stage you can get to and after that enforcement becomes virtually impossible.  There is a reluctance on the part of the gardaí to become involved and I can understand that but there is no point in getting involved in a <Col N="2371" /> whole plethora of legislation to do with the rights of spouses in marriages where there are difficulties if these rights cannot be enforced.</P>
    <P>Finally, and this is totally outside the scope of the Bill, I would like to ask the Minister, since we are talking about conjugal rights, if he could think about another area of society which is under his aegis, that is the whole possibility of conjugal visits for the 2,000 or 3,000 people who populate our prisons at any given time.  It would do more than most things to sustain those families over periods of pain and suffering.  It is not a ludicrous idea.  Even in illiberal societies like the United States the idea has been accepted and implemented.</P>

The Minister has a better reputation or a better record in the area of prison reform than perhaps he would be given credit for; I will say that.  I know what the Minister did when he was Minister for Justice and it was far more than many of those did who would perhaps talk more liberally. He deserves credit for it and perhaps his reforming zeal might move in that direction.</P>

      <P>I may wander just a little bit because I did not intend to speak this morning but I feel I simply must respond to some things my distinguished colleagues have said.  Or course, I approve of the Bill.  It takes us back to a period in which women were simply property or chattels and this is a diminishing of the human dignity of individuals.  I very much welcome the Bill.  It is long overdue and I congratulate the Minister on introducing it.  It is short, specific legislation, <Col N="2372" /> a businesslike thing which we all must welcome.</P>
      <P>However, I would like to take issue with some of the things I have heard here this morning from my colleagues.  I refer particularly to the putting in context of this Bill and this notion that there must be more support in cases of marital breakdown, more mediation, more money spent, more taxation and I tell you why I would withdraw my assent from this.  It is a matter in which the Minister either has taken an interest or has ignored perhaps in the past but will certainly in the New Year be required to take an interest in it, that is, the question of the recognition of the status of relationships between persons of the same sex.  The Minister, I am sure, is well aware of the quotation from the American Revolution, &ldquo;No taxation without representation.&rdquo;  As far as I am concerned as a single man, no taxation without participation.  I was greatly distressed to read the report of many committees of inquiry established by the State, including the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown because I support many women's issues and it was a cause of great disappointment to me that Members of this House, including lawyers, saw fit to sign that document which started off on the premise that persons of the same sex should never have their relationships recognised.  The mis-titled Law Reform Commission in their submissions made very much the same point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to subvert the family because I regard myself as belonging to it in some odd or remote way.  Unlike Topsey, I do not &ldquo;specs I growed.&rdquo;  I emerged from a family and it is not my intention to subvert the family.  It is not my desire either to be taxed to the hilt in order to support a framework which is the bedrock of society, the expression of normality, which is part of the divine intention but in which I am specifically and deliberately disbarred from participating. With all these things assumed in its favour the heterosexual family unit ought to be able to work without my <Col N="2373" /> support financially as a single person.  I am in the 58 per cent tax category.  I do not wish to be mean, cheese-paring or niggardly but the Minister will understand that in times of financial stringency it is very galling to be expected to support financially institutions from which one is deprived of participation, with the apparent approval and consent of the women's movement.  I look for some support from the women on this very important matter. They signed these documents.  I hope they will be educated into refusing to sign any such offensive material in future.</P>

      <P>I am extremely glad that the last speaker clearly indicated to the House at the outset that he was going to speak outside the scope of the Bill.  I would like to thank the Senators for their comments on this short Bill.  The notion that a court can order a person to live with his or her spouse is clearly a relic of bygone days and one we can well do without.  Of course, I am happy that no one in this House will be sorry to see it go.  I thank Senators for their contributions.  I am not going to do what is done every Sunday evening and give the award for the man of the match or the woman of the match. It was an interesting and worthwhile debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry Senator Brendan Ryan is not in the House because he would enjoy what I am going to say.  It is a great pity he did not go to the trouble of making sure of what was and what was not attributed to me before he made certain assertions here today because as recent as 24 June, during the course of an address by me at the launching of the Family Lawyers Association in Blackhall Place under the most capable chairmanship of a former and distinguished Member of this House, Catherine McGuinness, I said &mdash; and I will repeat because it is necessary to repeat it &mdash; that my proposals for new legislation in regard to judicial separation are advanced.  I said that the new grounds for a decree of judicial separation &mdash; the present grounds <Col N="2374" /> are adultery, cruelty and unnatural practices &mdash; will include desertion and separation for a specific period and such other grounds as may appear desirable either as additional grounds or in substitution for an existing ground, i.e., unnatural practices, following full consideration of the matter.  I said also that I am having examined the question of giving the court in separation proceedings powers to make order for the secured maintenance, lump sum payments and orders in relation to property owned by the spouses.  Proposals for more informed hearings and for the use of counselling and mediation services are also being considered in connection with this legislation. That was a very positive statement and it attracted great attention by the media.  To the best of my knowledge it was printed verbatim in at least two of the national newspapers, <i>The Irish Times</i> and the <i>Cork Examiner.</i>  I fail to understand how Senator Ryan could believe, if he had done any research whatsoever before making his contribution here this morning, that I had any intention other than those I spelled out as recently as a couple of weeks ago.  This is a totally non-political matter and it is important that contributions to it should be worthwhile ones and stances should be not accredited to a person such as myself which are totally untrue.</P>
    <P>I recognise that Senator Robinson has a very genuine interest in this area.  I accept and respect that.  We have differed in the past in different fora but always in a dignified way.  I have always respected her viewpoints even though at times I could not accept them but that is as it should be.  She inquired about the position regarding the Government for conciliation services.  As Senators will be aware, a pilot scheme of conciliation between spouses whose marriages have broken down was launched in July 1986 and is to be evaluated after three years. It is too early as of yet to say what should be done in future in this matter.  I intend to wait until the pilot scheme has been evaluated before making recommendations to the Government on the matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2375" /> I want to reply to a number of points raised by Senator Fennell.  I will deal at a later stage with the political content of her contribution.  I will deal initially with the more serious part of it and gently tease her on the political points she made before I conclude.  Senator Fennell inquired why other items dealt with in the Law Reform Commission's report have not been included in this Bill.  The proposal to abolish proceedings for the restitution of conjugal rights is a straightforward and a non-contentious one and can be easily implemented in one section of a Bill.  As I said earlier, the original intention was to have this provision included with proposals in the other Bill &mdash; the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) (Amendment) Bill which we will probably get an opportunity to move on to this morning.  However, this did not prove technically possible.  The remaining recommendations of the Law Reform Commission's report, eight in all, are related to each other and are considerably more complex.  They are being examined in my Department along with other proposals in the area of family law.  Rather than hold this proposal over until another more suitable legislative vehicle came before the House, the Government on my recommendation decided to give it a Bill to itself.</P>
    <P>I could be forgiven for reminding Senators that the Bill we are now discussing and which everybody says something should have been done about a long time ago rested under the political wings of Senator Fennell when she had the very comfortable position of a Minister of State in the Department of Justice for three years but when she did nothing about it.</P>

I will give <Col N="2376" /> the Senator credit for everything she did during her term of office as Minister of State with responsibility in this area.  I will give everybody credit where it is due irrespective of what party they belong to. To the best of my recollection, the only legislation that reached finality in the Houses of the Oireachtas that could be seen clearly to have been handled wholly and totally by Senator Fennell was the Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act, 1986.  She introduced in another place, the Status of Children Bill but that has not reached finality within the Oireachtas to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to bring this Bill <Col N="2378" /> before the House.  Its purpose is to amend the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981 &mdash; which I brought to this House at that time; I had better put that marker down now &mdash; so as to give the courts more flexibility in dealing with applications for protection in cases of domestic violence.  It will mean that a court will, henceforth, have the option of granting a protection order as an alternative to and separately from a barring order.  At present, on an application under the 1981 Act, it is only open to the court to grant or refuse a barring order.  It may, pending a decision on the application, make a protection order where it considers that the safety or welfare of the applicant spouse or child requires it.  However, as the present law stands, the protection order is of an interim nature only and, once the case is decided, it ceases to have effect.</P>
      <P>Representations were made, notably by the AIM Group for Family Law Reform, that a barring order, which excluded the offending spouse entirely from the family home, could be too drastic a remedy in some instances and, indeed, could be counter-productive in that it had a potential for estranging spouses permanently from each other and rendering attempts at reconcilation more difficult.  It was felt that, rather than having a situation where a spouse who is threatened with violence in the family home is put in the predicament of having to apply for a barring order excluding the other spouse from the family home or being left with no effective remedy, it would be helpful if it were possible to obtain a protection order in its own right, prohibiting the offending spouse from using violent or threatening behaviour towards, or otherwise molesting, the applicant spouse or a child of the family. Such an order would not exclude the offending spouse from the family home, but would serve a warning on him or her and any breach of the order would, as with a barring order, render that spouse liable to arrest without warrant and to a fine or imprisonment, or both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole matter was considered in consultation with the various services <Col N="2379" /> directly involved, including the courts' administration, the Probation and Welfare Service of the Department of Justice and, also, solicitors attached to the Legal Aid Board.  There was general agreement that amendment of the law on the lines that had been suggested would represent a definite improvement on the present situation, and the Bill now before the House is the outcome.  The Bill follows the commitment for in the Fianna Fáil <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to amendthe law to protect women against domestic violence.</P>
    <P>If I might now review briefly the provisions in the Bill, effectively, the Bill takes the first five sections out of the 1981 Act and substitutes for them provisions of a like nature.  However, these are phrased so that the court will have the option of making either a barring order, excluding the respondent spouse from the family home, or, alternatively, a protection order prohibiting that spouse from using or threatening to use violence towards, molest or put in fear the applicant spouse or a child of the family.  A third possibility that will be open to the court will be to grant both a barring order and a protection order.  This would be equivalent to a barring order granted under the 1981 Act at present which includes a prohibition on the use of violence etc., as provided for in section 2(2) of that Act.  There is also provision, in section 3(2) of the Bill, under which the court may make a protection order pending a decision on the application; this would correspond to the protection order which can at present be made under section 3 of the 1981 Act.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections of the Bill are of a technical nature and do not call for comment at this stage.</P>
    <P>This Bill, as I have already mentioned, is in response to a need pointed out by interest groups concerned with family law matters.  I trust it will have the support of Senators on all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the statement the Minister made on the occasion when <Col N="2380" /> he quoted from his concluding remarks in the last Bill.  I am certainly very pleased to know he affirms the proposals made by the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown on which I think there is broad consensus of agreement.  I assure the Minister of the full support of the Fine Gael Party for the proposals he is bringing forward.  We all recognise, and perhaps it was brought home very forcibly to us during the debate on the divorce referendum last year, that there is a need to progress, be it carefully if slowly, in all these areas on which we have had no action for a number of years.</P>
      <P>I am quite sure the Minister will accept that progress on this kind of legislation, given our Constitution and the difficulties that drafting legislation can run into <i>vis-a-vis</i> the various constitutional provisions, is slow and tedious and it is perhaps prudent to be cautious and to proceed reasonably slowly.  The Minister is fortunate to have the recommendations and proposals of the all-party committee in the report before him when he continues the work started by the previous Government.  I welcome his statement which I saw in the papers and I am very pleased he has given this commitment.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which is intended to enable a court to make a protection order prohibiting a spouse from using or threatening to use violence against, molesting or putting in fear the other spouse or a child, as an alternative to and separately from a barring order, which has the effect of barring a spouse from the family home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original legislation which introduced barring orders dates from 1976. That Act was reviewed and replaced in 1981 by the Family Law (Protection of Spouse and Children) Act, 1981, which brought in improvements like increasing the duration of the barring order from three months to one year.  It also enabled a spouse seeking a barring order to obtain a protection order, which was in the nature of an injunction prohibiting the respondent from using violence and, thirdly, the Garda were given powers of arrest without warrant for breach of the <Col N="2381" /> barring order or protection order, powers which they did not have prior to that.</P>
    <P>This proposal to amend the legislation on family violence, as the Minister said in his speech, came directly from the AIM Group for Family Law Reform, and is the result of their findings in dealing with cases of marriage breakdown.  Last September they wrote making representations to amend the 1981 Act so that the court would be able to make a protection order as an alternative to a barring order and for the same maximum period of one year, subject to renewal.  I was interested at the time they made that submission for amendment that the issue of separate protection orders had been considered in 1976 and 1981 when the Bill was being drafted and amended and no good reason was seen for having this as a separate measure.  This illustrates perhaps the importance of consultation with groups.</P>
    <P>Of course it is important to consult with legal practitioners but also with other groups such as the AIM Group for Family Law Reform and Women's Aid and the other organisations that are actually working practically on the ground with couples and can pick up and identify difficulties or proposed improvements that are necessary.</P>
    <P>However, I certainly accept the arguments that the AIM group put forward to support this measure, in that because a barring order was or is such a drastic measure and in effect results in many cases in permanently barring a husband and father from the home and estranging him from his children, that many wives who needed the protection &mdash; even as a deterrent &mdash; would not consider taking out a barring order.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there are wives who apply for a barring order because of repeated and severe violence, yet for any number of reasons they fail in their efforts to have their husbands barred when it comes to a court case, and must return home to the house, more vulnerable than before and without hope of legal protection. This group is very large indeed and to illustrate I give figures from one <Col N="2382" /> district court area, the Dublin Metropolitan District Court Area, which does not include Dún Laoghaire, for the years 1985 and 1986.  During 1985 the number of applications for barring orders in this area was 1,856 and only 516 orders were made.  Even if we presume that up to 10 per cent of the applicants decided voluntarily not to pursue the cases &mdash; that is a higher than realistic percentage &mdash; we have a distressing statistic to consider.  In one District Court area alone there are at any time 1,000 families with no legal protection from a perceived threat of violence.</P>
    <P>For the year 1986 the number of applicants increased to 1,927 while the number of orders granted showed a reduction to 448.  The statistics refer to the same area, the Dublin Metropolitan District Court Area.  Again this leaves over 1,000 applicant spouses rejected by the courts.  May I say this is consistent with the information I get from the various Women's Aid homes around the country and hostels to which women go to when violence erupts in the home, and in many instances it is where they stay until the court hears their case.</P>
    <P>In this context when we examine the statistics for 1983, we find vastly differing figures.  Of 1,697 applications to the District Court, roughly half or 848 were granted, which is double the number for two years which I mentioned.  Why has the figure changed so dramatically?  I believe it is because of the Supreme Court case of O'B. <i>v.</i> O'B., 1984, in which judicial interpretation had moved towards refusal of a barring order unless physical violence was occurring.  I am aware that the view of the Oireachtas Joint Committee, who considered this very widely, was that barring orders should continue to be obtainable where the health, safety and welfare of a spouse or children were at risk.  I quote from pages 68 and 69 of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown report.</P>
    <P>The Committee observed that prior to the O'B judgment.  Barring Orders had been granted in some cases as a <Col N="2383" /> form of enforced separation and in situations where the marriage had broken down.  Following the O'B decision, the Committee notes that judicial interpretation has moved towards refusing the making of an Order unless physical violence is occurring.  The Committee is of the opinion that this rigid interpretation of the Act may have the effect of denying some persons a remedy under the Act where it can be strongly argued that the conduct of the offending spouse, though not physically violent, is such as to place the safety and welfare of the other spouse and/or children at serious risk.</P>
    <P>The Committee is concerned that this uncertainty which is a consequence of judicial inconsistency should be replaced by a clear re-statement of the law relating to Barring Orders, if necessary by amending legislation.</P>
    <P>I question whether the Minister has examined this proposal and the focus of attention it was given in the report.  Certainly the figures I quoted indicate that is a very definite change of practice.</P>
    <P>One ought to elaborate on the kind of family cases we are talking about.  I have had experience of these families over many years through my work in the women's advice centre in the AIM group and dealing, as many other politicians do, with a high number of cases in my constituency advice centres.</P>
    <P>This problem of family violence knows no social groupings or geographical locations.  The only difference is that wives deal with it in their own individual ways.  Some women accept violence from their husbands and never seek assistance. I have known cases where wives kept this problem indefinitely from even their very close family.  They do so because they feel there is no relief outside marriage, unfortunately, and in many instances this is the case.  Mistakenly, many women will not divulge this problem because they feel it will break up the family and their children will suffer.  The reality is that the children, in many instances, in later years will tell social workers that they would <Col N="2384" /> have preferred if the wife and husband had separated because of the intolerable violence and aggression in the home.</P>
    <P>There was a greater incidence of women not divulging this problem and not doing anything about it before 1975 than there has been since then.  With the introduction of the 1975 legislation greater numbers of women began to seek help.  Most wives will not easily seek a barring order.  They do not want to have their husbands barred from the home.  It is only when the provocation is serious and creating a grave family problem that wives seek the shelter that a barring order gives them.  Very many tell you they are doing so now for the children's sake. However, once the application is made, many women live in fear of retribution from their spouses in the interim between the serving of the order and the hearing of the case even though, since 1981, they would have had the protection of protection orders.  It is regrettable that many women have no legal representation in court because of the high cost.  One can envisage the home situation when these wives fail to get a barring order in court. They feel their husbands now have greater power over them than before because the protection order would have lapsed under our present system.  After the court hearing they are left to endure whatever treatment is meted out to them unless in a subsequent attack they are so badly injured that the gardaí have to intervene and then a barring order is forthcoming.  It is sad that this is often the case.</P>
    <P>We still see only the tip of the iceberg regarding family violence, and legal, judicial and social support provisions to deal with it are patently inadequate.  For instance, there are a number of towns where there are no shelters for the victims of violence.  We have come a long way, one might think, with hostels for battered wives in Limerick, Cork, Galway, Bray and a couple in Dublin.  As far as I know there is none in the midlands.  I had contact this week with a social worker in one of the hostels about a recent case which was heard in Tullamore District Court.</P>
    <P>In June 1986 a husband brought home <Col N="2385" /> three men from the pub and he invited his three friends to have intercourse with his wife.  As the husband watched, the men took up the invitation.  Neighbours heard the screaming and shouting of this woman and eventually rescued her and called the Garda.  The husband and companions were arrested and charges were pressed by the Garda.  Within two days that wife was pleading to have the case quashed.  However, because of the grievous nature of what they had witnessed the gardaí went ahead with the case in the district court.  The outcome was that the case against the husband was struck out.  The three defendants, who were charged with aiding and abetting, breach of the peace, common assault and indecent assault, were fined £500 each.  The judge in this case claimed that he would have jailed the three men for a year but for the fact that the husband had been involved in inviting them into the house.</P>
    <P>This is a very distressing case and many questions could and should be asked about it.  This was effectively a gang rape. Irish women are all victims when such an outrageous act occurs and the penalties handed down by our courts fail to reflect the seriousness of the offence.  As we have been discussing the quality of family life and the recognition within all our communities of the fact that women are at risk and are still regarded as the husband's property in marriage, we have to be concerned that there is no provision in many towns and many areas for women who want to escape from intolerable marriages and marriages where there is violence.</P>
    <P>Once again we must focus on the question of the training of judges and district justices.  Men and women dealing with family law cases should receive special training on the social, psychological and other non legal aspects of family relationships. We have no formalised provision for such training here such as exists in Australia where the Family Law Act, 1975 provides that for appointment to a family court a person must be a suitable person to deal with matters of family law by reason of training, experience and personality.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2386" /> I accept that among the Judiciary here there are men and women who would qualify under this requirement as being suitable by reason of training, experience, and personality, but they are in a minority.  Because the public see such wide disparities of sentencing, there is understandable concern at the lack of training to improve the administration of family law in the courts.</P>
    <P>It will be interesting and highly relevant, to monitor the effects of the Bill before us in the courts.  I have no doubt whatever that it will be welcomed by social workers, counsellors, lawyers and the Judiciary, but I hope its provision will not lead to a more unsatisfactory situation than at present exists for cases of chronic domestic violence where a court will decide more often than not that a protection order is the better of two evils and will leave some wives, who genuinely need and are seeking to have a violent man barred, without this vital protective measure.  However, we will wait and see the results.  I ask the Minister to let me know on what date the Bill will come into force after passing through both Houses.</P>
    <P>I turn now to a different but related aspect of this question, the fact that family cases are heard in <i>camera.</i>  I am uncertain about the provision in section 14 of the Principal Act that &ldquo;Proceedings under this Act shall be heard otherwise than in public&rdquo;.  There is general unease, which I share, about the fact that thousands of family law cases are dealt with every year in our courts behind closed doors, with no reporting of the facts or the conclusions.  In 1975 when the legislation was first introduced I supported the notion of the <i>in camera</i> ruling.  Now, ten years on, lessons have been learned to indicate a rethink on this matter.  First, public opinion has become more sensitive to the issue.  Ten years ago most women felt ashamed and guilty if their husbands beat them and they needed total anonymity in court.  We now know from several surveys, latterly from the recent EC study of violence in the family in Ireland, that there is absolutely no support for the idea that a husband has a right to use <Col N="2387" /> violence against the wife.  The EC studies show that nine out of ten people interviewed for the survey said there were no circumstances in which this could be justified.</P>
    <P>One important consequence of the present <i>in camera</i> hearing is to create the impression that we do not have marital problems in Ireland.  If the public do not bear and read about the thousands of cases of court hearings for maintenance, guardianship and barring orders, it could be perceived that there is only a small problem with our marriages.  This is very far from the truth.  Ireland has a marriage breakdown crisis and the electorate out there had better accept that fact.  Look at how public opinion has changed on the issue of rape, for instance, and the consensus now that stronger legislation is needed to deal with it.  This, I feel, is directly due to the reporting and debating of cases.  We have to question the practice of withholding the facts and information on marital breakdown cases from the public.  While I have not had any really clear submission on the matter from organisations dealing with the law, or women's organisations, I believe it is timely to consider amending section 14 of the 1981 Act to allow if possible a limited system of reporting of family cases but preserving the anonymity, the names of the persons involved.  This proposal was made by the AIM group in 1984 but it has not been followed up by them.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation.  It is very desirable and very necessary.  It will give legal shelter to a great number of families who at present are unprepared to seek a barring order because they know that in effect it can lead to a form of Irish divorce and can be totally contentious.  I have been told by women that they would welcome a protection order which would give the Garda authority to arrest the husband if he is in breach of the order. This would be a deterrent and would be a great deal more positive than the barring order which I can accept is not always necessary.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the many <Col N="2388" /> people involved in organisations such as the AIM group, Women's Aid, Gingerbread, FLAC, Marriage Counselling Service and the CMAC, who give their time voluntarily to inform, support and help people involved in marriage disputes. I include in my tribute also those who give refuge to the victims of domestic violence.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I hope this new measure will be enforced.  There is a feeling of frustration among the organisations who are dealing with this problem every day in the courts.  They realise it is extremely difficult to get the Garda to enforce these orders.  This is something that should be considered because there is going to be an increase in the number of cases coming before these organisations and it will not be good enough if this Bill adds to their workload.  I ask that the enforcing of this measure be carefully watched, I welcome the Bill and support it.</P>

      <P>As we have been told, this is a Bill to amend the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981.  It will enable the courts to be more flexible in dealing with domestic violence by enabling them to grant protection orders independently of barring orders.  I welcome this Bill.</P>
      <P>First, I would like to deal with barring orders.  A barring order is a very extreme measure because when it is introduced it leaves one of the partners very bitter and disappointed in being barred from his or her house.  It can also remove the prospect of reconciliation between the spouses.  There is no suitable remedy available to the courts to protect a spouse when the making of a barring order would be too drastic a step to take.  I have met people who were barred from their homes and the effect it has on them is unbelievable.  They are usually very sorry for the actions which caused the barring order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very important amendment which allows for a protection order to be made prohibiting a spouse from using or threatening to use violence against a spouse or a child.  It does not mean that the person will be barred from the house <Col N="2389" /> but if he or she uses violence or threatens the spouse or the children when a protection order is in force, he or she would be in breach of the order and that would render him or her liable to arrest and to be charged with the offence.  I also notice there is provision in the Bill for a court to introduce both a barring order and a protection order.  This is a very good idea and will be welcomed by families and spouses.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> published earlier this year, my party committed themselves to amending the law so as to give further protection to women caught up in material violence. The introduction of this Bill honours that commitment and represents a very worthwhile improvement in the family law code of the country.  I congratulate the Minister for introducing the Bill which is very necessary and also in having two family law Bills before this House today.  I support this very worthwhile Bill. Its introduction is timely.</P>

I agree with those who have advised the Minister.  He has mentioned groups such as AIM and lawyers in the family law centres.  Senator Fennell has also welcomed this development.  It has been the experience that it was insufficient to have the possibility of applying for a protection order as sub-stage in an application for a <Col N="2390" /> barring order.  In many instances a protection order provides adequate relief and is the appropriate order.  It certainly is better that the courts dealing with this very important area would have the maximum flexibility.  The Bill is very welcome in seeking to ensure that there is that flexibility.</P>
    <P>The Minister has carried over from the Principal Act, the 1981 Act, the grounds on which either a protection order or a barring order could be applied for.  This is referred to in section 3 (1) (a) of the Bill before the House which states it is &ldquo;an order (in this Act called a &lsquo;protection order&rsquo;) prohibiting the other spouse (in this Act called &lsquo;the respondent spouse&rsquo;) from using or threatening to use violence against, molesting or putting in fear the applicant spouse or the child&rdquo;.  The grounds relate to the protection of the safety or welfare of the spouse.  In the extract of the report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown, to which Senator Fennell has already referred, a concern was expressed.</P>
    <P>I recall, as a member of that committee, that the way in which the 1981 Act has been interpreted, particularly in a decision of the Supreme Court, was fully discussed by the committee.  In effect, the Supreme Court has construed the grounds for seeking a barring order &mdash; and that would also apply to a protection order &mdash; as requiring misconduct, physical violence or a threat of violence.  The Bill intends to protect the welfare and safety of spouse and children.  The joint committee recommended &mdash; looking again at the 1981 Act and perhaps seeking to redefine more clearly &mdash; that there are circumstances where there may not be either actual misconduct or risk of physical violence which places the spouse or children at risk and which would require either a protection order or, in more serious circumstances, a barring order.</P>
    <P>At this stage I would ask the Minister to consider the recommendation of the joint committee to which Senator Fennell referred.  That recommendation was arrived at by the joint committee after very considerable discussion and after considering submissions made by other <Col N="2391" /> bodies who were concerned about the difficulty subsequent to that Supreme Court case &mdash; I do not want to say too much about it because I was involved professionally in that case and indeed won on appeal to the Supreme Court, but the implications of it are somewhat worrying.  It narrowed the understood grounds on which a barring order could be obtained.  This Bill gives us an opportunity to have a very careful look at the statutory grounds on which the relief of either a barring order or a protection order is available.</P>
    <P>There was another recommendation of the joint committee to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention, namely, paragraph 7.7.15, page 70, of the report of the committee.  It referred to the absence of any concern about the barred spouse, that is, the spouse who has actually been barred from the home on foot of relief obtained by the other spouse. The joint committee said:</P>
    <P>A most unsatisfactory aspect of the present structure in relation to the making of Barring Orders is that, in practically all cases, no help is available to a person whose conduct has led to him or her being barred.</P>
    <P>That person is simply removed from the family home for a period of months or years during which time they are given no professional help to form an insight as to why their conduct was unacceptable, or to ensure that similar conduct will not recur.  This is yet another example of the complete lack of any adequate welfare or counselling service being available to those whose family difficulties are dealt with through the courts.</P>
    <P>Then the committee made broad recommendations for a reformed family court structure, including a much more developed family and welfare system. That is something we should consider in the context of this Bill.</P>
    <P>They are my main comments on the reforms the Bill proposes to introduce and which I warmly welcome.  I want to <Col N="2392" /> turn now to the rather significant limitations of the Bill, which are particularly important in the area of child sexual abuse.  They may not be entirely confined to the area of child sexual abuse, but I can make my own submissions more clearly by looking at the area of child sexual abuse.  It is an area which has become increasingly serious in Ireland as in other countries.  The number of cases coming before the courts, and the number of very serious problems have increased mainly, I think, because at last we have begun to provide ways of coping with this serious problem.  We had a hidden problem but now that we have begun to have expertise, training and a place for people to go when children have been sexually abused, we are beginning to see problems coming through the courts, and I think we are going to see more of them.  I know from my colleagues who specialise in family law that we are seeing more of it at the moment.  There are very few family lawyers at the moment who do not have several child sexual abuse cases in their present file of cases.</P>
    <P>Until recently the approach to child protection legislation assumed that the most appropriate way to protect the child who was suffering from serious sexual abuses in the family was to remove the child from the home.  This was by way of a place of safety order or similar move to actually get the child out of the family.  It was appreciated that the removal of a child may cause serious problems.  It may cause a feeling of guilt in the child that the child is breaking up the family, and it may also cause the child to feel that he or she is being punished for having told somebody about the occurrence of sexual abuse.  Where the abuser is the father of the child, the removal of the child presents an opportunity for the father to influence his wife and to get her support against the child if any action is taken, for example, by a health board.  There is a very serious problem at times in relation to that.  Also, if one child is removed it may be that other children in the same household would be at risk.  Perhaps most significant of all in this very vulnerable <Col N="2393" /> situation, the continuity of the child's relationship with other members of the family, with mother and siblings, can be seriously endangered and the child can be intensely unhappy having been brought into care or placed in fosterage. In that context the protection order could be an important way of providing for the circumstances under which a child can remain in a family home but where there is protection, and if necessary, it can lead to a barring order barring a spouse from the home.</P>
    <P>Having described the situation that way, it is clear from the analysis that there are serious limitations, and it is on those limitations I want to focus.  The first limitation, and it is one that is continued in this Bill, is that the remedy of either a protection order or a barring order is only available against a spouse.  I hope the Minister, when replying to the Second Stage debate, will explain why this remedy should only be available against a spouse. There is nothing in the Principal Act or in the long title of this Bill, which is the same in effect, which requires that the remedy of a protection order or a barring order would be confined to being available against a spouse.  The Bill says it is a Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) (Amendment) Bill.  It is to protect spouses and children but it does not say protection of spouses from action by spouses.  It is not that narrowly confined.</P>
    <P>In the area of child sexual abuse it is extremely important that we do not confine the relief and remedy purely to being an action which can be brought against spouses because the experience of practitioners, and I think of social workers and health board workers who are dealing with child sexual abuse is that relatively frequently it is not the father spouse who is the abuser.  It may be a brother, a stepfather, uncle, or a grandfather. Usually it can be any male in the household.  Therefore, it is very important that we afford protection to children against any person in that household who has been sexually abusing a child.  I propose to table an amendment on Committee Stage to extend the remedy to any <Col N="2394" /> person who is living in the household.  I say that because if one starts to define members of a family it can become quite complex.  It could be a lodger in the household.</P>
    <P>The important thing is that within a family context the remedy of either a protection or barring order is available with all the accompanying support and relief, the Garda are immediately alerted, and if the protection order is not adequate you can move for a barring order.  It is a simplified procedure.  Lawyers are familiar with it.  It works in as effective a way as any other relief whereas the alternative at the moment is if the husband is not involved you have to apply for a High Court injunction, a very complex and difficult relief to obtain.  That is the first area where I would like to see the protection in this Bill extended to allow spouses and children to be protected by way of either protection or barring order from someone other than the spouse, particularly where the welfare of children is at issue.</P>
    <P>A more sensitive area but also one we must consider on Committee Stage is whether it is adequate as the Principal Act provided and as this amending Bill provides that only the spouse can apply for a barring or protection order either for &mdash; again I am taking the normal pattern &mdash; her own protection or the protection of the children.  That in the area of child sexual abuse provides for very serious limitations on the effectiveness of the remedy because it is the experience of those who deal with child sexual abuse that it can sometimes be extremely difficult, for a variety of reasons, to get a wife to take proceedings for a protection or barring order against her husband.  She may not accept that there has been child sexual abuse by her husband or if she does accept it she may be afraid to bring proceedings.  There are very serious reasons for a wife not being prepared &mdash; even where there is clear evidence that the child has been abused &mdash; to institute proceedings and look for either a protection or a barring order.  At the moment if she does not this relief cannot be obtained as nobody else can do it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2395" /> I am thinking of the welfare of children. It seems that where there is very serious sexual abuse of a child or indeed, in some instances, severe physical abuse of a child, and where a wife is reluctant to take any step, in serious circumstances a health authority ought to be able to make application to the court for a protection or a barring order.  I am aware that this is a very sensitive area.  We have all read recently of certain controversy in England over the action of health boards in this very sensitive and difficult area of child sexual abuse.  Nonetheless, it is important that we look at the possible circumstances where, particularly to protect children, this form of relief would be available for the protection of the child even if it was not possible to get the mother to be the moving party &mdash; the spouse &mdash; as is defined at the moment.  I propose to put down an amendment to that effect on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There is another problem about the scope of this Bill and I am not sure if it is possible to correct this problem because of the long title of the Principal Act and the title of the Bill.  It is the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) (Amendment) Bill and &ldquo;children&rdquo; is quite widely defined which is appropriate but we have the word &ldquo;spouses&rdquo;.  Increasingly, couples are living together without being spouses. That is a fact.  Even with the absence of divorce legislation in Ireland an increasing number of couples are in long term, stable relationships but they are not spouses and they have children.  Those people living together in those circumstances do not have the availability of the remedies which we rightly consider to be necessary for the protection of the married spouse and the protection of children living in the context of a married family even if they are not the immediate children of the spouse if they are living in a situation where one or other spouse is in <i>loco parentis.</i></P>
    <P>We need to look at the reality of the family in Ireland which was to some extent examined by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown. <Col N="2396" /> That committee noted that the marriage rate had declined quite significantly from about 1974 to 1983.  It has gone down to about 5.2 per 1,000 and has now more or less evened off at that lower figure.  The marriage age is now steady rather than declining further but births outside marriage have now risen to in excess of 9.6 per cent.  That is a very sharp increase and it would be wrong to conclude that these births are all to unmarried mothers living alone with their child.  A significant number of births outside marriage are to couples cohabiting in stable relationships. The female cohabiter and the children in that context are equally in need of the kind of protection which is being set out here.  If there is physical abuse, if there is putting in fear or if there is child sexual abuse, in that context the woman and child should have access to the same degree of protection.</P>
    <P>We are about to see the removal of one significant area of discrimination of the child outside marriage by virtue of the provisions of the Status of Children Bill which commenced its life in the Seanad and is now nearing the completion of its parliamentary process.  At the same time while that will abolish the status of illegitimacy, the child outside marriage still suffers from the handicaps of not having available the protection we are talking about in this Bill.  The child outside a married family context would not be able to have a protection or barring order sought on his or her behalf in similar circumstances.  It is important that this be examined because there is an increasing number of family relationships in that context and because the need for protection is real whatever about the emphasis we might like to place on supporting marriage.  The reality is that an increasing number of couples are living outside marriage in stable relationships and that young persons who are not marrying are living in stable relationships and probably do not intend to marry but are having children.  What protection is offered them?  The only possibility would be either looking for an injunction in the courts, which is a much less satisfactory form of protection, or that the health <Col N="2397" /> boards would have the power to bring a place of safety order or whatever.  It is important to examine at this stage the possibility of extending the scope of the relief of barring and protection orders outside the marriage context.  It may not be possible to so amend this legislation because of the way it is structured but it is something on which I would welcome a response from the Minister.</P>
    <P>I hope we will have an opportunity to discuss fully on Committee Stage, on which I propose to table amendments, the definition of the grounds on which a protection or barring order can be obtained.  There is also the question of the extension of the scope of the relief so that it can be obtained against somebody who is not a spouse but who is living in the household and who, by abuse or violence, is putting in fear a spouse or child.</P>
    <P>The third area is that of the possibility of having an application for relief brought in extreme circumstances &mdash; and it would have to be in extreme circumstances &mdash; by a health board or other appropriate authority where a spouse in the particular circumstances is reluctant to or will not seek the necessary relief to protect the children of the marriage.</P>
    <P>There is one other area to which I should like to refer again as being a difficult area &mdash; and none of these is an easy area.  I can see some of the potential constitutional implications.  But it is important that we have full and careful discussion of them.  Under the provisions of this Bill, as indeed is the case under the existing law on protection orders, it is possible to apply <i>ex parte</i> for a protection order.  There is some support for the view that, in every serious circumstances it ought to be possible to apply <i>ex parte</i> for a barring order.  Obviously the circumstances would have to be extremely serious and the relief would have to be for a short time before a court could consider the matter.</P>
    <P>If the protection order simply would not achieve the short term relief for example &mdash; again to use the illustration I have been using &mdash; a very serious sexual abuse of a child, it might be necessary in <Col N="2398" /> certain circumstances to get a barring order.  It might be necessary either for a spouse to get a barring order, as provided under the framework of the Act, or, if we extend the Bill in the manner that I have been suggesting, it might be necessary that a health board or other authority would be able to get a barring order <i>ex parte</i> for a limited time.  Probably it would be a matter of days before the matter would be returnable before the court and before there would be a full hearing.  This is something which we should consider very carefully.  If we are giving the courts more flexibility, broader and more sensitive jurisdiction in this area, we should consider the possibility of enabling an application to be made for a barring order <i>ex parte</i> for a limited time as well as for a protection order <i>ex parte.</i></P>
    <P>Those are the main points I wished to raise.  I look forward to the Minister's response and also to a full Committee Stage when we can tease out the various sections and amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the provisions of this Bill rendered necessary in order to draw a distinction &mdash; from the 1981 Act &mdash; between a barring order and a protection order.  The point at issue is the ascertainment of the most effective way of dealing with family violence.  Under the provisions of the 1981 Act which followed the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, a barring order was considered to be the most effective means of alleviating a violent family situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am often struck by the lack of legal education in our community.  It is a source of great concern that a tremendous number of people have very little knowledge of what the terms barring order, protection order and maintenance order mean.  The Minister has a role to play in the civic code of our educational system to ensure more familiarity with or knowledge of the legal system through the educational process.  Indeed our adult educational system has a role to play in informing the public of their rights, of the provisions of the Family (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, the <Col N="2399" /> Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981, and the amendment of the latter we are debating today, how their provisions appertain to people finding themselves in violent situations and how these problems can be resolved or overcome.  As the House will be aware, a barring order has the effect of excluding one spouse from the family home on the insistence of another.  Often in a violent family situation the provisions of the 1976 Act afforded the Garda Síochána no powers by way of removing an offending party from the home.  The 1981 Act, for the first time, afforded specific powers to the Garda Síochána to arrest a person they believed was guilty of a breach of a barring order.  That was of great practical significance because, up to then, even if a person breached a barring order, the Garda were powerless to take any action in the matter.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the 1981 Act, which we are amending here today, also created a new form of order called a protection order.  The protection order covers the period from the lodgment of an application for a barring order to the date of hearing of that application.  It has the effect of restraining the alleged offending spouse from threatening, molesting or otherwise putting in fear the applicant and/or dependent children.  But it does not bar a spouse from the family home. It is probably significant and important that the amelioration of a barring order, in the form of a protection order, could generate a means of reconciliation and bring about a change of heart on behalf of the spouses involved.  It constitutes a kind of halfway house, if you like, attitude toward firmer action in the form of a barring order.  The breach of a barring order or protection order is a criminal offence which can carry the penalty of imprisonment.</P>
    <P>A recent decision of the High Court in the case of R. <i>v.</i> R. gave power to that court to make barring orders even though the provisions of the original legislation, did not so indicate.  I am concerned at the workload of the High Court that, whether it be family legislation, criminal <Col N="2400" /> legislation or whatever, the High Court appears to be taking on a very significant workload.  The Minister should be concerned about the fact that even family cases are increasingly finding their way to the High Court.  I referred earlier to the R. <i>v.</i> R. case in 1984 which found its way to the High Court.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister consider the establishment of separate courts to deal with the large amount of family legislation now on the Statute Book, and, as he said himself, the number of Bills he has in the offing to provide for greater amelioration of family problems.</P>
    <P>One of the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown was that family courts are essential to provide the type of professional expertise needed in a sensitive area such as that of family law.  There are social workers, psychiatrists and psychologists employed to draw the attention of the presiding judge to the various aspects and consequences of any decision taken in that sensitive area of family law.  I urge the Minister to consider at the earliest possible opportunity the establishment of a family tribunal, as was recommended by the joint committee, or some form of family court.  In Dublin only does that system operate at present, whereas people in other areas are experiencing difficulty and prolonged delays in having decisions taken on their situations in relation to family law.</P>
    <P>I am aware that in rural Ireland &mdash; and I am sure the Minister is as well &mdash; there are many people living a lie.  Their fear of exposing family situations to the public gaze often militates against their applying for barring orders or protection orders. It is a traditional attitude in Ireland, particularly rural Ireland, that people would much prefer to sustain the violence that is taking place behind closed doors rather than seek the refuge of the law of the land.  This is generated out of shame and on many occasions lack of knowledge on the part of the spouse or people involved that facilities are at their disposal to bring about an acceptable solution to their family situation.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson referred to two <Col N="2401" /> important aspects where the scope of this Bill needs clarification and perhaps amendment.  The first is the case of children who are illegitimate and born outside of marriage.  I regret that the concept of illegitimacy is still with us and that children born outside of wedlock are not treated equally with those who are born within wedlock.  I hope the Minister will bring the necessary legislation to finality in order to abolish this appalling concept of illegitimacy and seek to bring under the auspices of this legislation we are speaking about today the necessary changes to include those people outside of marriage.  Secondly there are the various difficulties that legislation has at the moment in coping with the relationships in second unions that are developing, albeit stable unions, which are not addressed in the marital law at present.</P>
    <P>I would certainly welcome the Bill and hope that the protection order mechanism will become more the order of the day, to promote more reconciliation in marriages.  Unfortunately, we have to face the fact of life that marital breakdown is becoming an increasingly difficult problem to resolve and the protection order is another way in which a very serious problem can be ameliorated without going the whole way towards excluding the person from the home.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make two very brief observations on this Bill, which I welcome.  In circumstances where the law surrounding barring orders is so unclear and where access has now become so difficult, from the point of view of the affected spouse and the point of view of the lawyer involved in cases of this sort, the Bill will provide a certain measure of protection.  It ensures, if properly implemented &mdash; and this is the key to it &mdash; that there is easier access for the spouse.  It ensures that the gardaí are involved from an early stage and that they are aware that there is an obligation on them to keep themselves informed and to be ready to intervene should that be necessary.  Finally, it provides easy access and availability of evidence, <Col N="2402" /> should recourse be needed to a full barring order.</P>
      <P>In that sense the Bill is a necessary step on the way towards much more full reform of family laws.  I stress that it may very well need a change in the attitude of many of the gardaí if it is to become effective because all too frequently, and perhaps for understandable reasons, but sometimes not justifiable reasons, the gardaí do not want to become involved in what they see as a family row and prefer not to be aware of the full circumstances. Now, at least, there will be an obligation on the gardaí to keep themselves informed and the evidence which may often be difficult to get will be available.</P>
      <P>The other point I want to make is that within the terms of this Bill, and maybe slightly outside it, the Minister could, in the most concrete way possible, give the strongest earnest of his intentions on law reform by immediately changing the court in which most of these cases are held.  The situation in the Four Courts at present for family law is nothing short of scandalous &mdash; the conditions, the absence of consultation rooms where people can talk with some degree of privacy, the fact that, on Mondays especially, much of the consultation is taking place in crowded corridors where one side can overhear the other.  The sheer lack of any dignity associated with the present operation of the law is something which causes a great deal of concern to those who on a daily basis work in the family law courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the same level, the Minister should look very seriously at the question of perhaps establishing a separate division of judges for these courts.  All too often, the judges who adjudicate have no special training and often have very little sympathy for the cases with which they have to deal.  It is not the glamorous part of the Judiciary.  As in other countries, the Minister should consider seriously the possibility of having a separate division with separate training and very careful vetting of the type of personalities needed to ensure that cases are heard fully and sympathetically and that, at the end of <Col N="2403" /> the day, in what is always a difficult situation, where there is usually no black and white and where justice will be only approximate, at least it approximates as closely as possible to the ideal.  With these two very brief points, I will reserve other points I have for Committee Stage of the Bill.  I will simply say I welcome this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa mo bhuíochas a ghabháil dos na Seanadóirí a bhí páirteach sa díospóireacht seo.  I am grateful for the very valuable contributions made.  I hoped today that perhaps a much greater number of Senators might have participated in this debate because often I find comments are made outside the House by Members who did not participate in the debate that there is a need for it.  Now that we have such important legislation before us for discussion it is regrettable that those who make those types of comments outside, criticising all of us whether we are in Government or Opposition for lack of progress in this area, are not here.  I say that because I feel I should.  I am extremely thankful to the Members of this House who have spoken and who have made very valuable contributions to the debate this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will say at the very outset that I am quite open to accept amendments &mdash; I say this in response to Senator Fennell and Senator Robinson and I will deal with all the points made as best I can.  I am open to be convinced that these amendments, if they can improve the Bill, should be accepted.  I say in particular to Senator Fennell that when she had the authority and obligation to bring the Status of Children Bill to the Seanad she was in a similar frame of mind and I compliment her for it.  I think we have a far better Bill for it.  If we can improve this Bill in this House, I am quite prepared to do so.  The only thing I would like to say to Senator Robinson is that if she can prepare the amendments inside the next week or ten days, two or three weeks from today we can deal with Committee Stage and try to have the matter <Col N="2404" /> processed before the Seanad goes on vacation.</P>
    <P>Senator Fennell and Senator Robinson asked if it was necessary that there be physical violence before an order can be made.  They referred to the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown and expressed the view, in paragraph 7.7.10, that in the light of the Supreme Court decision in the case of O'B. <i>v.</i> O'B, 1984, the judicial interpretation had moved towards refusal to grant a barring order unless physical violence was shown to have been involved. They felt this might result in a remedy being denied where the conduct of the offending spouse, while not involving physical violence, was such as to place the safety or the welfare of the applicant spouse or children at risk.</P>
    <P>They suggested that barring orders, and now also protection orders, should continue to be obtainable where the health, safety and welfare of a spouse or children were at risk.  In fact, it is clear from the Supreme Court decision concerned that the term &ldquo;welfare&rdquo; in the section includes health and that physical violence is not a precondition for the granting of a barring order or a protection order.  It has, moreover, been confirmed that in practice the courts grant barring and protection orders in cases where physical violence is not involved.</P>
    <P>Senator Fennell suggested that the guarantee of privacy that applies at present in regard to the hearing of a wide range of family law matters should be modified to allow limited reporting in applications under this Bill.  This is a matter which raises wide implications for the approach to family law hearings generally. It would require further consideration and I am prepared to give that suggestion of Senator Fennell's every consideration.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson asked why the 1981 Act and this Bill apply only as between spouses and their children in the usually family situations.  They do not apply where there is only a single parent including a widow or widower ill-treating a child or a cohabiting couple not married to each other.  This is because the barring <Col N="2405" /> order remedy is designated to empower a court to order one spouse to leave the family home notwithstanding the marital duty of cohabitation where the court considers that necessary because of the threat the respondent spouse represents to the safety or welfare of the other spouse's child.  The cruelty or ill-treatment of children by parents or others can, of course, be dealt with under childcare legislation or criminal law &mdash; the children's Acts and the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, as may be appropriate. I understand we will be hearing much more about this in the reasonably near future from my colleague in Government who has direct responsibility in this area.</P>
    <P>I accept the challenge Senator Manning has given to show the seriousness of my intent in this area by doing something with regard to courts and court facilities. It is important that reasonable courtroom facilities are available for people who are unfortunate enough to be involved in family law litigation.  The responsibility for providing these facilities in the greater Dublin area rests directly with the State. At District Court level there are two special courtrooms with waiting and consultation rooms.  These are in Ormond House and Dolphin House but in a short time both will be in Dolphin House.  The Circuit Court family law courtroom, together with the waiting and consultation room which at present is located in Dolphin House, will shortly be transferred to purpose-built facilities in the new office block which is about to be occupied in the Four Courts complex. This is the location also for similar purpose-built facilities for the High Court which will be used in substitution for its present courtroom in Ormond House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Dolphin House and Ormond House are not used very often for family court sittings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that these facilities are fully adequate for the demands likely to be made on them for family law business in the Dublin area in the foreseeable future.  The responsibility for providing courtroom facilities outside <Col N="2406" /> Dublin rests with local authorities.  I understand that in most centres the volume of business is relatively small and the practice is for justices and court staff to use existing facilities but in such a way as to ensure as much privacy and confidentiality as possible.  In many cases ordinary courtrooms are used outside the times for ordinary court business and in others the justice uses his private chambers or specially provided rooms.  If a need for additional facilities in any particular centre were clearly shown I would certainly take appropriate steps to see to their provision.  I consider the matter extremely important.  Senator Manning referred to the Garda involvement in the operation of this type of legislation.  The Senator can rest assured we can count on 100 per cent co-operation of the Garda in this matter.</P>
      <P>I am very thankful to the Members of the House who participated in this important debate.  I look forward with interest to amendments which I have been advised will be tabled.  I hope they will be tabled as soon as possible so that they can be given the consideration they deserve in order that the legislation will be finalised before the Seanad takes its summer break.</P>

    <Title>Safety, Health and Welfare (Offshore Installations) Bill, 1986: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the proposed legislation is to <Col N="2407" /> provide statutory arrangements for the safety, health and welfare of persons working on offshore installations engaged in the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons off our coast.</P>
      <P>While general responsibility for ensuring the safety, health and welfare of workers employed on such installations rests with my Department, none of the safety protection statutes administered by the Department applies to those workers.  The Safety in Industry Acts, 1955 to 1980, which apply to factories etc. do not apply to offshore installations. As the law stands, the rules and procedures for offshore petroleum development and production operations are based on the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960, and on Offshore Licensing Terms administered by the Minister for Energy.</P>
      <P>Section 6 of the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act prohibits searching for or recovering any petroleum found, save under licence from the Minister for Energy.  The safety of workers employed on an offshore installation is at present controlled by a condition in this licence.  This condition requires the licensee to comply with all regulations and directions of my Department for securing the safety, health and welfare of persons employed in or about the licensed area.  The current requirements are those set out in the &ldquo;Safety Instructions for Offshore Petroleum Operations&rdquo; issued in February 1983, in place of previous instructions issued in 1975.  While this system has worked reasonably well until now, it is time it was placed on a statutory footing.</P>
      <P>In passing, I might mention that the general question of licensing terms is at present under review by my colleague, the Minister for Energy and Communications. There has been criticism from within the industry of these terms &mdash; and, in particular, those affecting marginal oilfields and it is the intention that the new regime should be seen as clearly competing favourably with arrangements elsewhere.  An announcement in the matter will be made shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2408" /> Exploration off our coasts began in 1971 and the total number of wells drilled to date is approaching 100.  The work involved is by its very nature hazardous and I would expect that the contents of the Bill aimed at ensuring adequate safety arrangements for the workers concerned will meet with broad support across the House.  While this year over 100 Irish personnel have been employed in offshore work I am sure that, with the encouragement of Government, there will be increased opportunities in the future for the many experienced Irish offshore workers.</P>
    <P>Exploitation, as distinct from exploratory work, is confined at present to natural gas off Kinsale which came on stream in 1978, and is carried out by two production platforms.  We would all hope that the exploitation of natural gas will be matched by development of native oil resources off our shores in the near future.</P>
    <P>The incidence of fatal accidents on offshore installations in the North Sea has been alarmingly high.</P>
    <P>For instance, over 110 deaths from accidents in or near offshore installations were officially recorded in the first 17 years of drilling for oil in the North Sea. Nearly 650 accidents involving serious injury were recorded in the same period. In the case of operations in Irish waters there have been three fatalities to date. The legal position at present is that if directions about the safety of workers employed on or about these installations are not observed, the only penalty available is the withdrawal of the licence.</P>
    <P>A penalty which would involve ending all exploration or production under a particular licence is obviously not a satisfactory means of guaranteeing the effectiveness of day-to-day safety management on production installations. Hence the need for the alternative arrangements proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the positive approach which trade union and employer interests in the petroleum industry have shown in promoting a safety conscious working environment.  Both sides have recognised the importance of training in the drive <Col N="2409" /> towards safer operations.  Under a recruitment agreement made in 1985, all employees recruited for offshore work are required to register with the National Manpower Service and to have completed a fire-fighting and survival course. This ensures that all offshore personnel have basic training for what is a very dangerous job.</P>
    <P>There must be no complacency about the concern for safety in the hazardous environment of an offshore platform. Safety will not be assured simply by the making of laws and regulations.</P>
    <P>Safety essentially depends on the commitment of owners, employers and workers who must all accept a share of the responsibility for providing and carrying out the operation of safe structures, safe systems and safe procedures.  The Bill sets a high standard of safety as an objective and it will be my responsibility as Minister to work for its achievement through monitoring and enforcement.</P>
    <P>It is important that workers should be involved in decisions about their working environment.  Having regard to the nature and intensity of the hazards encountered, I am convinced of the need for a mechanism to enable workers on offshore installations to become involved in decisions on safety and health matters.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill should serve to press home to offshore employers and to their workers the need for effective safety policies, the importance of safety training and the value of having carefully drafted and well observed procedures. No amount of attention devoted to recording accidents is going to be of any use if the main emphasis is not on avoiding the possibility of accident or damage in the first place.</P>
    <P>The Bill is divided into six parts under which are grouped sections dealing with preliminary and general matters, offshore installations, safety regulations and representation, accidents, offences and penalties and the powers and functions of inspectors, together with subsidiary provisions.  Part I is concerned with preliminary and general matters and contains sections dealing with commencement, definitions, application, <Col N="2410" /> exemptions, regulations, informational needs, service of notices and administration expenses.</P>
    <P>In relation to the definitions and to the application of the Bill as originally circulated, I felt that it would be preferable to have in section 2 (1) a definition of &ldquo;offshore installation&rdquo; that would specifically include any installation providing accommodation offshore for workers.  Accordingly, I moved an appropriate amendment which was accepted by the Dáil on Committee Stage.  This, in effect made redundant some words qualifying the description &ldquo;offshore installation&rdquo; in section 3 (1) dealing with the Bill's application and that section was also amended accordingly.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that the Minister has power to exempt an installation from the application of the Act or regulations. Before issuing such an exemption &mdash; which must be in writing and which must refer to a particular time span &mdash; the Minister must be of the opinion that to insist on full compliance would not be reasonable.  The guiding norms for determining what is or is not reasonable will be: (i) the amount of work involved; (ii) the number of employees &mdash; actual or prospective; (iii) the duration of the work; or (iv) any other special circumstances.</P>
    <P>This power of exemption will enable a commonsense flexibility to be exercised. It is important to ensure that operations are not hindered by unnecessary restrictions. The Minister will have the advice of the industrial inspectorate when considering any exemption.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil, it was suggested that this section should contain a requirement about having mandatory consultation with trade unions prior to confirming any application for exemption.  Another suggestion was put forward about providing statutory exemption in the Bill for installations in particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>I have carefully considered both of these suggestions.  I would not be in favour of a situation where unnecessary delays could occur while mandatory statutory consultations were running their course.  Neither would I support <Col N="2411" /> having automatic and blanket exemptions built into the legislation.  I have been advised that it would be almost impossible anyway to attempt to cover all likely exemptions by way of legislation.  I feel that each case should be considered on its merits.  I am in favour of informal consultations taking place on exemption applications and I would expect the interests concerned to put forward their case.</P>
    <P>The industrial inspectorate will be charged with the duty of administering this measure to ensure the safety, health and welfare of offshore workers.  In advising me about exemption applications, the inspectorate will only recommend exemption where they are satisfied that the safety of the workers concerned is not under threat.</P>
    <P>While the Bill itself contains substantive provisions for safety matters, I have decided for practical reasons that the legislation will be backed up by detailed regulations.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill allows specific aspects of offshore operations to be made the subject of such regulations.  Section 5 (1) makes consultation with the Minister for Energy obligatory before any regulations are made.  I have also included a provision for consultation as necessary with other Ministers.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (7) provides that, with some exceptions, the Minister for Labour shall, before making regulations, publish in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in such other manner as he thinks desirable, notice of my proposal to make regulations and of the place where copies may be obtained.  Interested parties then have 21 days in which to make representations about the content of the regulations.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil, I was pressed to amend this subsection by the insertion of a requirement that the Minister should consult employer and trade union organisations prior to the drafting of regulations. As I have indicated, the Bill provides for publication of notice of proposals to make regulations and provides for the making of representations.  This <Col N="2412" /> provision compares with similar provisions in the safety legislation which applies to industrial workers and to mining and quarrying workers.  As we are concerned here with safety conditions in operations of a very hazardous nature, I am satisfied that it is essential to put a reasonable time limit on the process of consultation so as to avoid undue delay and to ensure that the necessary regulations are brought into operation as soon as possible.  However, I can give an assurance that there will be informal consultation with employer and worker representative bodies on the regulations to be made under this Bill in advance of publication.</P>
    <P>Subsection 5 (7) was, however, amended in one respect on Committee Stage in the Dáil.  I decided to bring regulations relating to the qualifications of installation managers and their deputies, logbook entries and prescribed diseases in under the list of matters which will be the subject of the consultative process. These are matters on which I think interested parties should have an opportunity to put forward their views and the amended subsection 5 (7) (b) provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill provides for the establishment of the position of installation manager.  Every offshore installation is required under section 11 to be under the charge of a competent installation manager appointed by the installation owner.  Under section 13, the manager is vested with responsibility for safety, health and welfare and also for order and discipline.  I have taken power as Minister for Labour to specify by regulation the installation manager's duties in relation to the safety, health and welfare of installation workers.</P>
    <P>Section 10 places an obligation on the manager to ensure that the installation is not used unless the rig and its fittings and equipment are suitable.  All equipment must be of sound construction and adequate strength, must be properly maintained and comply with regulations which will provide for a certification procedure in relation to these requirements. Section 10 also puts a qualified duty on <Col N="2413" /> the installation manager to ensure that all working places on or about the installation are safe.  There is a duty on different employers operating at the same installation to co-operate in protecting their workers from danger.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides that no offshore installation may in future function except under the daily personal supervision of the installation manager, or of a qualified substitute during his absence or incapacity. Section 16 places a duty on the installation manager to keep a logbook and a record of all persons on board the installation.  Section 14 prohibits the employment on offshore installations of persons under 18 years of age, unless exempted by regulation.</P>
    <P>Section 15 obliges employees on the installation to look to the safety of themselves and their co-workers, and to co-operate with employers in complying with the Bill or regulations.  In section 18 the installation owner is obliged to see that suitable clothing, equipment and facilities are provided for the protection of workers.  Sections 19, 20 and 21 oblige him to ensure that effective systems are in operation for dealing with the hazards of naked lights and smoking, for the detection of gas and for the safe storage and identification of dangerous substances and preparations.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with safety on the installation itself.  Section 22 specifies matters which may be the subject of safety regulations.  These include the operation of support vessels, aircraft, work processes, pipeline works and matters listed in the Schedule to the Bill, for example, medical and training requirements, and emergency procedures.</P>
    <P>Other sections of Part III deal with safety representation and may be brought into force by regulation.  Section 23 allows for selection by the workers of a safety representative and deputy safety representative to represent them at consultations with the installation manager on safety, health and welfare.  Section 24 outlines a procedure for the selection by the workers, if they so wish, of a safety committee to assist the owner and the <Col N="2414" /> installation manager in securing compliance with all safety provisions and regulations.  The committee may appoint a safety delegate and deputy safety delegate. There is provision in section 25 for appointment by the installation manager of a safety representative or safety committee in default of any initiative in that regard by the workers.</P>
    <P>Under section 26 the owner of an installation will be required to draw up a statement of policy specifying the manner in which the safety, health and welfare of the employees will be secured.  The installation manager must make a copy of the statement available to any safety representatives or safety committee, or, if neither exists, to any employee on the installation who requests a copy.</P>
    <P>As I stated earlier, these provisions on safety representation reflect my concern to highlight the importance of worker involvement in safety matters.  I recognise that ultimately a framework for involvement can only succeed in its purpose if it is suited to its environment. Following the publication of the Barrington report on Safety at Work, my Department have been working, in liaison with the Interim Board for Occupational Safety and Health, on the drafting of legislation to give effect to its recommendations.  The main criticism which this type of safety representation has attracted is that it has often remained unused or fallen dormant.  In this context, it may be necessary to review at a later stage how we provide for safety representation and worker involvement in safety matters generally.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill lays down the procedures to be followed in case of accident, injury or death and in the event of the occurrence of disease on an installation. In sections 27 and 28 I am proposing the establishment of procedures to be followed where death occurs as a result of accidents on or around an installation.  Written notice must be given immediately to both myself and the Minister for Energy.</P>
    <P>There is also a prohibition on interference with the scene of an accident for a specified period unless an industrial <Col N="2415" /> inspector of my Department has visited the installation and agreed to any proposed changes.  Section 30 lays down procedures to be followed where a person on an installation is found to be suffering from a prescribed disease.  I have taken power to order, where I consider it appropriate, a formal investigation into any accident, disease or other occurrence notified to me under the legislation.  In the discharge of my functions under the Bill I will have the benefit of professional advice from an industrial medical adviser, who may be vested with the powers of an industrial inspector.</P>
    <P>Parts V and VI which conclude the Bill deal with offences and set out the penalties for breach of provisions of the Bill and with the powers of the industrial inspectors of my Department.  In relation to penalties there is provision for daily fines for continuing offences and a court may impose a prison sentence for an offence likely to cause death or serious injury, a dangerous accident or endanger safety.</P>
    <P>In section 42 there is also provision for the ultimate sanction against a persistent offender which empowers an inspector to impose such prohibitions, restrictions or requirements as he considers necessary to safeguard safety or health and in case of any danger or risk of danger to request measures to be taken to deal with it.  An inspector may also apply to the High Court for an order prohibiting continuance of activities carried on in contravention of such an imposition of requirement.  The inspectors are also given the right of access to offshore installations and the right to make any examinations, inquiries and tests necessary to ascertain whether the Bill and the regulations are being complied with.</P>
    <P>The Bill will no doubt benefit from the detailed scrutiny of this House.  I will, of course, be prepared to consider any constructive suggestions which Senators may wish to put forward.  I am satisfied that the Bill will provide an effective framework for the achievement of the objectives of all those concerned with <Col N="2416" /> the safety, health and welfare of persons employed on offshore installations.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The United Kingdom Committee on Offshore Safety, chaired by Dr. J.H. Burgoyne, presented their report in 1980 and stated:</P>
      <P>We cannot emphasise too much that safety will not be assured by regulations and controls alone.  Safety of operations depends on the wholehearted commitment of owners, employers and employed who must fully accept individual responsibility for the provision and operation of safe structures, plant systems and procedures. The role of Government is to set objectives designed to achieve a uniformily high standard of safety throughout the industry, and to ensure their achievement through monitoring and enforcement procedures.</P>
      <P>Our own Commission of Inquiry on Safety, Health and Welfare at Work, chaired by Mr. Justice Barrington, reported in 1983 and said:</P>
      <P>It is not merely that prevention is better than cure.  Once an accident has happened there is often no cure.  If the system is to be preventive, safety must be a feature in the planning of factories and installations and systems of work. This idea governs all our recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that context, therefore, and with that philosophy, I welcome the timely introduction of this Bill, the Safety, Health and Welfare (Offshore Installations) Bill, 1986, which has been in preparation for a considerable number of years, has engaged the attention of several Attorneys General in several different administrations, was initiated by the previous Government in 1986 and is now adopted by the present Government.  Its Long Title states that its objectives are to provide for the safety, health and welfare of persons on installations concerned with the exploration for or exploitation of petroleum or other minerals in the waters in or surrounding the State and to <Col N="2417" /> provide for the safety of such installations and the prevention of accidents on or near them.</P>
    <P>The extremely hazardous nature of the operations of those involved in drilling for and producing oil and gas in coastal waters and the unfortunate accident record makes it essential that we are ahead with our safety legislation and regulations, not in any sense to cramp enterprise and initiative but in order to ensure that those who take those initiatives are adequately protected in so far as Parliament can protect them by safety legislation.</P>
    <P>The importance of the Bill can be seen from the fact that if one of the enormous oil rigs such as those used in the North Sea was superimposed on Croke Park there would not be much room for spectators. This can also be seen from the incidence of fatal accidents on or near offshore installations in the North Sea, an alarmingly high incidence, as the Minister has indicated.  For example, over 110 fatal accidents were recorded in the first 17 years of drilling for oil in the North Sea and almost 650 accidents involving serious injury were recorded in the same period.  It is true, and it is important to emphasise as the Barrington commission have done, that employers have common law duties towards employees in respect of occupational safety and health.  The duty of care of an employer towards his employees involves the provision of a safe place at work, competent staff, proper equipment and a safe system of work.</P>
    <P>However, as the Minister has indicated, while the general statutory responsibility for ensuring the safety, health and welfare of workers rests with the Minister for Labour, none of the various Statutes administered by the Department of Labour applies at the moment to offshore installations.  For a number of years we have had a patchwork approach to safety, health and welfare, and this is reflected in the wide range of Acts which relate to this area such as the Factories Acts, the Office Premises Act, the Boilers Explosion Act, the Mines and <Col N="2418" /> Quarries Act and the various Acts dealing with dangerous substances and particular areas such as the nuclear area.  It is most unsatisfactory that we should have a patchwork approach to such a vital area as safety, health and welfare because it must inevitably give rise to loopholes and to important areas being excluded.</P>
    <P>One such area, as the Minister has indicated, is offshore installations.  As the law stands, the rules and procedures for offshore petroleum development and production operations are based on the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960 and on offshore licensing terms administered by the Minister for Energy.  Section 6 of the 1960 Act prohibits searching for or recovery of any petroleum found save under a licence issued by the Minister for Energy.  The position of the safety of workers on offshore installations is at present controlled by a condition contained in this licence which requires the licensee &ldquo;to comply with any instructions from time to time given by the appropriate Minister in writing for securing the health and safety of persons employed in or about the licensed area&rdquo;, the appropriate Minister being the Minister for Labour.</P>
    <P>The only penalty available under the present law, as again the Minister has indicated, for not observing these directions about the safety of workers employed in or about these hazardous operations is a withdrawal of the licence. It is quite clear that such a crude sanction, which would involve the termination of all exploration or production under a particular licence, is an unsatisfactory way of guaranteeing and effectiveness and safety of offshore installations.  Therefore, this Bill provides for the introduction of a statutory and comprehensive code with clear requirements for those engaged in offshore developments.  The Bill enables the Minister for Labour to provide for the safety, health and welfare of offshore installation workers by means of legislation which is enforceable by its own direct sanctions.  It provides penalties graded according to the seriousness of the offence, so that an appropriate sanction may be held out for those who needlessly <Col N="2419" /> or, indeed, heedlessly take risks or disobey normal safety requirements.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has indicated, the Bill is divided into six parts.  In Part I, under section 3 (1), the legislation will apply to any offshore installation situated in waters listed in section 3 (2) of the Bill, namely, (a) waters in the portion of the sea which comprises the territorial seas of the State, (b) waters in all the areas of the sea to which the internal or inland waters of the State are extended by section 5 of the Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 1959 and (c) waters in any area which is for the time being a designated area within the meaning of section 1 of the Continental Shelf Act, 1968.</P>
    <P>The phrase &ldquo;territorial seas&rdquo; is part of international usage and in default of domestic legislation would have to be interpreted according to &ldquo;the generally recognised principles of international law&rdquo; which Ireland is declared to accept under Article 29.3 of our Constitution which states: &ldquo;Ireland accepts the generally recognised principles of international law as its rule of conduct in its relations with other States.&rdquo;  However, section 2 of the Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 1959 provides that: &ldquo;... the territorial seas of the State shall be that portion of the sea which lies between the baseline and the outer limit of the territorial seas.&rdquo;  Section 3 of the 1959 Act provides that: &ldquo;... the outer limit of the territorial seas is the line every point of which is at a distance of three nautical miles from the nearest point of the baseline.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the 1959 Act provides that the baseline is the low water mark except that by section 4 the Government may by order prescribe straight baselines in relation to any part of the national territory and the closing line of any bay or mouth of a river, and any line so prescribed shall be taken as the baseline.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the 1959 Act provides that sea areas to the landward side of a base line are internal or inland waters.  These provisions are in accord, then, with the 1958 Geneva Convention on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2420" /> However, since 1958 international practice has been drastically modified by many unilateral extensions of territorial sea to much greater limits than were previously recognised.  Ian Brownlee, in his book <i>Principles of Public International Law</i> states: &ldquo;The majority of States now favour 6 or 12 mile limits or take intermediate positions&rdquo;.  Article 2 of the negotiating text produced by the Second Committee of the United Nations Law of the Sea Conference, held in Geneva in 1975, proposed that &ldquo;every State should have the right to establish the breadth of territorial seas up to a limit not exceeding 12 nautical miles.&rdquo;  So far Ireland, as I understand it, has not extended its territorial seas beyond the three mile limit provided for in the 1959 Act although ample precedent now seems to exist for doing so.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Continental Shelf Act, 1968, empowers the Government to designate by order areas outside our territorial waters and to vest in the Minister for Energy rights of exploration and exploitation in relation to natural resources in these areas.  The concept that a State might have exclusive rights to explore and exploit the natural resources of the seabed and subsoil outside the territorial waters has assumed growing importance since the last war.  Technological advances have made it possible to explore and exploit such natural resources but considerable uncertainty existed in international law as to the precise rights of individual States to the part of the continental shelf adjoining their shores.  Therefore, at the request of the United Nations, the International Law Commission carried out a study of the problem with a view to bringing the definition and control of these rights within the ambit of international law.  The report of the commission was considered by the United Nations at the International Conference on the Law of the Sea, which was held in Geneva in 1958, and that resulted in the drafting of the Convention on the Continental Shelf. The Continental Shelf is defined as the seabed and subsoil of the submarine area <Col N="2421" /> adjacent to the coast but outside the territorial waters to a depth of 200 metres, or beyond that limit where the depth of the waters permits exploitation.</P>
    <P>Article 5, paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Geneva Convention, 1958, also provides the authority for the creation of safety zones around offshore installations.  A State may construct and maintain installations for the purposes of exploration and exploitation of natural resources and an installation may have a 500 metres safety zone around it.  Section 6 of the Continental Shelf Act, 1968, which incidentally does not mention the size of the zone, provides the authority in Irish law for the creation of safety zones.</P>
    <P>The Bill we are considering today is deliberately flexible in the sense that while it contains, as the Minister has indicated, substantive provisions for safety matters, the legislation will be backed up by regulations which will subject specific aspects of worker safety to detailed regulations. The Houses of the Oireachtas sometimes like to feel they have specified exactly what the regulations should be at the time of the legislation and indeed fight shy of making regulations by ministerial order.  However, in connection with this Bill it is right that the regulations should be made by ministerial order because, with a rapidly changing industry and its advancing techniques and technology, it will be necessary to bring in new regulations and to change them frequently in response to new developments.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill empowers the Minister for Labour to make regulations to give effect to the Bill.  The Minister for Labour, however, must consult with the Minister for Energy before making any regulations and additionally, he must consult with the Minister for Health if a health matter is in question, as stated in section 5 (1) (a), or with the Minister for the Environment if the regulations refer to a fire safety measure, as stated in section 5 (1) (c).  If the proposed regulations refer to hovercraft, helicopters, other aircraft or vessels, radio facilities or rescue facilities, the concurrence of the Minister for Communications, the Minister for the Marine and the Minister <Col N="2422" /> for Tourism and Transport must be obtained.</P>
    <P>The main feature of Part II of the Bill is the establishment of the position of an installation manager.  Under section 11 the owner of an offshore installation must appoint, as its manager, a person who, to the best of his knowledge and ability, has the skills and competence suitable for the appointment, as stated in section 11 (1) (c).  Under section 11 (2) (a) the Minister for Labour, after consultation with the Minister for Energy, may make regulations relating to the duties of the installation manager concerning the safety, health and welfare of persons employed on, in or in the neighbourhood of an offshore installation.  Any manager who proves that he does not have the requisite skills and competence for the post must be removed from office by the owner of the installation.  The owner must ensure that there is a manager of every installation which is manned, and a manager, once appointed, must remain on duty until relieved.</P>
    <P>Section 10 places an obligation on the installation manager to ensure that the installation is not used for exploration and exploitation purposes unless the installation, its fittings or other equipment are suitable for the purpose and comply with whatever regulations are made by the Minister for Labour under section 10.  The regulations may provide for a prescribed certification procedure in respect of the installation and its fittings.</P>
    <P>Section 13 outlines the duties of the installation manager in relation to the maintenance of safety and discipline.  In addition to the general responsibility for safety, health and welfare of persons employed on an installation the installation manager is also responsible for order and discipline connected with safety, health and welfare.  The installation manager is vested with authority over all persons on, in or about the installation. He is given specific powers to enable him to discharge these responsibilities. Thus, in short, the installation manager or master will be a person on board who is fully responsible for all safety arrangements and he will be, in <Col N="2423" /> many ways, in a similar position to that of a captain of a ship, with complete responsibility for complying with safety regulations.  It is possible, as is the practice on some rigs, that one man is master when the rig is drilling or producing and another man is master when the rig is being towed or moved from place to place &mdash; production master on the one hand and navigation master on the other hand. It must be stressed that at all times the installation manager is in charge of the operation.  The analogy with safety in mines and safety in ships at sea makes it clear it is absolutely right that there should be one person solely responsible and with the duty of ensuring safety throughout the operation.</P>
    <P>One of the matters which was raised in the House of Commons in their discussion of similar legislation in the United Kingdom, namely the Mineral Workings (Offshore Installations) Bill, 1971, was the question to the qualifications of the installation manager and whether he should indeed be a certified master and have special responsibilities.  The aim is to make sure that whoever is in charge of the installation has the necessary prestige and authority.  If he is to be responsible for the safety of everyone on the rig his word of command has to be accepted in difficult and emergency situations.  The tribunal of inquiry into <i>The Sea Gem</i> disaster, which led to the passing of the Mineral Workings (Offshore Installations) Act, 1971, in England recommended:</P>
    <P>It would not be necessary for the master to be an expert in the engineering and mechanical aspects of his charge.  It would only be necessary for him to be a mature and responsible person trained to have a wholesome respect for the sea and knowing what to look for in carrying out his task of keeping everybody up to scratch.</P>
    <P>That, of course, would be a most difficult appointment for anybody both in terms of the number of men involved and the capital value of an installation.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with safety on <Col N="2424" /> the installation itself.  Section 22 deals with matters which may be the subject of regulations, for example, the safety, health and welfare of workers on, in or about installations, the safety of installations themselves and the prevention of accidents on, in, or near them.  Section 22 also deals with regulations on specific matters, including matters listed in the Schedule to the Bill.  Thus the Bill enables all aspects of offshore work to be subjected to detailed regulations.  I believe the Minister for Labour is fortunate in having a series of reports which were produced in the United Kingdon and, indeed, in other countries and as a result of which detailed regulations were made governing all aspects of offshore safety to guide him in the preparation and making the new regulations which are envisaged under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the making and enforcement of detailed regulations are absolutely crucial and essential if the important objectives contained in this Bill in respect of safety on offshore installations are to be realised.  For example, drilling is an area that has the bleakest record for the total of fatal and serious accidents.  Diving is a most important and difficult area and special regulations must be and are required for divers who operate and dive from oil rigs.  For an accident to a diver is, as the figures show, particularly likely to be fatal.  In general, the reason for this is the difficulty in giving aid to a diver in trouble at his operating depth.  This emphasises the need for the diving industry to work at all times to the highest standards of safety.  I believe the regulations should provide a mandatory requirement that all offshore installations should have radio communications and radar.  Radar, is important not only for the identification of other vessels, but so that a rig may give a special signal identifying itself as a stationary structure which may be picked up, for example, in the case of fog.</P>
    <P>Life boat facilities are essential and crucial. When the <i>Sea Gem</i> went down, for example, many men died from exposure in the water.  Even if the normal number of lifeboats is provided on rigs, and if <Col N="2425" /> there is a collision, or the rig collapses, as did the <i>Sea Gem</i>, one side may be at an angle making the use of gravity launched lifeboats extremely difficult, and almost impossible.  From very early on, therefore, life saving devices on the lines of the Brucker system had been introduced.  The Brucker capsule is in the form of the metal dome which can hold a great number of men, more than the crew of a rig.  It is powered by a motor and because of various scientific devices and equipment on it, it can exist in a blazing sea of oil and take the crew to safety.  With elaborate provision for a cooling capsule on the outside, it can save people from hot death as well as from what might have been a cold death in the water.  I know, of course, that there have been considerable improvements and refinements in respect of lifesaving rescue facilities and it is essential that the provision of modern lifesaving survival crafts is a mandatory requirement for all installations over which we have jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Section 23 of Part III allows for the selection and appointment by the workers of safety representatives and deputy safety representatives to represent them in consultation with installation managers for the purpose of ensuring co-operation between management and workers in achieving compliance with the safety provisions of the Bill and, indeed, with the regulations.</P>
    <P>Section 24 allows for the selection and appointment by the workers of safety committees to assist the owner or the installation manager in securing compliance with the safety provisions of the Bill and the regulations.  Section 26 of the Bill requires the installation owner to prepare a written statement specifying the manner in which the safety and health of persons employed on, in, or in the neighbourhood of an installation will be secured.  Part IV of the Bill lays down the procedures to be followed in the case of accident, injury, or death on, in, or in the neighbourhood of an offshore installation.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill deals with offences and sets out the penalties for an infringement of the Bill and its regulations.  Part <Col N="2426" /> VI sets out in detail the powers of the industrial inspectors of the Department of Labour who are doing such an excellent job, including their right of access to installations, examination and inquiry, to check that the Bill and its regulations are complied with.</P>
    <P>Finally, it was the Barrington Commission which said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>Safety functions should permeate the whole work place as thoroughly as production functions.</P>
    <P>I believe, with the Minister, that the provisions of this Bill are broadly in keeping with the recommendations of the Barrington Commission.  They should serve to press home to offshore employers, and to their workers, the need for effective safety policies, the importance of safety training and the value of having carefully drafted and well observed procedures.</P>
    <P>Exploration off our coasts began in 1971 but, as the Minister has indicated, exploitation is confined at present to natural gas off Kinsale which came on stream in 1978 and is carried out by two production platforms.  We all hope that exploitation of natural gas will be matched by the development of native and indigenous oil resources very shortly.  It is interesting to note that in the period 1979-86,48 oil and gas explorations have been drilled offshore and two have been drilled onshore at a cost of approximately £340 million.  It is also interesting to note that on 4 June 1987 Deputy Ray Burke, Minister for Energy, promised that new licensing terms for marginal oil fields and for the exploitation of onshore minerals would be published by the Government within four or six weeks.  I hope the Government will take to heart the simple but profitable message contained at the end of that poem by Ogden Nash, and I quote:</P>
    <P>So the sad fate of Columbus ought to be,</P>
    <P>Pointed out to every child and every voter,</P>
    <P>Because it has a very important moral which is</P>
    <P>Don't be a discoverer, be a promoter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2427" /> Finally, a number of Attorneys General have wrestled with and worked hard on the jurisdictional point raised by this Bill. We all agree that this Bill and its passing is appropriate and timely but certain matters have been raised in the other House which indicate that the time taken for the introduction of the Bill raises serious constitutional doubts about our capacity to legislate in areas outside our jurisdiction. It would seem, therefore, much better than the matter be put beyond doubt now than at some time in the future.  Perhaps, therefore, the Minister for Labour and the Government should invite the President, after the passage of this Bill, to consult with the Council of State about referring the Bill to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution to test its constitutionality.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I welcome this timely and important Bill and I congratulate the Minister for Labour on introducing it in the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious there is widespread support for this Bill which is concerned with providing adequate safety arrangements for people involved in offshore operations.  It is true that a safety régime has already been in place for some time but today's Bill is an advance in that it underpins in a statutory and more elaborate way the safety régime for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the best of times, offshore operation work is hazardous and the death toll of 110 mentioned by the Minister in the North Sea activities has been a source of great concern.  Regrettably, there have been three fatalities in the Irish context also.  It makes particular sense, therefore, to study the British experience, as I am sure has been done in formulating this legislation, and to learn from it.  Legislation has its place but it can only make a limited contribution to the area of safety.  I share the Minister's view that an effective safety system primarily lies in the hands of both employers and every individual employee.  For employees, participation in safety committees provided for in the Bill allow an opportunity <Col N="2428" /> for a say in the working environment and a type of worker participation in practice at the workplace.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his opening statement rightly stressed the importance of training. The true answer it seems to me for safety of work is a better trained management and workforce.  It is encouraging, therefore, that employees, employers and trade union representatives in the petroleum industry recognise the importance of training in achieving the objective of safer operations. This is an intricate Bill from the legislative viewpoint and considerable work has obviously gone into its formulation. It is necessary to have sound and detailed safety provisions for people engaged in offshore activity.  We all share the hope that oil will be brought ashore and now is the time to put suitable safety legislation in place in advance of viable petroleum finds.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the establishment of the position of installation manager.  Section 11 requires that every offshore installation shall be under the charge of a competent installation manager appointed by the installation owner. This person will have responsibility for safety, health and welfare and also for order and discipline.  Furthermore, it will be necessary under the Bill that the person making the appointment of installation manager shall appoint a person who, to the best of his knowledge and belief, has the skills and competence suitable for the appointment.  This is obviously crucial.  The most careful worker will inevitably have an accident if he is required to work in an unsafe workplace or with unsafe equipment and materials.</P>
    <P>For example, the achievement of maintenance of safety standards and recommendations from safety officers can lead to costs.  It has been mentioned in various places that against the background of recession, investment in training in the safety area and investment in safety <i>per se</i> has taken a lower priority.  This does not make great financial sense from the employer's viewpoint.  The great escalation in employers' liability insurance in recent years had added an important <Col N="2429" /> additional industrial cost for employers. There is, however, evidence that precisely because of the increase in the number of claims and awards the appointment of an officer responsible for safety is seen by employers and indeed by insurance companies as being in their own best interests.  Even if it is only the financial motive it seems to be leading in certain instances to more investment by employers in the safety area.</P>
    <P>The safety officer in industry generally and the installation manager in the case of offshore installations provided for in the Bill have an important role to play in ensuring safety at work but on their own they can only achieve so much.  It is clearly in everybody's interests that the level of accidents at the workplace be reduced.  The only way to be 100 per cent sure that no accidents will take place at work is not to go to work at all.  This, of course, is not a practical proposition.  The role of the safety officer or installation manager needs to be integrated into the management system.  There is the obvious temptation that the person responsible for safety will be made a scapegoat in certain circumstances.  What I am arguing for, therefore, is that every manager in an organisation should regard safety as part of the managerial job.  In other words, safety must be seen as an integral part of the manager's job.</P>
    <P>I mentioned training for employers and employees; training for safety officers is also a specifically important area.  It is only in the past 12 months that we have seen the establishment of an occupational safety and health course in Ireland.  True, there were seminars and so on before that but there is now a professional course available in this area which is welcome, albeit a little on the late side.</P>
    <P>Turning to offshore activities specifically &mdash; the Minister mentioned this area in his opening speech &mdash; an attractive environment for investment is necessary to attract oil companies to engage in exploration.  The view has been expressed that more rigorous and, therefore, more costly safety requirements might act as a disincentive to exploration companies. This disincentive argument does not hold <Col N="2430" /> up, not least because, as I touched on already, on financial grounds alone it is in the employers' own interest to have safe working conditions, especially against the background of escalating claims, awards, tendency to engage in more litigation and, consequentially, higher insurance premiums.</P>
    <P>Offshore exploration is a risky, expensive business.  Very large sums have already been spent by companies on exploration in Irish waters with no real return.  A total of 95 exploration wells were drilled offshore Ireland up to the end of 1986.  The number of offshore wells varies from a low of two in 1971 to a high of 15 in 1978, down to six in 1986 and perhaps three in 1987.  When the Minister for Energy took office just a few short months ago he pointed out that there was only one firm commitment to drill an offshore well in 1988.  It is not surprising, therefore, that the Government are currently addressing new licensing terms for marginal oil fields.  There is intense competition among countries to attract oil companies to explore.  Ireland must produce competitive terms to keep the oil companies interested.  If we attract more drilling activity and the results prove satisfactory to the companies and the country, then we will have the opportunity to apply more rigorous terms to the companies when the next licensing round takes place.</P>
    <P>If it is worthwhile for the oil companies to stay drilling here, stay they will but in the first instance we must have an attractive carrot to get them and to keep them here.  It is worth recalling that our balance of payments could be significantly improved through the operation of a medium-sized oil development which, in turn, would make this country self-sufficient in oil.  Oil companies will be interested in marginal oil fields if they have the appropriate technology and our financial incentives.  In the area of technology, obviously they are developing more advanced equipment themselves but it is in the area of financial options that the Government can act and, like others, I look forward to the proposals of the Minister for Energy in this regard <Col N="2431" /> in the near future.  As I said at the outset, this is not a contentious Bill so I will conclude this brief contribution by wishing the measure a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Like everybody else I welcome the Bill which is necessary and detailed legislation.  It is good to see it come on stream.  It is most timely.  Most people, here or in the other House, have expressed the view that there are no grounds for complacency with regard to safety and health, not only offshore but in industry as a general principle.  In this area, because it is somewhat new to us, more vigilance is required of us.  For example, according to the report to the Minister for Labour there were 3,595 reported accidents in 1985.  Knowing the position and many of the people who would be engaged in tasks where accidents might occur I calculate that those figures could be much higher.  It is not always evident particularly if somebody files an application for disability benefit and does not indicate the information that their injury was sustained in the course of their work.  That incident would not be reported as an accident at work, as such.  There are other ways of establishing such facts and statistics but that is one example of how figures may not accurately represent accidents in this area.  In the same year, 1985, 18 persons died as a result of accidents in their workplace &mdash; one of those was under 18 years of age &mdash; and that was on a construction site.  In 1986, 3,570 accidents were reported and 14 people died.  There were 358 accidents on building sites and six deaths.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mention those figures to indicate that such things happen while the provisions of existing safety legislation await implementation or perhaps are being implemented to some degree.  I give the figures merely as an indication of the number of accidents that occurred in the years 1985 and 1986.  If we go back through the years we find even more convincing argument to suggest that people are not as diligent as they should be. <Col N="2432" /> There appears to be a certain laxity in implementing the provisions of existing legislation to provide for their safety, health and welfare.</P>
    <P>This Bill, in the way it is drafted, gives the impression that it is the intention that the inspectorate would be extremely diligent and that they would have maximum accessibility.  When one bears in mind other existing legislation and having regard to the higher risk element involved in these offshore activities one becomes more concerned about complacency. The tone of the whole debate is right but there is need for the fullest possible scope to be given to safety representatives and inspectorates.  There is also an encouragement of workers to establish safety committees: not only that, but resort to the other safety provisions and regulations &mdash; not necessarily in this Bill &mdash; but already existent.</P>
    <P>I would argue against the provisions of section 24 for the selection and appointment by the workers, if they so wish, of a safety committee to assist the owner or the installation manager in securing compliance with the safety provisions and regulations laid down in the Bill.  I do not believe that is the correct way to go about it.  Rather we should deal with it on the basis that the degree and element of risk can vary very much from factory floor to factory floor.  In the case of industry where membership of a safety committee is under 20 it is voluntary and, if over 20, compulsory.  I wonder if the Minister has given any thought to this aspect.  The offshore hazards will be different, possibly their degree higher than those experienced at ordinary industrial level.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider that provision.  I would not like to insert the phrase: &ldquo;shall form a safety committee&rdquo;. Some other wording could be inserted to act as a greater encouragement to workers to get involved in the area of dealing with safety, where they would have a direct, regular input rather than merely some sort of infrequent consultation procedure when somebody may complain that this or that procedure is not right.  The fact that the incidence of <Col N="2433" /> accidents may increase warrants a more direct input on a regular basis in this area.</P>
    <P>When dealing with the people responsible to have regard to the extent of the reportage of other Ministers to him.  This is particularly important having regard to the fact that I do not believe that the figures reported are accurate.  I believe that the numbers of people injured at work are much greater.  I would urge the Minister to place great emphasis on the extent of overseeing installation conditions when he is dealing with the people responsible for them.  I know that is the intention but one cannot drive it home sufficiently hard.  If one does not oversee conditions initially and ensure they are properly met it is very difficult to blame anybody else thereafter.  If you like, it is a three-way responsibility shared by the people responsible for overseeing the conditions, the installation manager and the company.  It can raise all sorts of problems.  If a company happen to be a foreign one, trying to assess where responsibility lies, against whom a claim should be lodged, in the case of accident can be the cause of much confusion.</P>
    <P>I believe the way to deal with the whole question of safety is to urge the workers to become more involved and not merely put a point of view now and again on safety or on whether one aspect of a procedure is right or wrong.  Rather they should ensure that the provisions of the Bill are being applied and that there is the three-way responsibility/consultation to which I referred with regard to the overseeing of conditions involving the inspectors, the company, the installation manager or whoever is their representative.</P>
    <P>Drilling offshore constitutes a new concept in safety at work.  I know there are some regulations in existence.  Such activities began to increase in 1983.  As more drilling is in prospect it might be appropriate to say I do not agree totally with Senator Hillery when he speaks of good conditions and inducements, about the act that people may not return if conditions are not favourable and so on. That aspect of his contribution had nothing to do with safety.  I mention it by <Col N="2434" /> way of its being a relevant observation.  I would disagree with his comments, in the sense that some companies already drilling off our shores, who have plugged holes are part of economies that are much larger and stronger than ours.  They can afford to plug the hole and leave it there until the terms are right.  They have plenty of time and they can wait.  I could not resist the temptation to make that observation, even though it is not totally relevant.  That is something we should bear in mind.</P>
    <P>Our intention in this legislation is to guard against health hazards for the people who are involved in the industry. Because of the fact that they are going to be drilling in greater numbers and at higher speeds, we must make sure that the risks that might not ordinarily be taken are not taken.  In a situation where good results may come about and somebody decides to speed things up such as drilling, diving and all other aspects of the work, if the overseeing lapses or the accessibility of an inspectorate is diminished and something like the ventilation or lighting becomes faulty, the risks are higher still.  If you couple the question of speed with bad lighting, bad ventilation and so on it is obvious that you will raise the level of danger.  Again I appeal for accessibility for the inspectorate.  We should emphasise that we are not talking about people cutting their fingers and going for treatment to a first aid station; we are talking about danger to life and limb.</P>
    <P>The other matter one worries about is a recession &mdash; and this is not a cut at anybody, or a pun &mdash; even though the intentions in the legislation are good there is a danger that the staffing of the inspectorate could be cut back and therefore the overseeing suffers and the hazards can get out of hand.  I appeal to the Minister to think about that area.</P>
    <P>When we are talking about the people to be employed, in this case there is the question of being engaged on installations. As I understand it if AnCO or Manpower are going to place people they will have them trained in fire-fighting and survival courses and these are necessary. <Col N="2435" /> I know politicians are accused of using pull and getting jobs for people, but I have not had much success with it in my time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have plenty of friends, but no jobs.  We will be accused of using political pull but having regard to what is needed and the calibre of the people who have to go through these courses, that charge cannot be levelled at us.  Shame on the person who would try to put somebody on a rig or an installation like that who was not up to it, and shame on the man who listens to the man who wants him to get on it, but that is not likely.</P>
      <P>One of the last points I want to make is in relation to redress and responsibility. I was not able to go into the Bill as deeply as Senator Kennedy, who seems to have a comprehensive grasp of it and who gave a very detailed explanation of its function and what can be cannot be done.  I am not sure whether the company take all the responsibilities when something needs redressing, whether the installation manager or the owner will be the person, or what the situation will be.</P>
      <P>I get confused at times and I am confused on the question of the three or four Departments with which the Minister will liaise.  I have not made up my mind whether that is a good or a bad thing.  On balance, one could say that possibly it is a good thing that somebody is looking over your shoulder and that you have somebody to be answerable to.  We are in the process of bringing agencies together and it is a pity that we cannot bring more operations under the same umbrella so that we could have a finger on the pulse with regard to which ministry is involved, rather than having it varying to such an extent.  However, the draftsman found it necessary and wise to act in the way he did in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In such a dangerous situation, I do not know whether the fines imposed are high enough.  On the other hand, I would not want to go to the point of introducing draconian measures by raising the fines <Col N="2436" /> extensively.  However, they could be a little higher, because no matter how responsible we are, how good or concerned we are about the laws on health, safety and welfare, there is the danger of complacency.  We have to be rapped quite hard over the knuckles when we stray off the beaten track.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased with the Bill.  I am satisfied that it will do the job.  As I said, there are small areas of concern.  Finally, please make the installations accessible to the inspectorate and please see that the staff are adequate to facilitate that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusCullimore" hpid="Mr. Cullimore Mr. Cullimore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullimore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy to add my support to this Bill.  Offshore exploration is a vital weapon in the battle to secure Ireland's economic future.  Any measure which will enhance the operation and effectiveness of offshore installations is strategically very important. Death and destruction can be the consequences when safety regulations are inadequate, or are ignored.  Tragically we do not have to go far to be reminded of this. In Cork, early in 1979 we had a disaster at Whiddy Island oil terminal in which 50 people lost their lives.  The <i>Betelgeuse</i> was wrecked, extensive damage was caused to the offshore jetty and installation, not to mention the loss of many peoples' livelihoods.  More recently, off the coast of Belgium we had the Zeebrugge disaster. Regulations were ignored and many people lost their lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, of course impossible to legislate for all accidents and events which might occur.  We must, however, learn from past mistakes.  Human and technical errors will always be possible but we must strive to minimise the probability of their occurrence.  Part II, section 11 of the Bill establishes the position of an installation manager.  The manager is appointed by the owners, subject to regulations.  Much of the onus for day to day implementation of safety regulations resides with the manager.  With the best will in the world, a conflict of interests may arise.  Commercial pressure can lead to the cutting of corners with respect to safety.  In view of these considerations, perhaps the Minister would consider making provision for <Col N="2437" /> a resident safety officer on offshore installations.  In an ideal world, such an officer would be permanently resident, but perhaps a compromise could be reached.  Such an officer could be resident for an agreed minimum period.</P>
    <P>Part II, section 18 deals with the provision and maintenance of equipment, clothing facilities and material for the protection of workers.  Section 19 deals with naked lights and smoking.  This section includes the provision that &ldquo;appropriate notices prohibiting or restricting smoking and the use of naked lights are displayed in sufficient numbers&rdquo;. I suggest that a similar provision be included in section 18.  These notices should indicate clearly the areas and circumstances where specific protective clothing or equipment should be used. This would not only assist the management and workers, but it would also be of great assistance to safety inspectors. It would be a clear indication of management's attitude to safety.</P>
    <P>In general, indeed, greater consideration could be given to the provision of safety signs and notices.  A minimum number of safety signs for a given number of workers should be displayed on an installation.  Safety signs are a common practice on good construction sites.  We only have to consider the anti-drink driving or seat belt campaigns to appreciate the importance of reminders regarding good safety practice.</P>
    <P>Section 26 in Part III of the Bill deals with safety statements.  It requires an installation owner to provide a written statement.  This statement is required to specify how the health and safety of employees will be secured.  I welcome this provision but perhaps more could be done in this area.  I urge the Minister to consider the provision of an emergency action plan.  This plan could be developed in consultation and co-operation with the appropriate agencies both nationally and locally.  In essence, the plan should provide (1) instructions to all personnel and particularly key personnel about the actions they are to take during a project emergency; and (2) detailed plans for notifying potentially' affected persons, <Col N="2438" /> including safety, law enforcement and medical authorities, as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Training and practice is a most important element of emergency procedures. I urge that detailed proposals regarding training and emergency procedures be included in any emergency action plan. There could be included as an appendix to the plan.  Any plan should be considered incomplete if these are not included.</P>
    <P>In the Whiddy Island disaster report the tribunal's conclusion regarding training in emergency procedures included the following points:</P>
    <P>The failure to hold refresher training courses in fire fighting techniques... demonstrated a decline in safety standards;</P>
    <P>The failure to provide adequate formal training in fire fighting techniques for employees who are designated &ldquo;temporary employees&rdquo; was clearly undesirable; and</P>
    <P>Had the crew been properly trained in evacuation techniques... then it is possible that they would have run to Dolphin I and their lives would have been saved.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to the points I have made. Let us do our utmost to ensure that a <i>Betelgeuse</i> type disaster goes not mar the progress of our offshore oil and mineral exploration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nice to see the Minister and I am sorry I missed him last week.  This is impressive legislation. Having a passing interest in the area of safety, I cannot but compliment the Minister and his officials on thorough attempts to address the area of safety in offshore installations.  The Minister referred to the forthcoming comprehensive legislation in the area of health and safety at work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is one of the peculiarities of many societies that there is a certain macho kind of resistance to the idea of proper safety practice.  This is not something that <Col N="2439" /> is exclusively characteristic of industrial workers or management in industry.  If people realised the risks involved in smoking cigarettes near petrol pumps and if their perception of the hazards associated with petrol were as great as their perception of the hazards associated with somewhat familiar substances, they would have a very different attitude to it. There is a feeling that real men do not worry about safety and this is part of the problem.  It is one of the reasons why one has to welcome the very vigorous and active role that trade unions take in advocating a very healthy and positive attitude to safety.  There is a long way to go yet.</P>
    <P>Many years ago I worked in an installation where face masks were an absolute prerequisite for safety but most of the employees did not feel comfortable wearing them and dismissed ideas of worrying about the risks to their health.  It is true, too, that there are perceptions of the relative safety of different forms of work and different areas of activity which are totally at variance with the facts.  For instance, the chemical industry of which I have some knowledge could be a far safer industry to work in than, say, the building industry.  The incidence of fatal accidents in the construction industry, according to British figures, would be of an order of magnitude greater than the incidence of fatalities in the chemical industry.</P>
    <P>At the core of the question of safety is the perception and assessment of risk. There is no such thing as absolute safety. There is always an assessment of the acceptability of risk.  It has been fashionable to talk about the idea of acceptable risk as a nasty kind of capitalist idea which makes human life dispensable.  In truth we all operate on the basis of acceptable risks.  Most of us would probably take great exception if regulations were introduced which made news, like &ldquo;Superser heaters illegal&rdquo;, although most fire officers around the country would stand up and cheer if such were done because of the risks involved.  However, public opinion has deemed that risk to be acceptable. The use of petrol and the use of motor <Col N="2440" /> cars as a means of transportation is an acceptable risk.  If people who work in the chemical industry were told that the biggest risk they face is driving from home to work rather than at work and they are far safer once they get inside the gates of the factory than they were when they were driving to work most would not accept that.  A person takes a far greater risk in driving a car in a country like Ireland than he or she takes in working in a well-regulated industry like the chemical industry or any similar industry.</P>
    <P>Underlying the safety aspect of the Bill is the fact that no amount of regulations and the Minister and Senators Hillery, Harte and Kennedy said this also, can create safety.  They can only create a framework for safe operation.  One could go on forever about what is needed for safe operation.  A number of things are required.  The first requirement is training. I agree fully with Senator Hillery that it is not only regrettable but it is bad economics to cut back on the area of proper training for safety.  The idea that short cuts in training in safety or in safe practice can somehow make an industry more profitable may be true for a specific industry at a specific moment in time but there is no global evidence to sustain it.</P>
    <P>The companies in the area I am familiar with that have the best record in terms of profitability, innovation and in terms of their response to new markets are the same companies who have been extremely innovative and very progressive in the area of loss prevention and the development of loss prevention techniques.  The idea that somehow one can succeed in any area where there might be an excessive risk by shortcutting on safety or loss prevention is both humanly destructive and in terms of profitability it is a blind alley out of which a company will emerge in serious disarray.</P>
    <P>I am very glad there is considerable emphasis on the requirement that people should be trained in the area of safety.  It is an interesting area which ought to be extended into many other areas of work. A requirement to be trained in proper and safe practices ought to be a condition of employment in many areas of activity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2441" /> The second requirement is that people who are trained should be properly supervised. While the installation manager, the concept and the proposal is most welcome, it is not just the responsibility of the installation manager but everybody who is responsible for supervisory activity in any process, whether it be an offshore installation or a shore based industry has a responsibility to supervise and to ensure that safe practices are maintained and that the occasional cumbersome ones are insisted upon even if a somewhat reluctant workforce does not accept it.</P>
    <P>The other requirement is motivation. Again you cannot externally enforce safety.  You can do it, but it is not going to be an adequate or complete form of safe practice if it is simply based on externally imposed regulations.  The most acceptable way to run a safe industry is, of course, to motivate the workforce into accepting that safe practice is correct practice.  That needs a considerable degree of involvement.  That is why it is most welcome that there should be a reference to safety representation on offshore installations.  I agree with Senator Harte that perhaps we could have a stronger word than &ldquo;may&rdquo; and that &ldquo;must&rdquo; or &ldquo;shall&rdquo; should be substituted.  I would be interested in the Minister's reasoning as to why he left it as an option rather than as a requirement.  There is an obligation on many onshore industries, above a certain number of employees, that there must be a safety committee.  I am not sure why it should be different in the case of a high risk area with the possibility that we have relatively new employees without much experience.  Inevitably in a country like ours, in the early days of offshore installations, there must be a high level of employee inexperience, however well they are trained before they come onboard an offshore installation. Therefore, the requirement to motivate people to think in terms of safety involvement is a prerequisite and I would have thought that the safety representation should be a compulsory rather than an optional extra.</P>
    <P>The other important area in order to <Col N="2442" /> sustain safe practice is continuous review. An industry which presumes that, because safe practices were instituted two years ago, it is still safe is a potentially hazardous place.  Safety can only be sustained by a continuous critical review of the operations, practices, and so on, and of the plant itself.  The Flixborough disaster indicated the extreme importance of a review in detail of any modifications to previous processes.  It is very easy, particularly in a moment of pressure, to modify a process without sitting down and dispassionately analysing the possible consequences in other areas of the process of what happened.  Unfortunately in Flixborough there was not such a detailed review of the possible implications of a modification.  So you are talking about training, supervision, motivation and continuous review.  That is obviously, a presumption of a sense of partnership in any high risk operations like offshore installations.</P>
    <P>Consequently, while the Bill is worthwhile and important, we will have to address the question of employee training and of providing funds to organisations like NISO to extend and improve employee training.  It was one of the perpetually infuriating things for me when I was involved in the executive of the Cork council of trade unions that, however worthy the functions organised by the National Industrial Safety Organisation, they were so far beyond the budget of individual trade unionists, as distinct from their trade unions that most of the people on the council, while recognising the value of these things, could do absolutely nothing about going because they were too expensive.  I am not saying this in any penny pinching way but it is a pity that the recognition of the need for safe practices cannot be extended further into the recognition of the need to train and motivate people to continue.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the Bill, I am concerned about section 4.  I hope the Minister will elaborate further on it.  It seems to be a large freedom to give the Minister the power to make exemptions without the necessity to hear the views of the employees or, indeed, of the industry <Col N="2443" /> generally.  Possibly somebody has persuaded the Minister about possibilities of an extreme kind that are not going to arise too often.  Perhaps the Minister will elaborate on it.  I am not happy that sections of well drafted legislation can be set aside because a Minister is persuaded that it would be unreasonable to expect people to meet the regulations at a particular installation at a particular moment in time.  I accept that there are aspects of these regulations that perhaps cannot be met.  But I am not convinced that a blanket capacity to give a large scale exemption is necessary or, indeed, is even good legislation.  It undermines the very positive philosophy of the Bill in general.  I would be interested if the Minister could give specific examples in the area of offshore installations.  Is it, for instance, something he sees as being exclusively required in the area of offshore installation, or would it apply to the general area of health and safety legislation?</P>
    <P>There are two other points in this area which relate to the powers of the installation manager.  I was looking at section 13 (5).  I do not want to get into a Committee Stage discussion on this, but it might be something which the Minister could explain.  It concerns this power to restrain a person where the installation manager has done or is about to do any act endangering or likely to endanger the safety of the installation or persons on, in or about the installation or the maintenance of order and discipline among those persons or the installation manager with reasonable cause suspects him of having done or being about to do any such act.  I am not objecting to the principle of &ldquo;suspects with reasonable cause&rdquo;.  The person can then be restrained.  Subsection (5) states that:</P>
    <P>The person shall not be kept under restraint by virtue of subsection (4) for longer than thirty-six hours unless&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the intention is that he shall be put ashore in the State in accordance with that subsection at the earliest opportunity, and</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2444" /> (b)  within those thirty-six hours notice of his being kept under restraint and of the reason for it is sent to the authority in the State prescribed for the purpose of this subsection.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that, once the notice is sent to the authority prescribed, there is no longer any time limit on the period for which a person can be kept under restraint.  I find that rather peculiar.  I accept the principle that offshore installations like aircraft are areas where the person in charge has to have somewhat extraordinary powers.  I would have thought that, where a person has to be restrained, and that was obviously where somebody had either criminal intent or was somewhat disturbed, something should be done about that person and that an open ended capacity to restrain was not really part of our practice.  I may have misread the Bill or perhaps it is something that should be looked at in greater detail.</P>
    <P>Regarding section 14 I am unhappy &mdash; given what I said about training and what other Members and the Minister said about training &mdash; that the requirement that a person should receive adequate, instruction or training and instruction concerning the work as may be appropriate, can be omitted where a person is doing work under the instruction and supervision of a person who is adequately trained.  I find that extraordinary because it is the essence of good safety practice that everybody should be trained.  Perhaps the degree of training may relate to the degree of involvement.  The idea that an untrained person can be let onto a potentially high risk area, like an offshore installation, and presume that that person can be relied upon to operate safely simply on the presumption of supervision by somebody who is trained, not necessarily the installation manager, seems to be at variance with the obvious positive philosophy behind the Bill.  Perhaps the Minister could explain what is involved.</P>
    <P>The Bill is most welcome.  I look forward to the comprehensive health and safety at work Act.  I ask the Minister, <Col N="2445" /> since we are talking about health and safety, to investigate the rather peculiar position of those of us who work in laboratories and in places of education where it is a matter of considerable dispute, whether we are covered by the Factories Act.  Perhaps he could have a word with his colleague, the Minister for Education, and get this matter straightened out.</P>
    <P>It is a rather peculiar position that those of us who are involved in training people in the proper use of laboratories, facilities, and often dangerous equipment, are not sure whether the regulations we are explaining and training these people to comply with actually apply in the areas in which we work ourselves. If the Minister is told it is true, then he might inquire from various VECs around the country whether they accept they are covered by the Factories Act?  I can assure him that at least in one case where I have a certain involvement, they do not.  I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions.  I will deal with some of the questions raised.  I say to Senator Ryan that I will certainly check that but I think that probably the laboratory people will be covered under the new legislation.  I will check to see whether they are covered under the Factories Act, and I will let the Senator know when I have checked it.</P>
      <P>I welcome the positive response of all the Senators to this legislation.  The Bill as has been rightly said, was in circulation for some years.  In Opposition I asked why the Bill did not come forward and why we did not deal with this legislation? I do not believe the constitutional question delayed it.  I think perhaps there were many other reasons, as it is very complex and detailed legislation.  The legislation is complex enough but the regulations that go with it &mdash; some of them already issued &mdash; are even more detailed and complex.  A great amount of work has been done by the officials in the inspectorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious that we get this legislation <Col N="2446" /> passed and up and running for two reasons.  First, oil exploration and exploitation is so important to the economy, and to the efforts of successive Governments, who try to encourage exploration in our offshore oil fields and gas fields. Secondly, as I said on Second Stage, there were clear anomalies for the safety and protection of workers in the legislation which at present governs them, that is if the legislation governs them at all.</P>
    <P>Senator Kennedy raised the question of the patchwork approach to safety legislation. The Barrington report addressed itself to the problem which will be examined in the context of the new proposals which I hope to introduce, as a number of Senators asked, probably late this year but more likely early in 1988.  Senator Kennedy also stressed the importance of the philosophy with regard to safety underlying the report of the Burgoyne Commission in the UK and the Barrington Commission in Ireland.  This is the philosophy behind this Bill also.  As I said in my Second Stage speech:</P>
    <P>Safety essentially depends on the commitment of owners, employers and workers who must all accept a share of the responsibility for providing and carrying out the operation of safe structures, safe systems and safe procedures. The Bill sets a high standard of safety as an objective and it will be my responsibility as Minister to work for its achievement through monitoring and enforcement.</P>
    <P>The Senator also referred to the issue of the safety zones.  Statutory Instrument No. 285 of 1977 established a 500-metre safety zone around the installations attached to the Kinsale Head gas field and prohibited ships from entering the zone without the consent of the Minister. However, it is not considered practical to establish such zones around mobile installations, the ones we refer to here, thus the expression &ldquo;in the neighbourhood of&rdquo; is used in the Bill.  This should be taken to mean normally a distance of some 500 metres.  However, it is considered desirable for flexibility purposes not to specify 500 metres in the <Col N="2447" /> legislation but to use the term &ldquo;neighbourhood of&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Senator Kennedy again asked for the qualifications of the offshore installation manager.  The details of these will be set down in the regulations to be made following consultation with the interested parties when the Bill is passed.  These will be specified in considerable detail.  There was also a question about life support systems.  There are four principal types, Watercraft, Harding, Viking and Whittaker. The first three assume the shape and configuration of a typical lifeboat and the fourth, the Whittaker, is essentially capsule because of its relatively spherical shape which makes for better manoeuvrability. Of the four, only the capsule is lowered on the single fall while all the other three operate in two falls.  There is criticism that the single fall capsule has a tendency to spin while it is being lowered.  Nowadays this tendency is minimised, if not totally eliminated, by the use of anti-twist cable.  In the Kinsale field operations each of the fixed installation has two Whittaker capsules; one holds 50 persons and the other holds 28 persons.  The capsules are inspected in the course of a usual visit by the inspectorate of the Department and their engine, air supply, drinkable water, first aid equipment, and torches are checked for reliability and up-to-dateness.  I think they are fairly detailed checks.</P>
    <P>Senator Kennedy mentioned the regulations being made under the Bill.  There are five sets of implementing regulations in the course of preparation: (1) operation, safety, health and welfare; (2) managers; (3) diving; (4) emergency procedures; (5) life-saving appliances.  These regulations will be made as soon as possible. I think all of the work has been completed on the regulations.</P>
    <P>The question of jurisdiction, as the Senator rightly said, came up on Second Stage.  It had been considered and the advice we received is that the definitions in section 2 (1) of the territorial seas of the State and the designated area together with section 3 (2) covering the application of the measure describes the <Col N="2448" /> activities which will come within the jurisdiction of the legislation.  The provisions will apply to installation in waters to which this Bill applies, section 3 (1), namely, (1) the territorial seas of the State, which is broadly the sea within a three-mile limit as set down in section 3 of the Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 1959; (2) the sea areas in inland or internal waters coming under section 5 of the Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 1959, and (3) the waters in an area designated under the Continental Shelf Act, 1968.  The UN Convention of the Law of the Sea describes a 12-mile limit instead of a three-mile limit.  Ireland, however, has not yet ratified the convention.  Senator Kennedy referred to the possible reference of the Bill to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality.  I am advised that such a reference is not necessary. The Bill simply applies the safety and welfare arrangements and installations, operating in areas already designated under the Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 1959.  I am advised there is no difficulty in that.</P>
    <P>Senator Hillery stressed the importance of the role of safety officers and safety training.  He also mentioned the desirability of offering a range of attractive licensing arrangements.  I welcome his contribution and I agree with him in these matters.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte referred to the accident statistics generally.  The position offshore has been that there have been three fatalities and some 40 non-fatal accidents.  The House will agree that there is no grounds for complacency.  This Bill should considerably help matters.  The details are laid down and if they are followed with the stringency the legislation intends they should undoubtedly assist matters. Senator Harte referred to the need for safety committees.  As I stated earlier, the provisions on safety committees in the Bill reflect my concern to highlight the importance of worker involvement in safety matters.  I recognise that ultimately a framework for involvement can only succeed in its purpose if it is suited to its environment.  Senator Ryan made the same point, that there is little good having <Col N="2449" /> legislation, rules and regulations if people are not prepared to adhere to them and follow them.  Following the publication of the Barrington report on safety at work my Department have been working in liaison with the interim board for occupation, safety and health and the drafting of legislation will give effect to their recommendations.  The main criticism which this type of safety representation has attracted is that it has often remained unused or fallen dormant.  In this context it may be necessary to review at a later stage how we can provide for safety representation and worker involvement in safety matters generally.  A number of questions were raised on that in the Barrington discussions, the ongoing discussions and the detailed preparation of that legislation.  These matters will be considered in detail to try to correct areas where up to now the legislation has not been effective.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte made a point about consultation with our Ministers.  His point was that perhaps we were consulting with too many.  The purpose in this respect is to ensure that there will be no overlap between responsibilities of the different Departments but that there is consultation to ensure that matters are dealt with efficiently and effectively.</P>
    <P>Senator Cullimore suggested the appointment of resident safety officers on offshore installations.  Sections 23, 24 and 25 of the Bill refer to safety representation provisions and the arrangements envisaged in these sections are probably unworkable.  The emergency procedures will be the subject of special regulations.  He has made a good point on this matter and I am glad to assure him that the emergency procedures will be taken up in special regulations.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan referred to the problem of introducing safety consciousness in Irish industry, which has been the difficulty for a long time.  I agree with him. We will have to try to work to it.  I agree with his comments generally.  We welcome the positive approach which trade union and employer interests in the petroleum industry have shown in promoting a safety conscious working environment. <Col N="2450" /> Both sides have recognised the importance of training in the drive towards safer operations.  Under a recruitment agreement in 1985 all employees recruited for offshore work were required to register with the National Manpower Service and to have completed a firefighting and survival course.  This ensures that all offshore personnel have basic training for a very dangerous job.  I take the points that the Senator made in connection with that.  There must be no complacency about concern for safety in the hazardous environment of an offshore platform. Safety will not be assured simply by the making of laws and regulations.  As far as we can go in the regulations is to ensure that anybody working on the rigs has registered to undertake the manpower course.  We had some questions on Second Stage and Committee Stage in the Dáil about some people who have experience not undertaking the course. We have ruled that people just have to undertake the course.  Some people who had considerable experience did not undertake the course to obtain what is considered to be a reasonable qualification.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan asked why a safety representative &ldquo;may&rdquo; and not &ldquo;must&rdquo; be appointed.  Section 23 provides that the employees may appoint a safety representative. This is a voluntary process to try to encourage the process of safety committees.  If employees do not appoint, section 25 provides that the manager must make such an appointment. It is preferable to try to get the employees to make that appointment to keep the voluntary nature of the debate and to keep trade union and FUE involvement in the matter.</P>
    <P>On section 4, Senator Ryan asked about the provision regarding the exemptions. We had a very detailed discussion on that on Committee Stage in the Dáil as we had on the whole Committee Stage. Section 4 provides that the Minister has power to exempt an installation from the application of the Act or the regulations. Before issuing such an exemption, which would be an unlikely event, it must be in writing and must refer to a particular time <Col N="2451" /> span.  The Minister must be of the opinion that to insist on full compliance would not be reasonable.  There will have to be stated grounds and the guiding norms for determining what is or is not reasonable will be the amount of work involved, the number of employees, actual or respective, the duration of the work or any other special circumstances.  The power of exemption will enable commonsense flexibility to be exercised.  It is important to ensure that operations are not hindered by unnecessary restrictions.  The employer will have to apply for the exemptions, setting out his reasons, the Minister will have to consider whether that fits in with the categories as set down, and it will then go to the inspectorate for their professional advice on the matter. Only at that stage would it be considered whether to grant the exemption.  The industrial inspectorate would be charged with the duty of administering the measure to ensure the safety, health and welfare of offshore workers and advising the Minister about exemption applications. The inspectorate will recommend exemption only when they are satisfied that the safety of the workers concerned is not under threat.  That would be the guiding principle.  They would have to be absolutely satisfied of that, and only where a delay would be unreasonable would the process be pursued.  It is unlikely that it would happen often but if there was some short term reason where an exemption was required granting it would still have to be based on, not just the Minister making his decision, but on the professional competency of the industrial inspectorate in taking the primary reason, the safety of the workers, into account.</P>
    <P>Again I thank Senators Kennedy, Hillery, Harte, Cullimore and Ryan for their excellent contributions and for the work they have put into debating this Bill.  We are anxious, after all the years it has been around, and we have tried in the last three months since I have been made Minister to get this Bill up and through. We wish to take Committee Stage today. We have had a good Second Stage debate <Col N="2452" /> and Committee Stage had a fairly long haul in the Dáil, with the agreement of the Seanad and mainly the Senators involved I would like Second Stage to conclude.</P>

      <P>The Minister has outlined the four criteria or norms or principles for the granting of those exemptions but the paramount interest is obviously the safety, health and welfare of the personnel on the offshore installation. Where there would be a conflict surely the four criteria he has outlined would not supesede the safety of the personnel on the installation.

      <P>We discussed this in the Dáil.  It could be used in many locations.  I am advised by the inspector that if the employer wished when testing to move the installation for <Col N="2453" /> testing &mdash; they may be testing in different locations or in one location for a short period &mdash; having to go through the process would not be realistic because by the time they go through it their certificate could be out of date.  In a case like that, provided the inspector is satisfied that all the other regulations are complied with, I do not think it is likely.  The inspector advised me that it could happen if there was a testing procedure in operation.  If we did not have the flexibility it would have to be refused and that would not be to the advantage of the country generally.</P>

      <P>I would like to refer again to the Burgoyne Commission report, paragraph 5.13 of which states:</P>
      <P>The Committee have received representations from the Offshore operators that there are a number of issues relating to Safety Zones requiring a change of policy.</P>
      <P>They identify four issues as follows:</P>
      <P>The 500m Safety Zone is of itself not large enough, particularly for anchored installations;</P>
      <P>Safety Zones should be accorded to mobile drilling units while on a drilling location;</P>
      <P>Safety Zones should be created around underwater installations (particularly subsea well completions or wellheads); and</P>
      <P>Fields with more than one installation should be accorded IMCO recognised &ldquo;areas to be avoided&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 5.17 states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of 2 or more installations in the exploitation of a field creates a &ldquo;corridor&rdquo; or &ldquo;corridors&rdquo; between the installations and their respective Safety <Col N="2454" /> Zones.  The offshore industry would like the Government....</P>
    <P>They are talking about the United Kingdom Government....</P>
    <P>... to promulgate &ldquo;areas to be avoided&rdquo; which are internationally recognised through IMCO (the UN Inter-governmental Maritime Consultative Organisation).</P>
    <P>They go on to make specific recommendations which are briefly summarised in paragraph 6.20 as follows:</P>
    <P>The Government should consider the case for the enlargement of the safety zone, currently set at 500m radius.  The Department of Energy should, as a matter of urgency:</P>
    <P>Allow the establishment of a safety zone for a mobile drilling unit;</P>
    <P>Establish the principle of according a safety zone to a subsea wellhead;</P>
    <P>The concept of IMCO &ldquo;areas to be avoided&rdquo; should be introduced as a matter of urgency.  The Government should keep means of enforcement of respect for safety zones constantly under review.</P>
    <P>There is no problem there.</P>
    <P>The Department of Energy should promote research into alternative means of marking the presence and extent of a safety zone.</P>
    <P>There seems to be definite recommendations there for the enlargement of safety zones and also on the whole question of consideration of corridors and so on.  We are a small country and as of now this type of legislation is unnecessary but on the other hand this is a very comprehensive Bill and we are looking to the future.

      <P>The person appointed in writing by the owner of the installation shall be the person deemed by the owner to have the requisite skills, confidence and experience for the efficient and effective discharge of the installation manager's duties.  It will be laid down in regulations that the person will have to be qualified adequately to carry out the powers given to him in the legislation. The inspectors would be anxious that we have some say.  There is not much point in giving all the powers to the manager in legislation and the employer then employing a person who would not be adequate to carry out those fairly stringent powers.</P>

      <P>I mentioned on Second Stage, and perhaps the Minister might explain to me now, the question of a person being kept under restraint.  I said at that time that I understand why the section is necessary but it appears to be a bit open-ended as to when the restraint should end.  The person shall not be kept under restraint by virtue of subsection (4) of this section for longer than 36 hours unless (a) &ldquo;the intention is that he shall be put ashore...&rdquo;.  I am concerned about paragraph (b) which states that unless &ldquo;within those thirty-six hours notice of his being kept under restraint and of the reason for it is sent to the authority in the State prescribed for the purposes of this <Col N="2457" /> subsection&rdquo;.  That does not seem to suggest that there is any urgency about dealing with a person like that.  The requirement is to notify that he is under restraint and after that matters can proceed at a certain pace.  Perhaps the Minister can explain what the intention is?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">

      <P>This is a technicality which will be dealt with in the regulations. If the Senator wishes I can give him the briefing note I have on section 13 (4) but I am not sure if it will assist him.</P>
      <P>If the installation manager believes that a person under 18 years of age is employed on or is in the neighbourhood of the installation, he is empowered to put that person ashore in the State.  The installation manager can also put a person ashore in the State if such a step is necessary to ensure the safety of the installation or persons on it, or is necessary for the maintenance of order and discipline. If any person on or about the installation is in danger, or is likely to endanger the. safety of the installation or persons on it, or discipline among such persons, or if there is reasonable suspicion that he has indulged or will indulge in such conduct, the manager may take necessary measures against him, including putting him under restraint, as he sees fit.  I am advised that there will be some further details in the regulations.  The Senator asked how long a person can be restrained, how long can a person be held before he is sent ashore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is do not think there is anything sinister in this.  At the very worst, it is something which should have been thought out further.  But the gardaí cannot keep somebody under arrest without a whole series of procedures.  The word &ldquo;restrained&rdquo; is being used here, presumably to avoid references that would give people any kind of quasi-judicial function.  Effectively, the installation manager &mdash; and quite rightly in my view &mdash; is being given the authority to put somebody under lock and key if the person is a threat to the safety of the installation.  But what worries me is that <Col N="2458" /> that ought to be an emergency procedure. Somewhere in the law preferably, but certainly in the regulations there should be an equally firm requirement of the installation manager to ensure that that sort of unofficial restraint is only an emergency operation and is not something which can be carried on until it suits the installation manager to put the person ashore.</P>
      <P>This procedure should be temporary until the person can be transferred either to the gardaí, if there is a criminal offence, or to the other area, which is a legitimate concern if the person becomes disturbed, and into medical care.  These procedures should be carried out quickly. From the manner in which it is written in the Bill you get the impression that as long as the restraint is notified, the installation manager could send him home the next time there was a supplies helicopter coming out, perhaps in a week's time. That is not acceptable.  I would have my doubts about the constitutional implications of that section, as it stands _ whether anybody can be authorised to keep somebody under restraint without due process of law and a court being involved.</P>
      <P>However, I am expressing my doubts and I am not going to challenge the constitutionality of this section, but somebody might.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This is enabling legislation, but if it is not specified in the Bill it would have to be set down in regulations. I am told this is a technicality, which is sensible enough when you take into consideration that we are dealing with offshore regulations.  If we write into this legislation three hours, six hours, or a day, the difficulty is that it may not be possible for the installation manager to get an individual off the installation because of weather conditions.  Therefore we cannot specify the time but exactly what happens will have to be spelled out in the regulations.  Presumably someone would have to be informed &mdash; the gardaí would be the correct people <Col N="2459" />&mdash; as soon as an installation manager is restraining somebody.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little unhappy about section 14 (2) (a) (ii).  The intention is that everybody working on a high risk activity, such as an offshore installation, ought to be trained, but we then say that a person, while doing work under the instruction and supervision of a person described in subparagraph (i) need not be trained.  I am not happy with that.  I do not believe anybody should be let into any area of safety on the presumption that he or she can be adequately supervised. I do not care whether that person is coming on to do a once-off specialist maintenance job on an installation.  For instance, those who come to work on the shutdown of a chemical plant have to operate under the same detailed safety requirements as everybody else, and presumably they have to know what they are doing and understand the risks they are taking.</P>
      <P>There is no substitute for people knowing what they are doing and the risks they are taking.  Unless you are talking about &mdash; and it is not specified there &mdash; one to one supervision, you are talking about leaving somebody under the supervision of a person who may not be present.  If you have a specialist person working with somebody beside him saying: &ldquo;Do precisely this or that&rdquo;, that is fine, but even walking around an offshore installation could be a risky business, if somebody does not know what he is doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Walking around a chemical plant, a subject I know a bit about, is a risky business.  No untrained person should be allowed to walk from one end to the other, even if they were left there by one trained person and told to meet another trained person somewhere else, because there is a risk.  Anybody who has a job to <Col N="2460" /> do on an offshore rig ought to be trained and understand what they are doing.</P>

      <P>The person going out would have to do the preliminary NMS course I was talking about earlier, but if this provision was put in an apprentice could not work on an oil rig without supervision.  This section would allow an apprentice to do his basic course, to which we referred earlier, and he could continue his apprenticeship under supervision on the oil rig.  That is put in to cover apprentices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House unnecessarily, but let us consider an apprentice who had served part of his time in the food industry, and then moved to the chemical industry where there would perhaps be toxic substances. My understanding is that before he would be let onto the plant, he would have to be informed of the risks and the differences between the risks of working in a food industry, where there were relatively few toxic substances, and working in another area where there were relatively substantial quantities of toxic substances and potentially explosive materials.  The fact that he was an apprentice working under supervision would not exempt him from the requirement to have some basic training about what he was doing.  I cannot see why the Minister cannot specify that anybody who works on these installations has to have at least preliminary training or else must work on a strictly one to one supervision basis.  Supervision by one person of another person is fine, but I do not think that necessarily means one to one supervision.</P>

      <P>I hope you will point out to the Minister, a Chathaoirligh, that there is no connection between us and those less energetic brethren of the other House who are on holiday at present.  This is a different House.</P>
      <P>As I said, it gives me no pleasure whatsoever to have to move this motion.  What we are debating here this evening is probably the greatest, most savage attack on the educational services we have ever experienced.  It is important for the record to re-read the motion, which commences:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Seanad Éireann, while recognising the need for controlling public spending, condemns the arbitrary nature of the decision to cut back the funding of RTCs and universities. These cutbacks will:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>1.  Create unemployment and the forced emigration of highly qualified personnel in whom the State has <Col N="2464" /> already made a substantial investment.</P>
    <P>Unemployment and emigration are the two most emotive areas in terms of this Government's supposed concern for people in recent months.  Indeed I might congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy F. Fahey, on his comments about illegal emigrants to the United States. Bearing in mind that he represents a constituency from which practically a football team emigrates to the United States weekly, he was absolutely right, that not only do the people in America not care about them but, as I am about to illustrate, neither do those at home, particularly those people with responsibility for them.  This is something the Minister herself should take on board.</P>
    <P>The motion continues:</P>
    <P>2.  Threaten the quality of third level education by reducing personnel at a time when student numbers are on the increase.</P>
    <P>3.  Stop essential building programmes with a knock-on effect on employment in the building industry.</P>
    <P>4.  Lower the morale and threaten the security of tenure of all workers in education.</P>
    <P>5.  Eventually reduce the numbers of highly qualified young people who are so essential to future employment and to the creation of projects.</P>
    <P>These are the young people in whom the Government have told us time and again they have such great faith, who represent our hopes for and investment in the future.  It is my belief that the only hope of our young people is to leave this country as quickly as possible.  Nobody is prepared to do anything for them here, least of all the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>I will set out to prove that this set of cutbacks the Minister proposes will reinforce inequity, will consolidate existing under-privilege, bringing inequality of access onto a new plane never dreamt of before.  It is a new and draconian refinement in discrimination against the disadvantaged.  I would go so far as to say <Col N="2465" /> it is an act of educational vandalism.  It will create unemployment.  Time will show that it is a planning decision as ill-advised and ridiculous as were the plans to build the Ballymun flats complex.  If the Minister has any care for her reputation in an historical context she will rescind these decisions immediately, accept this motion and let us all go home.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately these proposed cutbacks will create unemployment in colleges. We have observed already that the reduction of a 4 per cent in the money available for payment of staffs at third-level will enforce a reduction of 6 per cent in the staffing of those third level colleges.  This means that those in whom we have made a substantial investment throughout first, second and third levels &mdash; in whom we had placed our hopes for a new generation bearing new information, new techniques and technological developments &mdash; will be out of jobs.  It is the latest entrants who will be the first to go.  They, too, will be forced to take the boat, ship or whatever out of the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to forget that there is an increasing number of students entering third-level education.  At a time of increasing student numbers, reducing staff numbers, the student/lecturer ratio &mdash; already the worst in Europe &mdash; will deteriorate further.  As that relationship deteriorates so also will quality suffer and if the quality deteriorates, students suffer.  The students are the responsibility of the Minister.  It means that the time staff need for researching and further development will have to be spent totally in lecturing.</P>
    <P>Over the years we have listened to the reasonable argument, of the need for industry and education to be compatible. We have heard of the need for education to respond to the needs of industry so that job creation projects can take off. We have heard of the need to develop the area of research and development where a bridge can be formed between education and industry.  All the time this discussion was no more than lip service. We had an example of it earlier in the year at second level in the need for the educational service to meet student needs <Col N="2466" /> as they embark into the workplace.  The bridge between the two is formed of those who counsel young people on their future careers.  Instead of strengthening that bond or bridge the Minister, through a reduction in the number of career guidance teachers &mdash; I see the Minister looking at me in astonishment.  I was wondering whether she was listening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Senator's remarks are fascinating.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Let the Minister tell the House she will appoint more.  It is the lack of information that is so unfortunate in this respect.  I must throw in a few more of these comments if I get such an animated response from the Minister.  I am glad to see that she is listening with such great interest to what I have to say. I would be quite happy at any time to advise her on future planning decisions. With regard to the cuts now proposed for the RTCs and the NIHE, I look forward to hearing from the Fianna Fáil benches, those people who have made the case for the VECs and for the involvement of local authorities over the past two or three months, telling me what they think about the cutbacks in the RTCs, what it means in Sligo, Carlow and all the other places where the RTCs are located.  Will they tell me what effect that will have in their areas and how they will respond?  I look forward to hearing an honest response, as I am sure does the Minister. I hope they are telling the Minister at party meetings, even if they will not give us the benefit of their great knowledge here.</P>
      <P>In the RTCs &mdash; the institutions in many instances closest to industries &mdash; in effect these cutbacks are ensuring the stopping of research and development.  Likewise they are abolishing jobs in the building programmes now put on the shelf because of lack of money.  It means that the building projects in the RTCs, NIHE, the Dental College in Trinity and so on are all now suffering with consequent immediate losses to the building industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also important to stress &mdash; because nobody else apparently will say it <Col N="2467" /> officially &mdash; that these cutbacks in allocations to the colleges and to the staffs at third level are a knife in the whole area of research and development, so important to future jobs.  It means that those new areas of computer studies and computer technology &mdash; in which those people lecturing, imparting knowledge at third level have to spend at least 50 per cent of their time studying and acquiring new information &mdash; will not now be available to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister may think she can sell these cutbacks publicly and get away with it.  Many people feel that these cutbacks at third level are rarified and cut off from the rest of the real world.  I can anticipate some of the comments that might come from some of the Minister's colleagues on those benches, that the real education and real university is the university of life.  Let me tell the Minister that these cutbacks in third level education are a savage act against the poor of Ireland.  I want to develop some of those points.</P>
    <P>If the Minister takes, as she is doing, £250,000 from the budget of the colleges of education this year, the effects run right through the system.  It means that in the colleges of education there are fewer jobs, fewer students and, eventually, fewer teachers.  That is the first step. The primary schools at the moment, as the Minister well knows and has said time and time again when in Opposition &mdash; and I hope she will not be shy to repeat it tonight &mdash; have the largest classes in Western Europe, are the most under-resourced schools at primary level in Western Europe, are the most underfinanced at primary level in Western Europe and are operating with the lowest level of ancillary support and the highest pupil/teacher ratio in Western Europe. It is shameful that the Minister is now putting a further strain on this system which is already creaking and which needs support, help and investment rather than further cutbacks.</P>
    <P>People ask where does cutting the number of teachers affect us?  I want to give one example, one reference, one statistic that might stick in people's <Col N="2468" /> minds.  For the South of Ireland to have the same pupil/teacher ratio or class size in their primary schools as is at present available in Northern Ireland, we would need, as the Minister well knows, 5,000 primary teachers trained immediately. The Minister's response to that need is to cut back on the Vote to the colleges of education.  It is disgraceful and I might say in passing that the pupil/teacher ratio in Northern Ireland is the worst in the United Kingdom.  It grieves me to say it, but at this point I must recall the crocodile tears of Deputy Mary O'Rourke, Opposition spokesperson on education, on the closure of Carysfort College last year.  It should go into the record.  It is shameful, when the Minister agreed to and accepted the need for development in this area, that she is now stewarding further cutbacks.</P>
    <P>Fewer teachers at primary level again also means that quality suffers.  The larger the class, the less time for the individual pupil.  The academic nature of the educational structure means that the move from first to second level and from second to third level is very often determined by the pupil's level of academic achievement.  If the pupils do not get a chance at primary level by being put into over-crowded classes which cannot cater for their individual needs, they will be behind at second level.  If they are behind at second level, they will not get into third level and this, of course, is what the Minister hopes the public will buy, that third level does not concern us.  Of course, it does not; it does not concern too many of the population who can never hope to get there.  But they will all suffer the effects of cutbacks in that area. At the moment, less than 10 per cent of the young population can hope to be catered for in third level.</P>
    <P>Of course &mdash; and this is the saddest part of it &mdash; where the poor suffer, the wealthy can buy their way out.  If the well-off feel that the service provided by the State is not sufficient for the needs of their children, they go and buy a better type of education, as they see it, somewhere else.  This is the area where the inequality of access in particular is <Col N="2469" /> reinforced.  In fact, in the Minister's determination that the poor will suffer, this is where the vicious circle of under-privilege and poverty is maintained and maintained still further.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister: where is she going with education?  What is it that she has to tell us about education?  What is it that we can gain from these particular cuts that she has outlined?  I appeal to her, rather than have us go through this charade of trying to find out where the cuts will take place, to have the courage to pull back the veil over her cutbacks and tell us precisely how she sees them being implemented at third level, second level and first level.  Even though the debate tonight centres around third level, we want to point out to the Minister that the knock-on, accumulative effect in other areas concerns us every bit as much.</P>
    <P>We are now looking at an educational service which is less and less able or ready to meet the wants of those who most need it.  I have pointed out how the cuts at third level work their way down through the system to make it more and more difficult for anybody to get value out of the educational service.  From the worst off parts of the community, let us take the example of those living in Sheriff Street, living in the worst housing conditions, with 70 per cent or more unemployment, with home and relationship problems, with stresses and strains of living in over-crowded, poverty-ridden conditions, with hardly a chance of employment.</P>
    <P>These young people living there for 16, 17, 18, 19 hours a day then go to the classrooms and we expect that the primary classrooms of Ireland, already over-crowded, will in some way, over five hours of the day, counteract that environment and intervene to the advantage of those young people who are suffering from such an environment for the other 19 hours.  It is not fair, right or supportable by anybody who is elected as a public representative.</P>
    <P>I find it astonishing that, hand in hand with the draconian cutbacks to which I referred earlier, the Minister is also cutting back on the grants available to those <Col N="2470" /> who are involved in adult literacy courses and those who have not been able to avail of first chance education.  Third level education for these people is the only chance they might have and the third level that they are talking about is a third level of adult education and adult literacy courses.  Also, it seems incredible that, along with that, the Minister shaves another £250,000 off the paltry Vote that was available for projects to support and help the disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>All in all, we are looking at a situation of growing student numbers, cutbacks in the money available to look after them, at a future where it will not be possible for the educational system to cope with the needs of any of the pupils.  We are now cutting back on the services at first level, second level and third level, the disadvantaged, travellers &mdash; any of the groups who need our help.  Whom are we serving at the moment?  Whom are we looking after in the educational service? We are looking at the stress and strain of workers in education at all three levels. We are looking at the stress and strain now finding their way into the relationship between work in education and students or pupils in education.  The Minister has a clear and absolute duty in this area. She must say that education is an investment in the future.  All too often I have heard it said that third level education is something that people should see as a privilege.</P>
    <P>It is quite all right for someone philosophically to consider third level to be a privileged thing and to be something to which one might aspire.  That is a personal view, it is a personal philosophy that somebody may well have.  I do not support it and I cannot even understand how it works out.  If I hear Ministers and Governments saying that the young people are the hope for the future, if I hear them saying that we need to have development in education, that we need to have research, further technological developments, movement at all levels of education and then if pupils with ability cannot proceed through the system because their parents do not have the money to put them through, who loses? <Col N="2471" /> Is it the pupil, or is it the family, or is it the service?  It is not; it is the State who loses.  What we are saying is that we do not need the ability of young people: &ldquo;If you cannot afford to buy your way through the system, get the boat and get out of here&rdquo;.  That is the stark reality and that is the responsibility that faces any Minister for Education in this day and age.</P>
    <P>We want to see a little bit of concern, a little bit of hope and a little bit of the confidence that we heard so much about during the election campaign.  I stress to the Minister that what we are seeing here tonight is a vicious attack on education. It will create unemployment, force emigration and threaten the quality of the service we are giving.  In fact, the quality will deteriorate and it will, without doubt, stop essential building programmes.</P>
    <P>How can the Minister justify knocking and stopping essential building programmes at third level when up to six months ago she was shouting that they were so necessary?  This will lower morale and threaten the security of everybody in education but more than anything else it will reduce the numbers of highly qualified young people who are so essential to future employment and to the creation of projects.  We will no longer be able to hear Ministers for Education saying that our greatest resource are our educated young population if this continues.  We will not have that resource in the future. We are now taking a step backwards.</P>
    <P>In the history of this State there has been constant development in the educational services being offered to people and in particular to young people.  There has been development in this area year after year by successive Governments. As a member of a teachers union I have fought with Governments for more, for better quality or for extra input but I never had to consider anything like the cutbacks that are now being effected.  I am looking forward to hearing how the Minister can justify hitting the young people of Ireland in this way.  As we say in the motion we accept the need to control public expenditure.  Of course <Col N="2472" /> there is a need for control overall spending but the Minister has prioritised and in Government you have agreed and acceeded to a prioritisation which has hit the poor, has damaged employment prospects and has threatened the future of a young generation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;recognising the need to control public expenditure in the interests of laying the groundwork for economic recovery and in view of the fact that the allocation for total recurrent expenditure in the higher education sector in 1987 is 5.6 per cent greater that that provided in the 1986 Estimates, approves the measures adopted by the Government to maintain higher education services at as high a level as possible.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At the outset I would like to be associated with the congratulations and good wishes which have been extended to the Minister from many quarters on her appointment as Minister for Education.  I would like to join with all those in wishing her a long, happy and successful term of office in the very important ministry to which she has been appointed.  In view of the Minister's deep interest in and knowledge of education and her commitment to the improvement of the education service, I am confident that in spite of the present difficult economic circumstances she will prove to be one of the best Ministers for Education this country has ever had.</P>
      <P>In his budget statement of 31 March this year, as reported at column 787 of the Dáil Official Report of that day, under the section headed, Education, the Minister for Finance said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Exchequer cash that will be available to educational institutions <Col N="2473" /> will be reduced.  The Government recognise that many of these institutions are already operating under tight financial constraints but further economies are unavoidable.</P>
    <P>Earlier in his speech the Minister had outlined the seriousness of the economic situation and had spelled out his and the Government's determination to restore order to the public finances and to progressively reduce the level of Government borrowing and the cost of servicing the national debt.  In order to achieve these objectives it was inevitable that there would have to be reductions in Government expenditure right across the board.  When he made the statement I have just quoted the Minister was making it clear that education, like every other sector, was being called on to bear its share of the reductions.  It is obvious from the very first line of the motion before the House this evening that the Senators who tabled it, in common with the vast majority of people, recognise and accept the need for controlling public spending. There are very few people who honestly believe we could continue as we were going.</P>
    <P>When the Government took up office on 10 March, just four months ago, the national debt had already broken the £25 billion barrier and was gathering momentum all the time.  More than one-third of all tax revenue in the current year would go on debt service.  This was the situation with which the Government were faced. Urgent action was needed and because of the seriousness of the problem that action had inevitably to be both strong and firm if it was to have any impact.  I was speaking to a person the other evening who compared the situation to a patient who is critically ill and who needs major surgery urgently.  The fact that the surgery should have been carried out much earlier does not make things any easier.  It is understandable that the patient does not enjoy the surgery because it is quite painful, but neither does the surgeon derive any pleasure from having to carry it out.  Yet both know that it is absolutely necessary if the patient is to <Col N="2474" /> survive and be restored to health.  Neither I am sure do the Government derive any pleasure from doing what they have to do at the moment.  However, we all know that if this country is to have any future and if the young people who are in education at every level today are to have any future, it is essential that the necessary remedial action be taken in relation to the economy irrespective of how painful that action is.  Confidence must be restored and interest rates must be reduced so that investment will be encouraged because without investment there will be no worthwhile economic growth.  It is only through economic growth that we will see a reduction in unemployment levels and some prospect of employment for the thousands of young people who are in education, and particularly those who are in higher education.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied most people accept that the resolute way in which the Government are tackling the country's problems is already beginning to bear fruit: interest rates have started to fall and confidence is growing; economic development is being promoted and food processing, mariculture, forestry, tourism and horticulture which are all areas of significant job creation potential have been identified by the Government for special priority.</P>

      <P>What about education?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>Other initiatives taken by the Government, such as the arrangements which have been put in train for the establishment of a major international financial services centre in the Custom House Docks site, have significant employment implications for our young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is against this background that we must consider the motion and the amendment which are before us this evening.  The amendment states that public expenditure control is absolutely vital if the groundwork for economic recovery is to be laid.  The motion, as I have already said, appears to accept this also.  I know <Col N="2475" /> that like me, every Senator would like to see considerably increased funding for education and I am sure we could all identify priority areas at every level where such funding could be used to very good effect.  I am confident that the policies being pursued by the Government will result in such additional funding being available in the not too distant future.  In the meantime we have to accept the harsh realities of the situation in which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>Since the motion does not state otherwise I take it that the Senators who tabled it are satisfied with the overall gross provision for education in the current year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should point out at this stage that the total amount provided in this year for overall education expenditure is 10 per cent higher than the gross expenditure figure for last year.  As the amendment points out, the allocation for total recurrent expenditure in the higher education sector in 1987 is 5.6 per cent greater than that provided in the 1986 Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the sponsors of the motion seem to be concerned about is the share of the overall provision which the RTCs and the universities received.  If they accept the overall provision, but if they are not satisfied with the allocation from the overall provision to third level, they are by implication making the case that the allocation to either second level or primary education should be reduced in order to provide additional funding to the universities and the RTCs.  I could not accept that. <Col N="2476" /> While I recognise the tremendous work being done in our third level institutions, and the fact that they have been operating within very tight financial constraints for the past number of years, in the final analysis they are in a better position to minimise the effects of a reduction in resources than either the primary or second level sectors.</P>
    <P>The sponsors of the motion also seem to be making the point that the decision in relation to the funding of the RTCs and the universities should have been reached and conveyed to the college authorities in a manner different from that which was used.  I assume that what they have in mind is that there should have been a degree of consultation which did not take place.  If this is the case then I would have to make the point that, in the circumstances, what happened was understandable.  Consultation of its very nature takes time.  The Government were in a situation where immediate urgent action was required and to delay the action in order to allow consultation to take place would have only exacerbated the problem which necessitated the action.  However, I am sure that if the university or the RTC authorities wish to have discussions in relation to any difficulties, which they may have as a result of these decisions, they will find an open door as far as the Minister for Education and the Government are concerned.  I believe that this has been the experience of other interests which have been affected by similar Government decisions and I am satisfied that the same situation will obtain as far as the educational interests are concerned.</P>
    <P>I would not attempt to argue that a reduction in the availability of resources will not have some adverse effects on the quality and the development of the education service.  Of course it will, and this is true irrespective of what level of education we are talking about.  Neither would I attempt to make light of the difficulties faced by everyone involved in education as they try to maintain the quality of the service as far as it is humanly possible to do so in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2477" /> I also accept the argument that education is the very last service which should be made to suffer in times of economic recession having regard to the fact that any investment in education is an investment in the country's future.  However, I believe that the situation in which we now find ourselves is more than just an economic recession.  We are in national economic crisis and this crisis is being tackled by the Government in the only realistic way possible in the circumstances. I accept that in the short term education expenditure will not be at the level at which we would all wish to see it.  I hope that when the economy improves, as a result of the measures to which I referred earlier, the Government will have as a first priority the restoration of educational funding to the greatest possible degree.  Having regard to the past record of the Fianna Fáil Party in Government in relation to education&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and recognising the tenacity of the present Minister and her commitment to the education service at every level, I am confident that the curtailment of funding for education will not continue for any longer than is necessary. I compliment the Minister on having ensured, despite all the financial constraints, that there has been no worsening of the basic pupil-teacher ratio at first or second level.  I am pleased that the decision of the previous Government to bring guidance teachers within the quota at second level has been reversed.  I also welcome the fact that no restriction has been imposed on entry to education and also that higher education grants and the income eligibility limits for these grants have been increased to keep pace with inflation.  When one considers that three out of every four students in the RTCs have their fees paid by the State, either by way of VEC scholarships, ESF grants, or higher education grants, we get some idea of the massive investment which is made by the State in third level education. Time does not permit me to deal <Col N="2478" /> with all the other matters which are referred to in the motion, but I would make the point in relation to the morale of workers in education that nothing could be more damaging to the morale of such workers than a continuation of the situation where many of the highly qualified young people who graduate each year from our third level institutions have little or no prospect of employment in this country.</P>
      <P>In relation to the reference in the motion to unemployment and the forced emigration of highly qualified personnel in whom the State has already made a substantial investment, this is the problem which the Government are addressing and attempting to redress through the implementation of their <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  There is also a reference in the motion to the fact that building programmes which are not being proceeded with immediately will have a knock-on effect on employment in the building industry.  The Government have undertaken a review of all third level education capital projects.  As we know, some at least of these projects were promised by the previous Administration in the run-up to the general election. I accept that some of these proposed projects are essential to cater for the increased numbers of students entering third level education.  However, I also believe that it is not unreasonable that the new Government should have an opportunity to examine all projects so that they can be absolutely satisfied that the scarce resources which are available are put to the best possible use.</P>
      <P>The measures adopted by the Government having regard to the economic situation will maintain higher education services at as high a level as is possible in the present difficult climate.  I ask Members of the House to support the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very honoured to be here this evening particularly when the Senators of the Upper House are gracing <Col N="2479" /> us with their presence in our own Chamber. They are welcome.  I am very honoured to have here many of the new Senators and I congratulate them on their election.  I did not have an opportunity to do so earlier and I put it formally on the record of the House.  I also congratulate you, a Chathaoirligh, on the very dignified way in which you have renewed your duties as Cathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the motion at present before the Seanad.  Senators will be aware that I dealt with the education services in general in my speech on the Estimates in the Dáil in June and earlier in my address in the budget debate in April.  So, far from being a shrinking violet in declaring my intentions, as outlined by Senator O'Toole, I have spoken in this House on two occasions in education debates.  The motion put down by Senators J. O'Toole and Ross, and the other Senators however, puts the focus on the higher education sector and I am happy to deal in as much detail as time will allow with my strategy for the vital element &mdash; as Senator Joe O'Toole said &mdash; of our educational services.</P>
      <P>First of all, I should like to record my conviction that the need to bring public expenditure under control has the same widespread support in this House as it has in the Dáil.  Indeed, I believe that the Government's intention in that regard is accepted &mdash; as has been shown in recent &mdash; public opinion polls &mdash; by a substantial majority of the Irish people.  It is hardly surprising, therefore, that the education sector would be expected to play its part in achieving the financial targets set by the Government &mdash; and so ably outlined by Senator Brian Mullooly in his address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moreover, it is reasonable to expect that all levels of the system should carry a fair share of the burden.  The task to which we all need to address ourselves is to keep expenditure within agreed limits while, at the same time, maintaining the services in all their essential aspects.  I believe that the proposals I have prepared for the higher education sector represent a successful attempt to achieve <Col N="2480" /> both of these objectives and I am confident that I will receive the wholehearted co-operation of the HEA and the individual institutes in putting these proposals into effect.</P>
    <P>May I just say here as an aside, far from not being in consultation as had been implied by one of the previous speakers, immediately on the publication of the Estimates, I met with the following groups connected with third level education; a representative group of the CEOs, the IVEA on four occasions, the chairpersons of the VECs, with the heads of the universities and with the HEA.  I have met with all of those groups once and some of them twice.  I am engaged in my third round of meetings with others. I certainly have come upfront with the people who, in the popular coinage of words, are at the work face.</P>
    <P>As you are well aware, vacancies arising in the public service may be filled only with the approval of the Minister in whose area the vacancy occurs in conjunction with the Minister for Finance. I have been successful in excluding the higher education sector from the operation of this procedure and in making an alternative arrangement with the Minister for Finance.  Accordingly, my Department have issued a circular letter to VECs responsible for third level colleges setting out their rates of expenditure on pay for the rest of 1987 and for the whole of next year and advising them that it will be a matter for the management of each college to make the most appropriate staffing arrangements open to it in the light of its financial allocation.</P>
    <P>Not only did they know some months ago what they would have for 1987 but they now know their allocation for the whole of 1988 for their staffing arrangements well in advance.  The use of the word &ldquo;arbitrary&rdquo; which in my understanding of the word means sudden or with no notice, is not appropriate in the light of the provisions I have made and the fact that I have met quite frequently with the various heads and that they now know their staffing allocations for 1988. The Higher Education Authority have also notified the institutions operating <Col N="2481" /> under their aegis of the position for the remainder of this year and for next year. No matter how people here may shake their heads that is the exact position.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that in some cases the exercise of sophisticated management procedures will be called for to safeguard permanent wholetime posts but I am happy to say that we are far from a situation of unemployment or enforced emigration of highly qualified personnel.</P>
    <P>The second part of the motion suggests that a reduction in personnel will threaten the quality of third level education at a time when student numbers are on the increase.  As I have just pointed out, I do not see a major problem as far as reductions in staff are concerned despite an anticipated growth in student numbers.</P>
    <P>On the HEA side it is my intention to enable the universities and the National Institutes for Higher Education to continue to provide courses leading to academic and professional qualifications in the light of the demand from students and in the light of the manpower or personpower needs of our economy.  I believe we should strive to achieve a reasonable balance between individual demand for higher education and the needs of the economy for the services which highly trained graduates can provide. Over a considerable period the HEA sector has continued to cater for increased student intake without corresponding additions to staff and accommodation. I am happy to acknowledge publicly, as I have done when I met the heads of the institutions, the additional productivity which has been achieved in this way.  It has been no mean feat for them to have so done.  They have done so with skill and acumen and it is indicative of the level of capability which they exhibit as heads of their individual institutions.</P>
    <P>The RTCs in particular have shown remarkable skill in adapting their accommodation to cope with students in excess of the number for which they were originally designed.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Toole spoke at length with great verve, aplomb and élan and I did not interrupt him.  Will he allow me to speak?  They have been helped in this respect by the relative decline in numbers in the craft apprentice area, an area of activity which has traditionally made heavy demands on staff and available accommodation.  The drop in apprenticeship numbers &mdash; of approximately 27 per cent &mdash; has meant that space has become available for conversion at relatively modest cost into classrooms which can be used to teach certificate, diploma and degree programmes. I would like, at this juncture, to mention the considerable amount of capital investment in buildings at universities and other third level institutions which is continuing throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Work on the provision of a new engineering school building at UCD which started in the spring of this year is progressing satisfactorily and it is expected that the new building will be ready for occupation for the academic year 1989-90. This is a major project which, when completed, will have all the facilities and latest equipment necessary to produce our future high quality engineering graduates.  I should also like to acknowledge the involvement of the EC in this vital project through the substantial contribution made in grant form from the European Regional Development Fund.</P>
      <P>In Galway construction work commenced on the new microbiology building in UCG in September 1986 and is expected to be completed before the end of 1987.  This building, costing almost £2 million, will replace the existing substandard temporary accommodation which has housed the Department of Microbiology for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At NIHE, Dublin, a £1.4 million extension to the Henry Grattan building is underway at present and is expected to be completed and ready for September. The main contract for Phrase II of the UCD Library has also been completed <Col N="2483" /> and the furnishing and equipping of the new building and the adaptation of existing spaces is now proceeding.</P>
    <P>In the recent past, a major extension to NIHE, Limerick, has been completed. Other extensions have been completed at the National College of Art and Design and at NIHE, Dublin.  Many other minor adaptation works and extensions have also been carried out in other universities and designated institutions.</P>
    <P>It is also planned to provide additional facilities for the further development of the National Microelectronics Research Centre at UCC and to extend the industrial microbiology laboratories at UCD.</P>
    <P>With regard to the third level colleges in the VEC areas, major extensions are being provided for the colleges of technology at Kevin Street and Bolton Street which will enable these colleges to provide for a total of 5,000 students.  The Kevin Street extension has recently been completed and the furniture and equipment will be purchased this year.  The Bolton Street extension is due for completion later this year and the furnishing and equipping will follow.  A major new building has also been provided for the regional technical college at Tralee to cater for over 800 students.  This building is also being furnished and equipped this year.</P>

      <P>A programme for the purchase of computer equipment at four RTC's &mdash; Tralee, Athlone, Sligo and Carlow &mdash; is in progress and it is expected that this equipment will be purchased later this year.  It will be seen, therefore, that the third level area of education has received substantial State subventions to allow the institutions concerned to have the buildings, furniture, equipment and facilities essential to maintain the high level of educational excellence for which they are rightly noted.</P>
      <P>During 1985 the previous Government announced a major programme of capital development in the third level sector.  I have already mentioned some of these projects which are ongoing.  The implications of such a programme and the time scale involved are extremely daunting and would present a major challenge to any Government given the current limitations of our national resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems that a capital programme of such a scale presented a daunting financial scenario to the previous Government also since before they left office they had decided they would carry out a review of the long-term requirements for third level places, taking account of all relevant factors including demographic trends. Pending this review a Goverment memorandum has been prepared that no new commitment on any third level project <Col N="2485" /> was to be incurred without prior approval of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>From projections of student numbers it is evident that peak enrolment at third level will occur in the next decade and that thereafter student numbers will begin to decline.  The future scale of this decline can be gauged from the fact that over the next decade pupils at primary level are projected to decrease by almost 63,000.  In my estimation that figure is very conservative and I believe that the number that will be realised as the years unfold will be considerably in excess of that figure.</P>
    <P>Given these circumstances it will be necessary for the Government, in conjunction with the Higher Education Authority, to review proposals for capital development in the third level area for future years, taking into account demographic and all other relevant factors. However, the Government are committed to providing higher education for as many of our young people as possible and to seeking continuing improvement in the quality of the education provided within the constraints placed on them by the present availability of financial resources.</P>
    <P>The financial provision for the higher education grants scheme in this financial year is £20.6 million which is 25 per cent more than the 1986 outturn.  Additional students will be grant aided and the income eligibility limits and the maintenance elements of the grants have been increased in line with inflation.  The substantial increase in the financial allocation for these grants bears witness to the Government's commitment to ensuring that the less well off but talented young people in the community are not precluded from pursuing higher level studies due to their financial circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware of the commitment of those involved in education, the efforts they are making as they seek to use to the best advantage the resources available to them and the difficulties which they face at present in carrying out their duties. The reality is, however, that this country <Col N="2486" /> faces serious financial and economic difficulties. The Government have set themselves the primary task of taking difficult decisions which will be necessary to tackle the underlying problems.  Let me say that we have only started to take them.  The measures I have outlined and which are in motion for 1987 are extremely generous in the circumstances. I have absolutely no anticipation that the 11 per cent increase in Government expenditure which we have been able to produce for this year can in any way be maintained because we have started on what is going to be a very difficult, hard, painful road for every one of us in this House and the other House and the general public outside.  To expect that any sector of Government spending can increase at 11 per cent while inflation is at three point something per cent is a gross misrepresentation and a gross mis-assumption of what will be the relevant facts in the few years ahead.</P>
    <P>However, we are heartened by the results we are achieving and by the goodwill which is being constantly expressed. We are also very confident that we have a real task ahead of us, that is, to make a balanced judgment on everything that will be put in front of us so that in our various areas of experience and within the various arms of Government we are operating we will be able to see that the disadvantaged and the less well off receive the essential services, in each Government area, to which they are duly entitled.</P>
    <P>There is a large measure of agreement on the nature of these decisions which must include reductions in public expenditure in order to reduce the overwhelming burden of the national debt. Needless to say, all sectors must contribute their share to the necessary reductions.  Nevertheless the Government's commitment to education and the high priority they accord to educational needs even in these difficult times is clearly illustrated by the fact that this year's total allocation for the education services is more than 11 per cent greater than the 1986 outturn.  The 1986 outturn was considerably greater than the 1986 <Col N="2487" /> Estimate.  At 7 per cent of GNP it represents a greater proportion of national resources to education than ever before in the history of this State and it amounts to almost 18 per cent of the total Exchequer spending.  Those figures are on the record, verifiable and correct.</P>
    <P>In the third level sector the allocation for total recurrent expenditure in 1987 is almost 5.6 per cent greater than was provided in the 1986 estimates.  To represent this provision which is greatly in excess of inflation as a cutback is, I submit, an exaggeration and in an attempt to spread alarm and disquiet among the public in general who, I know, will take cognisance of the real facts as outlined in my speech.  The real facts are the figures as I have quoted them.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Toole said there has been a cutback in the literacy programme.  The literacy programme received an increase of £50,000 over their 1986 allocation &mdash; this is just an aside, a Chathaoirligh, not really relevant to the motion, but Senator O'Toole referred to it, therefore I must refute what he said. I do not know whether I will be able to maintain that level next year but we are dealing with what is the position now and 50 per cent was the increase in budget expenditure by this Government, over the amount provided by the last Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the motion raises the important question of morale.  I acknowledge that we are living in difficult times and that decisions, which must be taken for the general good, may, and will, call for sacrifices on the part of individuals or particular sections of our society.  I hope I have demonstrated our resolve to protect <Col N="2488" /> the fabric of the education system by making an arrangement with the Minister for Finance which ensures exceptional treatment for the education sector with regard to the filling of vacancies, <i>vis-a-vis</i> the arrangements made for the public service in general.  This provides clear evidence of the Government's commitment to education and of their determination to continue to provide an educational service of the highest quality for our young people.</P>
    <P>I have followed the speeches of the two previous speakers with great interest.  If we, both the Senators here and the Deputy on this side, are not to be accused of acting out a charade in this House, we must face facts very squarely, and the facts are as I have outlined.  This year expenditure on education increased at a greater rate than ever before in the history of the State.  I will not say that it will do so again.  Indeed, I have very grave reservations that that scale of increase could be matched foreseeably by any Government in power in the years ahead. That is the overall Government expenditure on education at a rate of between 10 per cent and 11 per cent when inflation was running at about 3.4 or 3.5 per cent. Therefore, we are speaking of overall Government expenditure at a rate of 8 per cent above the inflation rate.  In regard to the third level sector Senator O'Toole used words like &ldquo;savaged&rdquo; and &ldquo;vandalised&rdquo;, indeed with great effect.  I cannot see how an increase of that nature, the largest ever in the history of the State provision for education, can by any measure be regarded in the terms he used.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker asked that I would express hope, confidence and concern. I express hope in the Government commitment, as I have outlined, which has shown itself in the area of education. I have listed all the capital developments which have happened.  Since the OECD report and the ensuing investment report issued there has been a continuing and steady growth in the provision of education services.  It is time now for us to take stock.  It is time now for us to review what we have done and to mark out our <Col N="2489" /> priorities as to where we want to go in the realm of education.</P>
    <P>Of course, it would be absolutely charming and beautiful if I could come into this Chamber here tonight and say: &ldquo;Yes.  Every capital project we have on hand is going to go ahead and every university and third level institution that looks for additional staffing and resources may have it.  I may just write a cheque.&rdquo; People could then recruit builders and build, and so on.  I cannot do that and neither can the Government do it.  The reason I express confidence, concern and hope is that we have at last started on the road which will lead to hope and confidence for the future of our people. How can we go on spending money which we have to borrow at huge rates of interest?  How can we continue &mdash; all Governments have been at fault in this; I do not exempt any particular Government and I do not say that one has been purer or whiter than another &mdash; to mortgage not just ourselves but our children and their children?  That is what we are doing.</P>
    <P>If we went to the money markets or to the gnomes of Zurich and asked for an extra £1,000 million to spend on education, on health, or whatever worthy area it was, because they are all worthy and they all need increased expenditure, we would be tightening the noose which is already around our necks.  My generation are at a certain stage of our lives when, I suppose, we look ahead to a limited number of years but we are all, in our various ways, whether or not we are married or have children, responsible to the next generation.</P>
    <P>While I am a member of this Government I will take my duties seriously and my duties are in this order: First I am a member of a Government who are committed to making Ireland a country that can stand up and look at its creditor countries in the face; secondly, I am concerned that, as a small country, a country that has a proud past and a proud present, we can develop our resources and enhance our country without the huge burden of debt which is daily dragging us down as if it were a chain around us. <Col N="2490" /> Thirdly, I am totally dedicated to education. All my past, my upbringing, my life before I came into the Houses of the Oireachtas has been involved in education and it will continue to be so.  I will ensure that the resources which we have will continue to be spent in the areas which need them.  To represent as vandalism and other highly emotive words an increase of 11 per cent in the total budget for education and an increase of 5.6 per cent in the budget of third level education is a total exaggeration.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I have pleasure in supporting the amendment to the motion which reads:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;recognising the need to control public expenditure in the interests of laying the groundwork for economic recovery and in view of the fact that the allocation for total recurrent expenditure in the higher education sector in 1987 is 5.6 per cent greater than that provided in the 1986 Estimates, approves the measures adopted by the Government to maintain higher education services at as high a level as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>In my time in this House and in the other House I do not think I have ever heard a more extraordinary speech than we just had from the Minister. It was extraordinary in two ways. First, it was delivered as if the past five years and her record as Opposition spokesman and the positions she and her party took in Opposition simply did not exist; as if the present began in March 1987.  I will comment on that in a moment.  The second extraordinary aspect of the speech we have just heard &mdash; and it only occurred to me having read it twice and having listened to the Minister - is that we have only got half the speech.  What we have not got is the hidden agenda.  There is not a word in this speech about cutbacks, not a mention of Thurles, not a mention of Waterford or of Trinity.  It is a speech which is a clever documentation of those schemes which have as yet escaped the cutbacks <Col N="2491" /> and the savage knife.  It is a speech which certainly did not inform Members here tonight and which made no attempt to address the very real questions raised by the Senators who proposed this motion.</P>
      <P>The cutbacks as detailed in this motion are real; they exist.  They are having and will have devastating consequences in all areas of Irish education.  No shuffling with figures, no juggling with percentage points can disguise their existence, their severity and their arbitrary nature.  Nor can the consequences they will have for Irish education generally be disguised. These cuts emphatically are not the better way we were told about on one expensive hoarding after another during the course of the last election campaign.</P>
      <P>Let me speak briefly about the context in which these cuts are taking place.  For the previous five years there was one consistent theme in Government policy and that was that public spending had to be contained.  Changes, cuts, rationalisation and rethinking were necessary. Hard decisions had to be taken and special interests had to be taken on and had to be faced down.  The public had to be educated into the new reality.  This was the consistent line.  It was courageous; it was realistic; it was not very popular and it set out to protect certain priorities, expecially those affecting the most deprived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During all of this time Fianna Fáil knew full well the state of the public finances. Indeed nobody knew better.  Yet not once during all that time was there an offer to understand, to support or to help the Government in what they were trying to do.  On the contrary, every opportunity to disrupt or to frustrate Government intentions was seized upon.  Every disaffected interest group was courted and given, if not always a promise, at least the nod and the wink.  There was no need for cuts, we were told.  It was a question of management, of judgment and of confidence. Fianna Fáil told us to trust them and all would be well, but it was more than that.  It was cynical, destructive Opposition which on every occasion put party interest before educational needs. <Col N="2492" /> There was a refusal even to accept the need for cutbacks.  The people of Ireland were told there would be no cutbacks. All of this was untrue and it is now seen to be untrue and to be cynical.  It undermines the credibility which this Government bring to the task which they are now facing up to for the first time, and much of which task is necessary.  It is now being attacked and undertaken without the credibility from its own supporters who are sick and tired of trying to explain the nature of and reason for the U turns. And what of members of the party opposite in the RTCs and VECs throughout the country whose silence on the cutbacks and on the consequences which they must now face is deafening?</P>
    <P>We could go back to various statements but there is not time.  Various promises were made before the election, promises which the teachers' organisations documented and sent around, promises which every candidate in the last election had to face in one teacher's classroom after another and at one parent's meeting after another.  I will not labour this point but the climate which was created and sustained by Fianna Fáil and on which they won votes was a climate of the easy option, of the painless, invisible cut.  Promises were given and people were fooled.  They must now accept a far harsher reality from those who made these promises.  This is not a good climate in which to seek that partnership and understanding which are so badly needed in the interests of the entire community.  It was the price of power and, for many of those who will now lose their jobs, it is a very high price indeed.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that much of what the Minister has to do is not necessary but I wonder how many of those in the building industry, which is mentioned in this motion, how many of those who pinned such hopes on Fianna Fáil giving them a boost, of Fianna Fáil being the only people capable of giving them a real boost, of Fianna Fáil being the builder's party, are now looking at the growing list of capital projects, of schools and other buildings which have been abandoned, and this is on top of the housing cutbacks. <Col N="2493" /> These people were not told that when they went out in their cars and voted and filled the election coffers of Fianna Fáil before the last election.  They were told it would be very different indeed but now at least another myth has been laid to rest.</P>
    <P>Let me come now to the present cutbacks. I will take the institution I know best, University College Dublin.  Over the years UCD has lived within its budget.  Cutbacks were met in a planned way and it was possible to do so, though with hardship because positions were frozen, and ways of raising new money were explored.  A very tight parsimonious administration ruled with an iron fist.  It was painful but it was possible.  This year UCD was told that its non-payment budget would be reduced by 5 per cent. This was a cutback of £617,000.  The college faced up to this in various ways. It set about raising extra income through increasing student numbers.  It was possible to enrol 500 extra students with no increase in staff; in fact, with the number of staff actually decreasing.  Equipment grants were cut and research funds were depleted but the college set about meeting this cutback of 5 per cent on its non-pay budget.  At least it knew what was in front of it and it could plan ahead for the rest of the year.</P>
    <P>Now, suddenly, it is told there will be a reduction of 1 per cent this year in the pay budget for 1987 and 3 per cent reduction in the pay budget for 1988.  A reduction of 1 per cent for 1987 means a reduction of £250,000 over three months, or £1 million over a full year.  The Minister talks about these cuts not being arbitrary, about there being the possibility of planning for the year ahead.  How can anybody believe that?  UCD is one of the institutions less harshly hit in the realms of higher education &mdash; I suspect because of superior management over the years but that point is debatable.  However, the net effect this year of those cuts is a loss of 80 jobs in UCD and if we take in the veterinary and agriculture disciplines that is another 17 to 20 jobs.  That is 100 jobs in all and we are told this is being done in a planned way.  All that does not take <Col N="2494" /> account of the number of positions which have been frozen, jobs not filled and the other cutbacks which have been faced over the years.</P>
    <P>How can any third level institution plan for the year ahead?  How can the Minister say these cutbacks are not arbitrary? How can she say they are not a blunt crude instrument which will be far more counter-productive than if they had not been introduced?  I know there are other speakers so I will deal with two further points only.</P>
    <P>In third level education there is an awareness that universities have to move away from whatever isolation they were in in the past.  They will have to go out and sell their services to the outside world.  They will have to raise money wherever they can.  They will have to get involved in joint ventures.  If there is a commercial way of building student hostels which is not a charge on the Exchequer, then it will have to be explored.  If there are services in computing and research which can be sold to the outside world thus generating money for the university, then so be it.  There is a realisation that more and more universities must stand on their own feet.</P>
    <P>There is also a realisation that the level of fees has reached ceiling level.  It is like PAYE.  It simply cannot go any higher. Whatever way universities are to raise funds in the future it must not be in the form of higher fees.  These points are accepted.  We have seen in UCD in the last week the publication of a development programme which sets out what the university can do and what is possible, running away from the idea that the State must provide everything.  It sets out very clearly that as far as possible these institutions must stand on their own two feet and seek to generate whatever extra income they can in the interests of the institution and the taxpayers.  The people involved in third level education have accepted reality, that harsh measures must be taken.  They are doing their best to see how the universities can sell themselves better, setting up new courses, more summer schools, links with foreign universities, tie-ups in research and <Col N="2495" /> development, holding courses for those involved in industry, and so on.  The list is legion of things that can be done to generate money for the universities.  How can they expect to go ahead with these plans in good faith when arbitrary cuts are imposed on them, when they do not know what will happen next year, when the only thanks they get for greater productivity is the blunt scalpel and the message that there will be further cuts, but they will not be told where, why or how much.  That is the message which is coming across from the present Administration.</P>
    <P>I feel very negative about the Minister's speech tonight.  I cannot share in her optimistic positive mood.  The facts do not let me.  I only hope she will fight her case in Cabinet to ensure that the damage which has been, and is being done, will as far as possible be undone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">

      <P>I welcome the Minister to our assembly which is temporarily housed in her Chamber.  I wish her well in her present position and now I consider myself dispensed from the civilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I must reassure the Minister that none of us &mdash; even if she had not given us the assurance &mdash; would have thought of her as a shrinking violet. She need not be afraid of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the points in her speech cannot be denied.  The third level institutions are being allowed to administer the medicine to themselves as they see fit and that is a small mercy for which we should be grateful.  As a member of the staff of University College Cork I am very grateful that our new library is in place before the bad days came.  There are things for which we should be thankful.  On the other hand, I consider the amendment fatuous in the extreme and this borne out by the Minister's speech.  It is an Alice In Wonderland situation.  A cutback is not a cutback if the Minister says so.  What then have we being doing over the past <Col N="2496" /> several weeks in UCC attending meetings and seriously considering how best we can deal with the directives from the higher education authorities.  I think that part of her speech is ludicrous in the extreme, as Senator Manning said.</P>
    <P>The statistic of an alleged 5.6 per cent recurrent expenditure greater than 1986 does not gainsay the fact which Senator Manning outlined, that we are compelled to reduce our staff and to cut back on our payroll in what is really to an emergency degree over the next couple of years, even if things do not get worse and I am afraid they will.  It must be remembered that that cutback is done at a very low base.  As the Minister acknowledged, universities have done a good job with their resources.  Student numbers in UCC &mdash; like Senator Manning I refer to the institution I know best &mdash; have gone up by 20 per cent since the late seventies but effectively there has been no corresponding increase in staff.  A good job has been done in that context.  There really is no fat in the system.  When you look at the resources available in the United Kingdom and the resources to Queens University Belfast, you see they have double our resources and we have been doing as good a job.  Therefore, the cutbacks are all the harder to bear given the fact that there is no fat in the system.</P>
    <P>Our motion recognises the need to control public spending.  Irrespective of what Government are in power or what social system one espouses, we are in a horrendous situation and we all accept the responsibilities involved.  It is pointless to indulge in recriminations about who caused the malaise in the first place.  We suggest that the economic and social implications of the cuts are not in the public interest, that they will not achieve the economic recovery, which presumably is the Government's ultimate goal and which the amendment stresses. Therefore, the amendment is also faulty in that regard.  Economic recovery, which is stressed, will not be served by the cuts. On the contrary, the effects of the cuts will be to retard further the prospects of that recovery &mdash; I will develop that argument later.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2497" /> The quality of degrees is bound to suffer, with reduced staffing and services, even still poorer staff-student ratio and cuts in services provided, for example, by libraries and laboratories which seem to be inevitable as well.  Then there are the very serious consequences of the reduction in part time staff.  So far as third level institutions generally are concerned, the existing permanent staff have security of tenure and there is no way in which special provision can be made such as early retirement and so on because we do not have redundancy incentives or anything of that kind.  We have to make substantial cutbacks at the part time level as has been spelled out to us in UCC but this has two serious consequences, one is that the quality of special teaching, which is often conducted by the part time staff &mdash; one might call it tutorial teaching or remedial teaching &mdash; will suffer.  For example, in my own Department I envisage a cutback in my post graduate tutorial staff of 15 per cent.  Very often the students who have to be coached at tutorials are the poorer students in every sense of the word.  They are students from poor background, they are students who have not benefited from a good second level education.  Therefore, they will suffer further.  There is a class dimension in this.</P>
    <P>In my Department of Irish History the only way I have of encouraging research is to provide this minimum patronage to my post graduate students, offering them small amounts of money to help with the tutoring and general departmental work. That will now be cut back.  These post graduate students will be discouraged from research and the quality of their lifestyle will be further impoverished. One of the things one can see happening under one's nose is that under-graduates and post-graduate students are, by the day almost, becoming poorer.  The quality of their life is becoming poorer.  At that level of cutting back part time staff there will be very serious consequences indeed.  The life of the scholar &mdash; beatha an scolaire &mdash; is, at the moment, not very aoibhinn.  It will be even less aoibhinn in the future.</P>
    <P>There is this new phenomenon of <Col N="2498" /> English institutions of higher learning coming over here and recruiting because of the availability of places in their own universities and because of the equality of fees and so on under EC arrangements. This is a new and shameful form of educational emigration.  It is a brain drain and these people will be lost to us.  Doubtless, the Government are relieved to know that that much extra burden is being taken off their hands and &mdash; rather like their attitude to emigration &mdash; they are at once ashamed and grateful.</P>
    <P>The cuts will also aggravate the worsening fees-grants ratio and thus diminish further the equality of opportunity in education.  The fees element in university incomes has increased greatly since the late seventies.</P>
    <P>The proportion of income represented by fees has doubled from about 12 per cent to 25 per cent which means that university education is the rich man's commodity.  We are moving back to the forties and fifties where universities perpetuated the social system.</P>
    <P>Economic recovery, which is the Government's goal, will not be helped by the reduced investment in education, the deteriorating morale, the poorer quality of degrees, the poaching by cross-channel universities and the aggravation of class differences as a result of all these consequences. The amendment flies in the face of commonsense.</P>
    <P>One directive from the Minister which is very hard to justify is the absolute requirement that staff numbers be reduced even if the individual institution, through its own ingenuity, manages to find the financial resources.  This seems to lack any commonsense.  For example, if UCC were to make savings in the non pay area by making economies or by taking in foreign students from the United States and charging them the so called economic fee, the college would not be allowed to use that extra revenue in order to make good the deficiencies in part time staff and so on.  I hope the Minister will look again at this blanket prohibition on the transfer between pay and non pay resources.</P>
    <P>I also want to refer to a special concern <Col N="2499" /> of my own in adult education with which I have been long involved in UCC.  The adult education department in our universities is suffering also from the directive to the VECs that the courses should be self financing.  Therefore, our adult education departments are in danger of losing the VEC financial support.  This cannot but be reactionary in every educational and social sense.</P>
    <P>Finally, retrenchment in the health and educational spheres does not constitute a policy.  It is an austere housekeeping measure which, indeed, at this critical juncture, may be essential for the national wellbeing.  But the bitter pill would be more palatable if it were coated in a radical reappraisal of our whole ramshackle health and educational systems &mdash; if &ldquo;systems&rdquo; is the word to describe them.  Sweet are the uses of adversity, the bard says.  We would all enthusiastically don the hairshirt if it were really a garment of hope, if Fianna Fáil were to reallocate radically our existing resources.  I am not talking about borrowing, I am talking about being radical in the reallocation of our existing resources, both in health and in education, in other words, if Fianna Fáil were to seize this opportunity to regenerate the social crusading zeal which distinguished them as a party at their foundation.</P>
    <P>There are many puzzling things, not all of them unwelcome, about the actions of this Government since their accession to office, but the strangest of all is that they should be effecting cuts so mechanistically. It seems the Minister was right, perhaps the word &ldquo;arbitrary&rdquo; was not properly chosen in our motion.  The cuts are being made in the dark and without any surrounding aura of brightness or hope.  That is the most puzzling thing about this Government, that they are operating these cuts so blindly, so mechanistically and without any concomitant positive social philosophy which used to be an integral part of their programmes in the formative period of their existence, and which only 20 years ago &mdash; God be with Donagh O'Malley &mdash; prompted Fianna Fáil to take giant steps <Col N="2500" /> towards achieving real equality of opportunity in the educational sphere.</P>

      <P>On the <Col N="2501" /> motion for the Adjournment I have notice from Senator Paul Bradford that he proposes to raise the following matter: the need for the Minister for Education to indicate when it is proposed to start a building programme at Rahan national school, Mallow, County Cork.  A serious accommodation problem will arise there in September 1987 as some of the present accommodation is extremely unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to be afforded an opportunity to discuss this matter in the House.  I welcome the Minister of State.  Hopefully he will be able to provide me with some sort of satisfactory response.  Senator J. O'Toole, himself a national school teacher, would also like to comment on the matter.  I have no objection to him doing so although the problems of Rahan national school may not be of major national concern, as well as being a cause of great concern to the parents, pupils and teachers in that area, they are reflected in many other similar rural schools.  Indeed the House will be aware that this type of problem in national schools has existed for decades past.</P>
      <P>As a candidate for election to Seanad Éireann what I learned of most as I travelled around the country was the need to do something about the depopulation of rural areas and the consequential unnecessary build-up of populations in the urban areas.  It is vital to our economic wellbeing and that of the countryside that we do our utmost to ensure a reversal of this trend of movement away from rural life.  All of us should do whatever we can to help stabilise rural populations.  Proper educational facilities constitute a vital part of the solution to this problem.  We must insist that areas, such as Rahan and many others throughout the country have national schools capable of catering for the children in their catchment area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rahan itself is not a parish.  It is a townland within Mallow parish.  It was typical of any small rural community in the past, varying little in population and <Col N="2502" /> comprising mainly of farmers.  However, in recent years there has been a large increase in its population as people have left the town of Mallow and its environs and moved out to places such as Rahan. As a result there has been a corresponding increase in the number of school-going children.  This has caused problems, paramount among which now is that of the accommodation in the national school there.  The present school is typical of national schools built in the thirties and forties.  Like most national schools in similarly populated areas it comprises two rooms, a toilet and very little else.  Continuous efforts were made, particularly during the seventies, to provide a lunchroom or cloakroom but, unfortunately, to no avail.  Some years ago the numbers of children attending the school had increased to the extent that it entitled the school to a third teacher.  When the third teacher was approved for appointment a prefab building was provided and was welcomed.</P>
    <P>In December 1986 a fourth teacher's services become necessary.  In order to allow the appointment of that fourth teacher there was no option open to the board of management of the school but to divide the prefab building in two.  This has meant that both sections of the prefab building are over-crowded leading to a most unsatisfactory position.  At present it appears that when the pupils return to school in September next there will be a net increase of 11 pupils bringing the total to approximately 120.  Room 1 in the old building will house 36 pupils in a room measuring 21 feet by 17 feet.  Room 2, which measures 21 feet by 15 feet will then accommodate 31 pupils.  In the prefab building the first section which will measure approximately 17 feet by 11 feet will house 25 pupils and the second section measuring 22 feet by 11 feet will accommodate approximately 28 pupils. There is no toilet in the prefab building. Perhaps as an indication of its origin the windows in the prefab are wired up and cannot be fully opened.  The House will readily appreciate that that is not very satisfactory or comfortable during whatever fine days we may have.  Therefore, <Col N="2503" /> the position that will arise in September and later in 1987 will be very unsatisfactory indeed for all concerned in the school.</P>
    <P>In January 1986 an application was made to the Department of Education to build two extra classrooms and one general purpose room.  It was felt that such accommodation would allow for the satisfactory accommodation of the numbers of children who would be attending the school in ensuing years.  Little attention has been given to that application. While I understand that the site was examined some weeks ago by an architect there has been no response from the Department to date.  The parents are justifiably concerned about the situation obtaining.  Their main fear is that if sufficient suitable accommodation is not provided pupils will be unable to attend the school, will have to leave that area and attend some other national school or schools located five or six miles away.</P>
    <P>For a small local community that would be demoralising and cause all sorts of other problems.  One problem that immediately springs to mind is the necessity to provide school transport.  As the House will be aware the roads in small local areas are rarely sufficiently wide or in a condition to carry many of the school buses.  Even if they were to travel on them it would be quite dangerous both for the people travelling on the bus and for motorists using those roads.</P>
    <P>Another problem is that the community spirit and pride which always exist in small national schools will disappear as the numbers in the schools diminish. In the long run, as pupils continually leave the catchment area of a small national school you will see a general rundown of that school and unfortunately, as has happened in numerous cases throughout the country, the almost inevitable closure.  It makes no economic sense whatsoever to allow this to happen.</P>
    <P>It is only fitting to ask the Minister of State to do his utmost to provide some sort of suitable accommodation as soon as possible.  The lack of economic sense which any other decision would entail <Col N="2504" /> would, as I say, be seen in the necessity to provide school transport, with the associated costs.  It can be seen in the fact that whatever pupils will be leaving this area over the next few years will almost certainly be going to a national school nearby which, accordingly, will see its numbers increased beyond expectations and will probably need extra accommodation in a few years' time.  The fall-off in numbers in Rahan school will, after one or two years, result in one or maybe even two of the teachers being let go.</P>
    <P>If, however, the Department agree to the demands by the parents for the provision of extra accommodation &mdash; and I stress that what the parents, teachers and everyone within that area are seeking most of all is the provision of two extra rooms to be built on rather than placed on the site and a general purpose room &mdash; that would be the wise, long term solution.  The area is lucky enough to be able to offer the guarantee that the number of pupils will always be quite high because of the population structure that has arisen there in recent times.</P>
    <P>The four teachers at present working in the school, namely, the headmaster, Mr. O'Callaghan, and the other teachers, Ms Flaherty, Ms Connolly and Ms O'Callaghan, are all doing a very good job under difficult circumstances.  I appeal to the Minister to do his utmost to rectify the situation as soon as possible and provide some sort of hope for the parents and teachers in that area and also to provide a long term hope for the future children of that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Senator Bradford for making some time available to me.  I am a teacher and a principal of a rural school.  One thing I found in my election campaign, travelling around the country and meeting teachers, was the true sense of urgency about a real building programme.  In the Mallow area, when I was talking to some branch officers one of the things they stressed to me was that they had a number of schools in that area that needed support.  This was one of the schools they mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2505" /> It seems that in this particular school the Minister of State is actually in breach of his own departmental regulations.  The idea of 31 pupils being in a classroom of 315 square feet actually goes away beyond anything his own rule book and regulations expect school managers to comply with.  Both in that classroom and in the smaller classroom of 17 feet by 11 feet, we are talking about a breach of the departmental regulation as to the required area of square footage per pupil &mdash; and that concerns the prefab, never mind the specre of the prefab divided in two.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if the Minister is aware of the fact that surveys have shown that there is a far higher incidence of absenteeism from prefabricated classrooms than from the permanently structured classrooms in a school.  Surveys have also shown that pupils in these kinds of classroom suffer far more from chest infections and chest ailments than is the norm.  The picture Senator Bradford has made clear to us here is one of pupils, parents and teachers battling against the elements.  That will happen in the winter time in that school if something is not done.</P>
    <P>There is always the question of priorities. I know that this will, no doubt, form part of the Minister's answer.  Really in a small community, the school is of far greater importance.  There has always been a tradition in his Department that in terms of allocating money to school buildings priority was always given to the school where numbers were on the increase, where there was a need to look after an influx into that area.  In an area like Rahan the focal point of the community is the school.  Dave Tussing, in his report on education referred to the national school as the ubiquitous national school which is to be seen in every townland in Ireland, in many cases the focal point of the community, as it certainly is in this case.  When new parents come into an area, they do not get to know each other until their children begin to meet. They meet in the school.  That is the environment.</P>
    <P>It would be a shame, indeed, as the <Col N="2506" /> mover of the motion said, if the parents felt they had to leave on account of the conditions or overcrowding.  I am sure I do not need to remind the Minister of the fact that the Constitution requires us to provide education for all our children.  It does not stress the quality or the conditions in which they might be educated but I am sure he would agree from the description of the school outlined that it is not really the kind of place where learning or teaching can take place.  It is not a proper environment.  It has not a proper ambiance and it really is an area which requires urgent attention.  I would appeal to the Minister to give us good news on this subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to thank Senator Bradford and Senator O'Toole for their contributions on this issue.  Rahan national school has, as both speakers have said, a staff of four teachers with a total complement of 109 pupils who at present are accommodated in two rooms of permanent construction and one prefabricated classroom which, I am aware, has been divided by a partition to form two teaching spaces.  Until comparatively recently this was a two teacher establishment.  Because of the increase in enrolment averages, a third teacher was appointed in March 1983.  My Department agreed to grant-aid the provision of a prefabricated classroom.  The grant was formally sanctioned in April 1984, the erection of the prefab and the necessary ancillary works having been completed by January of that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that, as a result of enrolments continuing to increase, a fourth teacher was appointed and this gave rise to a very difficult accommodation situation. My Department's inspector looked into the short term options in consultation with the school authorities and his recommendation as to the most suitable immediate expedient was the division of the prefabricated classroom with a view to accommodating two teachers in two smaller class groups on a temporary basis.  Earlier, the Department had asked the Office of Public Works, <Col N="2507" /> who were then responsible for the planning and technical aspects of the provision of national schools, to prepare plans for the additional permanent accommodation for Rahan national school.  My Department recently received a further letter from the school authorities renewing their application for permanent accommodation and are now seeking an urgent report from their professional advisers as to the possibility of providing a sketch scheme at an early date for the provision of the permanent accommodation for the school.</P>
    <P>I should explain that, since the original application in this matter was made, my Department have assumed responsibility for the technical aspects of the national school building programme.  Unfortunately, due to current workloads and staffing vacancies it has not been possible to attend as speedily as I would have wished to this project.  In response to what both Senators said, we have a serious difficulty in the Department with regard to the backlog of projects which are now awaiting invitation to tender.</P>
    <P>In fact, when I came into the Department the position was that it would take eight years to clear all the projects which are now in need of being constructed or expanded.  This is not satisfactory.  I am the first to admit that, but it is a real difficulty that we have such a huge backlog of projects.  Because we have a small number of projects going ahead each year, that backlog has grown over the past number of years.  That, basically, is the most difficult problem.</P>
    <P>While I take the point both Senators made, in particular Senator O'Toole's point about the responsibility on the Department to provide adequate accommodation, we have a real problem in that at present we have 60 projects waiting to go to tender.  We cannot allow them to go to tender because the full allocation of money for 1986 was spent last February or March before we took office. That is an indication of the pressures that are on the Department and which, unfortunately, I have been able to do very little about up to now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2508" /> An officer of my Department's primary building branch was recently in touch with the chairman of the school's board of management and indicated to him that to provide for the immediate needs of the school my Department would be prepared to grant aid the cost of another prefabricated classroom or, as an alternative, to give financial assistance towards the cost of renting suitable classroom accommodation if such was available. This offer is being considered by the school authorities and my Department await a response from them.</P>
    <P>Because of the pressure on funds available to my Department for the provision of permanent buildings I am not in a position at this time to say when it may be possible to grant aid the permanent building in Rahan national school.  I share both Senators' concern about the unsuitable conditions under which the school is operating at present and I can give every assurance that if the school authorities can come up with a proposal to solve their immediate needs, every assistance, including financial aid, will be given.  In the long term, I can only promise to do my best to have the planning of the provision of permanent accommodation completed as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I wish to stress that the difficult financial outlook constrains me from saying at this stage when building operations might commence.  While I accept that this matter is vitally urgent, particularly because of the new classes which will be in the school in September, the only hope I can give the Senators at this stage in the short term is that my Department will provide a prefabricated classroom immediately, if that is acceptable to the school management board, or as an alternative, we are prepared to assist the management board in renting accommodation if they wish to do that.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 16 July, 1987.</P>
