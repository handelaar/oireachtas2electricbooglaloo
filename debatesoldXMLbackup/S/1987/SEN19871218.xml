      <P>I have notice from Senator Brian O'Shea and Senator Paul Bradford that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House, they propose to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to rescind his decision to abolish local health advisory committees, to ensure the continuation and development of Mallow General Hospital acute facilities and to insist that the necessary level of funding be provided to it.</P>
      <P>I have also notice from Senator Patrick Kennedy of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The abolition of An Foras Forbartha.</P>
      <P>I have also notice from Senator Maurice Manning of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The urgent crisis facing Irish Lights, including the loss of over 100 jobs and the close-down of lighthouses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senator O'Shea, Senator Bradford, Senator Kennedy and Senator Manning as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment of this House.  I have selected the motion of Senator O'Shea and Senator Bradford and it will be taken at the conclusion of <Col N="340" /> business.  Senator Kennedy and Senator Manning may give notice for another day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended that we take Items Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 today. For the information of the House, we were to take this week the remainder of the Fianna Fáil Motion, Item No. 10, but by agreement with the Whips that motion will be taken on the first sitting day after resumption and we will also take another motion during that week.</P>

      <P>Is the Order of Business agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, there are one or two points I would like to raise.  First of all, can the Leader of the House indicate when in January the House will meet again?  Secondly, I note that Item No. 10 on today's Order Paper has been deferred.  If on the first week back we meet only for one day, we will have to insist that two Private Members' Motions be taken on that day. Thirdly, this session began with a very long and detailed discussion involving all Members of the House on questions of updating the procedures of the Seanad and making the House more efficient and more attractive, although I think we have had a very efficient session.  Could the Leader of the House, at the earliest possible date in the new session, give us an account of progress to date and of any specific proposals which may be ready for discussion in the next session on this general topic.  We on this side of the House feel that, unless pressure is kept up on the Government Party on this issue, real progress will not be made.  We want to put on record that what we said earlier in the session was meant and we will be pressing this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, on the Order of Business, A Chathaoirligh, may I wish you a very happy Christmas and also the staff and thank all of those who made the House <Col N="341" /> work so effectively during the past session.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to reiterate some of the points made by Senator Manning but, in particular, the issue of Private Members' time.  The Leader of the House does not have any difficulty in giving commitments here day after day about what might and might not happen. The list of commitments which have not been met and which have been given to me during this term now exceeds a page in length.  I would like to stitch into the record that we have an agreement, this time from the Government Whip, that in Private Members' time on our first resuming week two motions will be discussed, one to complete the business that is there at the moment and another new one.  That is a commitment that must be accepted and undertaken.</P>
      <P>Similarly, I would welcome a discussion on the procedures of the House in the next term.  Finally, in adding the voice of the Independent group to the good wishes that have been extended to the Cathaoirleach, to the staff of the House and to our colleagues on both sides of the House, might we also remember at this season that it is a time of great difficulty for a quarter of a million unemployed people, for people who are suffering from poverty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the atmosphere of goodwill that obviously prevails this morning, I want to propose an amendment to the Order of Business to the effect that Item No. 16, the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill, be taken after Item No. 2.  In other words, I accept that there are constitutional and other reasons why the Appropriation Bill must be passed but I can see no urgency with regard to any of the remaining business. I know the urgency of Item No. 16.  Any of the Members of this House who choose to look out of the Kildare Street gates of this building will see a cardboard box in a doorway which is the home of a human being.  A woman sleeps there every night of the week.  That is the urgency of that issue and none of the other items is nearly as urgent.  Since the Government have broken their promise to the homeless to produce their own legislation, I propose that this House takes up the issue and that Item No. 16 be taken third on the Order of Business.  I move: &ldquo;That Item No. 16 be taken after item No. 2&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Brendan Ryan's request to include No. 16 on the Order of Business.  I understand that today was the agreed day for it to be taken; at least, this was the day that was set.  I know that it is a matter for each day's sitting to decide if it is to be included, but the Leader of the House did not even mention it.  I agree with Senator Ryan that we were all expecting that this would be listed for today and in view of the small amount of progress that <Col N="343" /> has been made by Governments in this area, the only way we can address it is to try to move a Private Members' Bill in this very important area which touches the point made by Senator O'Toole about the disadvantaged at Christmas.  It is appropriate that the homeless should know that this House is concerned.  We can show our concern for the homeless by doing something about the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill.  I am serving on a committee which at present are updating the Standing Orders and, as the House is aware, the Commmittee on Procedure and Privileges have reported progress. It is now up to the different groupings to agree to adopt the changes we have suggested to date.  This committee is being chaired by the Cathaoirleach and I hope that we can attain agreement on what we have proposed.  I suggest to those representing the different groups to look quickly at what we have suggested as it will help to make the business of this House more relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take exception to the remarks made by Senator Joe O'Toole in regard to commitments.  He implied that this side of the House does not keep its commitments.  If the Leader of the House or I have to change a commitment which we have given we endeavour to find the Whips.  Senator Daly is always around but yesterday I could not find the Whip for the Indpendent group to inform him of the position.  Therefore, it is most unfair of Senator O'Toole to say that we are breaking our commitments.  We are not.  It has always been my policy to contact the Whips on the other side of the House if there is to be any change of business, that is, if I can find the Whips of the other side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is for the Leader of the House to reply to Senator Manning in regard to the question of progress.  Some people may think that we have fallen down in regard to the progress we have made in this House but I am happy at the progress we have made since we returned in September. It is the same rate of progress as was achieved in previous years under <Col N="344" /> other Governments.  We have been very busy.  Since we returned there have been two weeks in which we have had only one day sittings and I do not think that that is anything to complain about.  We have been exceptionally good this term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, lest there be any misunderstanding I did say that this has been a very effective and efficient session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Without entering into any degree of argument, whatever the commitments given by the Government side there certainly has been a problem about timescale with regard to the programme. We on this side of the House will be watching very carefully in the coming session to ensure that commitments and timescales are honoured.  I do not believe there is any necessary chicanery involved but it is very important for our side that we fulfil this role.  My real purpose in standing this morning is to support very strongly what Senator Brendan Ryan has said with regard to taking the homeless persons Bill.  There is almost a moral obligation upon us under the Constitution, in the light of the fact that in the Constitution and in public life, Christianity is so frequently referred to and because, a Chathaoirligh, as you have mentioned this is the season of Christmas, to take the homeless persons Bill.  It would be a great shame if we remained unaware of the fact that there is a large section of the population for whom there is no room at the inn.</P>

      <P>This is also a point of order.  There seems to be a misunderstanding about what I said.  I got a solemn commitment from the Leader of the House that the Extradition Bill would be taken in this session but it has not. What I said when I first rose to speak was that I was glad that this time a commitment had come from the Government Whip, whose commitments have always been honoured.  Up until yesterday afternoon the agreement as I understand it was discharged in terms of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>When we resumed after the summer recess we paid great compliments to you, a Chathaoirleach, for the work you had done during the break in regard to the added comforts that we enjoy.  However, what I have found during this session is that the Chamber lacks adequate ventilation. Perhaps, during the coming break you may be able to do something about that. Those of us who find that that is a problem may leave the Chamber but there are those, including your good self and the staff, who cannot.  It will be very unfair to ask the staff to put up with the same problem through a further session.  I have found that there tends to be a build up of stale air and I noticed it again when I walked into the Chamber this morning. There is inadequate ventilation in the Chamber and perhaps something can be done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a lot of trouble with the ventilation and they are still trying to deal with this problem. We are all well aware of the problem, particularly those of us who have to put in long stints in the House.  I call on the Leader of the House to conclude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Senator McMahon as regards the deplorable conditions we have to work under in this <Col N="346" /> House and I do not mean physical comforts such as seating.  There is a problem as regards the air conditioning in this Chamber.  This must make conditions difficult for the staff particularly who have to be present at all times.  We will have to take up this problem with the powers that be.  In answer to Senator Manning, in the new session we will be sitting two days a week.  We will take whichever private motion comes up plus the Fianna Fáil motion in the first week of the new session.</P>
      <P>The updating of the procedures of the Seanad is proceeding satisfactorily.  The sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges have been meeting on a regular basis and readjusted draft Standing Orders have been prepared. These will be discussed within the groups as soon as the groups can get together. When agreement has been reached within the groups the readjusted Standing Orders will lead to a more efficient Seanad, I will not say a more relevant Seanad but there will be opportunities to debate matters of urgent public interest and they may be taken under section 29.4 of the present Standing Orders.  It will be up to the groups to meet as soon as possible between now and the time we reassemble.  If agreement can be reached an early meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges can be arranged and the new Standing Orders can then be implemented.  As regards the commitments given to Senator Joe O'Toole, he did make the remark to me that &ldquo;Verbal commitments given to me are not worth the paper they are written on&rdquo;. All that I would say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take exception to the remarks made by both Senator Norris and Senator Brendan Ryan about the concern which this side of the House and other Members of the House have for <Col N="347" /> the plight of the homeless.  We are concerned about the homeless and about all the under-privileged in our society.  We have tried to express that concern at all times in as strong a manner as possible.  Senator Ferris said he expected the Bill to be taken today but as a Member of the House for a time, he knows that the date given for the Bill was the earliest date it could be taken.  That was explained to the House when I agreed to have that Bill ordered for a certain date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government will always have concern for the homeless and have had concern for them.  The Government will produce a Bill which will give due cognisance to the plight of the homeless and be capable of being implemented.  It is my proposal that the Order of Business should be Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.</P>

I would refer the Cathaoirleach to Standing Order 40 which states clearly and distinctly that after a motion or an amendment has been put to the House, there should be no further debate thereon.  You, a Chathaoirligh, initiated a debate with three other speakers when the division bells were ringing. It was an incorrect procedure.  It is unacceptable that when the House was off the record the time was used by some Members unscrupulously to make comments about a Member of the Independent group.  I would like to see two things on the record of the House; an indication that what happened should not have happened, and I would ask that the use of particular words by the Leader of the House about Senator Ryan be seen as unacceptable and should be written in as such.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The annual Appropriation Bill gives statutory effect to the Departmental Estimates for the supply services, both noncapital and capital, including all supplementary and additional Estimates that were voted and approved by the Dáil since the enactment of the previous Appropriation Act.  In line with custom, this year's Bill appropriates to the various services set out in the Schedule, the sum of £6,716 million comprising the Estimates totalling just over £6,691 million as set out in the revised post-Budget Book of Estimates, Supplementary and Additional Estimates of almost £25 million <Col N="354" /> and £200,000 in respect of a Supplementary Estimate for the Office of the Minister for Finance for 1986, which was approved by the Dáil after the enactment of the 1986 Appropriation Act.  As usual the Bill also authorises the use of certain Departmental receipts amounting to £661 million as appropriations-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The Appropriation Bill also provides the statutory basis for calculation of the &ldquo;four-fifths&rdquo; issues which the Minister for Finance is authorised, under the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act, 1965, to make from the Exchequer towards meeting the cost of next year's services during the period before the Dáil has an opportunity to consider and pass the various individual Estimates.</P>
      <P>This year the Appropriation Bill is also being used to make a number of technical amendments to existing legislation.  The Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill fully explains the basis for these changes. Section 2 of the Bill provides for the amendment of section 14 (3) of the Finance Act, 1948, to allow for the daily calculation of the annual interest rate on Post Office Savings Bank deposits.  This is a welcome change which will bring the Post Office Savings Bank into line with financial institutions generally.  Given that the Post Office Savings Bank's interest year begins on 1 January, it makes sense to provide for the change at this time.</P>
      <P>The second technical provision provided for in section 3 of the Bill, amends sections 2 and 4 of the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act, 1965, and ensures that there will be proper statutory authority for certain accounting procedures in relation to the issue of moneys from the Central Fund for supply services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1965 Act empowers the Minister for Finance to issue moneys out of the Central Fund to meet payments by Departments from their Votes.  The amount of these issues are necessarily based on estimates of the outturns for individual Votes.  Inevitably, in some cases, issues from the Exchequer in respect of an individual Vote will be less than the actual payments made from that <Col N="355" /> Vote, even though the total payments are less than the amount granted by the Dáil. This situation is usually referred to as an &ldquo;underissue&rdquo;.  Since total expenditure on every Vote must be matched in full by an issue from the Central Fund, the requisite balance is issued in the following year. This has been the practice followed since the foundation of the State and is clearly recorded in the annual Finance accounts. The wording of the 1965 Act, however, authorises the Minister for Finance to issue moneys &ldquo;in the year&rdquo; and the Comptroller and Auditor General has brought this particular anomaly to the attention of my Department. In order, therefore, to remove any questions as to the legality of the traditional accounting procedure the references to &ldquo;in the year&rdquo; in sections 2 and 4 of the 1965 Act are being deleted.  The changes have been backdated to December 1965 when the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act was enacted. This ensures that there is proper statutory authority for the procedures used over the years.  These amendments are purely technical in nature and will in no way change the way in which the Supply Services are controlled and accounted for.</P>
    <P>Let me turn now to domestic economic developments in 1987.  It has clearly been a good year for the economy in many respects.  Growth has been much higher than in recent years, and has been led by a very strong recovery in exports, especially exports of high technology goods.  The strength of output and exports this year has been widespread. While the high technology sector has again led the way, other areas have also been doing very well.  Take the food sector, for example.  Output was 10 per cent higher in the first eight months of this year than in the same period of 1986; or the so-called &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; manufacturing sector &mdash; here there has been steady growth in output for the second successive year.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is also likely to show a real improvement in 1987.  After two difficult years, we expect to see a strong recovery in farm incomes due to a number of <Col N="356" /> factors.  Output prices are likely to be much better than in 1986.  The volume of farm inputs has fallen because of better weather.  Input prices have also fallen. The recovery in farm incomes this year should be substantial.</P>
    <P>Solid progress has been made in other areas too.  Inflation is at its lowest level for nearly two decades.  With world inflation and commodity prices staying low and the effective exchange rate of the Irish pound stable, inflationary pressures are being held at bay.</P>
    <P>There has been further solid progress in the balance of payments this year.  Last year the balance of payments deficit was down below 2 per cent of GNP and I expect further significant progress this year.  There is a big improvement in the trade surplus over the first 11 months of the year.  It has virtually doubled compared with last year to £1.4 billion, at an all-time record.  There are also signs that investment in plant and machinery has been strong, which augurs well for the future.</P>
    <P>While average registered unemployment in 1987 will be close to 11,000 higher than in 1986, this figure masks the considerable improvement that has been taking place in the trend in unemployment for most of the year.  In the 12 months to end-April last the live register rose by 18,400 but in the 12 months to end-November the increase was only 3,800.  A further improvement in this trend is expected for the end of the year. There can be no doubt that much of the improvement shown in the live register trend in recent months has been due to the success of the Jobsearch programme which has been of particular benefit to the long term unemployed in their search for work and training.</P>
    <P>The action the Government have taken on the public finances this year has had a beneficial impact especially on interest rates, which have already fallen very substantially. Indeed, we are now seeing a further downward movement.  Lower interest rates encourage investment, the basis for growth in employment.  The drop in interest rates is an important consequence of the action being taken by <Col N="357" /> the Government to correct imbalances in the economy.  It is part and parcel of the process of putting the economy right and will help to achieve faster growth over the coming years.</P>
    <P>Economic performance has been disappointing under some headings.  Personal consumption has been rather weak and now looks unlikely to show growth this year.  Building investment has also been poor.  Notwithstanding the improving trend to which I have already referred, unemployment is far too high. Despite the progress of 1987, we cannot afford to be complacent.</P>
    <P>The world economy is still in an unsettled state.  Events like the worldwide stock market crash in October illustrates the growing interdependence of the major economies.  I might add that, whenever possible at international meetings, Ireland has always urged that the major world economies should take the necessary action to reduce the trading and other imbalances which are at the heart of the present instability in the global economy.  The response of Governments to the stock market crash has been sensible and has averted some of its potential adverse after-effects.  This points to the need for us to get our own house in order; we cannot rely on international economic developments to resolve our problems.</P>
    <P>One of the most significant developments in 1987 has been the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and its associated pay agreement.  The programme represents the culmination of the Government's effort to secure a consensus-based approach to the resolution of the formidable difficulties facing this country. Having received the endorsement of the principal economic and social interests, and, if opinion polls can be believed, of the public generally, the programme can be said to enjoy the broad support of the Irish people.  This augurs well for our capacity to successfully overcome the obstacles to sustained economic and social progress, because the programme clearly indicates the Government's intention <Col N="358" /> to face up squarely to the financial realities of our situation.</P>
    <P>The programme has its roots in the common analysis of the most influential groups in Irish society expressed in the NESC report <i>A Strategy for Development, 1986-90</i>, published just over a year ago.  This report set down the requirements to be met to avert an economic crisis, and to establish solid foundations for increasing output and employment over the longer term.  One of the conditions defined was the adoption of a consistent and coherent macroeconomic strategy, embodying in particular fiscal policies which would stabilise the national debt in relation to GNP. Another was the pursuit of an effective development strategy, focused on the internationally trading sectors of the economy.  Both of these elements are in the programme.</P>
    <P>The aims of the programme are, however, broader than this.  In it the Government, in co-operation with the social partners, have also set themselves the task of addressing other issues of major concern to Irish people over the past decade or so.  For example, the Government are committed to reform of the taxation system so that each group within Irish society pays, and is seen to pay, its fair share of the burden.  Similarly, we are committed to securing greater social equity in terms of social benefits and of access to health care and education.  As foreshadowed in the programme, the Minister for Labour has already published a discussion document on possible measures in the areas of employment equality, payment of wages and unfair dismissals.</P>
    <P>The public service pay agreement, which was negotiated in the context of the programme provides for yearly increases in pay averaging approximately 2.5 per cent over the three year period to 1990.  The terms of the agreement represent a satisfactory compromise between what the Government can afford to pay and the expectations of the trade unions and their members.  An important feature of the agreement is that the basic pay increases are weighted <Col N="359" /> in favour of the lower paid which should enable them to secure a genuine improvement in their relative wage income over the period of the programme.</P>
    <P>A major achievement of the pay agreement is the undertaking by the trade unions not to engage in industrial action in pursuit of claims in excess of the pay terms.  This will contribute greatly to industrial peace in the public sector and so enable the Government to concentrate on the difficulties they are facing in relation to the public finances and the economy.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that the <i>Programme of National Recovery</i> is an integrated strategy and the attainment of its ultimate goals depends crucially on the coherent application of the policies which it contains. As an illustration, the beneficial downstream effects on the climate for investment stemming from the resolution of our public finance difficulties will be reinforced by the boost to competitiveness implicit in the pay provisions of the programme and the active sectoral development approach envisaged.  This strategic combination of measures is designed to maximise the employment opportunities which are so badly needed. The mutual consistency of the planned policy initiatives and the support of the social partners in their implementation greatly enhances the chances of the programme's ultimate success.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the 1987 budget, I am pleased to say that the budget for this year is still on course and there is now a good prospect that the overall Exchequer borrowing target will be achieved.  The latest expenditure data suggest that there will be savings on non-capital supply services and Central Fund services.  These, however, are likely to be offset by a shortfall on tax revenue, particularly in the area of indirect taxes.  These taxes, in particular, are showing signs of weakness reflecting, among other things, the sluggishness in consumer spending to which I have already referred.  The overall effect is that the gap between spending and revenue is likely to be very close to that predicted in my March budget.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="360" /> Savings are also likely on the capital side of the budget.  Exchequer-financed expenditure on non-programme outlays, which mainly relate to capital restructuring of semi-State bodies, and on the public capital programme are likely to be below budget.  Even allowing for a small shortfall in Exchequer capital resources the Exchequer borrowing requirement for capital purposes is likely to outturn somewhat below its planned level.</P>
    <P>The Government, then, have reason to be pleased with the prospective 1987 budgetary outturn, Not only did we introduce a budget designed to secure a significant reduction in Exchequer borrowing but, more important, we are about to deliver on this undertaking.  This augurs well for the future control and management of the public finances and also provides a sound financial basis for the preparation of the 1988 budget.</P>
    <P>In the future, when we look back at the economic history of this period, 1987 may well be seen as a key year &mdash; a watershed when we began to break away from the sluggish growth and sluggish policies which have plagued us for most of this decade.  This year the Government took strong and decisive action to put the economy back on the road to recovery.</P>
    <P>Sensible policies which squarely face the real issues and which do not shy away from the difficult choices which have to be made, have been, and will remain, the hallmark of this Government.  We have taken the lead in putting in place an economic strategy which gets to the root of our problems.  We have already seen some beneficial effects of these policies this year and I am convinced that, by continuing along this path, we will see considerably greater benefits in the years ahead.  I commend the Appropriation Bill to the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome also the optimistic approach contained in his speech.  It is like a breath of fresh air at a time when other people are predicting doom and gloom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to do something for the motor trade which has <Col N="361" /> been downtrodden throughout the years. With the expected growth in the economy during 1988, 1989 and 1990 &mdash; and please God we will be here for that period, and I think we will be &mdash; I hope the Minister can see his way to doing something for the motor trade.  In common with all Ministers for Finance, when the Minister is asked to give relief in a certain area he says: &ldquo;Of course I will if you can tell me where I can get the money.&rdquo;  One area in which he could give relief, without any cost to the Exchequer, is in the car hire section of the motor trade.  The car hire service is the cornerstone of the tourist industry and nobody knows the value of tourism better than the Minister because he comes from a tourist area.  If the excise on cars which are purchased in January and February by the self-drive business was deferred until those cars are sold there would not be any loss to the Exchequer and it would also cut the very high cost of the purchase of cars.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware there are very high insurance premiums in this country and we are competing with companies in Northern Ireland and the UK who operate a policy which is known as back tracking where people hire cars through American tourist agencies and collect the cars in either the UK or Northern Ireland.  This is very damaging to the self-drive industry because the price of cars in the UK and Northern Ireland is lower than it is here and insurance costs are also lower.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta are an offspring of Aer Lingus and I have no respect for either of them.  They are the greatest scourge this country has seen since Oliver Cromwell.  Bord Fáilte have done a very good job in the tourist industry but they have been handicapped by Aer Lingus because they have not helped to bring people into this country at economic rates.  Aer Lingus have carried thousands more passengers out of this country than into it.  When the previous Minister gave a licence to Ryanair to operate a service, Aer Lingus started playing tricks.  They offered flights to the UK for £66 but there was a restriction on the return trip.  I know a man who had six tickets for six <Col N="362" /> different periods.  He could not get back to Ireland because he was given a day's notice in each case and that continued for a fortnight until the tickets expired.</P>
    <P>On hearing that I went to London at my own expense to investigate the matter.  One morning when I was there, there were 35 people outside the Aer Lingus office.  I was in that queue from 6.30 a.m. and they did not open until 9 a.m.  They did not want to let us into the office.  I was at the head of the queue and I told them that we were not prepared to discuss our business on the street.  When I eventually got in to the office I told them who I was and what I was doing.  I told them I was going to pay the full fare to get back to Ireland and that I was going to hold a press conference when I got back.  However, somebody waved a magic wand and 15 people were given seats on flights back the same day.  Aer Lingus also brought in different packages.</P>

I do not want to spend too much time on this because there is a time constraint on the debate and I am the only speaker from my party.  The usual procedure when we discuss appropriation Bills is that we nod them through and discuss them afterwards.  I do not want to make a lengthy speech but I want to cover a few points.  It is relevant that Aer Lingus who are a semi-State body and who are getting taxpayers' money are now demanding a very heavy sum from the taxpayers to replace their fleet.  I would like Aer Lingus to be privatised because I think that is the only hope for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Acting Chairman comes from <Col N="363" /> County Mayo and I have something to say about Knock Airport.  The Minister for Tourism and Transport, Deputy Wilson, gave permission to Ryanair to operate a service to Knock Airport and they carried 55,000 passengers on that route.  When Aer Lingus realised their success they then applied for a licence and I am glad the Minister refused it to them.</P>
    <P>In regard to duty free shopping Aer Lingus are not charging VAT but they are charging the full price for every article. The Minister said in the other House recently that they are making profits of 50 per cent.  Their argument is that they are using those profits to subsidise other parts of the airport but what they do not say &mdash; and this is what concerns me &mdash; is that they are ripping off the care hire people with the high prices they are charging.  A small car hire firm at Shannon Airport is being charged £100,000 for a five foot space in the airport and that firm have to have two caravans in the forecourt in order to deal with the people when they come to sign their agreements.  The sooner Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus are privatised the better.</P>
    <P>What surprises me is that we were told by the previous Government as well as by the present Government that the biggest problem in this economy is created by the price of oil.  A couple of years ago the price of oil fell but it was not reflected in the economy.  I will reserve the rest of my comments for a future discussion on this matter and I will conclude in order to facilitate the Minister in getting this Bill through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion on the Appropriation Bill gives us an opportunity to review events of the past 12 months as well as giving the Minister the appropriations necessary to deal with matters in the coming year.  The past 12 months has been a very difficult time for everybody who has had anything to do with the day to day running of the country and with planning for the future of the Irish economy.  Within that period, for <Col N="364" /> the first time in many years the real problems of overspending without earning and of borrowing without thinking about the future have been confronted.  Irrespective of the fact that many people are suffering in the short term as a result of measures taken to tackle the problems, most people believe that the Government are at last on the right track.  This Government are governing and are making decisions which will help to ensure that not alone the people of today but also future generations will have a reasonable standard of living.</P>
      <P>A number of problems confront the people at present.  Taxation is one that is paramount in everybody's mind.  There is no doubt but that all levels of taxation are extremely high.  The reason is that we have borrowed too much in the past and it is costing a lot not alone to repay the capital but also the interest on those borrowings.</P>
      <P>Mention has been made here by various speakers throughout the year about the plight of PAYE workers.  This morning we should address ourselves to the plight of the employers.  A large number of small employers confront problems on a day to day basis that never had to be confronted by business people in the past. The Revenue Commissioners have too much power in the sense that the rate of interest they charge on overdue accounts is much too high.  It has not been adjusted in line with interest rates.  Because the Revenue Commissioners insist at all times that the interest as well as the taxes must be paid many firms are going out of business.  They are not able to pay interest of 1.25 per cent per month to the Revenue Commissioners on overdue accounts.  I appeal to the Minister to bring a sense of reality to the interest rates which are charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suggestions have been made in the past that an amnesty should be given on overdue taxes but I do not agree with that.  If taxes are due they should be paid but I do not think it would be impossible for the Revenue Commisioners to eliminate the interest on tax if the tax itself is paid. If that was done for a short period much of the taxes which are now overdue would <Col N="365" /> be paid immediately and many of the problems confronting the Revenue Commisioners could be overcome.  This would also help the Government in the enforcement of tax legislation.  Many small businesses are in a critical position because of taxes due and I appeal to the Minister, on behalf of them, to see if something can be done in relation to the penal interest rates charged by the Revenue Commissioners at present.</P>
    <P>There has been major rethinking in many areas and it is good that we can hold our heads high regarding our industrial output, our inflation rate, and the fact that in Europe we are among the prime exporters.  Our workforce has proven that, given the right circumstances, it can equal any in the world.  The success of our industry in export and in profit making is helped by the fact that there is a measure in the tax regime whereby manufacturing and exporting companies get a tax concession on their earnings.  It has been proven that if you allow people to earn money they will earn even more and will reinvest and this is what is happening.</P>
    <P>This has been a good year for agriculture. It is atrocious that in a country which has the best food in the world we should have to appeal to Irish people to buy Irish food.  I am glad the Government have taken initiatives to create jobs within the agricultural industry generally. At last with proper planning in agriculture we will see a resurgence of interest and investment in the agri-business sector.  This is good for the economy.</P>
    <P>A lot of people knock the incentives being given to business people to come in here.  The SEATO group of countries had the greatest growth rate in the world for the past number of years and because of incentives, investment is coming in from places like Taiwan, South Korea and so on.  This proves that Ireland gives a return on investment.  It is also an expression of confidence in the Irish worker.  In addition, it creates employment which helps our economy.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly mentioned tourism but I am not going to get into an argument with him as to whether Aer Lingus or <Col N="366" /> Ryanair should operate in a more commercial way.  The lowering of air fares has helped the tourist industry and has brought back many Irish people who had stopped coming home at holiday time. Because fares were too high, a lot of Irish people living abroad, either stayed where they were or went to places like Spain and Portugal because it was much cheaper to holiday there than to come home. Because air fares have come down there has been a huge growth in traffic into the country.  This is good not alone for the tourist industry but also from a family point of view as it keeps the Irish from becoming separated for too long from their home base.</P>
    <P>On the question of Aer Lingus, it is about time they got their act together and provided single fare structures such as have been introduced by Ryanair.  If somebody wants to go to Brussels they have to pay a fare of from between £336 to £400.  To come to Ireland from Brussels there is a fare of £189 and a £139 APEX fare with a Saturday thrown in. People are sitting on the same plane, having paid different fares because of four or five different fare structures.  Fare structures are important if we want to get people to travel in or out of the country.</P>
    <P>I agree, to a certain extent, that duty free does not mean cheaper shopping. The chairman of Aer Rianta makes no apologies for making large profits in the duty free shops, and he uses this large profit for purposes other than giving good value to the customers.  The prices in duty free shops here are, in a lot of cases, higher than on the main street.  Visitors to Ireland would be much better off to shop in the main street shops and claim their VAT back when they go out of the country because it is of no benefit to them to shop in the duty free shops.</P>
    <P>Over the past 12 months there has been a gratifying drop in interest rates.  Small percentage reductions in interest rates might not seem very significant, but to those who have borrowed, who are trying to keep their heads above water, every little drop is of enormous importance. When the banks lower their interest rates, there is a consequent drop in mortgage <Col N="367" /> rates which helps a very large sector of our population who have invested in their own homes.  We should be proud that we have the second highest home ownership rate in the western world. Governments have put a lot of money into providing houses through the local authorities and through the various Government schemes.  This means that the quality of life is good for those who have been able to take up these loans. Where people buy local authority houses, the subsidies they are given by the Government to occupy exceptionally good houses, is a very high one.</P>
    <P>In Kilkenny, the average subsidy for a local authority house is about £75 a week which is a heavy burden on the Exchequer but a burden which the Government have been willing to take on.  In that area, the Government have been able to get the commercial banks to row in to help the people who are on lower incomes.  They have agreed to put about £70 million into providing loans for those at the lower levels of income.  These loans will be provided without the borrower having to have money on deposit with the lending institution for long periods prior to making the loan application. It is good to see that the Government have been able to persuade the banks and the other lending institutions to get involved in this necessary provision of funds for the lower paid people in our society.  The Exchequer can use the money saved, in other ways.</P>
    <P>Even though there are hiccups in certain areas the indications for the economy are good.  It does not mean that we can get back into the helter skelter spending that was going on in the seventies without any regard for the future.  It is regrettable but necessary that people will suffer in the short term because of financial stringencies. The Government have to be complimented for standing up to the many pressure groups in our society who are looking for more and more in their own interests.  The public in general want the Minister and the rest of the Government to stick by the financial constraints <Col N="368" /> that have been placed on them by historical facts and thereby ensure that there will be a better future for all the people in our society.</P>
    <P>On a personal basis I would like to join in the appeal to the Minister to give some help to the Irish motor industry.  In doing so he would not just help the motor industry but the economy in general. The motor industry was one of the biggest employers here for many years. There was a huge growth in employment and in reinvestment in the industry.  Not alone that but the Irish motor industry was in the forefront in the training of young people.  They passed on skills and made certain that their apprentices were trained to the highest possible standard. In Kilkenny city at present there is no apprentice mechanic.  That is an indication as to where the industry is going.</P>
    <P>I did an exercise in my own small business recently.  I am a small wholesaler and I have lost 70 customers due to closures in the past four years.  There is no sign of that changing.  Unless something is done for that industry, not alone will it suffer but the country will suffer.  I guarantee that anybody driving out from Dublin or around the city will meet cars with only one headlight working.  People are not replacing their headlight bulbs or their taillight bulbs.  If they are not replacing bulbs, can you imagine what the condition of the rest of the car is like?  People say that the motor industry should be doing better in the service area because of the fact that people are not purchasing new cars.  This is not true.  People are not servicing their cars.  There is a major case to be made for bringing in a Department of the Environment test for motor care in the same way as there is a test on commercial vehicles.</P>
    <P>Another serious situation is developing in that a huge number of cars are being brought if from Northern Ireland and from Great Britain which are being reregistered here.  I would suggest that 90 per cent of these cars have failed the MOT test in Great Britain and that one of the main reasons they are coming in here is that it would cost too much to get <Col N="369" /> these cars through the MOT and it is cheaper to bring here.  They look cheap and many of them were first registered in 1979, 1980, 1981 and 1982.  This is not good for the Irish economy.  It is placing the people who use the roads in a very hazardous position because I have no doubt that these cars are not up to the standard required in Great Britain.  There is a major case for realistic levels of benefit in kind.</P>
    <P>There is some little help for the motorist in that the drop in the value of the dollar means that oil prices should come down drastically within the next few months.  There is no situation where oil prices will again be as low as $16.50 a barrel, which two or three years ago would have been the equivalent of about £20.  At present $16.50 is the equivalent of about £9 or £9.50.  There has to be some help for the motorist in that there should be a drop in the cost of petrol. However, the motorist here is faced with the highest insurance costs in Europe and the cost added to cars because of duties or levies of one kind or another is enormous.</P>
    <P>It is a year in which there has been a resurgence of confidence that the Government are doing their job, irrespective of the fact that harsh measures have had to be taken.  It is only in the imposition of harsh measures that we can see a future for ourselves and our children. The sectional lobbyists are growing in numbers.  Some people are critical in their attitude towards politicians and politics.  They keep saying on the one hand that politicians in Leinster House should be legislating and not acting as messenger boys for various groups.  The very people who are strongest in the expression of that point of view are those who in their own organisations are trying to get the lobby system built up so that they can put pressure on the politicians, not in the national interest but for their own sectional interests.</P>
    <P>The Government have for the first time laid down categorically, well in advance, the amount of money to be spent in 1988. Everybody knows where they stand. There can be a re-juggling within the amount of money that is available, but <Col N="370" /> everybody should be told again that the amount provided is the amount that will be spent.  If that is adhered to the Government will be doing an excellent job for the Irish people, even though it might be unpalatable in certain areas.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which was signed by the Government and the social partners is an indication of this policy.  It should be acknowledged that the social partners have also looked at the problems confronting us and have rowed in with the Government to a large degree by accepting the message of the Government.  Although they might not agree with everything that is done in every area, they do agree that the Government are going in the right direction and that unless the Government keep to that direction there will not be a place for anybody, whether they be trade unionists, farming interests, industrial interests or the unemployed, homeless or deprived in our society.</P>
    <P>It has to be said that even though we are living in times of stringent control of finance where there have been major cutbacks in quite a number of areas the Government have not forgotten the plight of the unemployed, the plight of the homeless or the plight of the deprived.  The Government have indicated that the underprivileged will not suffer to the same degree as those who are privileged.  I am glad that the amount of money being given to the underprivileged is staying extremely high and has not been cut back in any way. Although not quite the double week of benefit was given for Christmas, nevertheless a week's benefit plus 65 per cent was allocated.  Not alone that but it has been extended for the first time to the long term unemployed.  This means that many thousands more can benefit under that scheme.  This demonstrates that the Government give priority to the underprivileged in our society, that they have their priorities properly in place in that respect.  The ensuring year will be another in which there will be a degree of cutback with stringent control being maintained over the nation's finances.  Though it might not suit the tourism industry, hopefully <Col N="371" /> the dollar might drop another few points which would be a tremendous help to the economy on many fronts.  Hopefully, the tourism industry will benefit from the fact that ingress fares are coming down.</P>
    <P>Agricultural and agri-business are being managed on a planned basis for the first time, an area that was making its fair contribution to the economy.  Now that it is being planned and managed in a proper structural manner hopefully that too will reap enormous benefits for our economy.</P>
    <P>We must pay tribute to employees and employers in Irish industry for the major efforts they have made to bring their productivity levels up to the highest international standard.  Too often we hear people run down the Irish worker.  I contend that if he has the proper tools he is the best in the world.  Although there is at present a drain of enormous magnitude of young people leaving the country what the Government are doing will ensure that our economy will expand in the next few years thereby allowing those young people to return and, if they wish, find employment at home at reasonable rates of pay and under reasonable conditions.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Finance on what he has done over the past 12 months even though there have been times I too have suffered on that account. The trend is in the right direction.  Hopefully, the headline that appeared in one of yesterday morning's papers to the effect that the ESRI have predicted that 1992 will be the year of full recovery will be proved to be incorrect.  Given Government decisions taken in the right areas, given a reasonable international scenario within which to work perhaps that forecast might be brought forward at least one year, if not two.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to pick up a number of points raised earlier.  This Bill is merely an enabling motion to allow the Government to spend money and to govern.  There can be no question but that it is their priority to have it passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was intrigued by some points raised <Col N="372" /> earlier, particularly the references to Aer Lingus.  It highlights once again the double-think about public companies, privatisation and so on when, on the one hand, people say public and semi-State companies should be profitable and be run on a commercial basis while, on the other hand, people tell us that, when they do run their affairs profitably and on a commercial basis, they are doing so at too high a cost to the people dependent on them, that we should put pressure on them to do otherwise.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus represent probably the best investment that the State has made in the semi-State sector, in terms of what the company cost us and what they are worth. They have been worth every penny we have put into them.  One of the reasons for that was that the Government of the day, in their wisdom, at the time of the company's inception, allowed the company to develop in different ways.  They did not restrict their operations merely to air traffic.  The Government allowed then to develop and expand into the hotels area and so on.  That strategy allowed them to become a more complete company and to work efficiently and properly.</P>
    <P>In relation to deregulation I might reiterate that it is my opinion that we are going through a honeymoon period at present.  Because of the introduction of more privatised, smaller companies into the general area, air fares have dropped and are now much cheaper than heretofore. I might warn the House &mdash; and I am sure that the Minister is aware &mdash; that ten years ago, when deregulation was at its height in the US air fares dropped substantially.  Ten years later, when all of the smaller companies have been wiped out, air fares are more expensive in <i>pro rata</i> terms than they were then, so that there has been no ultimate gain to the consumer.  The same will happen here. We see it happening daily.  No later than yesterday there were the negotiations mooted between British Caledonian, SAS and various other groups to amalgamate. Aer Lingus stated in recent months that they foresee a time within the next decade when there will be five or six <Col N="373" /> multinational airline companies that will control everything, the smaller ones being bought out.  We are moving in that direction.</P>
    <P>I consider prices at duty-free shops very high.  However, the &ldquo;holier than thou&rdquo; attitude of singling out Aer Lingus in this respect is unacceptable.  Probably, it could be said that in any part of the world it is cheaper to buy goods on the high street than in the supposedly duty-free shops.  I would include in that comment any carrier to continental Europe. For example it is cheaper to buy a bottle of brandy in a supermarket in France than at any of the duty-free airports in France.  That is a fact and can be substantiated.</P>
    <P>In terms of spending and allowing semi-State companies to develop, on which we will be having to debate later, I should like to compliment the Government on allowing the ESB to expand their operations into the area of wholesale coal distribution.  Of course, any time they have ever tried to develop &mdash; including the period in which they were established &mdash; there was objection raised to their being allowed to expand nationwide. That is a semi-State company which will be proved to be a jewel in the crown eventually.</P>
    <P>It is of interest to everybody to establish for themselves how the nation decides its financial policies.  In the debate on the Estimates the Minister made a very brave point, one which was not picked up at all in the course of that debate.  He said he was trying to find a solution to problems created by successive Governments from 1973 onwards, and that included Governments of his own party.  That was a brave statement to make, an indication of honesty and deliberation.  Whereas I would disagree with many of the aspects of the programme for Government, at least it constituted an honest starting point.</P>
    <P>I am interested in the growth of our economy because I believe very strongly that we have a two-tier society in which there are the haves and the have-nots. There appear to me to be two ways only of finding a solution to that problem.  We <Col N="374" /> could say: there are a lot of people with wealth in this country at present; let us take from them and give it to those who do not have it.  But there is not a chance in hell of that happening.  I recognise that and am being pragmatic about it.  The only alternative way to ensure a proper distribution of wealth among the lesswell-off in our society is to create a situation of growth in the economy, so that that growth can be spread amongst those people who most need it.  In other words, there would be positive discrimination in the share-out of the effects and the wealth created by growth in the economy.  The Leader of the House said he was glad to see that there was not a reduction in the moneys available to the disadvantaged or under-privileged in our society.  That is not quite true.  In one disadvantaged area, that of primary education, there has been a major cut of one-third.  However that figure perhaps does not represent the extent of the problem as it was a small budget in the first place.</P>
    <P>It is my view and certain belief that sound financial decisions are based very definitely and dependent upon sound economic strategies.  At the moment we have a Government who are led by an accountant who wishes to act like an economist.  Therein lies the problem.  We are falling between two stools.  We need to recognise that the economist gives a direction and the accountant takes the decisions.  That has not happened.  If they both got together maybe we could get a direction that might be more programmed and more understanding.  For that reason, the Government should be aware and take discriminating heed of the economists who advise them in their decisions.</P>
    <P>I want to talk on one area of that at the moment, and that is the area of redundancies. It is my firm belief &mdash; and it is only a belief because I cannot get to the facts of the matter and perhaps the Minister might be able to clear it up for me &mdash; that the whole area of redundancy in the public service is one that has been handled with a great lack of sophistication. <Col N="375" /> It seems to me that the Government were advised, perhaps correctly, that the cost of a public servant is £X, the average amount.  Let us say that the figure was a correct figure because it is simply a matter of division.  The Government then decided that to reduce that number by 10,000 was going to save the State a certain factor of 10,000.</P>
    <P>I think that is where the operation fell down because the Government then went about looking at each of the spending areas and saying they would take so many from here, so many from there on a <i>pro rata</i> basis.  That was like giving William Tell a blunderbuss to shoot the apple off his son's head.  He would have spattered the apple all right, but he would have spattered everything around it as well. There was a certain lack of accuracy in the way we developed the redundancy scheme in the public service and the way the Government approached it, because there are certain areas in the public service which are far less cost effective than others.  This was not taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>I am speaking very clearly at this stage about primary education, because in primary education the cost of a teacher to the State is more or less the cost of that teacher's net salary, whereas it has been estimated that in many other areas of the public service to maintain an employee that one has the costs of telephone, copiers, secretarial help, management structure, heat, light, rent and all the other costs that are there as part of maintaining a public service.  This is not the case in primary education because those particular costs are covered locally and the only cost to the State is a cost per pupil which works out at something like 15p per pupil per day, and that cost will remain even if one takes every teacher out of a school because it is based on the pupil population only.  Therefore, in this area and in other similar areas as well we have a situation where there is not the same cost to the Government of different public services but I have seen no sign of that kind of study taking place anywhere in the costings the Government have put <Col N="376" /> in front of us.  It also seems to me that the economic gurus who advise the Government in this area did not consider where we were going.</P>
    <P>On the area of the cost and cost effectiveness, the need for planning, the need to follow up investment and the need to get the most out of investment, it is highly questionable why some of the decisions were taken.  It was my understanding that when the Government, and all due credit to them, published the Estimates at the earliest I can remember them being published, the idea at that stage was to allow a debate to take place with people responding to them and pointing out various points to the Government.  In other words, it was a recognition &mdash; at least I hope it was a recognition &mdash; that all the nation's wisdom was not simply invested in the members of Government and their advisers, that there are other people as well who can add to the collective wisdom of the nation in order to give a direction to economic planning.</P>
    <P>In saying that, let us look at what it costs this country to take 1,500 national teachers out of the public service.  The cost to the State to put a teacher on stream, at a very conservative estimate, would be approximately £25,000.  That is what it costs to train and prepare a primary teacher and to have that teacher ready to take up work.  Similarly, taking the primary teachers out of the system means we are turning our backs on that investment.  If we are now saying that it costs £25,000 to train, educate and prepare a primary teacher and we then say let us take 1,500 of them out of the system, we are talking about 1,500 times £25,000 which is roughly £37.5 million that we are turning our back on, money that the taxpayers pay, that the nation has invested, that the nation is entitled to a return on and we are saying we do not need any return on that investment.</P>
    <P>Similarly, if we take 1,500 teachers out of the system we are leaving up to 1,500 classrooms lying empty to deteriorate. Apart from the deterioration, which is something that is very difficult to quantify and assess, it would certainly be a very conservative estimate indeed to say that <Col N="377" /> the average cost to the State to build each of those classrooms was approximately £40,000.  Again, if we multiply £40,000 by 1,500 we get a figure of £60 million. We are talking about a figure of £60 million which we have invested in actual concrete and £35 million invested in the preparation, training and education of teachers.  There is £100 million there that we are turning our backs on which is not being discussed at all.  It is a waste of money in that we have invested money in creating an infrastructure, in creating a fabric, and we are now prepared to turn our backs on it.  Is that a wise way of spending money?  Is that a sound financial decision?  Is there a sound economic strategy behind it?  My understanding of economics leads me to believe &mdash; and I have yet to find the economist who will disagree with the point &mdash; that the most important resource for any developing economy is a sound, well-educated young population.  There are two requisites for the development of an economy, health and education.  There can be no development without them.</P>
    <P>What we are doing at the moment is like buying a new car and then not being able to afford the insurance or tax on it.  Thus, the car which cost £10,000 or £20,000 is lying outside the front door for lack of insurance and taxation.  While it is outside the door it is deteriorating by the day and it is losing value by the year. We are looking at a huge investment which is devaluing all the time.  What we are doing does not make economic sense. The future saving to the State through taking out of the system the primary teachers is probably a saving that would have come about naturally by way of demographic trends and changes over the next decade or so.  I do not believe that the economists who advised the Government on this area took that into account. I put these points very sincerely.  All of us make mistakes.</P>
    <P>I have listened to Ministers talking about the need to work within the Estimates. I want to make a statement to the Minister for Finance in this particular area which I hope he will take on and respond to, because no member of the <Col N="378" /> Government has responded to me so far on this point.  I have listened to Ministers saying that whatever changes are necessary must take place within the budget and within the Estimates.  To many people the Estimates are something very mysterious and very difficult to understand. The Estimates for primary education are dealt with in approximately 18 lines.  Any normal fourth class or fifth class student could work them out.  They are not difficult.  I want to say, here and now, that in the Estimates for primary education no account is taken of a redundancy scheme.  It is not costed in the Estimates for primary education except in one area and that is the area of pensions.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Minister for Finance to tell me I am wrong in what I am going to say next.  If the Minister would not apply this redundancy scheme to primary education, the net effect on the State's education Estimates for next year would be a saving of £5 million.  The only place, that I can find, in the budget or in the Estimates where there is any allowance made for this redundancy scheme has been in the pensions area where, as I recall, superannuation at primary level goes from something like £48.6 million to £54.6 million in the coming year.  On my figures, only £1 million of that will be needed for normal increases, therefore I estimate that £5 million extra has been put in to pay the pensions of teachers whom the State wishes to make redundant. Not making them redundant would save the State £5 million and that is the only effect it would have on the Estimates of this year.</P>
    <P>Secondly, if we are talking about saving money and spending money, about Estimates etc., I would like the House to consider for a moment where the money for future redundancy schemes is going to come from.  How are they going to be funded?  I have heard references made to the Central Bank.  Perhaps the Minister will correct me if I am wrong in my simplistic approach to it but, as I understand the Central Bank, it is a State-owned body.  Its profits come to the State and its reserves are the State's reserves.  There <Col N="379" /> is a number of ways by which we can get money from the Central Bank.  The only ways I know of are: they can give us a loan, which we have to pay back; they can give us an advance one year which means that we will not get money in a future year; or else they can give us the money out of the reserves.</P>
    <P>If it is a loan, we have to repay it with interest at a cost to the State and I do not recognise any costing built into any of the schemes I have seen.  I would like to know that cost.  If it is an advance to the State from money that it would get in a future year, all this means is that in the future years for which we should prepare we would have less money to spend.  If we have less money to spend in future years, the deficit must be made up with extra taxation.  An advance means extra taxation; a loan means extra payment and loan repayments for the State.  The other way is to take from the reserves.</P>
    <P>Every year, as people will be aware, the Central Bank sinks a certain amount into the reserves.  Some idiot, for want of a better word &mdash; who has a degree in economics &mdash; said to me recently, that we can take from the reserves because we have more money there than we need. I would certainly like to examine that point because it raises two questions. Either we have been needlessly sinking money into a hole for the last number of years and if that is the case I want to know about it, or we are taking from the reserves now.  If that is the case it will create a crisis of confidence in the Central Bank and in the banking system which will have far more cumulative knock-on effects on the system than the Stock Exchange collapse, which was really only the rich hitting the rich.  A crisis of confidence in the banking system would create a major problem for us.</P>
    <P>There is one other way in which we could get money from the Central Bank and I hope the Minister will say that there is no intention of doing this &mdash; that is, to ask them to print more money.  It seems that whichever of the four approaches is to be adopted, there is no sound, or financial, or economic argument for using <Col N="380" /> it.  That is my response with regard to the scheme of redundancy.  It is non cost effective, it will not save money and-it is a mistake at a time when we should be building up an infrastructure.  Surely, a precondition for growth is an effective infrastructure at all the different levels.  I would appeal to the Minister to consider that, perhaps this is an area where, in the long term, savings could be achieved to the same effect, without a devastating onslaught in a very short period.  I would ask him to take that point into consideration.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment very briefly on the Ministers remark that he would like to see access to health and education made easier for people.  I would certainly welcome that.  I say with regret that I cannot see the decisions being taken at the moment making that happen, but I am not going to get into that argument. The direction is not right for achieving greater access to health or education, but it is simple enough for me to stand up and say that, particularly without putting forward my argument.</P>
    <P>I want to talk briefly about resources. What is a national natural resource? What is valuable and what is not?  Really it very much depends on the perspective of the person making the assessment.  It is true that if an oil field or gas field started running free or wild tomorrow through a breakdown in piping, or through an upheaval or whatever and the gas was flowing into the air or the oil into the sea, there would be a public outcry at the waste, apart from the pollution. Something would need to be done.  There would be immediate intervention to get the leak plugged.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister probably has been listening <i>ad nauseam</i> to statements on emigration, on the outflow of people from this country.  I put it to him that the outflow of our young people is a leak, or a waste, of a natural national resource of greater proportions than if the Kinsale oil field were to be lost to the elements tomorrow morning.  That must be taken on board.  To put that in its context, as I recall, the latest figure that came through last week indicates that 28,000 was now <Col N="381" /> a conservative estimate of the number of people emigrating from this country per year.</P>
    <P>Figures mean very little to people &mdash; 28,000 is the same as 280,000.  What does this figure mean, in fact?  Can we relate it to something?  I just want to relate it in very simple terms to the age cohort, in other words the number of people of any one age group in Ireland at the moment. The number of people born per year is roughly between 50,000 and 60,000.  In each age group in primary schools over the last ten years the average number would be about 60,000.  Such a figure will drop down over the next eight, nine, or ten years to roughly 54,000.  An emigration figure of 28,000 per year is, in fact, one out of every two in relation to the number of births taking place in the year.  Eventually, it finds its own level.  It would be incorrect for me to say that one out of every two, or half of the 18 year olds in this country, are going to emigrate, but over a period of years &mdash; and it is a figure that is increasing &mdash; the estimates are that emigration will go up to 30,000 or 33,000 per year.</P>
    <P>We are looking at an outflow from this country of more than one out of every two young people.  We cannot afford that.  We need these people.  There will be no growth without them and that is for us a matter of priority.  It is misleading to think that we can have development or growth without them.  At the end of the day, we will have to take economic decisions, financial decisions.  We must spend our money in a way which will repay every penny.</P>
    <P>In making decisions during the year the Minister's number one priority should be to aim for growth and in trying to achieve that growth, he should use all the resources, advice and help that are available.  The Government, because they are in a minority at the moment in the other House are in the ideal position to assess the information that is available and to make judgments.  The expertise is not confined to the Government or the Government party, there are other people who can help.  Their views should also be taken on board and given consideration. <Col N="382" /> We should try to build a future of hope, not of emigration; a future of work, not of unemployment and a future in which there will be equality in society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to discuss the figures which have been presented by the Minister in the Appropriation Bill, 1987.  An extra £25 million is required over and above the figure contained in the Estimates and that extra £25 million has been approved by the House.  The Bill presents us with an opportunity to look at where the country is going, how we as public representatives are performing in the eyes of the public, at the responsibility which has been placed on us by the electorate and indeed at the commitments given by us either when in Opposition or in Government. The position of the Labour Party has always been crystal clear and the Minister can, if he so wishes, check any documentation which was presented by the Labour Party before an election or any programme that we have been involved with in Government to see that this is so. We have always recognised the cardinal importance of attacking the crisis in the national debt, bearing in mind the major question as to who should pay for the crisis.</P>
      <P>Ninety per cent of elected representatives feel that this crisis has to be, first of all, attacked at the levels which affect the poor, the underprivileged and the needy.  The Government have approached the problem in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When in Government we were accused of slowing up progress in dealing with the national debt.  We plead guilty to that accusation on the basis that if everything that was required to be done was done within a prescribed period then suffering and hardship would ensue.  We approached the problem realistically and there were widespread accusations that we were too tough.  As Senator Lanigan has said, the lobby groups were active. Senator Lanigan's party were the biggest lobbyists of all.  They ran with the electorate and said that more money should be spent in every area.  If they were as realistic then as they are today they would <Col N="383" /> have realised that it was difficult to say that without being dishonest with the people.  There is a widespread feeling among the electorate that people are not the same in Government as they are when in Opposition.</P>
    <P>The word U-turn has been used widely in respect of the Governments performance. Apparently, the Minister sees the need for being cautious in what he does and irrespective of what he might have promised when in Opposition he now realises that things are not so easy in Government.  We still ask the question, who will pay for this crisis?  On looking at the Book of Estimates for the coming year, which have been based on the Estimates for this year, I discover that there are major reductions in all of the areas which the Labour Party are concerned about.  In the allocation for the Department of Labour who deal specifically with the sections which Senator O'Toole has spoken about, the young, the unemployed, and those who need to be retrained after leaving school, there is a reduction of £10 million.  All that is left for them is the emigration boat.</P>
    <P>The allocation for the Department of Health, and health is an area which touches the underprivileged, has been reduced by £72 million.  There were widespread cutbacks within the health services this year and hospitals were closed around the country.  These closures were dictated at departmental level and as a result many difficulties have arisen.  The need which is there has not been met by the health boards.  They now publicly admit that because of the Estimate for next year there is no way that they can continue to give any semblance of a health service to those who need it, to those who are entitled to it and to those who have paid for it.  One of the tragedies of this type of bookkeeping is that the decisions which are made at a higher level can lead to widespread hardship on the ground.  That is what happened in the health services this year and it will continue to happen in the coming year.</P>
    <P>The executive officers of the health boards have publicly stated that they <Col N="384" /> cannot continue with the money being made available to them.  Members of health boards who are also in the Government party are publicly stating that they want to meet the Minister for Health to say that they cannot carry on.  Senator Lanigan is one of those Senators who is privileged to serve on a health board.  He has publicly stated that they must meet the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, to explain their dilemma; yet, today he commended a Minister who has sent a warning shot across the bows of the Department of Health that they must cut back and that this is all they are going to get.  When we go to the coal face, where the services are delivered, we realise that the services cannot be delivered.  The Minister says that he does not want any more hospitals closed, but he only gives an allocation that will almost require the closing of a hospital.  It is a very neat transfer of responsibility.  The Minister says he does not want to close hospitals but he gives insufficient funds to the health boards who will have no option but to propose the closure of more hospitals which the Minister will accept.  That is what he did this year.</P>
    <P>We went to the Minister about the hospital in Tipperary.  He said that he had no plans to close the hospital in Tipperary but in a vote the Fianna Fáil members of the health board decided to close the hospital so that the budget would be complied with, and the Minister agreed.  We now have to go to court and go through all sorts of procedures.  That is just one example of what is happening in the South Eastern Health Board area.  Their budget for this year is smaller than any which has been given in the history of the State and is £4.2 million less than they require.  That represents a real cut.  In the past the Minister looked for more in the hope that he could improve services.  He received a little extra last year but a lot less than he needed.  For the first time it is being recognised that real cuts have taken place because less money has been given to the health services and other services.  CEO's of health boards have said they cannot provide services unless <Col N="385" /> they close hospitals.  This year those closures have not affected any economies because the genuine sick must be hospitalised or otherwise they die.  That is a tragedy particularly when we are mainly concerned about the old who have contributed their share in taxes over the years.</P>
    <P>There is a cutback of £43 million in the area of primary education while post primary has been cut by £26 million.  The cut in third level education is £3.6 million. Senator Joe O'Toole dealt with the dilemma that exists following the issuing of the 20/87 circular by the Minister. When that circular arrived at schools, and parents and teachers realised they were obliged to fall in line with its terms, they announced that they could not provide adequate primary education for the children. All hell has broken loose since and now the Government realise that irrespective of what is decided in the Department of Finance it is not always possible to deliver.  Four different U-turns have been made on the Education Estimate. The Minister may have adopted certain policies, which were accepted by his colleagues on the basis of being a decision by the Cabinet, but on the ground some members of his party are expressing great concern.  Members of his party on health boards, local authorities and county committees of agriculture, are concerned about the policies being pursued by the Government.  They are unable to meet the challenge put to them by the Department of Finance.  It is fine to say that they represent strong Government, even though the Government do not have a majority, but in my view the policies are being pursued by the Government because they realise they have support on local authorities to carry them through.</P>
    <P>I wonder why it is that the Department of Finance is one of the privileged Departments in that they have been granted an increase in their Estimate of £27 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is marvellous. <Col N="386" /> There has been a 45 per cent increase for economic advisers, consultancy fees and so on.  Who advises whom?  I accept that the Minister for Finance needs consultants but I hope the consultants realise that it is left to others at local level to provide services for the people.  That is not easy.  There has been a reduction of £90 million in the Estimate for the Department of the Environment.  I have gone through the difficult experience, as a member of local authorities, of trying to strike a rate and I have come to the conclusion that unless the financial structures of local authorities are reorganised there will not be a future for them.  Local authorities are not being allowed to dominate the economic development of their counties or towns.  They are not able to make democratic decisions which they can follow through.  In my view they are nothing more than rubber stamps for central Government where there is very little planning.  Central Government do not have any understanding of how local authorities functions.  They are not aware that those power houses generate schemes to improve the infrastructural development of their counties.  I hope the Minister will give real power to local authorities.  The Government will have to address the financial problems faced by them.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in dealing with agriculture, told us that farm incomes improved in 1987.  My response to that is, thank God for a fine year.  I do not think the Government had anything to do with the improvement in farm incomes. That improvement was handed down by the Lord.  I accept that the Minister is in a powerful position but I do not think he has the power to intercept the decision of the Lord in regard to the weather.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may claim credit.  I was blamed for the wet days. Occasionally we all have to pray to survive in politics.  The years 1985 and 1986 were disastrous ones for farmers because of the bad weather.  The Minister should not rest on his laurels because another <Col N="387" /> bad year would prove disastrous for them, too.  We must remember that the farming community have very few options left open to them to increase incomes.  Many of the traditional sources have been closed off by the Council of Ministers.  We depend on a vibrant agricultural industry and because of that I was amazed to hear the Minister for Agriculture and Food introducing a Bill to reorganise the system of advice, research and development and in doing so proposing to reduce the amount of money for that by 50 per cent.</P>
      <P>That was a wrong decision and it will prove detrimental to the agricultural and food industries.  We may prepare elaborate programmes but we will not be able to deliver on them if we do not have experts available to help farmers implement them.  The experts in ACOT and An Foras Talúntais have been offered voluntary redundancy and I do not think there will be officials of any consequence left in those organisations to make it possible for the Government to implement their programme.</P>
      <P>An expert in the field of agriculture, in the course of a letter to me, said that the proposed cut of 43 per cent in the estimated budget for An Forus Talúntais and ACOT, coming after a cumulative reduction of 25 per cent in real terms over the past six years, will virtually mean the end of agricultural research here.  He went on:</P>
      <P>The Institute have a team of experienced and dedicated research scientists, all of whom have real contact with agriculture and whose research work over the past 28 years has laid the basis for the growth in agricultural production and efficiency.  To expect a recovery of our national economy in a land bereft of the research and development team for its major industry is impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a valid response to the Minister's intention to amalgamate ACOT and An Foras Talúntais.  ACOT, who have been giving advice and training to our young <Col N="388" /> farmers, will be offering their staff voluntary redundancy.  The Minister's proposal is that the staff should earn their wages by charging farmers for advice but in the past we could not coax our farmers to take advice at no cost.  Profit margins in the agriculture sector are recovering after a number of disastrous years.</P>
    <P>Unemployment concerns us all and the Minister was honest in telling us that in spite of all the efforts of the Government through the Jobsearch programme and other schemes, the number has increased over the 1986 figure.  If the predictions of all the experts are right, whether or not they are competent experts and most of them are self professed, unemployment figures will continue to increase next year in spite of the best efforts of this Government.  If so I am not sure that proper planning has taken place in the Department of Labour or the Department of Social Welfare to take account of this additional charge on the Exchequer to cover for additional figures in unemployment, unless we accept the soft option of facilitating people to emigrate to other lands.  If we invest money in teaching and training our young people in agriculture or any other sector, we have an obligation and a constitutional right to make every effort to provide work for them in future in our own country.  That itself would generate economic development which would benefit not alone the country but those of us resident in it.</P>
    <P>The long term figures for unemployment are extremely worrying and it will be a tragedy if we have to wait until 1992 or further down the road before any real improvement takes place in this area. The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which the Minister referred to, on page 16, section V under the heading &ldquo;Employment&rdquo; states: &ldquo;Lower interest and mortgage rates, a stable exchange rate, low inflation, stabilisation of the National Debt/GNP ratio and its subsequent reduction to a sustainable level, halting and reversing the flow of capital out of the economy, lower and more equitable personal taxation constitute the <Col N="389" /> fiscal and monetary policy of the Government under the Programme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In spite of the collapse of the Stock Market this year which, as Senator O'Toole said, is the rich beating the rich, despite that jolt for the money men of the world, I see nothing in this programme except aspirations.  It is good that at least there is an aspiration to do something about unemployment and that the social partners also have an aspiration in this area and will get together and submit proposals to the Department.  If that was to be followed through, why were the NDC singled out for a reduction in their allocation when we could have capital available on an equity basis to stimulate development between the public and private sectors in areas where either one or the other would not have the funds, expertise or courage?  Perhaps we should admit that the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is just a wage agreement.  Some right wingers would say it is too generous. The trade union movement would say it was a give away but they want to be involved with the Government in a consultative process, which is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>As I see it, it just manages to deal with the question of wages over a two or three year period in the hope and belief that there will not be industrial disputes on wages.  After that you can read every page and find relatively little hope for creation of jobs or any improvement as far as we can see that might stimulate the economy.  Therefore, I do not know where national recovery comes into that programme.  I hope I am wrong.  I will monitor the progress and will be nothing but constructive in anything I might say or do in the next two or three years in this area.  Let us hope some proposals come up because every other day I hear the private sector offering redundancies. The State sector are in the same dilemma and saying that one way they can balance their books is to ask everybody to leave the service.</P>
    <P>We cannot abdicate our responsibility as a Government or as a nation.  There are some services nobody can provide for himself or herself which the Government <Col N="390" /> must provide.  The whole concept of socialism is that people who are unable to provide for themselves must be looked after by somebody and the Government accept that responsibility.  Let us not just say economically that we can take everybody out of the sector and forget about the services because that will manage to balance the budget and the national debt will be looked after.  What will happen at the end of the day?  Who will pay for all the redundancies?  What are the amounts that will be given as lump sums going to cost initially?  Where will the funds come from for the future pensions of all these people who now are taken out of the sector for which they were educated and trained and are competent to give the service?  Suddenly we pay them all to leave it and continue to pay them when they are not in it on the basis that it is better economics to pay them for doing nothing.</P>
    <P>This brings me back to the example Senator O'Toole gave about the car.  I have used it on numerous occasions, but my analogy is even worse than the Senator's.  Not alone did we buy a car; we taxed and insured it.  We could not afford the petrol which he talks about so we locked the car and hired a taxi.  We must have a driver for the car.  We told the driver we do not want him.  We sent him home to sit down and we paid him or he could drive somebody else's car. We would prefer if he drove somebody else's car.</P>
    <P>That is the sort of economic development I see happening.  We have invested a great deal of money in the State in the past in BTE, forestry, agriculture. Mention any sector and this Government and past Governments have put public money into the development when it was about to pay off to the State there was a mad rush to shift it into the private sector where real profits could be made when the infrastructural costs were already put in place by the taxpayer.  This is Mrs. Thatcher's philosophy.  You can bring down interest rates, inflation rates, everything, but if unemployment levels rise and continue to rise and all other movement of money and capital is unable <Col N="391" /> to create jobs, this Government will have lost the mandate they got from the public. They made an issue of the fact that there was widespread unemployment, pictured the passports on their billboards and said: &ldquo;There is a better way.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Bigger queues appeared in Molesworth Street since this Government were elected.  Some of them may have been going on holiday, and I hope so, but a good many passports were prepared in Molesworth Street and we may never see some of those young people again.  That is a drain on a real natural resource which this nation can ill afford.  We have invested money in the past.  We should use every method at our disposal to stimulate the economy and use the powerhouse of Government to ensure that people get work in their own country and thereby fill the coffers of the Exchequer and, in turn, look after the poor, the underprivileged and those in need who are unable to look after themselves. This Government have a responsibility not to disregard them, close their hospitals, do away with their pupil-teacher ratio or anything which touches their lives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I must thank the House for its cooperation in facilitating us in getting this legislation through and I thank the Senators who have spoken for their contributions. I could spend hours replying because many points were raised in relation to Government activity, local authority activity, transport activity and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Daly spoke about the difficulties in the motor trade, the car hire services the high cost of cars and the cost of insurance.  There is absolutely no doubt that there are many difficulties facing this trade and facts and statistics will show there has been a great downturn in that trade.  Senator Lanigan rightly pointed to this as well.  It costs money to do anything about these problems.  One has often to examine carefully whether it is a taxation proposal, a downturn in disposable income or employment or <Col N="392" /> emigration, or a combination of factors, that is leading to the difficulties that any particular industry might experience. The motor trade is one that I accept are experiencing difficulties.  I met motor traders this past week and I do not know whether it is possible for us to do anything to help them, but this is one area I will carefully examine to see if there is anything we can do.</P>
    <P>There was a lot of talk about Aer Lingus, and I think it would be better for me to leave that to the Minister for Transport to reply.  I would not completely accept some of the condemnations that were laid at the door of Aer Lingus or Aer Rianta when we see the amount of work that will be done by Aer Lingus, Ryanair and all their carriers, which will carry a larger number of visitors to Ireland over Christmas.  I will come back to that before I conclude.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan mentioned tax collection, the difficulties and the abuses, and suggested that we should be less strict in our enforcement.  I do not think we can realistically accept that we should have huge amounts of taxes due to be paid, but when efforts are being made to collect that money as has been done in the last 12 months with sheriffs and the task force and a tightening up of enforcement and collection, and when those measures begin to bite, we cannot have too much sympathy for these people because many of them may have got two or three years grace to pay their tax, unlike the PAYE sector, about whom we are all concerned, who pay their tax out of their weekly, fortnightly or monthly cheques.  I do not think we can have too much sympathy for those who could well afford to pay their taxes and who have not done so for quite some time, but now when they have to meet there obligations, they are inclined to complain. Obviously one would make every effort to ensure, and I am sure the Revenue Commissioners and all their staff will ensure, that the taxpayers they come into contact with are treated with courtesy and respect and that they are given the proper information and all that is <Col N="393" /> required to ensure that the State, through its legislation and law, is not using the big stick against any individual, company or corporation.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan also pointed to the difficulties for employers and small businesses, the cost of employment and the fact that employees are used, and have been used, as tax collectors.  I know that is true and many of them have difficulties, but what has been inclined to happen in some businesses is that they took their turnover as being all their own, and did not take fully into account the amount that should be sent to the State in VAT, PAYE, PRSI or their own income tax. A number of them have caused some of the difficulties they are experiencing at the moment.</P>
    <P>In relation to a number of these difficulties that have been raised, one has to accept that there is a downturn and that we are going through difficult times, and have been for some time.  One good fact mentioned by Senator Lanigan was the boost increased tourism gave us this year. That was welcome and it arose because the Government saw the potential, even late in the season, and took action.  The Minister for Tourism and Transport made sure that whatever we could do was done in the short time at our disposal, and we are all grateful for that.  It led to some improvement in the industry.  We hope we will be able to do even more for 1988.  When we talk about tourism we relate it to the summer months or the good weather periods &mdash; spring, summer and autumn.  It has been confidentially predicted that the number of visitors to Ireland over the Christmas period will break all records.  The efforts of the Minister for Tourism and Transport in relation to excess fares have led to increased competition and a huge increase in the number of people using air transport particularly.  However, I am glad to say that other forms of transport have rowed in and are making their contribution as well.  We expect that huge numbers of additional people will be coming into the country, as we experienced in recent weeks.  Most of the improvements will begin to accrue during 1988 on the basis <Col N="394" /> of the agreements that have been worked out by the tourism and transport Ministers of the EC and by our own Minister.</P>
    <P>Some Senators have mentioned interest rates.  We all welcome that fact that they are continuing their downward spiral and let us hope that will continue. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind, or in the Government's mind, that unless and until we can have money available for investment at rates that will give a return on that investment &mdash; unlike the rates we have had for quite some time in this economy &mdash; we will not get the kind of investment we need to create the jobs that are required for the huge numbers who are unemployed at present.</P>
    <P>One of the things Senator Lanigan rightly said was that we had made every effort to ensure that the poor, the people on social welfare, the unemployed, old age pensioners, would not have to pay or bear the brunt of the impact of these savings.  All other Senators condemned the Government and suggested that it was the poor who were having to make this contribution.  It is no harm to remind the House that we have shown concern for those people.  I have said it on numerous occasions, but I want to repeat it. Our concern for the less well off is clearly demonstrated in both our actions since coming into office and in our published commitments for the next few years.  For instance, unlike the Senators who spoke and the parties they supported up until March this year, we paid this year's welfare increases from July instead of November, as had been promised by our predecessors.  It was promised only; it may not have been delivered on because of what has been done or what was happening in the economy at that time.  This increase helped to ensure that welfare recipients would not fall behind.  Secondly, we maintained the Christmas bonus for welfare recipients despite widespread concern that it would be reduced or abolished.  Up to 920,000 recipients and dependants will benefit from this bonus.  We also extended the equal treattempt alleviating measures to the end of this year and, as the Minister for Social Welfare said recently, until the end of April next.</P>

      <Col N="395" /> I know they will keep pumping it out because if they say it often enough many people will believe it, but the facts are that the Government have been very careful in every single decision they made to ensure that those who are dependent on social welfare are not bearing the impact of the kind of measures and savings that had to be made in relation to the overall state of the public finances. The same goes for the delivery of the services on the ground, no matter who is delivering them.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole, spoke about social welfare and complained about the poor having to bear the brunt of what we were doing, and he talked quite extensively on the education expenditure &mdash; I am not going to go into any great detail on that. On eductional expenditure we are talking about hundreds of millions of pounds in the payment of teachers' salaries.  The Education Vote has been trimmed like every other Vote to contribute to the savings required by the Government. They have outlined their expenditure proposals for 1988 and will stick by them. When I come here to do the Appropriations Bill this time 12 months I will be able to say what I have said today, that at the end of the year we will have achieved the targets laid out in the budget.</P>
    <P>I could not understand all the points made by Senator O'Toole on redundancy. There has been a great demand and necessity for a redundancy package because of the fact that in numerous areas throughout the public service &mdash; the Land Commission for example &mdash; people could not be laid off because of their terms of employment.</P>

      <P>There is tremendous interest in the early retirement and the voluntary redundancy package throughout the public sector.  I have no doubt that we will achieve the target set by the <Col N="396" /> Government in relation to the operation of this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. In the private sector redundancy schemes have been in operation for ten or 15 years.  To survive, they must modernise and rationalise and, therefore, redundancy proposals were put forward in many industries.  The State has found itself in the same position in many areas because of the decisions we took and implemented during 1987 and what is proposed in 1988.  We did not want to make it compulsory for people to go so we came forward with the voluntary scheme.</P>
      <P>How will it be paid?  The main reason it was not countenanced before was because of the lump sum cost.  Nobody was prepared to pay what was necessary in that area because it was not worth considering the lump sum up front costs. We understood that and accepted it and we said quite clearly that we would be concerned about the up front costs which are running at £80-£100 million now.  We discussed ways and means with the Central Bank of providing that money.  I indicated in reply to a recent parliamentary question that the board of the Central Bank have approved of arrangements under which the bank will make advance payments of surplus income to assist the Exchequer in meeting the exceptional costs of the redundancy programme.  I would like to emphasise that point and to contradict the rest of what Senator O'Toole said in relation to taxing the reserves and undermining the confidence in the Central Bank, which is absolute rubbish.  Advance payments of surplus income are being made to assist the Exchequer in meeting the exceptional costs of the redundancy programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Every year the Central Bank has over £100 million which it pays into the Exchequer.  It has been <Col N="397" /> doing so for years, even during the period of the Senator's Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>These arrangements are in accordance with section 63 (7) of the Currency Act, 1927, which provides that the Central Bank may at any time pay into the Exchequer such sums on account of surplus income as may be agreed upon by the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank.  Each year the Central Bank pays over to the Exchequer the surplus income it has earned in the previous year after having made certain appropriations to reserves.  The surplus income is taken into the Exchequer as non-tax revenue and is shown separately in the White Paper of Receipts and Expenditure published at the start of each year.</P>
      <P>Under the arrangement I have outlined, the Central Bank will advance to the Exchequer not later than 31 December 1987 amount equal to the issue from this Vote, £10 million.  This represents an advance payment to the Exchequer of surplus income by the bank in addition to the amount which would otherwise have been paid.  That is how the lump sum costs are being paid for.  The result is that the exceptional costs of the redundancy programme will be financed by the additional surplus income from the Central Bank and will not add either to the current budget deficit or the Exchequer borrowing requirement.</P>
      <P>The advance by the Central Bank will be repaid over a period of four years after a moratorium of one year.  The repayment will take the form of four equal annual deductions by the Central Bank from the normal payments of surplus income.  The Exchequer will, at the same time, be getting the benefits of savings from reduced numbers.  That is how the scheme will be paid for.  It is good business. It is a very popular scheme and there is great demand for it.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Toole and Senator Ferris raised the question of emigration and unemployment.  We have been concerned about these matters in recent years.  It is ironic that after we left office in 1982 the scourge of emigration returned to this country and that many tens of thousands left here over the past four years.  In fairness, it has to be said from my experience and the knowledge I have of many who have gone from my own area and the area I represent, many thousands of those young people, living in England or America, are now earning and saving money so that when the upturn comes here they will come back. It is heartening to note, too, from what we are told by their families that many thousands of them are in a position to come home and will be coming home. Some of them have already arrived to be here for Christmas with their families and perhaps many of them will not go back. We hope that will be the case but it is good to note that many of those who, unfortunately, had to go in the past number of years are now saving money abroad and that when the opportunity presents itself they will come back and make their contribution to this economy.</P>

I am sick and tired of people who get up in this House, in the Dáil on public platforms or even on the streets, as the health workers and teachers did over the past number of months, saying they are all for cutting the national debt and for reducing borrowing but then marching because of the decisions that had to be taken to reduce spending.  This is what the Government have to face.  We will continue to face it and have done so successfully in the past nine months. Huge cutbacks and savings had to be made in 1987 and we were able to achieve these savings in nine months, notwithstanding the fact that during January, February and March spending agencies, because of the attitude adopted by the Labour and Fine Gael Parties, has spent their allocations for 1986.  They had expected to get an increase in their allocations as had been the case in previous years.  For the first three months of the year they were spending more than a quarter of what was spent during 1986. When we introduced our budget at the end of March we had to say quite clearly that we could not match 1986 expenditure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As I said in my introductory remarks on this legislation we have seen a marked slowing down in the increase in unemployment in recent months.  Naturally we are very concerned about the huge numbers who are unemployed but unless and until we can control public expenditure, reduce borrowing and get ourselves out of the market of having to borrow so much from abroad, with little or no flexibility about how we spend <Col N="401" /> resources, we will not combat this problem.</P>

      <P>Senator Ferris referred to the local authorities and I think it is no harm to put the facts on the record.  In 1988 the level of rates support grants to local authorities has been substantially reduced because it had to be. The Government have set out to make a significant reduction in expenditure under their control and local authorities must contribute to this process.  Local authorities spend £900 million on a day to day basis, of which about £500 million comes from their own resources with the balance being expended by the Exchequer.  Local authorities have been asked to make significant economies in their expenditure, including their pay costs in 1988, and to increase revenues where possible.  All local authorities have done just that and have provided what they believe are the necessary resources to run the services they are responsible for during 1988.</P>

      <P>The level of reductions they are being asked to make are in line with the economies made by the Government.  They are being asked to find economies of up to £50 million on total day to day expenditure and revenue for a combined £1,300 milliion.  This represents a reduction of only 4 per cent.  I <Col N="403" /> know the local authorities are implementing these economies in a way which will ensure that emergency and essential services will not be adversely affected any more than they were with the savings that had to be imposed in the 1987 expenditure which was done on 31 March.  We had nine months only to implement those savings and we have come to the end of the year on target without any great impact, notwithstanding the difficulties that every individual had to face.  As we face into 1988 we know we are going to have to do something similar and that by the end of the year we will have made sufficient progress to enable us to be able to stand again on our feet, stick out our chests and say that we are in control of our own destinies, we can provide the resources we need, we are not going to be a prisoner of those on the international scene who are lending money to us and we are beginning to overcome those problems.

I bhfochair sin tá Meitheal Iompair Bhaile Átha Cliath le h-athbhunú.</P>
      <P>The main purposes of the Bill are: to provide for the dissolution of the Dublin Transport Authority; to re-assign most of the Authority's functions to other bodies; to repeal the Dublin Transport Authority Act, 1986, which is the legislative basis for the Authority; and to extend the scope of some of the provisions, which had been confined to the Dublin Transport Authority functional area, to the country as a whole.  The measure is necessary as a consequence of the Government decision that no funds would be available for the Authority from next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to dissolve the Authority was not taken lightly.  As Members of the House are aware, after the Government took office it was apparent that taxation levels and Exchequer borrowings were excessive &mdash; the House had an opportunity to hear that from the Minister for Finance a few moments ago &mdash; and that a reduction in State expenditure was urgently required, if the overall situation were not to disimprove further.  That is an understatement.  Examination of expenditure was undertaken in all Departments.  Every single area of spending was scrutinised.  It is fair to say that we would be facing a long term serious crisis in the public finances &mdash; to quote the Minister for Finance we would not be in charge of our finances if the matter had continued as it was &mdash; if we had not <Col N="405" /> tackled these problems right across the board.  In this process, we had to recognise that many services, which had been taken for granted by the public, were no longer affordable.  It is regretted that the Dublin Transport Authority had to be chosen for dissolution, but this was unavoidable.</P>
    <P>In implementing the Government decision, through the Bill before the House, we have succeeded in preserving most of the Dublin Transport Authority functions through transferring them to other authorities.  In addition, the Government decided that some of the functions could be extended with advantage beyond Dublin to the whole country and this we are providing for in the Bill. The House, no doubt, will agree that that is desirable.  Traffic management functions of the Authority, which are so vital for traffic flows in the Dublin area, are being transferred to a reconstituted Dublin Transportation Task Force.  With these changes it is possible to continue to pursue most of the important tasks set for the Dublin Transport Authority.</P>
    <P>Some have argued that the amount of money involved in keeping the Dublin Transport Authority in place was so small that the decision to dissolve it could have been avoided.  For 1987 the Authority's funding comprised two State grants-in-aid, one for current expenditure totalling £300,000 and £365,000 for capital works for traffic management measures.</P>
    <P>Savings from the abolition of the Authority cannot be judged on the basis of the 1987 allocations but on the likely expenditure of a fully staffed Authority.  It was envisaged that in time the staff would need to increase to at least 20 people.  On this basis the savings on the Authority's operating costs would be of the order of £500,000 per annum and could be expected to increase with the passage of years.  In the nature of things, for example, consultants would have to be employed and paid for.</P>
    <P>Again, some have said that it is a pity to sacrifice the Authority for the sake of £500,000 a year.  I acknowledge that the amount involved is not huge but the decision reflects the depth and extent of <Col N="406" /> the financial problems.  It is all the savings, including the small ones, which collectively will make the Exchequer savings worthwhile.  The Scottish proverb expresses that in sharper language: many a mickle makes a muckle.  If we were to follow the advice of our critics in all of the areas where cuts are being implemented, we would be failing to meet our overall responsibilities to the people of Ireland. I wish to emphasise that, while the Authority are being dissolved, most of their functions will be carried out by other agencies.  There will not be a vacuum.</P>
    <P>The dissolution of the Dublin Transport Authority in no sense calls into question the quality and value of the work undertaken by the chairman, members of the Authority the chief executive and staff.  The volume of work handled and carried out by the Authority demonstrates the dedication and commitment to the very onerous tasks which made up their mandate.  In the traffic management area they actively tackled such matters as disruptive roadworks by intervention at administrative level, parking and other traffic measures, including the funding of capital projects and the preparation of by-laws in relation to tow-away services. The Authority's by-laws in relation to parking controls came into force on 11 December last and they bring the &ldquo;business hours&rdquo; for Dún Laoghaire into line with the rest of the Dublin area.  The Authority made submissions to the planning authorities on the Dublin city development plan, the Custom House Docks development authority plans and other major planning applications.  The Authority also submitted to me their recommendations on the Bus Átha Cliath and Iarnród Éireann applications for increases in fares.</P>
    <P>This is not an exhaustive list but gives a general view of the work carried out by the Authority during their short life.  I wish to record my appreciation of the Authority's efforts in the past year and the efficient and effective way in which they began to come to grips with the tasks they faced.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Transport Authority Act, 1986, provided an extensive mandate. <Col N="407" /> The Act provided for the activation of the various functions by ministerial order.  It was decided that at the outset the Authority could not be expected to undertake all the functions in the legislation straight away.  As a result, functions in relation to the responsibility for the traffic warden service, licensing of passenger road services, regulation of public service vehicles and licensing of public car parks were not activated.</P>
    <P>I circulated an explanatory memorandum with the Bill.  Nonetheless, there is a need to give the House some explanations and additional information. A simple revocation of the Dublin Transport Authority Act, 1986, is not involved. There is a need to provide for continuity of most of the functions contained in that Act and these are being transferred to the Garda Síochána and the local authorities. Indeed, in most cases the Bill restores functions which had been transferred from them to the Dublin Transport Authority. As the Dublin Transport Authority mandate covered the Dublin area only, the transfer of functions is limited accordingly.</P>
    <P>Some of the provisions in the 1986 Act, for example, those in relation to the control of roadworks, the immobilisation of vehicles parked illegally through wheel-clamps and the like, the control of vehicles by bollards and ramps and the control of access to and egress from construction sites, were new and the opportunity is being taken in the Bill, in section 9 to be precise, to provide for the application of the provisions to the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>In relation to the co-ordination of roadworks, for instance, the Bill in fact is more comprehensive than the existing legislation.  A definition for emergency roadworks is now included in addition to an enabling provision for a local authority to issue directions even in such emergency cases, in order to ensure speedy completion of works.  There have been problems with gas, in the city of Dublin particularly.  These provisions will form part of the road traffic legislative code and the Minister for the Environment <Col N="408" /> will be generally responsible for their administration and for the making of relevant regulations.  These provisions represent additional functions for the local authorities and should be valuable in improving traffic flows in many areas.</P>
    <P>Decisions in relation to individual road ramps and bollards and the control of roadworks will be the responsibility of the local authorities, who will also make the by-laws in relation to control and access to and from construction sites. Regulations for giving full effect to the provisions in relation to immobilisation devices will be settled between the Ministers for the Environment and Justice. The extension of these functions to local authorities is a worthwhile development because traffic and transport problems are not peculiar to Dublin.</P>
    <P>Sections 2 to 6 of the Bill provide for the dissolution of the Authority, the transfer of assets and liabilities from it to the Minister, the continuation of the Authority's staff pension scheme, the method of dealing with legal proceedings to which it is a party and the exemption of the Minister from stamp duty on property or rights transferred from the Authority.</P>
    <P>In relation to the continuation of the Authority's staff pensions schemes, &mdash; I use the plural deliberately because the wife and family are involved &mdash; the pension schemes for the chief executive of the Dublin Transport Authority have been approved by both the Minister for Tourism and Transport and the Minister for Finance, and they were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on Wednesday 16 December 1987.  The Attorney General's office confirmed that the pension schemes are in force immediately from the date of the Ministerial approval.  The chief executives pension rights both in respect of his previous local authority service and his recent Dublin Transport Authority service are, therefore, already fully protected and will be further protected by section 4(3) of the present Bill.  This provides specifically for the continuance in force of the pension arrangements following the repeal of the 1986 Act and the substitution of the Minister <Col N="409" /> for the Authority in relation to the administration of the schemes after the Authority is dissolved.  It is important for me to put that on the record of the House as there has been considerable misunderstanding about that among Members of the Oireachtas in both Houses.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill re-enacts the provisions for dealing with persons who fail to or refuse to pay fares on public service vehicles.  This provision, which represents an improvement on the existing provision in subsection (9) of section 82 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, will apply, in accordance with the section, to the country as a whole.  It is hoped that these provisions will improve the general environment for public passenger vehicle drivers as regards the collection of fares.</P>
    <P>Section 8 transfers back to the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána the functions of the Authority in relation to such matters as taxi stands, omnibus stopping places and stands, control of traffic and pedestrians, the parking of vehicles and control of traffic signs.</P>
    <P>Section 10 continues in force the on-the-spot fines system and penalties in relation to false declarations in connection with applications for the granting of licences, plates and certificates or vehicles.</P>
    <P>Section 11 re-enacts section 27 of the 1986 Act, with minor amendments in the interest of clarification, in relation to the provision and maintenance of busways. These could become very important means of improving traffic flows in congested areas.</P>
    <P>I would like to explain that there are no busways at present in any part of the State.  They have been envisaged for the old Harcourt Street railway line and also from Tallaght.  Section 11 provides for the designation of roads or parts of them to be busways.  Use of busways would be confined to specified vehicles such as passenger road service and street service vehicles as well as ambulances, fire brigade vehicles and the like and such other vehicles as the Minister for the Environment after consultation with the Minister for Tourism and Transport may <Col N="410" /> designate.  The intention is to provide priority treatment for the services involved so as to enable them to carry out their functions quickly and effectively in the common interest.  To allow ordinary private cars or bicycles on the busways would completely negate their value, where buses, ambulances and the like would be back to competing with all other vehicles, as on our roads at present, for the limited space available.  Busways are radically different from the buslanes with which we are familiar and which cyclists are allowed to use.  The section does not make any alteration to the limits on the people or vehicles who are entitled to use buslanes.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for the extension of the functions of traffic wardens and increases from £20 to £150 the maximum penalty for certain offences such as the destruction or removal of notices attached to vehicles by traffic wardens.</P>
    <P>Now, I come to the question of the Dublin Transport Authority functions which are not being continued.  They relate principally to advisory type powers in a transport planning context.  The need for such powers has been reduced by the fact that a major priority function assigned to the Authority, that is to advise on the public transport needs of the areas to the west of the city, has been overtaken by the Government decision that no further consideration should be given to the possible extension of the electrified rail system to these areas.  This decision was taken because the substantial cost involved &mdash; running to many hundreds of millions &mdash; could not be contemplated having regard to the state of the public finances for the foreseeable future.  As Members of the House are aware, CIE have been requested to prepare transport investment plans for the Dublin area, involving only bus-based options or diesel rail services on existing lines.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Transportation task force is being reconstituted, on a non-statutory basis as before, to take up the DTA role in general transport and traffic matters. Thus the valuable work of the DTA in this area need not be lost and can indeed <Col N="411" /> be built upon.  The new task force will include representatives of the Department of Tourism and Transport and the Department of the Environment, the local authorities, the Garda and CIE. The House will be aware of the tremendous work the task force did up to its dissolution.</P>
    <P>The original task force, which preceded the Dublin Transport Authority, was responsible for the introduction of bus lanes which improved traffic flow in Dublin, stricter parking controls and the funding of specialised traffic signalling and bus priority schemes.  It also sponsored the development of the Dublin traffic management model, a computer-based traffic simulation package used to assess the effects of new traffic managements projects.  This work has been developed further by the Dublin Transport Authority.  The reconstituted task force will assume the functions of the Authority in these matters.</P>
    <P>The task force will be responsible for devising traffic management schemes, settling on an annual basis the priority traffic management activities for implementation and for allocating funds for the traffic management schemes to supplement the investments of the local authorities in this field.</P>
    <P>The 1988 Estimates for my Department provide for an allocation of £165,000 for traffic management purposes by the task force.  There will be scope for the task force to comment on development plans prepared by the Dublin local authorities in so far as the plans have a bearing on traffic management.</P>
    <P>The dissolution of the Authority is a disappointment to many but the situation would be considerably worse if the activities undertaken by the Authority were also to be terminated.  That is not happening and careful attention has been given to preserving, in so far as is possible within existing resources, the continuation of the work in hand.</P>
    <P>It is important that the position of the chief executive on the dissolution of the <Col N="412" /> Authority be clarified today because there has been a number of misconceptions as to what he has been offered on the dissolution of the Dublin Transport Authority.  As Members heard from the Minister for Finance when he was addressing the Seanad, the Government had a commitment to the need to achieve a voluntary reduction in the number of public service employees.  The chief executive has been offered redeployment within the public sector. Initially the redeployment would involve a contract of employment with Bus Átha Cliath.  It has been confirmed to the chief executive that acceptance of that assignment would not prejudice his redeployment at the end of the assignment to an appropriate permanent post in the public sector.  It would also be open to him at the end of that assignment to avail of the public service early retirement terms should he so wish.</P>
    <P>The chief executive has also been given an assurance that he will suffer no loss of pensionable service in respect of his period of contract with Bus Átha Cliath.  I already made it clear that his pension rights with regard to the 19 or 20 years he spent working for Dublin County Council and the short time with the Dublin Transport Authority are recognisable for pension purposes.  As an alternative to redeployment it is open to the chief executive to opt for voluntary redundancy at this stage in line with the public service package.  I confirmed in writing to the chief executive yesterday the proposals put to him last week.  The relevant extract from that letter is as follows:</P>
    <P>That proposal offers you the prospect of immediate employment, coupled with written assurances that:</P>
    <P>(a)  acceptance of the assignment in question would not prejudice your redeployment at the end of the assignment to an appropriate permanent post in the public sector;</P>
    <P>(b)  it would be open to you at the end of the assignment to avail of the early retirement terms should you so <Col N="413" /> wish; and</P>
    <P>(c)  you would suffer no loss of pensionable service in respect of the period of the assignment.</P>
    <P>Nothing could be clearer than that.  I am glad to have the opportunity to put it on the record of this House.</P>
    <P>I conclude by renewing my expression of appreciation for the work of the chairman of the Dublin Transport Authority and of the members of the Authority and the staff who worked for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>My comments will be brief and rather general.  On Wednesday we discussed the Transport Bill with the Minister's junior colleague.  On that occasion we were very supportive but that is not quite the case today.  In fairness, however, it must be said that the powers which had been vested in the Dublin Transport Authority will not disappear completely since the main functions will be carried out by other bodies. That is the most important point and for that reason I am not totally opposed to the Bill, although I have certain reservations.</P>
      <P>It is, perhaps, appropriate that we are discussing this matter immediately after hearing the Minister for Finance speak about the economic state of the country. The basic reason for the dissolution of this Authority is the state of the economy and the need for cutbacks.  We must recognise that the abolition of the Dublin Transport Authority is based on this principle. The decision certainly does not take into account the need to plan for the future transportation needs of the capital city.  It must be seen as a short-term measure, and one which in the longer term will be seen to be retrograde because the amount of money to be saved is quite minimal.  In the long run no major savings will accrue to the economy as a result of the dissolution of this body.  The work will have to be carried out by some other body.  If that work is not done, the economy and the capital city will suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Transportation Consultative Commission set up in the late seventies <Col N="414" /> under the chairmanship of Professor McCormack reported on the passenger transport services in the Dublin area and recommended the setting up of the Dublin Transport Authority.  This suggestion was welcomed by everybody, including the then Minister, Deputy Albert Reynolds.  The Dublin Transport Authority were rightly seen as a body who could make a valuable contribution to solving the problem of Dublin's traffic congestion by the provision of a satisfactory urban passenger service.  Their basic task was to draw together road, bus and rail investments and to take charge in a general fashion of public transport operations and management.  It was hoped that this would rid the streets of Dublin of traffic chaos.</P>
    <P>This overall approach would have resulted in better access to the city and made it more attractive to visit.  It would also have helped to improve commercial life.  For these reasons the establishment of the Dublin Transport Authority was widely welcomed.  I realise that the Dublin Transport Authority were not in control of the situation for long enough to achieve these objectives but at least a start had been made and good work was being done.  Enormous benefit would have accrued to the capital city by their continued existence.</P>
    <P>Anyone commenting on Dublin today will remark on the major developments on the outskirts of the city, the unplanned road network, the still unplanned road and rail network and the general level of chaos.  Regular commuters in the city have probably become so accustomed to the traffic queues, the potholes and the road works that they do not bother to complain any longer.  They have become immune to these chaotic conditions. Tourists and people like me who visit the city once a week or less frequently must be appalled by these conditions.  We do not seem to have an integrated plan to enable the free flow of traffic and easier access to the city centre.  Somebody must take overall charge if the necessary changes are to be brought about.  The Minister has stated that the functions of the Dublin Transport Authority will be given to <Col N="415" /> other groupings.  I am sure they will all do their utmost but there must be a parent body and some sort of integrated plan.</P>
    <P>On busy days like this the streets of Dublin resemble an obstacle course.  Not only is this harmful to the image of Dublin but it is doing irreparable damage to the business life of the city.  A speedy solution must be a priority.  The Dublin Transport Authority would have helped tremendously in the long run and with their disappearance we are left with a problem. I realise, of course, that the search for solutions will not stop and that the Department of the Environment, the corporation, CIE and the Garda Síochána will all have their say in what needs to be done.  I would hope they would coordinate all their views, plans and proposals. Otherwise we will be left with another network of plans and a resultant mess.  What has happened to date has been the result of bad management.  It is most unacceptable.  We are left in that position and we must endeavour to solve it.  I hope the bodies which will take over the role of the extinct Dublin Transport Authority, or those functions which will still be catered for, will bear this in mind when formulating their relevant proposals. Were the Dublin Transport Authority being abolished in, say, two or three years' time rather than today, we would be looking back on a certain amount of work done by them of which everybody would be aware.  Unfortunately the Dublin Transport Authority has been in existence for a year only in which time they have not been able to take the requisite action.  Nonetheless within that short space of time they have worked keenly and effectively, their results just about ready to come on stream.  For instance there are their worthwhile plans for the tow-away service.  Something must be done, on a regular basis to remove illegally and dangerously-parked cars.  At present there appears to be a total disregard for all parking laws.  Perhaps it is not as bad in Dublin city where there are traffic wardens.  The Irish mentality for parking one's car when and where one wants seems to prevail and is causing <Col N="416" /> many problems.  What we are doing to try to stop it is not sufficient.  More action has to be taken and in this respect the Dublin Transport Authority plans were worthwhile, and could have yielded much necessary finance to the Authority.  This is one area where we can seriously question the economics of dissolving that body.  There is a section in London city, a minor section only &mdash; approximately the size of the area between the two canals in Dublin &mdash; where there is a clamping service allowed by law which last year alone yielded a total revenue of £3 million from fines collected as a result of illegal parking.  I know that is something the Dublin Transport Authority were considering.  I would hope that whatever group is responsible for that area in the future will reconsider it.  If there is money to be collected from the illegal parking of cars that must be collected. One needs only to walk down any street where parking meters are operative to see three out of every four meters showing that the allowable parking time has elapsed, when a warden has not appeared so that people are not paying the fines they should.  I know there are times when we all welcome the fact that a warden may not have arrived on the scene and caught us.  However, in the long run we all suffer as a result of this illegal parking.  We all suffer financially, having to make up the deficit to the relevant authorities.</P>
    <P>The message must be: let those who break the law pay.  The present system is not sufficiently strict in that respect; there cannot be a warden on every corner of every street watching the metering system.  That is why I contend that the clamping system I suggested will have to be considered.</P>
    <P>There was mention of the traffic management schemes which will come into being as a result of the dissolution of the Dublin Transport Authority.  I note from the 1988 Estimates that this scheme is estimated to cost £165,000.  I presume these schemes will cost a couple of hundred thousand pounds annually, clearly demonstrating that the economies resulting from the dissolution of the Dublin <Col N="417" /> Transport Authority are questionable. However I would not worry about who does the work as long as it is undertaken. It is my opinion that it would have been better to have had an overall, parent body in charge of or responsible for any planning schemes.  If there are three or four groups all working in different directions, all pulling against each other inevitably nothing is done.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I may pose a few questions to the Minister on some of the sections of the Bill.  I would welcome his assurance that additional powers will be given to local authorities.  This Bill comes at a time where almost every power they had is being taken from them.  I note that the whole role of local authorities has been questioned today.  I know that the additional powers they will be granted as a result of the dissolution of the Dublin Transport Authority and the transfer of some of their powers to local authorities will not be tremendous but at least will constitute a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>While I know this would be more proper to the Minister for the Environment, there is the ridiculous position obtaining at present in all local authorities whereby they cannot move a &ldquo;go slow&rdquo; sign, a speed limit sign or change a speed limit sign without the sanction of the Minister for the Environment.  That is a typical example of what is so dreadfully wrong with local government today, that the people on the ground &mdash; who know the problems &mdash; do not have power to take immediate action.  Perhaps the Minister would pass on my comments to his colleague, the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>I see my colleague Senator Joe Doyle waiting to speak.  I am sure he will be able to give a better view of matters from the urban or Dublin Corporation viewpoint. At the end of the day they are the people who will be concerned most with the implementation of the provisions of this Bill.  All of us who travel in and out of the city infrequently cannot but be struck by the bad traffic planning which has attained over many years leaving potholes, traffic jams and many other hazards for motorists.  With these powers <Col N="418" /> being given to somebody else it is hoped that action will be taken, rendering our streets more navigable and the city be more attractive to visit.  It is to be hoped also that the commercial life of the city will be enhanced.  If that happens nobody will question the wisdom of the Minister's decision.</P>
    <P>I might revert to the questionable economy entailed in the decision to abolish the Dublin Transport Authority.  The Minister rightly remarks that it is all the savings, including the small ones, which collectively will make the Exchequer savings worthwhile.  I agree with him there.  Nonetheless, before deciding to supplant any body or effect even a small saving in any area one needs to give the matter serious consideration.  I presume such serious consideration was given to the dissolution of the Dublin Transport Authority.  If the full facts were presented to ten objective people together with a list of the potential advantages and disadvantages of doing so probably nine of those ten people would have requested or opted for the Dublin Transport Authority remaining in being.  However if that one out of the ten has to be the Minister, I hope he has taken the right decision.  In principle I will not oppose his decision because of our understanding that the work promised will be undertaken by somebody else.  While I am not altogether happy with the proposals contained in this Bill I will not oppose it at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief.  The most important part of the provisions of this Bill is that the main function of the Dublin Transport Authority will be relocated. I agree with some of the sentiments expressed by the previous Senator.  I have to take issue with him on others, because duplication in business cannot be tolerated or afforded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance gave us an excellent account of the Government's stewardship for the past nine months and the serious problems that confronted them.  They must be commended for the way they have handled these problems in the past nine months.  Everything the Minister said in the House this morning <Col N="419" /> is taken into account in this Bill and the question of being able to afford anything before bringing in legislation.  It is the reality of the finances in the country today that brings this Bill before us.  I am particularly pleased that the task force is being brought back.  It was a previous Minister, Deputy Albert Reynolds, who implemented the bus lanes.  There were doubting Thomases at the time but it was as a direct result of the task force recommendation that this was implemented.  I also welcome the further suggestion that there should be extra facilities for buses to speed up transport, including cycle lanes and so on.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker also mentioned that it is difficult to travel through Dublin because of the amount of road works being undertaken, particularly in the past 12 months because of activities by Dublin Gas.  The problems with gas are very serious and we saw a very serious accident on the first day of this year which resulted in loss of life.  No Government, Minister or local authority can be blamed for the situation that exists today.  I mention it because I know that 90 per cent of traffic problems are created by these small roadworks resulting from problems with gas.</P>
    <P>As a person from the country who travels in the city three or four days every week I would say that it was a good idea to reverse the traffic on either side of the Liffey making it easier to get in from the west, and the Cathaoirleach and the Minister being also from the west will also appreciate this.  There were genuine efforts to change the transport system and they have been quite successful.  I remember taking half an hour to get from O'Connell Street to the station, but now one can travel freely on Friday evenings or on any other evening and get there in about ten or 12 minutes.  While there are many problems in the city, many positive changes are being implemented.  I want to compliment all the people who are involved.</P>
    <P>There is another problem, the problem of people indiscriminately parking their cars.  The roads which were originally built to take about 30 per cent of the <Col N="420" /> present volume of traffic are now being used as car parks by many people.  We have an efficient warden system in our city.  Quite often they are too efficient for our liking.  But private and public car parks are increasing all the time and when one gets a fine of £50, as has happened to me on one or two occasions, and several fines of £10, one changes one's attitude and puts one's car in a private or public car park.  It is a matter of educating people.  This is improving every day.  The movement of traffic through the city has improved beyond expectation from what it was two or three years ago.</P>
    <P>I am very proud of Dublin as our capital city.  It has a lot of character.  Having visited many European cities, I know Dublin is as good as any.  We are fortunate to have a magnificant main street in O'Connell Street, the width of which lends it enormous potential as a tourist attraction.  Any country in the world would be delighted to have its magnificent architecture.  Being built on a river means there are many other pluses that could be looked into in the future. We have also the beautiful Garden of Remembrance at one end of O'Connell Street, many beautiful museums, Trinity College, City Hall and the Mansion House which are great tourist attractions. On the sporting scene we have Croke Park, Lansdowne Road, Dalymount Park and the RDS.  As a city of one million people, Dublin has enormous potential and a great amount to offer. We should be looking at how best to promote Dublin and help the city.  We have our disadvantages but we must look at our advantages.</P>
    <P>We have all made submissions on this Bill in regard to various aspects but the biggest success, as far as I am concerned, is Aer Rianta with their shopping complex at Dublin Airport making a magnificent profit, and they should be highly commended.  <i>The Irish Press</i> does not come into this House very often, but when it does it speaks very negatively about the upper House of the Oireachtas. The banner headline the day before yesterday that the duty free shops at Dublin Airport were ripping people off was a <Col N="421" /> scandal.  That newspaper owes Aer Rianta an apology.  Not alone are they the cheapest in Ireland, but the cheapest in Europe.</P>

      <P>While we are on transport and while the Minister is in the House I would like to say that the bus services and train services in our capital city could take a leaf out of Aer Rianta's book.  They have magnificent geographical locations at each end of our city and they could give a magnificent service. Many of our stations are beautiful buildings and their location provides a great opportunity for them to grasp the nettle and give a service which is not there at the moment and make a lot of profit.</P>
      <P>I welcome the extra powers given to the local authorities.  The local authorities are all too frequently stripped of their powers.  I look forward to the report of the Minister for the Environment which is due to be published next spring.  I do not intend to delay the House any longer except to say that because of finance this Bill is before us today.  Because of the problems with which the Minister was confronted he is taking on the job and the main functions which will be relocated among the various sectors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister at the end of his contribution said that people would be disappointed with the dissolution of the Dublin Transport Authority.  They will be very disappointed.  I had the privilege of speaking in another House at the birth of this Bill.  I have the sad duty today to speak on the obsequies of the Bill.  It strikes me as extraordinary that we bring in an Act one year and dissolve it the next year, saying it is all in an effort to save the taxpayers money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer back to the history of the Dublin Transport Authority.  It was set up, as Senator Bradford said, after a report commissioned by the then Minister for Tourism into the passenger transport services in the Dublin area.  That Commission produced a very fine report <Col N="422" /> in 1980.  They set out the composition of a Dublin Transport Authority which was needed to deal with the traffic problems in the city.  If we are talking about saving the taxpayers money we must also ask what this report cost, what it cost the Houses of the Oireachtas and the officials concerned in terms of the time spent debating the Dublin Transport Authority Bill in 1986.  It is only then we can calculate the real saving.  The Minister said that the savings eventually would be £500,000.</P>
    <P>While I accept the Government's role in cutting back on public expenditure, I am amazed that they have dissolved so many small bodies such as the Dublin Transport Authority.  An Foras Forbartha and the National Social Service Board.  These were organisations which gave a very effective service to the community, the services which were cost effective, to use a word which was used frequently when the present Government were in Opposition.</P>
    <P>If the Dublin Transport Authority was allowed to continue it would bring tremendous savings in the transport area to the city of Dublin.  For that reason I regret that it will be dissolved.  I am a member of Dublin Corporation and if I was asked to categorise the three areas from which I received most representation since I was elected, I would say, housing, traffic and planning.  Housing is no longer a problem, we can meet the needs of our citizens, though we may not be able to meet the needs of the homeless yet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The major problem now facing public representatives in Dublin &mdash; and I am sure the Minister will be interested to hear this &mdash; is that we have <Col N="423" /> extra traffic.  People who have their business in the city, people who live in the city, and people who come into the city all have to deal with this problem.  The Dublin Transport Authority would have helped in some way and was dealing in a positive way with this problem.</P>
      <P>After the report became available the Minister set up a task force.  The Bill was produced, debated and passed by both Houses.  Today were are in the position of dissolving the Authority set up by that Act.  I will refer again to the task force. Sometimes people charge the Government with U-turns.  That is a fairly good U-turn in the non political sense, that we are back to where we started.  It is a negative step and one in the wrong direction.</P>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for the tribute he paid to the chairman, the members and the chief executive of the Dublin Transport Authority.  There are many issues affecting Dublin which are unique to other areas.  A Senator mentioned a problem relating to roadworks. We have a number of utility companies who have a statutory right to open the roads, for example, the Gas Company the ESB, and Bord Telecom.  They carry out these works which at times cause problems.  The Dublin Transport Authority were coming to a position where they would help to co-ordinate the work of these companies.</P>
      <P>Senator Cassidy spoke about the elimination of duplication.  I think what we are doing will cause further duplication. If the Dublin Transport Authority was allowed to continue it would have eliminated duplication.  In a local authority like Dublin, Dublin Corporation are the roads authority, the Garda are the traffic authority, and it is very difficult to get measures through, but the Dublin Transport Authority were helping in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see that some of the positive aspects of the Dublin Transport Authority will now be spread throughout the rest of the country.  One recent change in the by-law, which is of great benefit to the citizens of Dublin, is in relation to residential parking.  The first <Col N="424" /> residential parking scheme in Dublin &mdash; and probably in the country &mdash; will come into effect early next month at Dart-mouth Square.  There is a problem for people living in residential areas on the verge of the inner city in that they are unable to park cars outside or near their own houses.  When they return from taking their children to school in the morning they find that their space has been taken by some person commuting to the city.  We now have a system where people living in an area, by paying a fee per year, will be able to park within a certain distance from their house and be protected in doing so.</P>
    <P>I will tell the House a very interesting story because this problem affects a number of areas on the outskirts of the city.  In the Portobello area we have many lovely small houses.  A lady came to me one day and said that a gentleman had parked his car outside her house, opened the boot and taken out a suitcase.  She said that the car remained there for two weeks until the man returned with a suitcase and a lovely sun tan.  Obviously, he did not want to pay the fee for parking space at Dublin Airport.  Instead he decided to park his car outside her house. That is the situation we have now.  It is one of the major achievements of the near defunct Dublin Transport Authority that we will have these designated areas for the Minister's support in encouraging as many designated areas as possible around the city.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech dealt with the question of busways and the designation of the old Tallaght line as a busway.  I have been hearing that for a long time and I hope it will soon come into effect.  We have been very unfair to the people who live in west Dublin &mdash; in the Tallaght area &mdash; in the kind of accommodation and provisions that we provide for them.  This busway from Tallaght is a necessity.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Dublin Transport Authority are being dissolved.  As I said earlier, they played a most important role at very little cost to the Exchequer, and in the long term there would have been savings for the Exchequer.  I do not <Col N="425" /> understand why the Government have decided to abolish a number of these small boards which were effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the abolition of the Dublin Transport Authority.  A good deal of what the Minister has said in his speech which I have just read indicates there is a need for a centralised transport authority in Dublin.  This has been the experience of other capital cities and nobody who is a frequent visitor to the city or indeed, who like myself lives in the centre of the city, can doubt that the transport network is a very serious problem.  It is very appropriate that the Minister is Minister both for Tourism and Transport because the traffic situation in Dublin has a serious implication for tourism.  In particular Bus Éireann, is seriously negligent in the provision of its services.  I am not speaking this time about inadequacies of timetabling but about the appalling record with regard to the servicing of the motor vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot think of many other European capitals that would permit with impunity the levels of pollution for which CIE are responsible in central Dublin.  I note this is the kind of area on which the Dublin Transport Authority might have had some kind of persuasive impact.  I look to the Minister to provide some reassurance to the House that this very irksome environmental problem will be tackled by the task force to which it is now the Government's intention apparently to return.  It is a serious problem.  It is a health problem particularly in view of the kind of motor fuels that are employed which have a higher noxious content than that permitted in many other jurisdictions. It is regrettable because the amounts of money involved in continuing with the Dublin Transport Authority are comparatively small.  The Government recognise in the person of the Minister that the measure is necessary.  He said that as a consequence of a Government decision no funds would be available for the Authority from next year and he then itemised the amount of grants involved £300,000 and £365,000.  This is obviously an identified need so that although the <Col N="426" /> amount of moneys involved is small, I am left wondering how the obvious shortfall in services that were earlier perceived as necessary will be met by returning to the <i>status quo ante</i> which is what this Bill will clearly mean for the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I am concerned because I thought the Dublin Transport Authority would lead to greater efficiency and a more rational approach to the very vexed problem of transport in our cities.  The core of the city is that of an 18th century city whose thoroughfares were not designed for heavy road vehicles or even for the kind of public transport that we have so there is a clear and acknowledged problem of which, of course, the Minister would be aware and Senator Doyle will also be aware as a member of Dublin Corporation. The great difficulties the officials of the corporation already experience in traffic management, and the conflict with which they have been brought into with citizens of Dublin who wish to resist attempts to impose a particular road engineering solution of the matter of Dublin represent a very clear problem.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Transport Authority was, as I said, part of an overall response, and I regret the Government appear to be dismantling this overall response because we have had also greatly to my regret the dissolution of the Metropolitan Streets Commission.  It did seem that earlier on there was a clear, consistent and coherent attempt to address the problems of our capital city.  We have the Custom House Docks development site on which I congratulate the Government.  I wish them well on it, but it is only part of a jigsaw puzzle.  You have the corporation's advancing attempts to pedestrianise sections of the city particularly the Grafton Street, Temple Bar, Mary Street areas.  You then had set in place a scheme to help join them with the designated areas, the areas under the influence of the Metropolitan Streets Commission.  That has been removed.</P>
    <P>We now have another element of the strategy removed and that is the Dublin Transport Authority.  I regret this, as I <Col N="427" /> regretted the dissolution of the Metropolitan Streets Commission.  I feel also some concern at the Minister's statement that what is involved here is not a simple revocation of the Dublin Transport Authority Act.  He says there is a need to provide continuity for most of the functions contained in that Act and these are being transferred to the Garda Síochána and local authorities.  That is a matter of concern to me, particularly in the light of recent tragic developments which, luckily, had eventually a positive outcome such as in the O'Grady kidnapping where we were repeatedly informed that the Garda were being asked to undertake functions that were not strictly those of policing and were being expected to take on additional functions of various kinds. The already overstretched police force, the Garda were pushed almost to breaking point and it worries me that envisaged in the Bill is a further transfer of responsibility to an already overburdened section of our public service.  I hope this will not lead to any real problems for the Garda but I suspect that it may very well do so.</P>
    <P>There is a clear need for some direct responsibility for road maintenance and roadworks.  I speak with some feeling because I am a resident of the inner city and I know the way in which it is pockmarked so that the flow of traffic is considerably impeded by repeated and unnecessary roadworks.  I may be incorrect in this but I understood that the Dublin Transport Authority would have at least some function in regard to the regularisation of these roadworks.  I am particularly heated on the matter because I went down one of those unscheduled roadworks and rearranged my nose about six months ago.  This is an experience that is occurring with increasing frequency for the unwary citizens of Dublin.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of residential parking, this is an experiment that is being tried in other cities in Europe and also in some of our provincial cities. It is something I think we would all welcome and I hope that the Minister can be persuaded not to close off this area of experimentation merely because of the <Col N="428" /> dissolution of the Dublin Transport Authority.  Again, I can speak from personal experience.  I noted that my good friend and colleague, Senator Doyle, referred to areas on the fringes of the inner ciy.  Well, I can speak with even greater fervour, coming from the heart of the inner city where it is virtually impossible to park within a radius of half a mile of your house if you shift your car during the day.</P>
    <P>I feel that not sufficient notice is taken of the fact that there are also residential communities inside the inner city who also have transport needs and may well need, for professional or family reasons, to have a car.  Areas like that in which I live have already done their duty towards the public by having space made available in the immediate vicinity for a considerable number of multi-storey car parks.  It seems an abuse of our residential status that, in addition to having buildings demolished and replaced by huge multi-storey car parks, we also have surplus car parks and on top of that again we cannot even park outside our own front doors.  I would like the Minister to attempt some solution to this admittedly very difficult problem.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Doyle, I certainly welcome the proposed development of a Tallaght busway.  It seems that the citizens of Tallaght, which is now a very large town &mdash; I understand about the size of Cork&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is a very large conurbation and yet they still lack some of the essential services and the provision of a busway is a good first step.  However, I would like the Minister to be a bit more adventurous.  May I suggest to him that it would perhaps be worth looking at the possibility of developing a proper underground railway network for Dublin, even on a rudamentary basis?  I am sorry to see him shaking his head, but I say this because it is noticeable that a small and comparatively insignificant city in the North of England, Newcastle, can embark upon the development&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose I will have to withdraw that, in deference to the Geordie sensibility, but in the overall context of the neighbouring island it is not a major industrial centre.  It is not even a very large city.  I congratulate them on their vision in putting in place a new underground railway network.  Admittedly, it is fairly rudimentary, but it would seem that it still should be possible to investigate this for the city of Dublin for a number of reasons.</P>
      <P>If an underground network were set in place, even a rudimentary one, it would immensely relieve the traffic congestion. People would be encouraged not to bring their cars right into the centre of the city. In terms of economic planning, it would also be a very good idea because my belief is that very considerable capital grants could be extracted from the European Community in order to assist in this development.  I may be incorrect, but I believe that up to 50 per cent capital funding would be available for such a project.  It is a very expensive project.</P>
      <P>I am not one of those who deprecates what is known as the begging bowl syndrome. That is a kind of reverse inferiority complex.  We signed the Single European Act, we were good Europeans. Part of the whole philosophy which guided us towards signing that instrument was that we were told yet again that central funds would be allocated outwards to the less advantaged areas.  I feel no shame in putting out a receptacle &mdash; I will not call it a begging bowl &mdash; and demanding our just allocation of funds for a city which is unique in the European Community in being the only capital city which is itself a deprived area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The impact of undertaking this major infrastructural work would, first of all, relieve the traffic situation and return the city to something like its original beauty. It would certainly cleanse the atmosphere, but probably even more importantly, it would lead to a significant increase in employment and investment in ancillary industries.  It seems tragic that <Col N="430" /> we are once again going to be exporting our young workforce to build the new Channel tunnel, as they have already been involved in the building of various extensions to the London metropolitan underground railway system.  Why, if there is any possibility at all, can we not use an imaginative transport policy for the city of Dublin to bring some of these people home, to employ some of our young people?  Look at the impact on the carriage building operation that we still have in some form at Inchicore in Dublin. There would be the possibility of major contracts for this section of Irish industry. So, although it may appear to be a pipedream, I would urge the Minister, for what I consider to be sound economic reasons, not to close his mind totally to the ultimate possibility of the development of some form of underground rail link that can be brought into being in the future.</P>
    <P>I regret to be negative on an item of Government legislation.  Some aspects of this proposed legislation certainly will have my support, but I must deplore the dissolution of the Dublin Transport Authority.  I saw it, not as an item merely in and of itself but as part of a coherent strategy for traffic management in the city of Dublin, along with other elements which the Government have similarly and for equally mysterious reasons dissolved &mdash; although ironically, as the Minister has so graciously done, they have thanked for their professional services the very people whose role they were abolishing.  I may say that, in my experience and involvement in public life, I would prefer to be attacked and get what I want done rather than have the agency dissolved and be thanked simultaneously. So, it is with regret that I give a very mixed welcome to the Minister's legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words on this topic.  While the Bill is not 100 per cent right, that does not necessarily mean that it is 100 per cent wrong. From the point of view of the Labour Party and their adherence to their policies <Col N="431" /> with regard to the question of a comprehensive transport policy, there are things in the Bill that are objectionable and, therefore, it is necessary for us to vote against it.</P>
      <P>One of the problems we see is that the country itself has never had anything resembling a cohesive transport policy which brought railways, docks, roads, farms, etc. under the one umbrella. Because we have never had that type of transport policy, it has never been possible to see whether a policy had any sort of reasonable credit balance in the sense of looking after many things that should, in fact, come under transport. The Dublin Transport Authority was one of the good things that came out of an effort at having some semblance of a transport policy and it was a good deal. At the time it was introduced in 1974 by Dublin Corporation, I believe the situation was that it had all-party support and over the past ten years it has proved itself very substantially, indeed.</P>
      <P>Parts of Meath can now be described as greater Dublin, as can for example Celbridge in County Kildare and also north Wicklow.  We must consider the extent of the roads, highways and byways which now make up Dublin, as distinct from when the Authority was set up. In effect, by splitting the Authority into three different areas instead of having one body working in unity on the whole question of the transport situation and the problems that are relevant to it, the work is very likely to be duplicated.  On the one hand, there is the argument that you must rationalise in certain sections, such as the Garda Síochána and others, and, at the same time, you start to unload work on them.  That does not add up.  If something has to be rationalised it should be rationalised on the basis of the way it exists.  We should not take bits and pieces from some bodies and merge them into one and should not add to inefficiencies which already exist to confuse things further. Therefore, we have to treat the economic arguments with a certain amount of scepticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many economic advisers <Col N="432" /> who promote fiscal rectitude to the point where savings become more important than safety.  We have seen evidence of this on many occasions in the past.  The Dublin Transport Authority worked very well for ten years, yet suddenly somebody has decided that they had to go.  As a result all the good work and all of the initiatives undertaken will be undone. The Minister does not deny that their work was constructive and I cannot see the reasoning behind this decision particularly considering the other point I made in regard to the merging of bodies which may not be very efficiently run.</P>
    <P>We do not think this is a good idea. The public are entitled to ask what are the economic advisers trying to achieve. Are they trying to achieve savings at the expense of safety?  Will the splitting up of this Authority and the scattering of responsibility not only create greater hazards but also result in a duplication of work?  The trade union movement and other bodies are regularly lectured on the need to rationalise and on the need for them to become more efficient; yet, we are not embarking on a course of action which will lead us in that direction.</P>
    <P>There is no point in flogging this point because it would be superfluous to repeat what has already been said by the Labour Party Members in the Dáil.  I cannot accept the economic argument which has been put forward which is that savings are going to be effected or, as the Minister said in his speech, that this will be a more efficient method of dealing with transport.  Therefore, I oppose the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Bradford, who spoke first in the debate, accepted the basic philosophy which lies behind the introduction of this Bill to abolish the Dublin Transport Authority.  He accepted that there is a need to cut back public expenditure.  He indicated that although the amount involved in this case is minimal he believed the capital city would suffer <Col N="433" /> unduly as a result.  I know the history of the evolution of the idea to set up the Dublin Transport Authority very well and the only point I can make is the one I made at the outset which is that the Government in examining minutely all the areas of public expenditure had to make up their minds as to where expenditure could be cut.  This is one area where a Government decision was taken and, while I admit that the sum involved is not huge, I will quote again the old Scottish proverb, &ldquo;Many a mickle makes a muckle&rdquo;.  If you avoid the small sums, there will not be a great saving in the end.</P>
    <P>Professor McCormack has carried out a lot of work into this.  The Transport Consultative Commission which was set up by the then Minister, Deputy Faulkner, reported to Deputy Reynolds. When I was Minister in 1982 I prepared the Dublin Transport Authority Bill which, incidentally, was a very strong Bill.  That Bill was well debated in the Dáil and my main complaint was that it was not strong enough.  I put together a much stronger Dublin Transport Authority Bill and expressed my disappointment that there was not enough muscle in the actual Bill.  To use the cliche, circumstances alter cases and financial circumstances alter cases more deeply than any other circumstances. That is why I am before this House today.</P>
    <P>Senator Bradford referred to the problem of dug up streets.  This is a problem in all towns but particularly in our capital city.  The unfortunate gas debacle has added to our worries and considerable frustration has been felt about the activities of Telecom Éireann, the Gas Company and the ESB who at different times, quite close to each other, have ripped up streets and roads.  Sometimes, if they have not already been threatened by citizens, they have damaged trees that have been nurtured to beautify the city.  The Bill gives local authorities throughout the country more powers than they have had in a wider range of areas, the Dublin Transport Authority Bill only deals with the city of Dublin.  I appeal to all who are involved in local government, to <Col N="434" /> members of local authorities in particular, to exercise the undoubted strength they have in this regard.  There have been complaints in the past that local authorities have not exercised the powers they have and that they have not kept a fire lighting under the officials, engineers and all other people responsible. It is not easy if one is involved only on a part time basis in local government to keep an eye on everything but there is a very strong obligation on members of local authorities to do this.  In my own area of tourism, the powers in regard to water pollution should be exercised.  In an area people can find it hard to be totally objective in their judgments or to resist the pressures that may be brought to bear on them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Very often it is not a question of money but rather a matter of reporting it to the authorities who should take cognisance of it.  We must not forget that within our local authorities there is a battalion of highly qualified technical staff.  Some people down the country complain that there are more technical people than are needed in individual cases.  I should like to make the point that as a result of the Bill local authorities will have extended powers and I appeal to the members of those bodies to exercise them and to keep an eye on what is going on.</P>
      <P>Clamping was mentioned by some Senators.  The Bill indicates where the powers of clamping of vehicles should be exercised.  There was a little weakness in the original Bill which could cause traffic chaos.  We have removed that.  I should like to call the attention of the House to section 9, a very substantive provision. Senator Bradford made a very good point &mdash; it was by nature an apophthegm &mdash; in that he said he would not worry who would do the job provided the job was done.  That is the theme of my speech. The Senator indicated, like other Members, that giving local authorities more power was an exercise in the strengthening of democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="435" /> Senator Cassidy spoke at some length in commendation of the idea of bus lanes. He referred to the original launch of them in dramatic fashion.  I agree with him that the gas problem which has defaced the city of Dublin to a certain extent is an exceptional case.  The point has been made by a number of people in another place that many local authorities, particularly those responsible for ancient cities, do not know where the conduits or the various pipes are.  They do not have proper mapping.  In modern times that deficiency is being made up and local authorities will gradually, by exploration, have to find out all about what is under their cities.  Senator Cassidy also referred to the improvement in traffic movement, east/west, along the quays.  I agree with him that we have a beautiful capital city, that it has wonderful amenities and that we should look after them.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle said he was a Member of the Dáil at the birth of the Dublin Transport Authority and it saddened him to be present at the obsequies of that authority.  At least I am leaving him some offspring which he can make use of on his local authority to try to remedy some of the deficiencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been very slight infant mortality in any legislation I have been involved in.  Senator Doyle maintained that the Authority would have been cost effective if it had been left alone.  The figures in the Book of Estimates, and in my Second Stage speech, indicate that the amount of money was small but there is no way that the Dublin Transport Authority could carry out their duties within that budget not merely when it was fully staffed with 20 but as time went on because they would have to buy in the services of consultants.  All Members will be aware that those services do not come cheap any more.  The Senator went on to say that as a member of a local authority he received representations in regard to three matters <Col N="436" /> but that now traffic was a paramount one. I am glad to say that as a conscientious member of the corporation he now has some extra powers coming from this Bill &mdash; adventitiously, in a way &mdash; and I am sure he will utilise them.</P>
      <P>In regard to road works I should like to say that by comparison with the position which existed prior to the establishment of the Dublin Transport Authority the statutory powers available for reducing traffic congestion in the Dublin area will now be greater.  This arises from the fact that not only are functions previously exercised by the Garda Commissioner, <i>exempli gratia</i> functions relating to control of traffic, pedestrians, parking, traffic signals and so on, being transferred back to him from the Dublin Transport Authority but that some additional enabling functions vested in the Authority are being transferred to the local authorities. Those additional functions relate to the regulation of access to and egress from construction sites &mdash; this will become increasingly important, I hope, as we have a great upsurge in development in Dublin city taking the Custom House Dock scene and other areas into account &mdash; construction of bollards and ramps, use of wheel clamps and control of road works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The power to issue directions to control and co-ordinate road works is being transferred to local authorities.  Some powers in the Bill can be applied to any part of the country.  Hitherto the Dublin Transport Authority only covered the Dublin area.  This can be done by regulations and are not limited to the Dublin area as were the provisions of the 1986 Act.  The power to issue directions has been strengthened by specifying a number of important additional matters which can be covered by a direction, including standards for the reinstatement of roads.  Some times I wonder seeing that we have such highly technical qualified engineers and so on in our local authorities, why some of the reinstatement jobs are so badly done.  The best way to find out is to cycle around some of the streets of Dublin.  If one is driving around in a car with good suspension one would <Col N="437" /> not feel it half as effectively as one would if using an ordinary push bicycle.  That is the best way to test the skills of our civil engineers.</P>
    <P>There can be requirements as to the provision of securage, to ensuring that roads are properly reinstated and also in relation to traffic control.  Flexibility is also being given to issue general directions or directions relating to specific walks.  The exemptions relating to emergency road works are being tightened.  In fact, the excuse of road works being emergency works will no longer be valid for prolonging the work.  The powers to make regulations are being widened. Specific statutory obligations are being placed on local authorities in relation to carrying out their own works.  That will give the House some idea of the additional powers available to local authorities in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Senator also mentioned the residential parking system.  This was mentioned by Senator Norris.  I agree with both Members that it is sad that people can be excluded from getting near their own homes.  The position is even more serious if a professional person, such as a doctor, needs to get to his or her car quickly.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris said there was a need for central authority and he did not agree with the abolition of the Dublin Transport Authority.  He instanced tourism as an area that would suffer as a result of its abolition.  The Senator was critical of the servicing of vehicles by CIE.  The company have a system of servicing their vehicles and there is an obligation on them to do so.  The Senator also dealt with the question of pollution.  He said we allowed a higher noxious content in our vehicle fuel than other countries.  I should like to tell the House that the European Council of Ministers for Transport, which takes in more countries than the EC, are working hard on the issue of lead content in petrol.  The Minister for Transport of the Federal Republic of Germany is conducting a missionary campaign in that regard.  We have lower lead petrol for sale at a few outlets in Ireland and the objective is to extend that <Col N="438" /> number.  I have no doubt that they will come when an EC directive will force us to have lead free petrol available exclusively on our market.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris stressed that Dublin City &mdash; he boasted proudly that he lives in Dublin's inner city &mdash; was an 18th century city and that this caused problems in that as an 18th century city it has to deal with 20th century traffic problems. He would have greater problems were it not that the planners of the 18th century &mdash; I refer in particular to the account of the architectural development of Dublin in Maurice Craig's history of the architecture of Dublin &mdash; planned those quays as methods of ingress and egress to and from the city.  Senator Cassidy referred to them and how the reorganisation of traffic on them has made movement east-west and west-east so much easier.  He regretted the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission's demise as well, but that does not come under my brief.</P>
    <P>He thought we were conferring back powers to the Garda and that they were over-stretched already.  The Dublin Transport Authority are only a very short time in existence, and sections of the Garda involved in this area had developed training and expertise in it over the years and, no doubt, we will be able to call on those again.</P>
    <P>The Senator made an appeal, which has been made on ideological and other grounds several times already, for the provision of an underground system in Dublin.  I was going to say: &ldquo;Come the millennium and this we might be able to do,&rdquo; but that is &ldquo;millennium&rdquo; in a different sense.  The estimates at the moment for the type of system advocated is £460 million.  Can you imagine me walking up to Deputy MacSharry, Minister for Finance, and saying: &ldquo;Ray, do you think you would be able to give me £460 million until I get this underground system and the other rail links to Tallaght, Clondalkin and so on going?&rdquo;  We simply cannot do it.  Financially we cannot do it.  For that reason I made a decision that CIE were to concentrate <Col N="439" /> their traffic development plans on the busways and diesel operated rail links.</P>
    <P>The Senator said, I thought rather innocently, that there might be substantial funds from Europe.  At the end of the 8 December meeting when we agreed the air package at the Council of Ministers in Brussels we started in to deal with, among other things, international road haulage and an infrastructure fund for the making of roads.  It is an <i>ad hoc</i> fund because a real fund has never been established.  We spent several hours that evening debating it.  On 16 December another meeting of the Council of Ministers meant £2 million to us, not £190 million, not 50 per cent; it meant £2 million to us.  We came away with nothing. No decision was taken.  It was blocked by other states including our neighbours to the east.  The Senator made a plea for an ultimate possibility of having an underground system.  There is always an ultimate possibility.  It is a philosophic term, but that is very far down the line.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte referred to the serious problem of conurbation.  He said that parts of County Meath can now be regarded as part of greater Dublin.  I could not agree more.  Blanchardstown causes me a great deal of trouble when I am trying to get away to &mdash; I was going to say to more civilised areas &mdash; my constituency at weekends.  There is a dreadful bottleneck there.  I accept there are serious problems there and in other surburban areas.  Senator Harte would not accept the economic argument and I would claim no more validity for it than a Scotsman does for the proverb quoted twice already, &ldquo;Many a mickle makes a muckle&rdquo;.  If you add them all together we are saving in the public interest and cutting down on public expenditure in the light of what the Minister for Finance has been talking about.  He has to tackle between £25 billion and £26 billion of a national debt.  At 10 per cent interest that is £2.5 billion or £2.6 billion per annum we have to pay.  That is the area we are attacking mainly I thank the Senators for their contributions to the debate.</P>

      <P>This is the most devastating section that could be in any Bill because the words are so definitive, &ldquo;the Authority is hereby dissolved.&rdquo;  This brings into focus the whole concept of what the Minister is trying to do in this Bill.  He agreed with my colleague, Senator <Col N="441" /> Harte, that the amount of money involved is small, but if you add the Authority to An Foras Talúntais, An Foras Forbartha, the National Social Service Board, and the smaller organisations which are fundamental to local democracy, the Minister's policy seems to be that the end justifies the means.  The unfortunate Dublin Transport Authority is included in that conglomeration of groups.  There is no real economic reason for abolishing this body, but if you add enough of them together, maybe there is a reason.  I have to oppose the section.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister tell me what plans, if any, the Department have for the existing staff of the Authority?  I am thinking of the people who were given certain commitments on their appointment, people with whom the State had a contract of service.  I saw nothing in the Bill to cover these people.  I am thinking of the Chief Executive, Mr. Phil Murray, and others. What future has the Minister or his Department for these committed people in the public sector?  Will they be offered the same kind of voluntary redundancy that the Minister's colleague, the dreaded Minister for Finance had offered other public service employees?  We are living in fear and dread of approaching Deputy MacSharry about anything.</P>

      <P>I honestly thought <Col N="446" /> it was the only Christmas present I could give to the Senators but I can assure them that it will not happen in 1988 or 1989.</P>
      <P>Under sections 68 and 279 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, as amended, the Minister for the Marine is empowered to make an order altering salmon, eel and oyster fishing licences and by sections 159 and 160, as amended, of the same Act to alter by order the duties payable on salmon dealers' and salmon exporters' licences.  The order may not be made, however, until a resolution approving a draft of the order has been passed by Dáil Éireann and by Seanad Éireann.</P>
      <P>Commercial salmon, eel and oyster fishing licence duties were last increased with effect from 1 January 1985.  I am satisfied that an increase in these licence duties is warranted from 1 January 1988 in the light of the rate of inflation in the meantime and to provide some additional revenue for the fisheries boards.  In the majority of cases the proposed increases are up to 20 per cent.  An increase of 20 per cent may sound alarming but if we look at the actual increases they give a different picture.  In the case of two licences, however, pole nets and loop nets, the present price charged is extremely low.  I am, therefore, proposing to increase them by 30 per cent and 100 per cent, respectively.  This is relevant only in relation to the basic licence.</P>
      <P>Even with these increases the pole net licence will cost only £50 and the loop net licence only £10.  Salmon dealers' and salmon exporters' licence fees were last increased on 1 January 1983 and there has been no increase in the past five years. Increases in these fees have been substantial in previous years; they were increased from £1 to £25 in 1981.  Dealers' licence fees were increased from £25 to £50 and exporters' licence fees were increased from £50 to £200 in 1983.  It was decided not to increase the fees from 1 January 1985.  I now propose to increase them by 20 per cent and 25 per cent respectively with effect from 1 January next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="447" /> Income this year from commercial fishing licence fees, duties and salmon dealers' and salmon exporters' licence fees will amount to £217,000 approximately. The increase in these duties and fees, which I am providing for in the draft order, will generate approximately £33,000, bringing the total income from all these licences to approximately £250,000.  That is the total expected revenue for 1988.  While some fishermen, salmon dealers and salmon exporters may feel aggrieved at having to pay more for their licences next year, I would ask them to bear in mind that £4.77 million is being provided in 1988 towards inland fishery development.</P>
    <P>Accordingly I recommend to the House that the resolution approving the draft order be passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>State expenditure over the years on the development and protection of our inland fisheries has been substantial and I am <Col N="448" /> now proposing that trout and coarse fish anglers who benefit from this should bear part of the cost.</P>
      <P>At present a licence is not required for trout or coarse fish angling: salmon anglers must have a licence.  The Inland Fisheries Commission, as far back as the mid-seventies, proposed the introduction of a licensing system for trout and coarse fish angling.  The 1980 Act, however, although based on the commission's report, did not introduce trout and coarse fish licensing but instead made provision for a voluntary system of registration for trout, coarse fish and sea anglers in order to raise revenue for the development and protection of inland fisheries.  Such registration cost £5 per annum up to 1985 when it was increased to £9.50 which is the present fee.  It entitles those registered to fish for trout and coarse fish without a permit in any of the waters owned or occupied by the Central Fisheries Board and the Regional Fisheries Board with which the angler is registered.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 100,000 trout anglers and 10,000 coarse fish anglers in Ireland as well as an additional 10,000 trout and 33,000 tourist anglers.  Out of those 110,000 native trout and coarse fish anglers only about 3.5 per cent have registered. This figure is very disappointing indeed.</P>
      <P>On the introduction of the proposed licensing system for trout and coarse fish anglers, the present voluntary register for such anglers will be dispensed with.  I will, however, retain the voluntary system of registration for sea anglers.  I have, accordingly, provided in the Bill to change the name of the register to a &ldquo;Register of Sea Anglers&rdquo;.  In this connection I wish to address myself to sea anglers and to encourage them to continue to pay their voluntary contributions towards the development of sea angling which has enormous potential but which has been relatively under-exploited and which a small contribution would help us to further develop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Life members of the former Inland Fisheries Trust are entitled to fish for trout and coarse fish without payment of a permit fee in fisheries boards' waters. <Col N="449" /> With the introduction of the proposed legislation these members will require a licence to fish for trout or coarse fish but will retain their right to fish without having to pay for a permit.  Of course life members who have reached their 66th birthday will be exempted from purchasing trout and coarse fish licences.  I am proposing to introduce separate licences for trout angling and coarse fish angling which can be used nationwide and will be available for a period of 21 days or for the full season with respective charges of £10 and £5 for the 21 day licences and £15 and £10 for the full season licences.</P>
    <P>I am also proposing to reduce the number of classes of salmon angling licences from five to two &mdash; a 21 day nationwide licence costing £21 and a full season nationwide licence for £25.  I might add that this rationalisation has been long overdue, particularly bearing in mind the position that has obtained up to now in which there was a multiplicity of licences available.</P>
    <P>In the case of anglers who engage in all types of rod fishing I am providing in the Bill for an annual composite licence costing £40 which will entitle the holder of fish for salmon, trout and coarse fish nationwide.</P>
    <P>In the preparation of this legislation I have borne in mind the recreational needs of our young people.  Neither have I forgotten our senior citizens.  As Senators will no doubt have observed, I am providing in section 4 (2) of the Bill that persons under 18 years of age or over 66 are exempted from having a licence when fishing for trout and coarse fish. This, of course, will also apply to tourist anglers in those age brackets.  The present law which provides that salmon anglers of all ages are required to hold a licence is not being changed.  I am not proposing to require those engaging in sea angling to hold a licence.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to estimate how many trout and coarse fish angling licences will be sold in the first year following the introduction of the new licensing system. A total of 50,000 licensed trout and <Col N="450" /> coarse fish anglers would, however, yield an annual income in the region of £500,000 in any one year.</P>
    <P>I would stress that all the income derived from the sale of the new licences will be retained by the fisheries boards for protection, development and conservation of fisheries and for pollution control.  The fear has been expressed by many people that the money would not be put back into the relevant region.  I am giving this House a solemn assurance that this money, which will be collected locally, will be used on the local inland fisheries.</P>
    <P>The Central Fisheries Board, on which all regional fisheries boards are represented, have requested the proposed legislation now before the House.  It is also supported by the Trout Anglers Federation of Ireland and the National Coarse Fishing Federation of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Some organisations and individuals have voiced their objections in principle to the introduction of licences for trout and coarse fish angling.  It has also been stated that it will harm the tourist industry. While visiting coarse fish anglers will outnumber native coarse fish anglers by about three to one, on the other side of the coin, however, native trout anglers far outnumber visiting trout anglers by about 10 to 1.  The bulk of the licence fees will, therefore, come from native anglers.</P>
    <P>Few visiting anglers will object to paying £5 for a 21 day coarse fish licence or £10 for a 21 day trout angling licence. A fee of £5 or £10 for a coarse fish or trout angling licence is a very small charge in the overall cost of a holiday and tourists who pay a substantial sum to come to Ireland on fishing holidays are most unlikely to change their plans because they are required to pay such a fee.  Tourist anglers are more than willing to make a contribution.</P>
    <P>Trout and coarse fish anglers, be they native or tourist, cannot expect the Exchequer to continue to completely fund the development and protection of their angling waters.  What we are seeking here is a small contribution from the <Col N="451" /> anglers who benefit substantially from the recreational amenity of inland fishing.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that licensing constitutes the minimum amount of inconvenience to our own, or to visiting anglers.  While the arrangements for the distribution and sale of licences will be primarily a matter for the fisheries boards, it will be organised in the simplest possible manner.  Licences, as at present, will be sold by the fisheries boards through their own offices and some field staff and through outlets countrywide &mdash; shops, hotels and offices of regional tourism organisations.  The feasibility of extending on the spot sales of licences by fisheries field staff is being examined.</P>
    <P>Many Senators will be aware that a restructuring of the fisheries boards is currently being considered.  No firm decisions have yet been made, however, as to the future structure.  There are many references to the fisheries boards in the text of the Bill.  This is necessary in view of the fact that responsibility for inland fisheries currently lies with the fisheries boards.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to again state that the objective of this Bill is to provide a more equitable way by which funds for the future development and protection of our inland fisheries will be available without undue strain on any sector of the community.</P>
    <P>I strongly commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that at the moment a personal licence is not required for trout and coarse fishing, and that the Inland Fisheries Commission, as far back as the mid-seventies proposed the introduction of a licence system for trout and coarse fishing. Despite the fact that that was proposed in the mid-seventies nothing happened perhaps due to the wisdom of the people at the time.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his speech also said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also proposing to reduce the number of classes of salmon angling <Col N="452" /> licences from five to two &mdash; a 21 day nationwide licence costing £21 and a full season nationwide licence for £25.</P>
    <P>That is a very small difference and for the sake of £4 I believe those figures should be the same &mdash; a licence fee of £21 to cover everything.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that there would be about 50,000 licensed trout and coarse fish anglers yielding an annual income of £500,000.  There would be many more than 50,000 trout and coarse fish anglers, so the income generated would be much greater.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's undertaking to retain the money in the fisheries boards for the development and conservation of fisheries and to control pollution.  I hope the fisheries boards will be retained.  The licences cannot be issued by the fisheries boards if they are not to be retained.  The Minister said that no firm decision had been made as to the structure of the fisheries boards in the future.  I am glad a firm decision has not been made yet as many people, including myself, would have things to say on the restructuring or abolition of the fisheries boards as they now exist.</P>
    <P>On receipt of this Bill I read through the Title in an effort to find out what its purpose was to be.  The Title reads as follows:</P>
    <P>An Act to amend the law relating to fisheries and for that purpose to amend and extend the Fisheries Acts, 1959 to 1987, by amending the provisions for salmon rod ordinary licences and extending the provisions for ordinary fishing licences which relate to rod and line to include licences in respect of trout, licences in respect of coarse fish and licences in respect of salmon, trout and coarse fish, to limit registration under section 58 of the Fisheries Act, 1980, to sea anglers and to certain other persons and to amend and extend section 59 of that Act, to provide for other matters connected with the foregoing and otherwise to amend and extend the Fisheries Acts, 1959 to 1987.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="453" /> There is no real indication in the Title as to the purpose of the Bill.  This Bill was presented by the Minister for the Marine on 8 December 1987.  I am surprised at the speed with which the Bill is being put through the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>When I studied the Bill on Wednesday, 9 December, I was not aware, nor was there an indication on the Seanad Order Paper even on Wednesday of this week, that the Bill would be dealt with in this session in the Seanad.  I gave an assurance to a number of interested parties that I would have discussions with them about this, as I had assumed that the Bill would not come before the Seanad until after <Col N="454" /> the Christmas recess.  That was a mistaken impression.  We have not had enough time to go into various aspects of the Bill because it appears to be the intention to have it enacted before the end of the year.  Senators in my position have been left with very little time to consult various groups.  I wrote to people on Wednesday undertaking to enter into consultations on the assumption that the Bill would not be taken at this stage.</P>
    <P>I read through the Bill and found the punch line to lie in section 6 (a), which gives the real reason for its introduction. This is also indicated in the Schedule which states:</P>
    <P Just="Center">AMENDMENT OF PART I OF FOURTH SCHEDULE TO PRINCIPAL ACT</P>

    <P>These are the charges which will be imposed if the Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>There should be no doubt that the introduction of licence fees will be resisted, especially in the area of Lough Corrib, the largest free fishing lake in Europe.  It is promoted as such throughout the world.  Galway angling and tourism interests are angry and will resist the introduction of these fees.  A protest march is to be held tomorrow in Galway. People may be encouraged in this protest by the obvious success of recent parent protests about cuts in primary education which forced the Minister to back down. The federation of anglers' clubs in Galway are willing to take to the streets on this issue.  The <i>Galway Observer</i> published last Wednesday contained an item which stated as follows:</P>
    <P>Angry Galway anglers will take to the streets next Saturday to protest at the Government's plans to impose licence charges for trout and coarse fishing.</P>
    <P>The anglers are furious that Lough Corrib, the largest free fishing lake in Europe, will lose its free status under the terms of the proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>The Government proposes to license all trout and coarse fishing in a Bill which proposes fines of up to £20,000 and two years in prison for all breaches.</P>
    <P>The Federation of Lough Corrib Anglers are expected to strongly oppose the legislation when they meet later this week, but already a number of individual angling clubs have rejected the move out of hand.  Braith-reacht na Coiribe, one of Galway's oldest angling clubs, have organised <Col N="455" /> a protest march through the city for Saturday.</P>
    <P>A similar article appears in today's issue of the <i>Connacht Tribune.</i>  Anglers are saying in effect that the Minister should tackle the real problems of poaching, pollution etc.  Tomorrow's protest march is also mentioned in the <i>Connacht Tribune</i> article, which goes on to state that it will be followed by a mass meeting of all angling clubs in Connacht in Castlebar at 2 p.m. on Sunday.  It reports Mr. Seán Beatty, a member of the Annaghdown angling club, as saying that he had fished on the Corrib for the past 40 years and found it hard to stomach that a charge could be imposed on him now.  This gives some idea of the ordinary angler's opposition to this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister is in a difficult position. The introduction of licence fees at this time will be seen simply as another means of collecting revenue.  He has indicated that he expects to raise about £500,000 but I believe the figure will be much greater.  A detailed study recently published by the ESRI has shown that there are 122,000 regular anglers in Ireland, while a further 200,000 tourist anglers visit Ireland each year.  Those figures are small relative to the potential market.</P>
    <P>If the new licences are to be accepted by anglers the Minister should make a provision in the Bill guaranteeing that the moneys collected in licence fees will be reallocated to the regional fisheries boards for the non-pay element in fishery protection, pollution control and other promotions.  The regional fisheries boards are operating in conditions of severe financial hardship.  They were established, along with the Central Fisheries Board, under the Fisheries Act, 1980.  Their first year of operation was 1981, the year in which the first embargo on recruitment to the public service was introduced and cuts in public expenditure began.  These new organisations, which were intended to give a whole new impetus to inland fishery protection and development and the promotion of angling, had to cope with progressive cuts <Col N="456" /> in resources, manpower and finance in the following years, making it extremely difficult and often impossible to cope with the statutory functions given to them.</P>
    <P>Financial allocations to the boards have declined seriously in real terms since 1981.  With increasing wage costs, the money available for non-pay purposes and to keep the staff working productively has declined to a ludicrously low level.  As a result, the full potential of inland fisheries has not been realised. To give some idea of the way moneys have been cut back over those years, I will quickly run through the budgets since 1982.  In that year £3.1 million of the budget was spent on pay and £1.9 million was spent under non-pay headings.  In 1983, £3.5 million was spent on pay and £1.7 million on non-pay elements.  In 1984 those figures were £3.7 million and £1.1 million.  In 1985, £3.9 million was spent on pay and £1.5 million on non-pay.  In 1986, £4.4 million was spent on pay and £1.3 million on non-pay elements.  This year £4.8 million was spent on pay, while non-pay elements accounted for only £900,000.  It is obvious that since 1982 when the non-pay element of the budget was £1.9 million we have lost £1 million. To have the equivalent of the 1982 figure we would need a non-pay budget of £2.93 million today.</P>
    <P>Despite the cutbacks, the boards have made significant progress in dealing with the tasks and functions given to them. They have been to the forefront in highlighting the problems of pollution.  While in many cases local authorities have stood back from these problems, fishery boards have been actively tackling them.  The record in relation to monitoring, detection and prosecution of offenders speaks for itself.  In terms of prosecutions alone, records show that the boards have been many times more active than local authorities. The boards have no vested interest, as have many of the local authorities who may themselves be polluters.</P>
    <P>In the western fisheries regional board, the area in which I live, successful prosecution has been taken against the local authority when a five figure sum in damages was awarded to that fisheries board. <Col N="457" /> The protection of salmon, sea trout and molluscs has improved considerably compared with the position obtaining prior to the establishment of the boards.  In 1981 there was a real danger that salmon stocks would disappear within a very short time.  The work of the boards has halted their decline.  Oyster fishermen's co-operatives now openly confirm that, without the protection services of regional boards, the potential of the important oyster fisheries in the areas of Kilkerrin, Galway Bay and Clew Bay could not be realised and indeed, would be endangered.  The Western Regional Fisheries Board have tackled the important development of preserving the natural environment of the Corrib.  A regional fisheries board is in the best position to undertake this task.</P>
    <P>Promotion of the game angling resources of the region have been undertaken in a professional manner.  The boards can point to other significant improvements also effected.  The Minister has indicated elsewhere that he is now considering the abolition of the regional fisheries boards and to replace them with a national authority.  I believe that would constitute a retrograde step and should be opposed because the democratically elected body with strong local representation &mdash; whose members act in a voluntary capacity &mdash; would be supported.  The members of regional fisheries boards now act in a totally impartial manner.  They can comment objectively on abuses, particularly in regard to pollution.  The boards voice local interests in the protection and enhancement of the essential part of their local environment.  The abolition of regional fisheries boards would not effect any real saving in public expenditure because the only cost involved is its members' travelling expenses.  Probably many of the members of regional boards would be prepared to act even if they did not receive those travelling expenses.</P>
    <P>In any event a centrally-sited body in Dublin might cost just as much, in terms of travelling expenses, for officials commuting to and from Dublin.  I contend that any shortcomings in the past few <Col N="458" /> years have not been the fault of the regional fisheries boards.  Apart from lack of resources the greatest shortcoming in the past has been the absence of any policy in this area.  What are needed now are the right policies to ensure that the State gets the maximum economic benefit from those important resources.  Policy is a matter for the responsible Minister.  The Central Fisheries Board endeavoured to contribute to the question of policy in its document entitled: <i>Inland Fisheries &mdash; Strategies for Management and Development</i> with inputs from the regional fisheries boards. That publication was acknowledged to be progressive and positive in relation to future needs and prospects.  Yet, within a few days its publication, the board was threatened with abolition.  Was this an indication of the general apathy to sensible planning or the inability of Government Departments to take decisions in the country's interests.</P>
    <P>All of this work undertaken by the boards has come about despite a drastically reduced budget each year.  Far from scrapping the boards, as was indicated, I believe their powers should be strengthened to tackle the problems of the development of inland fisheries, of pollution of poaching and of other problems.</P>
    <P>A new problem has arisen recently on Lough Corrib and I believe also on the Erne.  On Lough Corrib, in the Ballycuirke area, near Moycullen, a section of the lake has been taken over by roach, which could be an even more serious problem than pollution.  It is believed, in the case of Lough Corrib, that the roach were introduced about six years ago, probably by German anglers using small roach as bait and then disposing of them in the lake.  They multiplied so rapidly that, within four to six years, they had taken over in a section of the lake with millions competing for the food of other species.  The presence of those millions of roach in a stretch of the Corrib will completely destroy other fish life because they eat all the food life wherever they habitate.</P>
    <P>The western region fisheries board <Col N="459" /> have done tremendous work on predator control and, up to this year, had taken thousands of roach from the Corrib.  This year no money was allocated to this essential work because of the serious cutbacks. Again, the budget for the non-pay element of the Central Fisheries Board and the Regional Boards has been reduced over the five years by £1 million. Their allocation is now £1 million less than it was the year after the boards were established.  How can the regional fisheries boards continue their work if they are starved of finance?  How can they monitor and control pollution if their budget continues to decline each year?</P>
    <P>In the western regional fisheries board, monitoring of possible pollution is done on a daily basis.  The board has convened meetings with farmers and industrialists to educate them in the dangers of pollution from activities carried out close to waters.  They have made great strides in that area; that is from the angling point of view only.  Other interests represented on the boards would include eel fisheries, the fishery owners, the oyster section, drift net and draft net interests, angling representatives and salmon, trout and coarse fishing interests.  There will be, and there is, great hostility on the part of the ordinary angler to the introduction of a licence charge of up to a maximum of £40 a year for a composite licence.  There is great objection to it on the part of the Federation of Corrib Anglers Clubs, on the part of tourist interests, particularly in the Corrib catchment area.  As an alternative &mdash; and I have spoken briefly only to some of them &mdash; the Corrib Anglers Clubs have said they would advance a £1 for £1 contribution to match anything central Government would invest in regional fisheries boards for non-pay development.</P>
    <P>The angling and tourist interests in Galway, Connemara and Mayo have been complaining for the past two seasons that salmon are not reaching the rivers and lakes on account of severe poaching and illegal fishing, with monafilament netting, further up the coast <Col N="460" /> and off the Donegal coast, in the area represented by the Minister of State. When will the Government take action in regard to illegal fishing.  It is quite obvious to anybody in the western region that salmon just do not exist in the lakes and the rivers.  How can they be there while there are miles and miles of net preventing them from coming up to their natural habitat to spawn.  The tourist interests in Connemara, anglers who come there every year, have been complaining for the last two years that the fish are simply not there.  Catch records bear that out.  This question must be addressed seriously by the Government and the Minister.  No matter who is catching the fish they are doing serious damage to the natural environment.</P>
    <P>On top of all that without taking any steps to solve the problem of illegal net fishing &mdash; the Minister is proposing to impose a licence fee on angling tourists who, for the past two years, have been coming to Connemara catching practically no fish.  The fisheries boards have put themselves out on a limb in supporting the introduction of licensing of rods.  Therefore, the Minister must guarantee that the revenue raised from licensing fees will be allocated to the regional fishery boards for the non-pay element of their work.  We must warn against any attempt by this or future Ministers, to repeat the stipulation that local authorities should raise revenue for service charges.  Yet, when they did so &mdash; unpopular as it was in some cases &mdash; their capital grants were further reduced.  If this Bill becomes law we must ensure that there will be a written guarantee that this Minister or any future Minister will not allow that to arise.</P>
    <P>These safeguards should be written into the Bill.  The revenue from licences must be allocated to the fisheries boards to finance the valuable work they are carrying out and in recognition of the responsible attitude they adopted to this Bill.  Investment in fishing will be more than paid back over a number of years. Any money invested in developing fishing is economically justified and there will be a quick return on the capital investment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="461" /> In the present economic climate, there is now general agreement on the need to conserve and concentrate on the development of our resources.  Fisheries have been especially identified by the Government as a growth area, and a target of 4,500 new jobs has been set in this sector. The present contribution of £50 million a year to the economy from inland fisheries as a whole is but a fraction of its potential and £30 million of the current £50 million total is attributable to tourist angling. This is an indicator for the future.  In 1982 salmon angling contributed an estimated 50 per cent of the revenue to the State from the salmon industry from only 4.5 per cent of the catch.</P>
    <P>Ireland's fisheries have a unique natural advantage.  We are now widely recognised as one of the few countries in the world which still have the potential to provide high quality angling in abundance. The value of this natural resource has not been fully recognised or exploited.  The current influx of tourist anglers is small, relative to the potential markets available.  There are four million anglers in Great Britain.  The angling holiday markets on the Continent and in North America are also substantial, with the potential of access by many millions of additional anglers.</P>
    <P>Ireland does not have an industrial advantage comparable to its natural fisheries environment.  It is reasonable to suppose that investment and promotional costs would be lower for jobs in fishing than for industrial jobs.  To attempt to prove this in an abstract, generalised, way is unlikely to be very convincing as there are little data on which to base development costs.  Individual cases are strongly supportive of this argument.  For example, the Corrib-Galway fishery which was bought by the Government for £200,000 in 1978 has averaged a yearly surplus since of between £30,000 and £40,000 and would give a profit to the State of about £150,000 after clearing the purchase price.</P>
    <P>Prior to the purchase of the Erriff fishery for £175,000, the average turnover for the previous five years was a mere £12,000 per annum.  This was built up to <Col N="462" /> £80,000 last year by the Central Fisheries Board and it is hoped to exceed £100,000 this year.  The Moy fishery cost £300,000 and is expected to show a profit of about £50,000 this year.  These figures reinforce the view that a well managed Irish fishery can make money.  It is worth noting that investment in those largely self financing natural resources is durable and not mobile, and the jobs created are permanent.</P>
    <P>Let us continue our investment in fishing. Let us halt the decreasing budget each year.  Let us realise the potential benefit of investment.  Above all let the Minister guarantee that if these licence fees are introduced &mdash; and we have an indication of that already &mdash; the money raised will be allocated to the various fishery boards.</P>
    <P>Níl aon rud eile le rá agam ar an mBille. Ní dóigh liom go glacfar leis mar níl na hiascairí i gContae na Gaillimhe agus i gContae Mhaigh Eo sásta leis ná fóralacha atá ann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and hope that this debate will not keep him or, indeed, the rest of us at this seasonal time.  At the outset.  I welcome the principle behind the proposals before us.  I make that point at this stage of my contribution lest anything I might subsequently say might be misinterpreted as being outright opposition to the Bill which is not the case. However, there are aspects of it about which I would like to express some concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to start by welcoming the general thrust of it.  The lack of finance for the protection and development of trout and coarse fishing here in Ireland has inhibited the industry from realising its full potential down through the years. The provision of coarse fishing facilities in my own county of Leitrim has proven to be an economic lifeline to the area and for the lakeland region as a whole encompassing the counties of Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Fermanagh, Roscommon, Longford, Westmeath, Meath, Offaly, Galway and Mayo and the Minister's own county of Donegal.  Of course <Col N="463" /> the Minister's ability to cast a long line is legendary.</P>
    <P>Any proposals in relation to the coarse fishing industry affect a considerable portion of the country.  The traditional tourist, using the term in its widest possible interpretation, in many of the areas outlined, but particularly in the North Shannon area of Leitrim, Roscommon and Cavan has been the coarse fisherman and his family.  The vast majority come from the English midlands and the London area.  They are a separate breed of people who have an interest in coming to Ireland for one reason only, to catch fish and to talk about catching fish and, in most cases, I am happy to report, to tell all who care to listen about their success, expecially if they fish around the 20 or so lakes within a four mile radius of my own town of Drumshanbo.</P>
    <P>The method of attracting these special people who normally come among us in the close tourist season of April, May and June needs to be encouraged.  The method for attracting them is for Bord Fáilte in co-operation with local voluntary tourism bodies, and guest house proprietors to mount aggressive marketing and promotional campaigns in Britain.  I was present at such a marketing occasion in London only two weeks ago and was most impressed with the spread of accommodation available and the professionalism of the Bord Fáilte personnel in going after this important segment of the market.  I would like to emphasise my impressions of Bord Fáilte on that occasion, particularly in the light of the comments that have been made about the board in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>The single biggest attraction at this promotional exercise was the quality and the quantity of the fish in our area, exemplified by a first rate film presentation to the several hundred English anglers present and most important the fact that this veritable feast of fish on film was all free.  Free coarse fishing is synonymous with Ireland and her lakes.  As I stated at the outset, I welcome the proposal to put much needed finance into the coarse fishing area.  For counties like Leitrim <Col N="464" /> with a low industrial base and a high service sector, such moneys will be a much needed stimulus, and I can assure the Minister I will be among the first at his door when be begins to dispense the largesse which he estimates is about £.5 million in the first year.  I would like to compliment him on giving his strong assurances to the House in his Second Stage speech that the moneys generated by this licensing system will go back directly to the local areas.</P>
    <P>However, I would like to remind the Minister &mdash; in fact he does not need any reminding &mdash; that there is strong opposition to this measure among tourism angling interests, particularly in my region and further west.  This opposition is not new and has a certain validity. I remind the House that two previous attempts to introduce charges such as those proposed failed at first reading, one under a Coalition Government when the late James Dillon TD, was Minister for Agriculture, and again in 1966 when the present Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, was Minister for Agriculture.  The opposition then as now was based on the detrimental effect such charges would have or were perceived to have on the tourist industry.  The Taoiseach admitted his own reservations on the matter of charges when in reply to a question put to him about the possible implications for the tourist industry in Ireland he said there would be ample opportunity to consider that aspect before it was finally enacted. In the Dáil at Question Time on 28 April 1966, Official Report, Vol. 222, col. 1010, the Minister for Agriculture said:</P>
    <P>I do not wish to interfere with free fishing but it seems to me reasonable that we should make this provision for the benefit of the sport as such. However, I am at the moment receiving representations from interested parties about this proposal.  I am discussing the proposal with the various organisations interested and I am having regard especially to the effect the proposal might have on the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>At a later date he again indicated he was <Col N="465" /> looking at the proposals in the light of their possible effect on the tourist industry. Even then there was an acknowledgement &mdash; and the proposals were modest at the time &mdash; of the opposition to the measure.  The opposition was so vocal that the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1966, did not get beyond the First Reading in either House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that 21 years on the position in relation to the Bill seems to have changed among those whom I might loosely refer to as having a vested interest.  The main opposition in 1966 came from the National Federation of Coarse Anglers.  Now, however, a similar body representing coarse anglers have come out in support of the proposals as per the Minister's statement earlier. This <i>volte-face</i> on something that was a matter of great principle as well as policy in 1966 makes for interesting debate.  I can only speculate on the reasons for the change in the absence of any speculation from those particular sources.</P>
    <P>I am aware that colleagues of mine have contributed to this Bill in another place and have articulated support now given by coarse fishing associations, as referred to by the Minister, in some of their lakeland constituencies.  I have no wish to doubt their sincerity.  I just happen to differ on the general principle of imposing a charge for coarse fishing where none has existed for hundreds of years and where the absence of such a charge has contributed enormously to the economic well-being of the area I am proud to represent in this House.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly natural that tourism interests in my region should be nervous and feel vulnerable to any change in market conditions in such a volatile industry as tourism where Ireland has to compete for every pound, for every angler who has alternatives for his chosen sport.  The arguments put forward in the past against the introduction of these charges are equally valid today.  I was interested to read in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Thursday, 17 December 1987, a letter from a Mr. B. Hobler writing from County Galway as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="466" /> As to the impact on tourism, is a Dutch or German angler expected to pay £26 in licences before he can fish for his pike and trout?  When I fished in the Netherlands a few years back I paid less than £2 for a licence which entitled me to fish for all species of fish. A similar licence in Germany cost £3 last year on my holidays.  Obviously the continental European angler will not return to Ireland when he is forced to pay such an excessively high fishing licence.</P>
    <P>The new licence system will have a particularly detrimental effect on the brown trout fishing on the western lakes.  Towns like Ballinrobe, Headford and Oughterard, which depend on the tourism angler, will suffer enormously by this proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>He could have mentioned a few of the lakes in Cavan, Leitrim and Roscommon.</P>
    <P>The theory behind these proposals sounds impressive.  A levy is imposed on a definable collectable group of people who will have no option but to comply if they wish to pursue their favourite leisure occupation.  We then wait for the money to come rolling in so that it can be reinvested for the betterment of the sport and ultimately the economy generally. Let us look at the possible consequences. The traditional English angler is not an affluent individual.  In the main they come from the lower economic level where every pound counts and any increase in costs has already inhibited such people from coming to Ireland.  The high cost of access to Ireland has resulted in a falling off of this market and in my own area it has been very noticeable.</P>
    <P>However, the impact of Ryanair and cross-Channel air charges leading to more competitive sea carrier prices, which is the traditional mode of entry for the English angler, has resulted in an upsurge of visitors, specifically to Counties Leitrim, Roscommon and Cavan during the close season in 1986 and again in 1987.  There is no doubt whatsoever that the reduction in the access charges into this country over the past 18 months, <Col N="467" /> has contributed significantly to an increase in coarse fishing and anglers coming into the counties I have referred to.  In that context it was one of the most important developments that this Government initiated since they came into office and one that should be applauded and encouraged.  I suggest to the Minister that the new charges will cause many of these new-found friends of ours to pause and to consider whether they might not be better off staying in England rather than coming to Ireland to do their fishing.</P>
    <P>Ireland is synonymous with free coarse fishing.  In the past 25 years the market has been assiduously cultivated by voluntary organisations irrespective of Bord Fáilte's involvement.  The coarse fisherman is a totally different animal from the salmon fisherman who can well afford to pay for his sport, in many cases a sport which can prove lucrative.  Coarse fishermen return all their catch to the river or lake in which they are fishing.  It is the challenge of the fly from the first bob of the cork or the float, that sends the adrenalin running in a true coarse fisherman.  This reaction is added to by the thrill of the catch.</P>
    <P>I can see a time, not too far distant, when only those with substantial funds will be able to fish Irish rivers and lakes and to be a coarse fisherman will have as elitist a tag as to belong to certain golf clubs in this country.  It has been suggested that the proposed charge will quickly double or treble and that every lake owner will now impose their own charges for access on top of the State levy.  Such a move should be met with the strongest opposition from the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister refused to accept an amendment to exempt tourist anglers in another place.  I would ask him to give the proposal serious consideration in the interests of tourism and the economic well-being of the region from which I come.  I know that the arguments against this are that one should not single out any one section but we are talking here about something that is contributing <Col N="468" /> to the livelihood of a particular region which has been ill-served since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>There is some emphasis on the role of the Central Fisheries Board in the administration of the proposals contained in the Bill.  The Minister clarified the reasons on the basis that the Central Fisheries Board are responsible for such administration.  I regret having to bring to the attention of the Minister criticisms of the role of the board in relation to the protection of fish resources in the Lough Allen area.  I am aware of several successful attempts to poach fish from the Shannon lakes by the illegal use of monofilament nets.  Despite several protests from tourist interests to the appropriate authorities, the response was not that they were unwilling to do their job but that due to lack of resources and inadequate personnel they, the Central Fisheries Board, were unable to stamp out this invidious practice.  In that context, again from the letters' page of <i>The Irish Times</i> of Thursday, 17 December 1987, a Mr. Patrick Maher from Dublin, in the course of a long treatise on the reasons he is opposed to the introduction of licences, said the following which should be brought to the attention of the Minister. I quote it without comment and without any suggestion of criticism of the Central Fisheries Board.</P>
    <P>Mr. Maher said that, in an effort to get some information, he telephoned the Department of Fisheries and the Central Fisheries Board on the afternoon he wrote the letter.  He said the response he got from the little girl in the Department was &ldquo;I'm afraid we don't know anything except that new arrangements have been made to increase the cost of licences in 1988&rdquo;.  Mr. Maher said that absolutely nothing was forthcoming concerning the control of poaching, or pollution, or indeed conservation.  The spokesman for the Central Fisheries Board also knew about the new licensing arrangements.  In fact, he only knew as much as had been reported in the newspapers and he told me that his organisation was being disbanded at the end of the year.  Obviously, <Col N="469" /> it is opportune for the Minister at some stage in this debate to clarify that position. I am sure the Minister would not wish to have officials of his Department or those under his aegis being criticised in the public press where they cannot respond or reply.</P>
    <P>I mention the Central Fisheries Board in the context of the Bill as they propose to dispense the money.  The Explanatory Memorandum states: &ldquo;The purpose of this Bill is to introduce a licensing system for trout and coarse fish angling&rdquo;.  It further states:</P>
    <P>This licensing system is required in order to ensure that trout and coarse fish anglers who benefit from substantial State expenditure on the development and protection of trout and coarse fish fisheries contribute towards that expenditure.</P>
    <P>I do not think any of us could argue with or object to the sentiments expressed in the Explanatory Memorandum, but in the light of the information and experience I have had in my own area in relation to the protection of the fishing stocks in the Shannon and in the Shannon lakes, the suggestion that the money is going towards the protection as well as the development of trout and coarse fish fisheries is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the difficulties the local tourist interests have had in my own area about illegal poaching.  As a result, in order to protect their livelihood, in co-operation with the local Garda local people took steps to ensure that such illegal activities were terminated.  I advise any would be illegal poachers that they will get a welcome to Lough Allen not in keeping with the tradition of the area which is based on friendliness and open hearted hospitality.  These illegal activities were planned and executed using the most sophisticated equipment available. I know the Minister is aware of the gangsters who are involved in this trade.  I also am aware of the Minister's deep concern in that area.  I hope that, on a general level, in the context of the resources which are going to be provided for the protection of the fisheries industry, the <Col N="470" /> Minister will keep in mind that aspect of it.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I wanted to preface my remarks by saying that I supported in principle the thrust of the Bill but, in honesty, I could not come before the House and before the Minister without outlining the very serious and genuinely held concerns of voluntary tourism interests in my own area which must be viewed in the context of a very wide area, the midlands of the country.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister does not need reminding of the importance of the tourism industry in the context of coarse fishing to areas such as County Leitrim and parts of his own constituency.  I hope that, once this legislation is passed, the Minister will continue to monitor the collection of the levy, the collection of the licences and, more important, that he will use his good offices to ensure that an area which he knows so intimately, and I am sure he will agree with me, requires perhaps a larger slice of the national cake than it has been getting.  When the time comes for the dispensing of that money to the area I come from in the north west which relies so much on the coarse fishing angler from England, it will benefit to a degree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got the experience of Senator McCormack or Senator Mooney in this matter.  I do not think I would be here today but for the fact that I attended a meeting last Wednesday of the Dublin and Eastern Regional Tourism Board of which I am a member.  At the commencement of the meeting there was an angry discussion among members involved in the tourism business directly, hoteliers, etc.  They complained bitterly at the introduction of this Bill which proposes to charge tourists a licence fee for trout and coarse fishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Mooney has pointed out, we have sold the fishing facilities of the tourism industry in Ireland as free across the world.  We have marketed them in that way.  The extraordinary thing was that these people who were angry were not angry at the charges but at the way in which they were being implemented. <Col N="471" /> They have all produced their brochures; they have all packaged their holidays; they are in the throes of that at this time. It is all ready; it has all gone abroad. They are writing to people in England and elsewhere explaining in their brochures and literature that coarse fishing and trout fishing are free in Ireland.  I do not think it is in the best interest of the tourism industry if these good people, who are a very important cog in the wheel of our tourism industry, have to tell their clients when they arrive: &ldquo;We are sorry, We misled you.  There is a charge now.&rdquo; I would not ask the Minister to exempt tourists from his charges but, in view of the fact that he has been so late in introducing this Bill, the tourism industry should be exempt in 1988 from these charges.  That is a fair point.  It would be a fair response to the tourism people, the hoteliers etc. who attract anglers to our country and they would not be seen to mislead them.  If the Minister were to exempt them for 1988, it would solve the problem which was brought to my attention last Wednesday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeEogan" hpid="Professor Eogan Professor Eogan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Eogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am one of these people who are all in favour of developing our fisheries and, in particular, our inland fisheries.  In many ways our inland fisheries have not been given sufficient attention, or the attention they deserve.  They have a considerable potential, not only economically but, as other Senators have said, from the point of view of recreation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where to fish and how to fish can present various problems around the countryside.  When I first read this Bill I looked on it as something which might bring a certain amount of order into the chaos which exists in certain areas. However, as I read through the Bill I am afraid I came partly to the conclusion, at least, that chaos will continue to prevail. For instance, there is an enormous number of categories of fishing one can do.  There is rod fishing for trout, and there is fresh water rod, ordinary licences and so on.  I wonder how can one really control the bewildering variety of licences or permits or whatever, it is proposed <Col N="472" /> to issue.  If some more streamlined method could be introduced it would be an effective way of bringing about that certain order which I think the fishing structure in the country lacks.</P>
    <P>However, there are more problems than that.  We are told, for instance, about composite licences which will entitle the holder to fish for salmon, trout and coarse fish nationwide.  I honestly do not think that is a practical proposition for the very good reason that we all know you can be fishing down a river; you can walk across one stream and you are into the control of a fishing club.  Then you may walk another piece and you are into a free fishing area.  What is going to happen to all these local fishing clubs? Are they going to be disbanded?</P>
    <P>Secondly, if a landowner does not allow you on to his land to fish, say, in a river or from the bank of a lake, what are you going to do about that?  Thirdly, one might ask, can landowners themselves whose land may be bordering on lakes and rivers fish in these lakes and rivers without having to procure a licence?  I can see an enormous number of problems before us straight away.</P>
    <P>I also feel &mdash; and this is the nub of what I really want to say &mdash; that perhaps one has moved a little too quickly here.  There might have been too much of a rush.  We should really look at this whole important problem in a slightly more comprehensive way.  For instance, what about pollution?  I have often gone fishing and the only fish I could see were dead ones, killed as a result of pollution.</P>
    <P>One may also go fishing and what one would meet are these enormous draglands where huge arterial drainage schemes are going on, which indeed have been doing untold damage to river fishing, at least, over a number of years and not only just when main drainage programmes are in hand, but during the maintenance afterwards.  There is a great deal of insensitivity with regard to the maintenance of certain rivers.  For instance, the machines are re-introduced at the spawning season very often.  This is not so in all cases, but I have experience of it and it is a very unwise situation. <Col N="473" /> Basically, what I would like to inquire is if there is any possibility of looking at this enormously important resource from a slightly wider viewpoint which will involve examining the whole problem of ownership &mdash; who owns the rivers, the waters, the lakes and so on.  Will this system of licensing lead on to even a more limited use of our resources by our own people?</P>
    <P>As some of us may know, salmon fishing, for instance, at the moment and for a number of years is a very elitist pursuit in which only a limited number of people can engage.  To conclude, I am certainly very keen to see this valuable resource developed, but I would suggest to the Minister that it would be much more beneficial to everybody concerned to look at the problem from a much wider viewpoint and to tackle some of the issues which may prove in some cases rather tricky to tackle, but not just to introduce what really is a form of taxation.  It is a form of taxation which can, or could, damage the tourist industry but what is even more important is that fishing in many ways is a local amenity for local people and we must also bear that in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Explanatory Memorandum states that the purpose of this Bill is to introduce a licence for trout and coarse fish angling.  I object to this in principle.  In this country, a licence has never been necessary for coarse fishing and it has been one of the strong points in parts of the country that derive much money from coarse fishing.  My colleague from Leitrim, Senator Mooney, so eloquently said&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is very welcome.  He said that inland fishing in Leitrim, Roscommon, Sligo, Fermanagh and Cavan is a major industry.  It is the most major industry in that area.  Coming from Ballinamore I have seen, in the last number of years, the amount of work that the local tourism and angling associations <Col N="474" /> on a voluntary basis have put into bringing fishermen here from Europe and Britain under the auspices of the tourist board.  They have gone to Europe and Britain and they have worked extremely hard at trying to entice fishermen to Ireland.  Taken on a local basis, fishing has a very great economic effect within our country.  It helps supermarkets and publicans.</P>
      <P>From my own experience, in the months of April, May and June, when there would not be very many tourists around &mdash; and, indeed, in September and October &mdash; if you go into any of the local bars you will always meet five or six tourist fishermen.  That is very essential in a small economy.  The principal argument used to bring the fishermen to the area is that there is no licence for coarse fishing. That is the nub of the argument.  Regardless of how small the licence is, it is in people's minds that it should be free.  It costs money in Europe and Britain.  I think the Highlands of Scotland are the only other place where there is no charge on coarse fishing.  In all seriousness, licensing will have an effect on the industry and I would ask the Minister to reconsider it.  I know that the Bill has passed through the lower House, but as an individual, I object in principle to the introduction of a licence.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that few visiting anglers will object to paying £5 for a 21 day coarse fishing licence or £10 for a 21 day trout angling licence.  It seems a very minimal amount of money but there is the principle that people have gone out and sold the idea that we have free coarse fishing.  I know that for example, you could charge extra for accommodation, but the important principle is that we have had free coarse fishing.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of the Bill is how it is hoped to police these new licences. Senator Mooney has given an example that poaching has being going on, not only in Lough Allen.  The authorities are quite aware of that but, unfortunately, due to lack of funds there is not much they can do about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I honestly do not know how the Minister is going to police the legislation.  Since I have become a Member of the Seanad, this is a point I have made on a number of Bills.  We are the best country in the world for legislation but some of it is not being implemented properly.  I hope that if the licence for coarse fishing is brought in, it will be implemented and policed properly. I hope it is not going to be a farcical licence, because, as we are quite aware, implementation is going to be very difficult. Going to the extreme, the Bill will allow people under 18 years of age and above the age of 66 free fishing.  If a gentleman or a lady is fishing in a group on the shore how can you know his or her age?  It is just one of the difficulties that could come up.</P>
      <P>Another problem which will have to be dealt with on Committee Stage is that a licence which permits fishing for trout does not cover a person for coarse fishing. If a person catches a perch, for instance, he could be taken to court and fined up to £500.  I know that is another extreme example but we should not put in legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the problem. If this licence fee is introduced like every other good thing within this country it will always increase rather than decrease. The rain is the only bloody thing that comes down unfortunately.  We have the example of local charges.  Anybody who is a member of a local authority, and the Minister of State is well aware of this, knows what has been going on during the past couple of years.  What I am afraid of is that this fee will increase.  It is at a minimal cost at the moment but it might not be too long before it costs £50 or £100.  That would prove detrimental to those who have built, with the help of <Col N="476" /> Bord Fáilte, great bed and breakfast and tourist accommodation.  They provide services similar to those provided by the hotels and at a cheaper rate.  These people have put a lot of money into their areas.  Introducing a licence fee is bad enough but to increase it will prove to be detrimental.</P>
      <P>I have been very negative but what I would like to compliment the Minister of State on is that if the licence fee is imposed he intends to put all the moneys raised in that way back into inland fisheries. I hope this is done but, in principle, I object to the introduction of a licence fee for inland fishing as in the long term it will produce the wrong effect.  As I have already said we increase things rather than decrease them.  That is my objection to the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivianOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am the only Senator here who earns his livelihood directly from tourism.  I welcome the Bill. The opening paragraph in the Explanatory Memorandum says it all.  We can talk about fishing here until the cows come home but I wish to quote a very famous politician who said: &ldquo;The days of the free lunch are over&rdquo;.  If there ever was an industry to which that could be applied it must be the fishing industry. We can go on all evening praising the great attraction which we have for foreign anglers but what happens when they get here?  Quite often, they find disarray.  In fact, most of the time they find disarray.</P>
      <P>I have seen surveys which were carried out on visiting anglers and I will resist the temptation of doing a travelogue and talking about the famous rivers and lakes in Munster.  Anglers from the UK and, particularly, Germany have indicated in recent years that they are not satisfied with the quality of fishing in our lakes and rivers, simply because there is a distinct lack of organisation.  Quite often when they come they find no fish.  They may find that lakes have been swept the night before and that there is a distinct lack of control.  To add insult to injury there have been recent cases of pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is proof positive that the Minister of State and his Department are at <Col N="477" /> long last taking this problem seriously. There is reasonable concern within the tourist industry about this matter. Senator Doyle's suggestion that the Minister of State might consider a moratorium of one year for foreign anglers may be worthy of consideration for a number of reasons, the primary reason being that Bord Fáilte have printed their literature for 1988 which includes an offer of free fishing.  It may be said that the hotels and guesthouses could absorb the cost of the licence fee into their charges but if they do the next morning they will receive a letter in the post from Bord Fáilte urging them not to increase their prices.  The industry needs to be seriously examined and it will only be seriously examined when the anglers become serious about it.  Quite often a lot of hot air is generated by angling clubs about pollution.  They harass local authorities and, occasionally, farmers in relation to the problems caused as a result.</P>
    <P>There is another side to this argument. Over the past few years, at a time when the fee was quite small, there has been an abysmal failure to respond to the request to register.  In fact up until 1985 the fee was a derisory figure of £5.  Therefore, one must wonder at the level of commitment among anglers.  The Minister of State has decided at long last to grasp the nettle but he will only be able to do that when he has money in his pocket.  I am pleased that the Minister of State has said that it is his intention to commit the entire amount raised from the collection of the licence fee to the further development of the industry.  This is what is needed.  If for no other reason, the fact that the licence will not be issued free will make people realise that they must seriously examine this industry.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the 1966 Bill did not get past a First Reading as if it had been passed a lot of money would have been collected in the intervening period and we would not now be confronted with the problem of having no bailiffs to control large stretches of countryside and miles and miles of river bank and lakes. This is a direct result of the underfunding <Col N="478" /> of the fisheries boards.  I can remember a time when there was a bailiff, and quite often two, to control every river adjacent to Bantry Bay.  At that time we could have legitimately said to UK, German and French tourists: &ldquo;Come to Ireland to fish; you can be sure of getting a week or a fortnight of satisfactory fishing and you can be absolutely certain you will be able to catch a lot of trout&rdquo;.  Therefore, the introduction of this Bill is timely.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister of State would consider mitigating the impact the introduction of the licence fee will have on the tourism industry next year.  The Minister of State should make it his intention to introduce the charge immediately preceding the next tourism season in recognition of the fact that people compiling brochures and tourism packages for the coming season did not have an opportunity to address the problem in regard to the absence of free fishing in Ireland next year.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other minor points I would like to make.  The issuing of a 21 day licence is not particularly advisable.  I do no know why a period of 21 days was chosen as it is not the normal duration of stay of tourists to Ireland.  I suspect that the normal duration is between seven and ten days rather than being 21 days.  It is now very rare for a tourist to stay in Ireland for three weeks.</P>
    <P>If we are anxious to get the co-operation of angling clubs the Minister of State should at this stage give a commitment that the fee will remain unchanged for three to five years.  In this regard Senator Reynolds's comments were timely.  Having established the charge it should not start to creep upwards as this will only lead to genuine people in angling clubs becoming disillusioned.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I am a little disconcerted by the fact that it is envisaged that additional staff will not be required.  This certainly amounts to a contradiction in that we cannot control our fisheries if we do not have sufficient staff to do so.  River raiding at night is not being properly handled.</P>
    <P>We also had a big problem of river <Col N="479" /> pollution this year which was highlighted by the fact that it was a dry year.  Pollution has been bad for a number of years but it was not as much in evidence because the rivers were swollen for most of the summers of 1984 and 1985.  The Minister should tackle the problem of river and lake pollution.  I accept that it is primarily the responsibility of another Department but it is not enough to pass legislation dealing with pollution, place it on our Statute Book and not implement it.</P>
    <P>The Department concerned should liaise with local authorities in the fight against pollution.  If it were possible to establish a good working relationship between local authority staff and the staff of the fisheries boards in a drive against pollution in the next two or three years we would go a long way towards solving the problem.  It is not enough to talk about educating our farmers; we will have to flex our muscles a little more positively because there is definite evidence that most farmers do not give a damn.  I regret to have to say that.  Farming organisations, and others, may say that this is an educational process but there are other ways of educating farmers besides slapping them on the wrist.</P>
    <P>Limerick County Council should be complimented on invoking legislation under which an offender is expected to leave a fishery in the condition it was in before it was polluted.  That is the type of action we need to take against those who are seriously undermining one of our best natural resources.  Until we take that positive stance the problem will continue. We tend to be a little blasé about pollution, particularly the pollution of our rivers and lakes.  It is not good enough for Members, myself included, to talk about clean rivers and a clean environment when pollution has reached a serious stage.  Is it right to bring people here to see the disarray that exists in regard to our inland fisheries?  One only has to look at the demise of the Atlantic salmon to realise the serious problem that exists because of lack of control.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on taking this initiative.  It was not <Col N="480" /> an easy or popular step.  As a former chairman of a regional tourism board and a person who derives his income from tourism I know that the move is not popular in tourism circles.  However, we will have to grasp the nettle but we can only do that when the industry is properly funded and we get people to appreciate that the day of the free lunch as far as fishing is concerned is over.</P>

    <P>I favour fishing licences if the money collected is handled in the right way. Unfortunately, this move to issue licences seems to have been seen by the Department as a purely financial matter. It has not been sold to anglers and, in my <Col N="481" /> opinion, it has been badly thought out. The Minister said that the anglers agree with the measure but they agree with it in principle and not with the way the financing arrangements have been worked out.  According to my sums it seems the Department looked at the £1 million, the proposed amount to be taken off the budget for fisheries in the coming year, calculated the number of anglers at home and abroad and came up with a figure for the amount of money required to make the service work.</P>
    <P>Before I comment on the state of our fisheries I should like to deal with what the Bill lays down.  There is to be a £25 licence for salmon and sea trout, £15 for brown trout and £10 for coarse fish, making a total of £50 or a special price of £40 for the three permits.  That figure is too high.  We have always had free fishing for brown trout and coarse fish and we have now gone from zero to £25 if one wishes to fish for brown trout and in the off season throws a line in the canal.  This has happened suddenly and without warning after years of advertising of free fishing.  Many fishermen will object to this price package and will not pay it.  It would have been much better if the fee was set at £20 all in, to cover salmon, sea trout, coarse fish and brown trout or a £10 licence for brown trout and coarse fish and a £5 permit for coarse fish only.  I do not think visitors would have objected too much to that and the £20 package could have been sold by saying that it was a salmon licence and was better value than could be obtained in most countries.</P>
    <P>Allowing under 18s and over 65s to fish free is a mistake.  A junior ticket could have been issued for a nominal amount. There are many young anglers who would feel they were involved if they had a licence and we are losing out on quite an amount of money in this area by allowing all to fish for free.  When I was a youngster I did not feel I was a real fisherman until I had my ticket from the local angling club.  I know several fishermen who still have the first licence they bought when they were youngsters.  The over 65s in many cases are anglers who have at least <Col N="482" /> that amount of money to spare and who would be quite willing to buy a licence. Fishermen would be glad to pay a licence fee if they knew that our waterways, and what swims in them, would be looked after.  However, this money will not be extra to what the fisheries had last year. The licence money is supposed to fill a very large gap made by reducing the budget of the fisheries boards by £1 million.</P>
    <P>The maintenance of our developed fisheries is being run down and we will have in 1988 a much reduced service compared to 1987.  The development which has gone on for the past 30 years has deteriorated and it will cost an amount of money to even get to where it was five years ago.  If we are to believe that angling is worth £50 million per year to us, surely this approach to our fisheries is nonsensical?  It is a growing sport here and the largest sport in England, much bigger than the game of soccer.  Yet, in spite of this growing industry we do not seem to treat it very seriously.  Our fisheries officers are the greatest guardians of our rivers and lakes.  I have no doubt that the mean-minded approach to that service has been responsible in no small way for the huge pollution problems which faced us during this year.  Without even thinking of the proposed 25 per cent cut this year the fisheries people have had a 75 per cent cut in three years.  We had the ridiculous situation this year of seeing skilled able-bodied fisheries officers sitting at home because they could not put petrol in their cars to patrol our waterways.</P>
    <P>In the coming year the pollution problem will be even worse if we do not act more sensibly in relation to the financing of what are essential services.  I am not just talking about the preservation of fish or about areas of recreation for anglers. I am talking about our own health and our survival in relation to clean water. With the exception of the Shannon system the water table in this country is very shallow and it is far too easy to have pollution from one water system running into a neighbouring system and ending up in our drinking water.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="483" /> If the new licence fees are sufficient to finance our failing fisheries and allow the fisheries people to carry on with their work the anglers will accept the scheme, but if the fisheries are to continue deteriorating all the angling clubs will have very strong objections to this extra cost on their pastime.  I hope the Minister does not think I am getting at him because of the situation.  Every Minister is going to hate me because I will keep on chipping away with my hammer and chisel until the system begins to understand that we have a country which is really nothing short of a jewel and we do not really understand what we have and what we stand to lose.  I am sure the Minister will understand that I know that he has the country at heart and I am sure everybody from the Taoiseach down is of the same mind, but there is something about the system which does not seem to understand what makes up this country and that we have a very fragile environment.</P>
    <P>It may be of interest to many of our salmon anglers that yesterday the Danish Parliament made a decision to ban inshore drift netting altogether.  This decision was made on the basis that recreational fishing for salmon was worth far more than commercial fishing.  It is extremely interesting for Ireland in that the strategy document drawn up by our own Central Fisheries Board was used and praised in order to convince politicians of the rational way to manage their inland fisheries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not convinced there is a need for this Bill.  I have read the Minister's speech and I am still not convinced that we need it.  I have always found it difficult to understand why people needed a salmon licence in the first place.  Watching over the years the way the issue and distribution of salmon <Col N="484" /> licences was approached and implemented convinced me that we did not need it at all.</P>
      <P>This Bill is going to affect many areas of our lives which we cannot afford to have affected detrimentally at the moment.  I want to start with the tourist area.  I listened to Senator O'Callaghan both in the office and here after I came in.  As somebody who is depending on the tourist industry and the hotel industry I am amazed he is not at loggerheads with the Minister on this issue.  We have sold the idea of free fishing for years.  We have sold the idea of &ldquo;come to Ireland and fish cost-free&rdquo; and we are now moving backwards.  It is going to hit tourism.  It will hit it this year, as has been explained very vocally and articulately in the past couple of days by people in the general area of tourism, but it will affect us in years to come also.  What we need to sell is an Ireland that is free, that you can come to and be part of the environment, part of the ambience.  The amount of fish tourists are going to take or kill anyway is quite small.</P>
      <P>Let me pose one point that the Minister might respond to.  To get round the difficulty of hotels, would it be possible to have a general licence for guests in hotels or for a person who is genuinely in Ireland on a holiday?  If it is necessary to implement this Bill perhaps we could do it in a way that would not affect the tourist industry.  I ask the Minister to consider that and to give me his response.  I know the way holidays are costed by the tourist industry and by hotels particularly.  The cost per unit, in other words the cost per guest, is worked out to the nearest 50p almost and an additional expense such as a licence fee on top of that would very often make it something that would not be a saleable commodity any more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It worries me when I hear about substantial State expenditure on an issue as a reason for getting people to pay for it. Let me explain.  Substantial State expenditure should always reap a reward wherever it happens to be, in health, education or tourism.  However, I dislike this way of reaping the reward.  Really we are saying here that we will invest in fisheries. <Col N="485" /> We will try to have a good ambience or environment for fishing and we hope to reap the benefits in terms of the tourist industry but, at the same time, we are going to make people pay for the cost of our investment.  That lacks logic.  It is too simplistic to say we are paying this money out so we need to get this money back in terms of licences.  It does not work so simply.  We pay this money out and get the money back by selling the tourist industry, by selling the occupation internally and externally.  I would like to hear explained very carefully the estimated costing of this Bill.  In other words, I want to know how much it is going to cost the State to collect £10 or whatever it is for a licence.  It is not convincing to know that it will not be an actual cost to the State, it will be a cost on the fisheries board.  If it is a cost on the fisheries board they will have to direct resources in the area towards collecting these licence fees. That means they will have less money in other areas.  In that case there is a cost to the State.  There is a cost to the industry. There is a loss to the investment in this area.  I would like to hear that costed because it seems that it will cost very close on £10 to collect £10, to monitor it, register it, account for it and receipt it.  I see nothing very desirable in that.</P>
    <P>I have listened to a number of speakers. I listened carefully to my colleague, Senator de Buitléar, á rá linn go raibh sé ag tabhairt sórt fáilte don Bhille seo agus gur ceart agus gur coír go mbeadh but I have not heard the reasons for it except that people should feel responsible, should feel the need of being part of the system.  I need to know more than that.  I am speaking now environmentally rather than just financially.  Why should people need to have a licence to go out and, in his words, drop a line into the canal?  Knowing the Minister I believe he would agree with me that the last thing he would want to do is make fishing an exclusive occupation.  In other words, I am sure he would agree we do not want to make fishing an occupation that people could not participate in.  Even though the licence fees mentioned in the Bill are <Col N="486" /> small, as I accept, it is still a question of applying for a licence and having one before one can go out to fish.  People will not do that for a number of reasons: first, because they figure they could spend money in other ways; secondly, Irish people in general, whatever kind of psyche we have, are not heavy into licences and with any licence we have tried to sell we have come across this problem and thirdly, people feel they have a certain right to participate in fishing. Is it fair to make a person who might not have much else in terms of a pastime or a hobby spend £10 or £20 on a licence in some particular week?  Take somebody who is unemployed with a family.  This is an outlet, an occupation for that person. Even though £10 is a small amount of money, if you are trying to live on £80 or £90 in a week some week a decision must be made that this week you are not going to have £10 for food or whatever it is, because you will just have to spend it on a fishing licence.  They will not do that. Therefore, are we criminalising people who cannot afford to pay the licence fee? That is the difficulty I have.  I ask the Minister to come back on that and I will read over with interest what he has to say on it.</P>
    <P>For that and other reasons, this measure is almost unimplementable.  I have been reading through the Bill and the Explanatory Memorandum and I have great difficulty with parts of them.  Maybe because it was a quick reading I did not interpret it properly, but the idea of the different licences and the need for having licences for any kind of fishing creates a number of problems for me that perhaps the Minister could explain.  If I am at the seaside next summer with a number of my children and I want to show them how to fish, as many parents have done time and again, and if I put a line on a bamboo cane and a hook on the end of it, and if I bait the hook and throw that line into the water &mdash; and this is the only day of the year that I will ever fish &mdash; am I breaking the law?</P>

The Minister has assured me that that cannot happen.  Similarly, if I were to go fishing in a stream with a trout licence and if, because I use the wrong hook, bait or whatever, I manage not to catch a trout but something else for which I did not have a licence &mdash; say, a perch or pike &mdash; and if a bailiff were to come ambling along the bank just as I was landing the fish &mdash; while it was under the water I would not know what it was, and ignorance being no excuse in the eyes of the law &mdash; does that leave me liable to a fine of £500 and/or two years imprisonment?</P>

      <P>I have just mentioned two or three points in this Bill which will give me sleepless nights.  Innocent people are being exposed to fines of up to £500 and/or imprisonment of up to two years, because they are enjoying themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am unconvinced that we need this Bill <Col N="489" /> because I think it will affect our tourism industry.  It reinforces the divided society.  A sum of £10 or £20 is small money for those of us who have managed to survive and exploit the system, but it is a lot of money for people who have to find it and this fee will create difficulties for those people.  These are two main groups I am concerned about &mdash; the tourism industry and the socially or economically disadvantaged members of our society.</P>
    <P>I have said time and again that the worst kind of legislation is that which is not implementable.  Unless I can be reassured on a number of points, I do not believe this legislation can be implemented, that it is necessary and that it is fair.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider whether we need to have this dramatic change in the laws governing licensing.  I find it extraordinary that a Government who talk fairly regularly about things like privatisation and deregulation, at a time when deregulation seems to be the God towards which we should all be bowing, are introducing more and, to my mind, unnecessary regulation. I would ask the Minister to reconsider these points and I will listen to his response with some interest.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is just one item I want to mention. In the Connemara area we have quite a few lakes which have been totally undeveloped over the past number of years due to the fact that there are not many angling clubs there.  Many of these <Col N="490" /> lakes and rivers are being taken over by major companies which are using them as hatcheries, and some of them are using them for fish farms.  I am worried that some of these fish farms and hatcheries are very prone to disease and from disease we get pollution.</P>
    <P>I would like to see some control of the lakes where these fish farms and hatcheries are, and, in particular, control of those fish farms and hatcheries which are under the private scheme.</P>
    <P>There have been many complaints about lack of finance and the Minister has thrown the ball back down to the local regional boards.  The main thrust of this is that he is allowing them to hold onto the finance which they collect.  That is a very important move because the money collected by a local authority in motor tax goes right back into the Central Fund.  The local fisheries boards can hold onto this money and it will be up to them to ensure that this money is collected and ploughed back to help the fishing industry.  That will help the tourism industry in the long term.</P>
    <P>However, £40 for a licence for a tourist is quite substantial.  There should be some sort of allowance made to try to entice in more of these fishermen.  A substantial number of them come from Wales and England and most of them would tell you that they come here because our lakes and rivers are pollution free.  Because of the pollution from fish farms and other industries I am worried that this will not be so in years to come.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that people under 18 years of age and over 65 years of age will be exempt from having to have a licence. We have high unemployment at present and I ask the Minister to consider letting the unemployed have free access to the rivers and lakes because I am sure many of these people who have a lot of leisure time would be interested in fishing but they could not afford to pay for a licence. It would be a good pastime for those people.  I welcome the Bill generally but I am worried about the pollution from fish farms and hatcheries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  As Senator McCormack rightly pointed out. we have not exploited our inland waterways to their full potential.  They are a great potential source of wealth.  There is fishing second to none in the Boyne and Blackwater rivers and in many of the lakes in north Meath.  There are good fishing waters in the Cavan area also in Lough Ramor, Lough Sheelin, which hopefully will be back to its best in the near future, Mullagh Lake and all the other lakes in that area.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned before in this House, I live in Kells on the main Cavan to Dublin road and one way of guaging the success of the tourist season is to go out in the morning and see the number of cars with small boats and fishing gear on their roofs passing through the town on their way to Cavan and north Meath. Unfortunately, in recent years they have not been as plentiful as they might have been but during the past year there was a marked improvement in the number of cars and I am glad of that.  The hotels and guesthouses in those areas depend to an extent on the fishing potential in that region and the money brought by that business permeates through the whole society.</P>
      <P>The problems in the fishing industry have been mentioned already by a number of Senators.  Pollution can overnight, and indeed in a matter of a few hours, destroy the fish life in rivers and undo the work of years.  Hopefully we have reached the stage where that problem is under control.  Diseases and drainage works, which have been condemned to some extent also cause damage to fish life.  A scheme was undertaken on the Boyne and Blackwater rivers and I must pay tribute to the Office of Public Works for the way the rivers were restored.  By and large the angling clubs and fishermen are very satisfied that a good job was done.  The spawning beds have been restored.  Stretches of the rivers differ from traditional rivers which meander along and some now look like canals. Nevertheless this is satisfactory from the point of view of fishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="492" /> Poaching has always been a big problem and it is one of which people like me who were brought up in rural areas would be very conscious.  I am sure it is a problem that still exists to some extent.  I do not live in a rural area any more but, as a child I saw stretches of rivers denuded of their fish overnight by some individuals who achieved notoriety and were famous because of their poaching.  It is a difficult job to patrol the rivers.  I understand the Eastern Regional Fisheries Board will have to let ten employees go this year and this is unfortunate.</P>
    <P>At present there is a lady fishery inspector in the Kells area and she does a very good job but she has an almost impossible task.  She is a fishery officer and a water pollution officer.  In addition she runs a hatchery in Virginia which was closed by the Department but which was taken over by a joint council of the Boyne anglers and is now operating very successfully. In effect what is going to happen is that there will be nobody to patrol any of the rivers from Bailieborough to Navan.  I think it was Senator Eogan who said that the allocations to the fisheries boards have been reduced by £1.8 million and I hope this is not so.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals with licences.  I have met representatives of the fishing and angling clubs in Kells and I understand they are in full agreement with this Bill and the charges for licences.  Even if only £500,000 is collected I am sure it will be put to good use.  I would be interested to hear further about the mechanics of the collection of the fees for the licences.  This is a problem and on Committee Stage we can go into it in more detail.</P>
    <P>I have referred before in this House to coarse fishing and angling.  In my young days fishing referred to coarse fishing and angling referred to trout and salmon fishing. They are more or less interchangeable now.  The point I want to make is that salmon caught by net are sold for £2 per lb.  I made the case before that every salmon caught by a tourist is worth several hundred pounds and a recent survey by Bord Fáilte came to the conclusion that such a salmon was worth £740 and in many instances coarse fish <Col N="493" /> such as pike, roach and perch could be valued at £1,000 per lb.</P>
    <P>In order to develop our fishing potential further we must guarantee that there are fish in the rivers.  We have no way of controlling the sun but I understand that with regard to fishing the weather is not very important.  When angling tourists come to this country they want to fish in the rivers.  Like other Members, I would like to see free fishing available but I am not sure that something is appreciated when it is free.  It is important that fish are available in the rivers and if this Bill achieves that purpose, it will have done a good days work.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator O'Connor that perhaps some way should be found of allowing people who are unemployed to fish without licences or at reduced charges. Poaching by people from Northern Ireland in our lakes and rivers constitutes a real problem.  I agree with Senator Doyle that if some way could be found with regard to a deferral of charges for tourists in the coming year it would be helpful.  Mention was made with regard to restrictions on fishing in private waters. That problem is evident in County Meath.  There are stretches of river convenient to the town of Kells that are owned privately.  People in the area do not have the right to fish in these rivers. That is wrong.  Everybody should be free to fish where they like, particularly when this Bill becomes law and they will have licences to fish.</P>
    <P>Section 12 refers to removing salmon from a river, no matter what way they are caught.  It is an offence if, for example, somebody gets a salmon which has been caught by an otter.  It seems that is the implication of that section.  It could possibly be a mistake to include that measure in the Bill.  As a young boy I walked along the river on many occasions and got salmon that were killed by otters.  People who come from rural areas will know that others eat a small portion of the salmon only.</P>
    <P>People under 18 years or over 66 years will not have to pay a licence fee.  I appreciate that.  Perhaps young people <Col N="494" /> over 18 years of age and attending third level or second level educational institutions should also have a right to fish without licences.</P>
    <P>Finally, as the Minister has said, sea fishing has great potential.  On many occasions in the past I have gone to Clogherhead in the autumn and the pier there is always overcrowded.  It seems that no effort has been made to arrange boats or to arrange some proper way of coping with the crowds who come there to fish for mackerel.  I agree with the Minister that there is tremendous scope in that area.  As I have said, I have discussed this Bill with senior representatives of the angling fraternity in Kells and they are satisfied with it.</P>

      <P>Gabhaim buíochas leis na Seanadóirí go léir a tháinig anseo inniu agus a thaispeáin an tsuim atá acu san tionscal seo agus na Bhille seo chun Acht 1959 a leasú.  Déanfaidh mise mo dhícheall freagraí a thabhairt ar na ceisteanna éagsúla a chuir Seanadóirí.  Cuireann sé áthas mór orm chomh maith gur chaith na Comhaltaí oiread sin ama ag plé na ceiste seo in ainneoin go bhfuil sé chomh gar sin don Nollaig agus go mba mhaith leo bheith sa bhaile nó ar a mbealach abhaile go dtí a gceantair féin agus go dtí a dteaghlaigh chun an Nollaig a chaitheamh leo.</P>
      <P>First, I am pleased at the number of Senators who have remained here today to contribute to the Bill before us, the Fisheries (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1987, which relates to the introduction of licences for trout and coarse angling on our rivers and lakes.  It is particularly gratifying, at this late hour on a Friday evening and so near Christmas when many people are on their way home to their constituencies and families, that Senators with a particular interest in this Bill have remained here.  I would like to pay a particular tribute to all of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the Senators raised very interesting points, many of them raised similar points and I will try to deal with them as best I can.  In response to the query by Senator MacCormack regarding the long <Col N="495" /> title of the Bill which he read out, this is not something which was prepared by me but by the parliamentary draftsman and approved by the Attorney General.  Need I say any further than they would have tried to ensure that it would have been a much shorter version if that were possible.</P>
    <P>The 21 day licence which was referred to was directed specifically to tourist anglers.  I would like at the outset to refer to the various licence fees.  One would get the impression that they are so exorbitant that they will have a great effect on the tourist industry, that if this Bill is enacted on 1 January 1988 immediately the message will go out to the world, in particular to the UK and to the Continent, that there has been a substantial increase in some fishing licences, particularly salmon licences and that there is a new licence fee for coarse angling.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons we have decided to introduce this Bill is that trout and coarse fish anglers benefit very substantially from State expenditure on the development and protection of our trout and coarse fisheries.  There should be some contribution towards the cost of such development.</P>
    <P>People have mentioned golf and various other sports.  Let us for a minute pause and draw a few simple comparisons. If one wants to play one day's golf &mdash; not 21 days' golf &mdash; the fees range from £12 to £18.  If one went to any football match the admission fee would vary from £1 to £5 for an hour or an hour and a half's entertainment.  I do not think any of us here would know precisely what it costs to go to a film because politicians do not have the opportunity to avail of this leisure time but, having checked with some people who do have such an opportunity, I found it costs £4 to £5 and much more to go to the theatre.  Is there any comparison between that and a day's fishing &mdash; not alone one day's fishing but 21 days fishing.  If we do not want to sell this industry abroad, a very simple catch phrase can be used to those who want to use the 21 days licence for coarse fishing: <Col N="496" />&ldquo;Fish in Ireland 24 hours of the day for 24p a day&rdquo;, and that is precisely the choice we are introducing.</P>
    <P>This House like the lower House passed the Estimates and realised that we have a serious problem in this country which has been going on for a number of years.  We must try and reverse it.  We could have given £3.8 million to the Central Fisheries Board to run both the board and the regional boards in 1988.  While I can be contradicted, I wonder how many references were made to the £1 million and what suggestions were made as to where further moneys could be raised. All politicians should be responsible.  We can all fly kites and take the popular stance and say there should be no charges for anything.  People here today suggested that there should be no charges for this but I have yet to hear in this House a suggestion as to where the finance should come from.  We have this right across the board.  We have got to be responsible and if we say that there will be £.5 million less for the boards if we do not introduce this, let us have suggestions on where the money should come from, realistic suggestions, not some of the unrealistic suggestions which are made by politicians and, indeed, many people outside the House.</P>
    <P>The cost of coarse fishing per day for 21 days is 24p.  The yearly one is 3p.  For 21 days fishing for trout it is 48p.  The yearly one is 4p.  Salmon fishing for 21 days is £1.  I sincerely hope that everyone will go out to fish for salmon over the 21 days.  Indeed, I am told that it is not the actual catching of the salmon &mdash; it certainly adds to it &mdash; but actually spending the day at the side of the river that costs £1 approximately per day.  Over the year it is 7p per day and the composite licence to which anyone is entitled costs 11p per day.  Those are the facts.  I appreciate &mdash; and I do not want Senators to get me wrong &mdash; the psychology that is attached to it.  For very many years we had free fishing in Ireland and people came here as a result of that.</P>
    <P>I should remind the House that, long before Senator Mooney and many others were born, the salmon licence fee was <Col N="497" /> introduced and I have not seen it as being detrimental to the inland fisheries or to tourism.  All Senators should appreciate fully that this is not a means of raising taxes for the Exchequer to dispense in other ways; it is a means of raising a tax to supplement the millions which the taxpayer and not the Government, pay towards inland fisheries.  If we are to suggest that there should be no increase in this, in effect what we are suggesting is that the hard pressed taxpayer should be paying more moneys to supplement this £3.8 million which is being paid.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Senator McCormack suggest that it could be much higher than £500,000.  Lest there be any ambiguity about it, there is no suggestion here that if we reach £500,000 that goes to the boards and anything in addition goes to the Exchequer.  The solemn commitment I gave I repeat: all of the money raised by way of fees will go to the various regional boards in which they are collected. It was also suggested that the fee should be £21 for 21 days and £25 annually. Then is it suggested that we make it £25 and give everyone an annual one?  I suggest that we should leave it.</P>
    <P>I would welcome it if we could increase it, but I think it would be unrealistic and I do not think it was the point that Senator McCormack made.  The point he made was that the extra £4 was barely worth collecting and it should all be £21.  That £21 is relatively cheap and anyone who lives in the country, or who wants to come back to the country a number of times throughout the year for an additional £4, can fish throughout the year for this.  It is the same on a <i>pro rata</i> basis as far as trout fishing and coarse fishing are concerned.</P>
    <P>Senator McCormack referred to the resistance out there by the public to this. There will always be resistance to any increase but on this one a solemn commitment has been given that this will be for the benefit of the industry, to develop our fisheries, to protect the fisheries, to curb pollution.  This is where the money is going.  It is in the best interests of these people and there is no point in enticing tourists to return to Ireland year after <Col N="498" /> year if the rivers become more polluted, if there are less fish in the rivers and if we stop any development of our fisheries. There is no point in inviting them to Ireland, this beautiful Ireland, the lakes and rivers of Ireland if the number of fish is decreasing each year.</P>
    <P>I would say to Members of this House and to the Members of the lower House who, incidentally, passed this by a vast majority, that if the Government feel it is right to introduce this type of legislation for the common good, we should do it. Having taken advice, of course, which we did in consultation with the Department of Tourism and Transport, this was circulated.  We got observations.  We in the Department of the Marine who have responsibility for the development of inland resources must take an overall view because, as everyone in public life will realise at any level, there is no way that there can be unanimity.  We have a responsibility to take the overall view and introduce the type of legislation which we feel is right.</P>
    <P>If my explanations are not acceptable to Senators they can tease it further out on Committee Stage.  All of us have a duty to sell this to those who oppose it most.</P>
    <P>I very much appreciate the points made by all Senators, particularly those from Leitrim.  Indeed, I was awaiting an amendment that it was so important to Leitrim that Leitrim should be exempted from it.  That is not possible.  It is important to the country as a whole, vitally important to the economy and if we as a Government thought &mdash; if I and the Minister for the Marine thought &mdash; that this would be detrimental to the industry and to the economy, we would not introduce it.  We are doing it because we feel it is the one way of extracting this extra finance which is going to the boards and that those who can enjoy 21 days at 24p a day, fishing 24 hours a day will gladly contribute towards it.  In the long run it is to their own advantage and their own benefit.  It is vitally important to various regions of the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="499" /> The midlands and part of the Northwest were mentioned.  At times it is gratifying to go through County Cavan and stop in a particular restaurant where one hears more German being spoken than Irish or English.  This indicates to me the importance of fishing to tourism in that area.  I doubt if the extra 11 pence per day would buy a mixer for a drink of spirits.  I think we are over-reacting to the introduction of this charge.  There would be greater criticism of the Department if we did not introduce some form of licensing.  It was not accepted some years ago because of indecisiveness and trying to appease the minority instead of trying to do what is right for the industry and the common good.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney referred to a letter in <i>The Irish Times</i> of yesterday regarding the cost of a licence in Holland and in some other continental countries.  In Holland a licence costing £2 entitles a person to fish for all species of fish, while a similar licence in Germany cost £3 last year.  I have gone through this prior to the debate and have not seen any reference to quantity and quality which we can so proudly brag of in our respective areas.  He also referred to a query to my Department which I will pursue.</P>
    <P>The Central Fisheries Board would have realised that this Bill was being introduced, but before a Bill is circulated it has to be approved by the Government. That may have well been the reason for the Central Fisheries Board saying that they were not aware of it.  I cannot go along with the suggestion that the Central Fisheries Board are to be disbanded at the end of this year.  That is not to say they will not be disbanded.  I will refer to that at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Certainly free fishing is synonymous with coarse and trout fishing in the lakes and rivers of Ireland.  What better catchphrase could we have than &ldquo;fish in Ireland 24 hours a day for 21 days at 24p a day&rdquo;? Compare that to green fees, entrance to football matches or films.  Salmon fees were there long before some of the Senators were born and we have seen no great difficulty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="500" /> As far as I and my Minister are concerned, there is no question of locking the door.  I have said time and time again that we are interested in consultation with Members of both Houses and all in the industry.  If there are any problems they want to discuss with us, we are there to assist.  We should also remember that there were cases under the existing law before the court in Manorhamilton a few weeks ago.  The only complaint I got from public representatives was that the court was too severe on people polluting our rives and lakes.  We cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney made a statement the phraseology of which would need of be corrected.  He said that the Minister is aware of gangsters who are fishing illegally.  If any Minister was aware of gangsters who were fishing illegally he would not be worthy of being a Minister of State.  What he meant was that Ministers are aware that certain individuals may be fishing illegally.  If the Minister knew the House could be quite sure that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe the Senator would inform him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;action would be taken very quickly.  Senator Doyle referred to a meeting of the Eastern Health Board which he attended recently.  As I said earlier, the Minister for Tourism and Transport was consulted in relation to the introduction of the licences and the views of the Minister were taken into account when reaching a decision on the range of licences that should be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Senators made the reasonable suggestion that tourists should be exempt during the year 1988. Prior to the debate in the Seanad we spent many long hours into the early hours of the morning looking at the various groups that could be exempted.  The only groups which we felt we could exempt, because we could define them without any difficulty, were those under 18 and over 65. I do not go along with the view of a Senator who suggested that those over 65 <Col N="501" /> should be able to afford this.  I feel that we should introduce this exemption and it is one which has been welcomed.  If we were to exempt all of the groups suggested here there would be no point in introducing this legislation.  It would be extremely difficult to define &ldquo;tourists&rdquo; going from, say, from Donegal to Cavan. It is also very difficult to define &ldquo;students&rdquo;. This has to be introduced for the whole community.  If we were to exempt various groups the administrative costs would then be greater that the actual income.</P>
    <P>I would say to Senator Eogan that if the Bill is enacted the Department will insert advertisements in the daily newspapers and angling magazines explaining the licensing system in a simple way for the information of trout and coarse fish anglers.  A question was raised in relation to riparian rights.  The position will be precisely the same as in regard to salmon and we have seen no difficulties over the years as far as that is concerned.</P>
    <P>This money will be used for protection and development and the curbing of pollution in order to assist the industry. While no one could be so naive as to give a categoric assurance, we will do our utmost to ensure that this legislation will be implemented and policed.  I recall that there was a case in Limerick recently where a person was taken before the courts, charged and convicted and made responsible for restocking a particular river.</P>
    <P>It is also important to note that Ministers from the Departments of the Marine, the Environment, Tourism and Transport and Agriculture and Food have set up a working committee and that the Minister for the Environment will be introducing legislation.  Working groups are advising the Ministers.  My Department will also ensure that penalties will be increased.</P>
    <P>There was reference to those under 18 years and over 66 years of age.  Suffice it to say that those exempt under the provisions of this Bill can be required to produce documentary evidence.  We <Col N="502" /> cannot do anything about that requirement. One cannot determine a person's age by looking at them.  For example, a bus pass or any other such evidence of a documentary nature would be acceptable.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear from Senator O'Callaghan that he derives quite a substantial amount of income from this industry, that he does not feel that the provisions of this Bill will have the serious effects some Members believe they will have.  He said the days of the free lunches are over.  This is not a question of extracting fees from people to put them into the national exchequer and dispense with those funds in other ways.  I cannot reiterate often enough that all of these moneys &mdash; not limited to £500,000 but hopefully, as Senator McCormack said, it will be much higher bearing in mind the prospective 100,000 trout anglers, 10,000 coarse fish anglers and 3,000 tourist anglers whose fishing activities should generate a much larger income &mdash; will be put back into the coffers of the central and regional fisheries boards.</P>
    <P>There will be no question of additional staff being deployed.  The provisions will be operated in the same way as those in respect of a salmon licence.  It will not be a question of having to travel to the headquarters of the regional fisheries boards, such as Ballyshannon for all the north-west, or Ballina or Galway in order to purchase licences.  These licences will be available in many shops, hotels and tourist offices throughout the regions.  If we foresee any difficulty in that respect we shall extend those facilities.  We will be anxious to ensure that anybody can obtain a licence seven days of the week. If there are any difficulties encountered in that respect we will act very speedily to ensure that the licences are available.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Seanadóir de Buitleár &mdash; fear a bhfuil an-suim aige san timpeallacht &mdash; gur dóigh leis go mbeidh daoine sásta an ceadúnas seo a íoc os rud é go bhfuil siad ag fáil cothrom na Féinne.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh na daoine seo ag fáil cothrom na Féinne agus go mbeidh an £.5 mhilliún seo ar a laghad ag dul ar ais chuig na boird reigiúnacha iascaigh.  Tá súil agam <Col N="503" /> go mbeidh sé níos mó ná sin agus má tá, beidh siad ag fáil níos mó ná cothrom na Féinne, más féidir é sin a rá.  Chaith an Stát £4.813 mhilliún anuraidh ar iascaireacht.</P>
    <P>These cuts were absolutely necessary. All Departments have had to swallow the bitter pill.  We had to devise ways and means of effecting cutbacks but we decided we could reduce our expenditure by £1 million without having to find this money elsewhere.  As public representatives, we can sell this to the public on the grounds that it is in the best interests of all concerned.  There was reference to the cost of a brown trout licence.  The maximum fee for a trout licence is £15.</P>
    <P>I refer to the Ministerial committee set up to curb the incidence of pollution.  I can assure Senators that no time will be wasted in this respect.  Senator J. O'Toole felt that the introduction of these licence fees could be detrimental and spell the death knell for the fishing industry.  I cannot accept that view.  I go along with those who appreciate that their imposition is necessary and that it constitutes a cheap form of entertainment.  It is a natural resource from which many benefit. He referred to the necessity to consider granting a general hotel licence for guests.  We examined all of these possibilities but ascertained that that would not be possible.  We have not done an exact calculation in regard to collection costs.  I might add that the administrative system is already in place.  Therefore, the costs should be minimal.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole who said he had read the Bill several times referred to the time he spends with his children on the seafront.  He asked whether he would be committing a crime if one of his children or he himself had a rod, line and bait and cast it into the sea.  That is the only Christmas present I can bring to the House today.  It does not cost anything to do that.  We are talking here about inland fisheries, not sea fisheries.  Therefore, he can take all his children to the sea.  I might add that it is even a cheaper form of entertainment if people want to engage in it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="504" /> I am gratified at the responsible attitude of the Members of this House in relation to fines.  In the other House the impression was given that if you caught a pike while fishing for a trout you could spend two years in Mountjoy and on conviction on indictment could be fined a maximum penalth of £2,000.  That sort of irresponsible attitude, particularly on the part of people who should know better &mdash; by people in the legal profession who tried to introduce a red herring &mdash; is regrettable.  They should know better. That is the maximum fine.  It is contained in the provisions of the Consolidation Act, 1959, and its imposition is at the discretion of the courts.  I might reiterate that if a person is fishing for salmon or trout and lands a pike or a perch then the same obtains as has been the case since the salmon licences were introduced.  I have yet to hear of a case where anybody was brought to court, fined £500, and sentenced to two years in jail for catching a perch while fishing for salmon.  All of those people who fish as a sport would throw that type of fish back into the water.  I would be very interested to hear of any case where such penalties were imposed.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Conchubhair referred to the difficulties that might be encountered in 1988.  While I might like to concede to his request my advice is that it is not possible and would be very difficult to implement.  Senator Fitzsimmons referred to the importance of this activity generally to the economy.  It is of vital importance.  With this extra finance we will do our utmost to curb pollution and overcome the poaching problem.  The question of riparian rights was raised. They can be taken into consideration.  If one has riparian rights then one has to have a licence unless one is under 18 or over 66 years of age.</P>
    <P>The objective of this Bill is to provide a more equitable way by which funds for the future development and protection of our inland fisheries will be available.  The Minister and I, since our appointment to the Department of the Marine, have taken the question of inland fisheries very seriously.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="505" /> The Department of the Marine have taken the question of inland fisheries very seriously.  Despite the reservations of many Senators, we will find that this will improve the situation.  However Senators vote in relation to this, when we leave this House we have a duty and an obligation to build up this industry.  If I can give any further explanations at this Stage and on Committee Stage I will be only too pleased to do that.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>On the issue of riparian rights, I would like to refer the Minister to what Deputy Haughey, as Minister for Agriculture, said in the Dáil on 28 April 1966 at column 1010:</P>
      <P>Riparian owners and their families are also exempt.  That was the attitude of mind in which we put forward this proposal.  It was not to deprive the people of rights they have had for hundreds of years ... The fishing of the waters will still be free.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister indicate to me why it is that the question of riparian rights has now been eliminated or seems to be eliminated from the Bill?  It is a word I was not even aware of until today but, for the benefit of the House, what that means is that if the Bill passes the people who own the banks of the rivers or the banks of the lakes on which inland coarse fishing takes place will now have to apply for and will need to have in their possession a specific licence in order to fish what is, essentially, their own property.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>We are <Col N="506" /> not deviating at all from the regulations that are there as far as families are concerned. If we deviate from that now we are discriminating between one who has riparian rights and one who has not, providing that one who has riparian rights could be exempt from having a licence for trout and coarse fish but must pay for salmon.  That is the case.  There is a licence for salmon.  There will be a licence for the use of waters and after that those who own their own land can fish there and can issue a permit to others to do that if they wish.  It is up to each angling association.  It is a question of permits from the angling associations as well but this is a general national licence which we are introducing and that is all we can do.  We cannot, and have no intention of introducing any statutory regulations which would impose a burden on the angling associations.  If they run their fisheries and assist in restocking they, then have the right to consider permits. There may be a little ambiguity in regard to permits and riparian rights but that is the general intent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I must have misunderstood the Minister.  Section 2 (h) refers to &ldquo;the deletion of the definitions of ... trout rod (riparian owner) ...&rdquo;. It is the only reference in the Bill to riparian owners.  I am not talking about salmon fishing.  I am talking about inland coarse fishing, about trout and pike and perch and all the other coarse fish that would be of particular interest in the area from which I come.  Perhaps I misunderstood the Minister but that is what I wanted clarification on.  It is the only reference in the Bill and it suggests to me, as a layman, that the owner of the banks along which there are lakes will now have to apply for a licence to fish what is essentially his own land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">

      <P>On section 2 I ask the Minister to refer back to my earlier request in regard to the £21 licence for 21 days versus £25 for 365 days.  My interpretation of it is that for administrative purposes and for every other purpose it would appear logical that the £21 annual fee would be universal for both types.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The position at the moment is that countrywide the average fee is £17.  It can go as low as £8 but the average is £17.  The £21 was introduced specifically with a view to tourists, and the £25 was taken in with a view to many people in this country who want to fish more than 21 days.  There has to be a differential and we decided that if it would be £21 for the full year there would be a case to be made for reducing that to £17 or £16 for the 21 days.  Let me allay the Senator's fears by saying that this will not create any administrative difficulties. Rather, I would say that £4 is cheap for the additional 344 days.  That would be my interpretation.  This was raised in the Dáil as well and was accepted.</P>

I have not put in an amendment, but I wonder if the Minister would use his good offices to delete that part of the section.  Possibly there are not many landowners who will want to fish but I think it should be deleted.</P>

      <P>Section 4 provides for fines on summary conviction not exceeding £500 and fines not exceeding £2,000, at the discretion of the court.  In addition to the fees taken in from fishing licences, will the money taken in from fines also be ploughed back through the central and regional fisheries boards to the inland fisheries?  The Minister indicated in his reply to the debate that the Estimate for the Department was cut back by £1 million.  It appears from that as if the budget would be reduced.  It is estimated that the amount taken in will be £500,000.  I anticipate that it will be more.  The Minister said that if it is more it will also be used for the same purposes. If the amount taken in, through fines and licences, exceeds £1 million &mdash; the amount that was cut back from the Estimates &mdash; would it still be used for the development of fisheries through the fisheries boards and the inland fisheries? Over the last six years the central and regional board budget allocation was, respectively, approximately £5 million, £5 million, £5.2 million, £4.8 million, £5.4 million, £5.7 million and £5.7 million.  If we lose £1 million of that straight away, how can we provide the extra services referred to by the Minister when we get back £500,000 of the £1 million we are using?  The services provided this year were bad but would they not be worse next year in such circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first question in relation to the fines is that it is not the Department of the Marine who will take the case.  It will be the regional board and the fines will go <Col N="509" /> back to the regional board.  It will obviously supplement the fees.  There is nothing in the Act to suggest that anything in excess of £500, or £1 million, as the case may be, would not go to the board.  Any such suggestion would have to be included specifically.  All of the licensing fees together with the fines go to the boards.  I would like to draw to the attention of the House that the Exchequer grants to fisheries and boards from 1983 to 1987, respectively, were as follows: £4.515 million, £4.100 million, £4.7775 million, £5.017 million and £4.813 million.  The total for those years was £23.230 million which is a substantial contribution and investment by the State.</P>
      <P>I would like to be more conservative than Senator McCormack.  The figure we have budgeted for is realistic.  If it is more than £1 million, the excess, too, will go to fisheries.  I should be very pleased if the Senator is not disappointed in his optimism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that there has been an average budget of approximately £5 million, or slightly more, for the five or six years to which he referred.  We can all talk about putting fish back into the rivers and improving the situation for the home or tourist angler or any other type of foreign angler but we cannot do that with a budget reduced by £1 million, which we are hoping will be made up by way of £500,000 in the coming year.  We will be talking about a real budget of £500,000 less next year.  We cannot put the fish back into the river for any type of angler, on that type of a budget.  The Minister has made a great case here this evening, and he has impressed me, as regards the justification for the licence fees but that in itself is not good enough.  I would be very impressed if he made the case that this amount of money would be spent on regional boards and on inland fisheries if the budget was even the same as last year, or if this was extra expenditure over and above the budget of last year.  It is like the case of the local authority charges. When we introduced charges at local <Col N="510" /> authority level we found that, instead of being thanked for doing so, our budget was cut further the following year, and further again the following year, this year and every other year since local charges came in.  Are we in danger of the same thing happening if the target in this respect be exceeded next year?  Will whatever Minister for Finance is there say &ldquo;now we can safely take £2 million off the fisheries budget next year?&rdquo;  That is the real danger I see in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer that question.  I have given a categoric assurance. I can only speak while I am in office and I can speak for the Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry, who will be there next year.  I would be delighted if we could exceed £1 million and go to £2 million.  It would certainly alleviate many of the problems.  Senator McCormack initially had been very helpful to me in making the point but the fact of my being delighted with his optimism should be no reason to try to reverse the situation now by saying what might happen.  We have got to be realistic.  I do not want it to go out from this House that the Senators are suggesting that we are not doing what we should be doing.  I am trying to impress on the general public, those who desire to spend their leisure hours fishing, that they should contribute in a small way towards this activity.  We can agree do differ but time will tell.  I think it will be a figure in excess of £500,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator also referred to the restructuring of the boards.  It does not necessarily follow that restructuring of the boards will reduce or affect the service in any way.  The prime objective is to consider the restructuring of the boards with a view to making better use of the finances which are already available, £3.8 million plus approximately £1.5 million. I would like to make the point at this stage, because I may not get the opportunity later, as all Senators will be aware, a restructuring of the boards is currently being considered.  I can also assure the House that no firm decisions have been made as to what the future structures will be.  There are many references to the <Col N="511" /> fisheries boards in the text of the Bill.  It is necessary that the responsibility for inland fisheries is with the fisheries board. I have, at this stage, firm proposals for Government as to what form of restructuring should take place but Senators will appreciate that in such a complex and important matter, Government agreement to my proposals would be a prerequisite to my formally announcing these proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his assurance that no decisions have been made regarding the restructuring of the boards even though the matter is under consideration.  I presume that Senators and others will have an opportunity to have an input in that regard.  In other words, is legislation necessary if the Minister is to come up with a restructured board?  I would drop the matter now if that is the case because I would have an opportunity of having an input again.</P>

      <P>In section 4 we have the first reference to age.  Despite the Minister's very impressive presentation, I agree with Senator McCormack.  I must confess &mdash; and I have probably been a little parochial &mdash; that I am not totally convinced that it will not have an adverse effect in my own area.  Despite the contributions of some of my colleagues from other parts of the country, Leitrim and Cavan is a very highly developed area. The angling and voluntary associations, over a period of 25 years have attracted cross-channel anglers.  They are at present very vulnerable, perhaps it is because of the nature of the environment in which they have to live and work.  I do not want to cry here about County Leitrim but I know all Members of the <Col N="512" /> House understand what I am saying. Consequently any concession I can obtain I hope the Minister will understand that it would be in that spirit that I would ask this particular question.  Why or how was this decision arrived at that it should be at 66 years of age upwards that no licence would be required?  I understand, for example, that one is eligible for retirement pensions at 65 years of age.  How did the Minister arrive at 66 years, and would he not consider bringing it back to 65 years which seems to be the norm for retirement pensions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision was taken that those in receipt of the old age pension at 66 years of age, and not the retirement pension at 65 years, would be exempt as the income of a person is slightly higher on a retirement pension than on an old age pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister one question about the exemption of persons over 66 years of age.  The Office of Public Works have fishing rights of the Muckross lake, a salmon fishing lake &mdash; I know we are not dealing with salmon fishing here but perhaps it might be relevant to this Bill &mdash; and prior to this anybody over 66 years had the right to fish there without paying a fee or a licence.  The Office of Public Works have changed their mind about that recently. In view of the fact that the Minister of State will allow old age pensioners to fish free on the other rivers, would he convey a request to the Office of Public Works that they might extend free fishing in their Muckross fisheries to those people who are over 66 years of age?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difficulty here.  We have to differentiate between licences, which are national and permits which are issued at a local level.  The point raised by the Senator concerns a permit and I appreciate his concern but, of course, we would have no jurisdiction over that as it is a permit rather than a licence.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="513" />&ldquo;The provision of subsection (1) of this section shall not apply in respect of the fishing for or taking or killing by a person who has not reached his eighteenth birthday or has reached his sixty-sixth birthday&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister was very forthcoming in his assurance to Senator J. O'Toole that his children could be assisted.  The Minister was really saying, that commonsense would prevail in all situations.  I ask the Minister in his reply on Committee Stage to define that situation again.  For example, no more than Senator O'Toole could I assist my children, in their fishing activities when they go out to see their grandmother in Ballyconneely?  We go up to the lake and I may hold a rod for them, even though they are very capable themselves.  Perhaps the Minister could assure us of the mechanics of that situation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>We are referring to sea angling.  There is no discrimination. Not alone Senator O'Toole's children or Senator McCormack's children, but all children in this country are treated equally. Anyone under 18 years can fish on shore, and everybody irrespective of age, whether they are 8 months, 8 years or 80 years can go sea angling without charge.</P>

      <P>I would like to make a small point in relation to those under 18 years not having to have a licence, especially as it would apply to my own district.  It gives those under 18 years a great opportunity to have salmon in their possession illegally.  What is the situation if they go to sell a salmon?  Up to this, you had to have a licence before you could actually sell a salmon and your ordinary salmon fishing licence was sufficient if you wanted to sell a salmon in the ordinary way or have a salmon on your possession.  It really opens up the poaching scene very much to 18 year olds. There are many 18 year olds poaching in the County Wicklow and County Dublin districts and I am sure in many other districts around the country.</P>

It is very appropriate that you should raise this point, as I and my officials gave very serious thought to the situation that could arise when drafting the Bill.  I hope that will alleviate your fears; there is no exemption there.</P>

      <P>Freshwater fish is a new definition covering salmon, trout, coarse fish and eels.  This section amends section 99 of the Consolidation Act, which relates to restriction on erection of fishing weirs, fishing mill dams or fixed engines in the freshwater portion of any river.  The new subsection states that the provisions of section 99 of the Principal Act do not apply to long lines used solely for the capture of eels or to engines used for capturing fish other than freshwater fish.  This new subsection is identical to the existing subsection except that it refers to &ldquo;other than freshwater fish&rdquo;, which is salmon, trout, coarse fish or eels rather than &ldquo;other than salmon, trout or eels&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister to deal more fully with this.  He did not deal with it in the course of his reply to all of the points raised by Senators, and I raised this point in my initial contribution.  What type of action is being taken against the illegal monofilament netting method which according to the people I talk to in Connemara and in various places in the west, is really stopping the fish from coming up the lakes and rivers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Senator is referring to section 12, which refers to penalties for taking fish unlawfully killed or found dead.  This section is very technical and our advice was that rather than amending section 170 of the Principal Act we should re-enact all of the section and include coarse fish as part of it.  Penalties relate to all the fish mentioned in section 170 of the original Act together with coarse fishing, and that was the advice we received.  There are no penalties in relation to various types of rods, lines and nets that could be used, but in relation to types of fish.</P>

      <P>The question that you basically ask is, is it the Government or the Department who are responsible. The regional board are at arms length from the Department.  It is a matter for regional boards to take action in relation to illegal fishing.  If any Member of the House would be aware of instances of illegal fishing which the regional boards, for whom I have the greatest respect and who are doing a tremendous job under difficult financial circumstances, would not know about I would be only too delighted to pass on this information.  But illegal fishing is being dealt with.  I instanced four cases in County Leitrim, one further south in the country.  The Leitrim cases came before the courts last week and I do believe that the fines were substantial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister has said here.  He has recognised the wonderful work that the regional boards are doing under difficult financial circumstances.  Everybody's belief is that because of the budget of the regional boards they are not able to carry out their duties as satisfactorily as they themselves would wish to do.  Is the Minister saying that if the boards report this difficulty to the Minister appropriate action can be taken where they know if illegal activities but have not the manpower or the finances to follow them up themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might draw a comparison, all health boards and regional fisheries boards and tourism boards have financial limitations.  They are using those finances to the best of their ability.  I understand that they at all times bring before the courts cases where fishing is taking place illegally.  If they <Col N="517" /> were not taken before the court Senator McCormack should be asking further questions.  If any board who found that there are illegal activities taking place within the regional board I would be very angry if those cases were not taken before the courts.  Senator McCormack asked about fines and I gave him the categoric assurance that fines would go back into the fisheries boards and not to the Exchequer.  It is very much in our interest to do that.  We win some and we lose some, but I would prefer to take a case before the courts and to lose it rather than take a decision that we should not take them before the courts because there is a calculated risk.</P>

      <P>In my Second Stage contribution, I expressed my concern about the question of poaching and I thank the Minister for his graciousness in relation to my verbal <i>faux pas.</i>  I hope the Minister understands that as the matter I referred to received considerable national media attention, it was in that context that I was referring to his awareness and not suggesting any impropriety on his part.  I would also like to take issue with what he has said in relation to the restructuring of the fishery board.  I will not go beyond that because the Minister obviously will be bringing forward proposals in the New Year.  In the context of the experience I and people in my home town had in relation to very sophisticated poachers who, as Senator McCormack said, used monofilament nets, obviously were not amateurs and who came back time and time again, I have to say this continued not because of a lack of inclination on behalf of the Central Fisheries Board or the supervisory authorities but because simply of lack of resources and manpower and also the need on behalf of the local people to have definite and specific evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words it was suggested to them they would have to catch these people physically in the act in the middle of the night most of the time which was an impracticability.  I would like to impress upon the Minister that I would hope that when he is bringing forward his proposals <Col N="518" /> in the context of this section that the resources that will be provided for the detection and subsequent prosecution of these people will be given a top priority by his Department.  I would like to refer to portion of the letter that I mentioned earlier from Mr. Maher in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Thursday, 17 December, in relation to the question of the Central Fisheries Board where he said: We need more than office-bound waterkeepers.</P>

Could I ask specifically of the Minister, in the context of his own awareness and of what Senator McCormack and I have said about this professional illegal poaching that is going on in our inner lakes, would he not consider increasing the penalty from £500?  It seems to me a little unfair that if one as an amateur fisherman breaks the law that he will be fined up to £500 and if you are a professional group of people that you will equally before the law be only subjected to the same penalty.  Could he perhaps on Report Stage or at some future stage by order increase the maximum fine and also confiscate the equipment that would be found by the perpetrators of illegal poaching?</P>

In view of the fact that there is not unanimity between the views expressed in the Upper House and in the Lower House, then I would certainly have to stand back from this and look at it.  One House says that the fines should be reduced and this House says that they are not high enough.  On indictment which of course is a matter for the DPP, the fine is £2,000.

      <P>A number of suggestions have been made throughout this debate from all sides of the House, keeping in mind the implications for the tourism industry, to the Minister of State and he seemed amenable to at least conceding that they were valid even if he could not put them into operation.  Subsection (3) of this section says that this Act shall come into operation on such day or date as may be fixed thereof by any order or orders of the Minister.  Would the Minister of State, even at this late stage, consider granting a moratorium for a period of 12 months for coarse fishing on the basis of the argument which has already been put forward in that Bord Fáilte and all other tourist interests have their brochures and publications for 1988 printed and circulated throughout the United Kingdom and other areas from which we hope to attract people?</P>

      <P>The fisheries officers of the boards and the Garda Síochána will have the authority to do so.  A lot of consideration was given to the question over the last few days.  In fact, Senator Mooney has had discussions with me and I appreciate the fears and anxieties which people have.  I also appreciate the fact <Col N="522" /> that the brochures for 1988 are prepared. This is not a new Bill, it is an amending Bill.  I have had discussions with the Attorney General's Office and the advice which they have given to me and which I have accepted is that this Bill must come into operation on 1 January and that neither the Minister nor I have the power to defer its implementation.  Serious consideration was given to this question but the overriding factor in all of this is that we are anxious to raise these fees.  I am extremely confident that those involved in inland fisheries will be delighted to have the opportunity of contributing towards the development of our inland fisheries and the resolving of the problems in relation to pollution and all of the other problems which have knock-on effects.</P>

It is appropriate to include in that vote of thanks the Clerk and the Clerk Assistant and the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I should like to tell the Ministers, and the Ministers of State, who assisted the Seanad in the performance of our functions under the Constitution in this session, that we appreciated their courtesy and work in the House.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to express my thanks to the Cathaoirleach, the Leas-Chathaoirleach and Acting Chairmen for the help given to Members during the year.  I should like to thank the press for their <Col N="524" /> constant attendance at meetings of the Seanad and I extend thanks, too, to the reporting staff of the House, to the Editor of Debates, and the assistant editors, for their excellent work, work they are not often complimented on.  To the ushers and the other staff of the House who have given us assistance in the last session I should like to extend thanks and wish them a happy Christmas.  The Seanad, since the last election, has dealt with more legislation than any Seanad since the foundation of the State over a comparable period.  Critics have said that the general public do not realise what we are doing or that the business we are dealing with is not of importance but this Seanad has proved to be very effective.</P>
    <P>To the Clerk, the Clerk Assistant and the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas, I should like to extend good wishes for the Christmas season.  I should like to extend good wishes to the Leader of the main Opposition party, and the Leaders of the other groups.  We will be adjourning <i>sine die</i>, but I should like to remind Members that that does not mean that we will be adjourning for the same length of time as the Dáil adjourned.  We will be returning before the Dáil returns.</P>
    <P>My job in the last session as Leader of the House has been relatively easy.  On occasions I may have got upset with some Members, or upset Members, but my actions were always in the interest of the House.  If we keep the interest of the House in mind I do not think it matters if occasionally we have a blow up during debates in the Chamber.</P>

      <P>On behalf of my own group in the Seanad I should like to be associated with the sentiments expressed by the Leader of the House.  I join with him in thanking the Cathaoirleach, and the Leas-Chathaoirleach, both of whom have shown great fairness and impartiality, a great sense of the importance and the role of the House and who have always had the best interests of the House at heart.  I know that the spirit in which they assumed their office and in which <Col N="525" /> they carry out their duties is one which Members of all parties, and the Independents, appreciate.  The Independent Members certianly get cothrom na Féinne in the House and free speech is maintained for all.  On occasions one finds that being a Member of a major group is almost a disadvantage in terms of the amount of time given but that is politics, that is democracy.  It is exhibited in a very good way in the House.  I should like to be associated with the sense of appreciation, and thanks, to the people who make this House possible.  To the official reporters whose accuracy is renowned and who manage in the midst of sometimes slightly unseemly interchanges to catch even the nuances of what is said, I should like to say thanks.  I should like to pay my tribute to the officials of the House whose sense of courtesy, helpfulness and fairness is appreciated by all and to pay tribute to most of the newspapers who cover the affairs of the House.  I should like to pay tribute in particular to RTE, to <i>The Irish Times</i> which certainly does its best to ensure that the proceedings of the House are covered in a full and fair way, to the <i>Cork Examiner</i> which follows likewise and to the <i>Irish Independent</i> which does its best.  There should be silence so far as <i>The Irish Press</i> is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other people who make this House work and function well such as the ushers who are extremely helpful and courteous at all times.  Two people who can be overlooked at a time like this are the Whips of the two main groups.  Both of them share certain characteristics, they are quiet, they certainly do not obtrude themselves into the business of the House in any sort of offensive way but they go out of their way to be helpful to ensure that the House works in an efficient and fair way.  I should like to put on record my tribute to Senator Willie Ryan and Senator Jackie Daly for the fairness and the openness with which they approach their jobs.  There is one other group I should like to thank &mdash; the Government.  I should like the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, to convey our thanks to the Government who have given us the opportunity of taking many major Bills <Col N="526" /> for their first Reading.  From the point of view of the Government that has been worthwhile but I would not like the occasion to pass without it being said that we appreciate this.  I hope it is a tradition that will be continued.  In thanking those groups I should like to thank my colleagues in the House from all parties for their help in the course of the year and I wish a general sense of happiness and goodwill to all.</P>

My thanks are also due to the Leader of the House and to the Government Whip.  They have demonstrated to me the meaningful role that the Seanad can have.  I agree completely with what Senator Manning said.  Our compliments are due to the Taoiseach and to the Government for the amount of legislation that has been sent here and initiated here.  Certainly during my short time here this House has been given a meaningful role.</P>
      <P>I thank the staff of the House on behalf of the Labour Party.  I thank the press, the ushers.  Probably the most outstanding moment for me during this session was the debate that took place in the House in the aftermath of Enniskillen when there was total and unequivocal rejection of violence as a means of bringing about unity in this country.

      <P>I have notice from Senators Brian O'Shea and Paul Bradford that they propose to raise the following matter: (1) the need for the Minister for Health to rescind his decision to abolish the local health advisory committees; (2) to ensure the continuation and development of Mallow General Hospital's acute facilities and to insist that the necessary level of funding is provided to it.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand I have 12 <Col N="528" /> minutes to speak and that Senator Bradford will be using the remaining eight minutes.</P>
      <P>The kernel of what I am here to propose tonight I suppose I can illustrate initially from my area of Waterford which is part of the South-Eastern Health Board area.  We have lost five support hospitals and the voluntary hospital this year.  Two of these hospitals were in County Waterford, the Lismore District Hospital and the County and City Infirmary in Waterford.  On present trends it seems likely that the Dungarvan District Hospital is very much under threat in terms of the cutbacks which the South-Eastern Health Board must effect in hospital expenditure this year.</P>
      <P>The health boards are monolithic regional bodies.  When they were set up in 1971 the then Minister, later to be President of Ireland, Deputy Erskine Childers, introduced the local health committees, something of an extension of the old local county health authorities, in essence to maintain democratic connection between the smaller rural towns and the centre.  At the last meeting of the health committee in Waterford, one very well respected councillor spoke to the effect that we were moving down a road of dictatorship, that the democratic base of local government and health is being eroded.  The health committees have gone.  We are told we will have a fairly substantial reduction in the number of VECs and there is speculation that we may see town commissioners and some of the smaller urban councils being abolished. That is a general point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Essentially I am here tonight to demonstrate why the local health committees serve a very important role and should be maintained.  Again I draw the illustration from my own area but I know that a somewhat similar pattern applies throughout the country.  There are four electoral areas in County Waterford, each represented on the local health committee. There are three wards in Waterford Corporation, each represented also there.  We have the professional staff.  We have doctors who in some cases represent <Col N="529" /> hospitals.  We have representatives of the public nurses and the psychiatric nurses. Let me say in all sincerity that in the local authoriries and committees I serve on the discussions we have had at the local health committees have been extremely constructive.  In spite of fairly controversial times in the health area in the past few years, it is seldom that the discussion there descends into party political speeches.  Vast areas of County Waterford have no representation on the South-Eastern Health Board and the various councillors, from each party, can promote the interests first of all of their town or genetal area.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects to this.  Quite a number of groups with specialised interests have emerged in recent years. To illustrate the point I am making, one problem that has been highlighted in Waterford local health committee is in regard to speech therapists and how we are under-supplied in that regard.  In the main people who seem to need this help are mentally handicapped children and post-stroke patients.  There has been some small improvement in that area because of representations made by the local health committee to the South-Eastern Health Board, but there are many voiceless and disadvantaged groups in all our areas and it is very important that there is a forum where their case can be put forward.  I understand that in this type of representation not everybody can be met, and that is a real problem, but still it is vitally important that there is a forum where a case can be made, where it can continue to be pressed, and that we move along in this direction.  It is important from the members point of view &mdash; I have to compliment the CEO of the South-Eastern Health Board because he has a very good attendance record at local health committee meetings &mdash; that when changes are made in conditions relating to the various community care schemes which are in operation the public representatives get factual information from the officials at those meetings.  This means correct and solid information is being put out by the public representatives, the various voluntary <Col N="530" /> groups and the professions who in most areas would have prior knowledge.</P>
    <P>In general, I believe the health committee in Waterford have been constructive. The community know various groups will make representations to the committee who will make recommendations to the South-Eastern Health Board, and there is a certain amount of interplay.  For instance, when officials want to know what is the exact feeling in a particular area on a certain project, the public representatives, who have been put there by the people and who have the confidence of the people would have the best over-view.  In small areas, for instance, identifying sites for new health clinics, or where a lease on a health clinic runs out, as happened a couple of times, the local knowledge can be very important. The public representatives can advise of a number of buildings in the area which might be suitable and an arrangement might be worked out.</P>
    <P>In the health area we must, maintain the democratic input on as broad a basis as possible.  I know that not all the recommendations coming from the local health committee in Waterford could possibly be met in one year, or over a number of years, but it is important that people realise they are not being forgotten and that there are people who are promoting their case.  It is important that they read in local papers reports that indicate somebody cares about them and that their problem is not being neglected.  For those reasons, local health committees should continue in operation.</P>
    <P>Finally, on a point of clarification, the Minister's circular to the health boards stated that the functions of the local health committees were to be transferred to the health boards.  Could he be more explicit?  How can we maintain the direct input of the public representatives?  I see a problem here.  Public representatives in the main will no longer have a forum to pursue health issues.  They can, at their local authority meetings, put down notices of motion and so on but these notices of motion will be dealt with by way of correspondence and answers will <Col N="531" /> come back.  It is very important, in terms of the democratic operation of the health services, that the public representatives can put questions to the officials, can seek further clarification and pursue the matter further with the officials because if motions are being sent from local authorities, there will be long delays.</P>
    <P>People will feel strongly about a particular issue in an area, and if it only gets an airing in a local authority the people will not be satisfied.  The voluntary organisations have a direct input into the community care area.  At the local health committee meetings they can question the officials about what is happening. They can say that a grant is being given to a certain organisation this year, but there are special circumstances which make this a more expensive year on that organisation and they would ask for further funding.  My genuine fear is that we would be making many recipients of our services a bit more remote from what is happening.  They will not feel they have as much impact of the democratic process as is the case at present.</P>
    <P>I understand that the allocation to the Department is a basic problem and that the Minister is looking for areas in which to cut back.  It would be unfair of me not to say that the Minister, personally, has brought a caring approach to this area and I understand the limitations he is under.  I was interested to read last Sunday that he had become a Deputy before he became a councillor.  I do not know if he has ever served on a local health committee, but I feel that this measure is a retrograde step.  The savings in no way will represent the loss to the people.  I ask him to reconsider this decision in the light of its enormous importance to various groups in our society.  I would be particulary concerned about the groups serving the handicapped. There are many groups we can talk of here.</P>

      <P>As a former member of a local health committee I would like to concur with all the sentiments expressed by Senator O'Shea.  I would like to thank him for allowing me some of his time to raise the vitally important question of Mallow General Hospital.  You will forgive me if I read from my notes because I want to say as much as I can in the little time available to me.</P>
      <P>The case I wish to make here this evening for Mallow General Hospital is not one based simply on emotionalism as, I think we must admit, often occurs when we discuss the difficulties of a local hospital.  Instead, it is based entirely on solid facts and figures which clearly indicate beyond any doubt whatsoever the cost effectiveness of this hospital, the excellent record it has of keeping within its budget, the fine tradition of treatment and care in the hospital and its vital importance to the north Cork region.</P>
      <P>Mallow General Hospital at present has an allocation of 67 beds, 37 beds having been closed already.  It serves a population in the north Cork area of 72,000 people.  Even at the time when it had 103 beds its bed to population ratio was relatively low when you compare it with hospitals such as Portlaoise General Hospital which had 146 beds for a population of 53,000 &mdash; as you may well know yourself, a Leas-Chathaoirligh &mdash; and Tullamore Hospital which has 170 beds for a population of 60,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the House again that Mallow Hospital has 103 beds serving 72,000 people.  In terms of its financial position it has done spectacularly well to live within the confines of a reduced budget from the Southern Health Board. It has been doing so for quite some time. For example, in 1985 with a budget of £2.7 million 2,821 operations were carried out in Mallow.  The Tralee General Hospital, with a budget of £9.9 million, almost four times greater, carried out 5,200 operations, not even twice as many <Col N="533" /> despite their quadrupled budget.  The number of operations at Mallow General Hospital has increased from 893 in 1975 to 3,200 in 1987, which demonstrates clearly its importance to the area.  The number of general admissions in emergency cases dealt with has increased from 7,600 in 1978 to 14,070 in 1987.  It demonstrates clearly its importance to the area.</P>
    <P>The number of general admissions and emergency cases dealt with has almost doubled from 7,600 in 1978 to 14,070 in 1987.  The Minister may recall the tragic Buttevant rail disaster of 1979.  On that occasion the proximity of Mallow hospital and the outstanding work so quickly and effectively done there saved many lives.  Without it the picture would have been far worse.</P>
    <P>The average stay in Mallow hospital is six days and this is very favourable in comparison with other hospitals.  On a cost per day basis, and this is a vital point, the same work can be done at Mallow hospital for 70 per cent of what it costs at the Regional Hospital in Cork.  On that basis alone, sending patients from Mallow hospital to Cork hospitals is economic lunacy.  The importance of the hospital to the north Cork area can be gauged from the fact that some of the patients attending there travel 30 and 40 miles because it is their nearest hospital. If they had to go to Cork they would have to travel up to 60 miles.  We could be talking about life and death cases in those circumstances and many doctors in the Mallow area have publicly said that they would be willing to supply case histories of patients who would have died if it had not been for the proximity and availability of Mallow General Hospital.</P>
    <P>Because of their dependency on it the people of north Cork have solidly supported their hospital.  The Friends of Mallow Hospital Committee have raised tens of thousands of pounds for equipment for the hospital and, therefore, have a genuine stake in its future.  Mallow hospital has proved its worth and value. It turned a deficit of £60,000 in April 1987 into a surplus of £44,000 this October.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="534" /> Sacrifices have had to be made by the staff.  If every hospital in the Southern Health Board region and throughout the country had efficiency records similar or almost similar to Mallow hospital, the Minister's Department would not be suffering from some of the present financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>Because of their present financial difficulties the Southern Health Board are now proposing to save £1.5 million by transferring the acute facilities at Mallow hospital to Cork hospitals and basically letting Mallow hospital grind to a slow death.  It makes no economic sense whatsoever to do so.  If the patients being treated in Mallow hospital are moved to Cork hospitals all the figures conclusively prove that it will cost each patient an extra 20 per cent approximately.  What sort of saving would that be in both the short and long term?  As well as that there will be the dreadful and dangerous spectacle of patients having to travel over 60 miles, many on bad roads, to Cork hospitals where, if they are lucky enough to survive the extreme, journey, they will be far removed from their friends and neighbours and the extra special personal attention available at a hospital such as Mallow hospital.</P>
    <P>I realise the difficulties the Minister and his Department face.  I am glad the Minister stated publicly a few weeks ago that he does not wish to see further closures of acute hospitals.  I think it is time that the Southern Health Board were made aware of that view and were ordered to stop their plans for the closure of the acute facilities at Mallow General Hospital.  When we are talking about the health service today we have to admit that it has to be run in the most cost effective fashion possible.  There is clear evidence from the staff at Mallow General Hospital that they are willing to do this.  They have proved their record and they should be allowed to continue to prove their record.  In cases like this we are not talking about emotion we are talking about realism.  If commonsense is allowed to prevail in a case such as Mallow General Hospital the hospital will be allowed to remain.  I know that the <Col N="535" /> decision has to be taken by the Southern Health Board but because of the economics of the Southern Health Board at present councils in one area will be played off against councils in another area and the medical representatives in some areas will be opposed to counsellors in other areas.</P>
    <P>The case for Mallow General Hospital is one which requires no further proof. I hope the Minister will insist that the Southern Health Board change their plan for Mallow General Hospital.  That hospital has proved its worth and value and if commonsense is allowed to prevail, Mallow hospital will be allowed to serve the people of north Cork as successfully as it has done during the past number of years.  I appeal to the Minister to do his utmost.  The Southern Health Board are meeting next Tuesday to decide the future of the hospital and it is vital that the Southern Health Board management be made fully aware of the Minister's decision that no further cutbacks take place in acute hospitals.  The figures speak in favour of Mallow hospital.  The Minister has been asked to save hospitals where the figures spoke against them but in the case of Mallow hospital the figures speak clearly in its favour.  I would appeal to the Minister to come down in its favour and do his utmost to ensure its future for the people of north Cork and their health.</P>

      <P>I will deal with Senator Bradford's points first.  It is primarily a matter for the Southern Health Board to decide how they organise the services they can provide with the allocations made available for 1988.  The board have not yet made any decision with regard to their budget for 1988.  The management of the board have set out proposals on the measures which could be taken to ensure that their expenditure is kept in line with their allocation during the coming year.  Officers of my Department have agreed with the boards of management that measures of the order proposed are necessary in order to deal with the shortfall in revenue in 1988. <Col N="536" /> It is now a matter for the board to decide if they agree with management's recommendations, including a proposed change of role in Mallow General Hospital.  I understand that the Southern Health Board are meeting on Tuesday next to discuss a number of proposals and I will be awaiting the decisions made by the board.</P>
      <P>On the question raised by Senator O'Shea, I am glad of the opportunity to respond to his statement.  For some time now I have been convinced of the need to review the organisation of the health services, including the functions and management of health boards.  My perspective on this need is multifaceted arising from my involvement in the delivery of health services as a general practitioner, as a member of a health board and as Minister for Health.  When I was on the health board representing my medical colleagues, I had the honour of being on the local health committee representing the local authority.</P>
      <P>The existing structure was proposed in the mid-sixties and the health boards came into operation, as Senators will be aware, in 1970 to meet the health and personal social service requirements at the time.  The structures were also intended to address the projected requirements for future years as envisaged then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no need to remind Senators of the dramatic changes which had taken place economically, socially and budgetary, since then.  In addition, many developments have taken place in the intervening years in relation to health and health care which must also be taken into account in any proper assessment of the health care delivery system.  In the light of all these factors and having regard to the limited resources which are currently available for health and personal social services I have indicated on several occasions that there is a need for an assessment of current conditions and more importantly the conditions which are likely to prevail to the end of the century.  It behoves us all as public representatives to ensure that the publicly funded services in all spheres of national <Col N="537" /> life are regularly scrutinised to ensure that the structures that are in place and the service delivery system are effective and efficient and that they are addressing the current needs of the community.</P>
    <P>In so far as the structures of the health services are concerned I am satisfied at this stage that there is no need for a change in the number of health boards. Concentration on an appropriate number of health boards deflects attention from improvements that are needed within the existing structures.  A mere change in number does not address the need for change where deficiencies have been identified.  Some time ago I initiated the process of the examination and review of the role, function and remit of the health boards with a view to introducing modifications where necessary.  As part of the review the Government have been considering the role and function of local health committees which were established by regulations under the Health Act, 1970.  As this House will be aware the principal function of a local health committee is to advise the appropriate health board on the provision by the board of health services in the functional area of the committee.</P>
    <P>Senators will no doubt be aware of the questioning of people within the health sector, including members of local health committees, of the need to have such committees in the present circumstances. The focus of attention is centred on the statutory relationship between such committees and the relevant health board. The relationship is advisory, a health board are required merely to consider any advice tendered by a committee. They are not obliged to act on the advice so rendered.  The provision of health and personal social services to the population and the functioning of the health board in an equitable manner remains the statutory responsibility of the health board.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the health board structure in 1970 involved a radical change from the old health poverty system.  Health boards became responsible for services in a number of counties. In those circumstances it was clear that initially there was a need for an advisory <Col N="538" /> input to the boards at county level; hence the local health committees were set up to provide that more localised knowledge. However, after 17 years, in which the boards have become well established and the services provided for the functional areas have become more cohesive, the need for local health committees must be questioned.</P>
    <P>Another factor which must be taken into account is the cost of administering the local health committess.  This cost involves not just expenses paid to members but also the substantial cost to health board managements in servicing them.  At this time of financial restraint it is necessary to assess all aspects of health expenditure and in such an assessment the continuation of the committees must be queried.  The resources that are saved will be applied to priority activities within each health board.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided that arrangements should be made as soon as possible for the abolition of local health committees.  I fully subscribe to the widely held view that there is a need for the involvement of the local community in the direction and the shape of the health services provied within a health board area generally and at local level specifically.  The important position of local authority members, who by statute are in a majority on health boards, must be stressed in focusing on the planning and delivery of services within a board's functional area.  While Senator O'Shea expressed concern that the input of local authority members would be diminished, it is important to recognise that local authority members, by law, make up the majority on each health board and, therefore, will continue to have the opportunity at health board level to make their input on behalf of their own particular county.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware of my recent initiatives in the area of health promotion which are now central to the improvement of community health.  In that context I am considering the most effective arrangements or structures necessary to involve the local community in the positive promotion of good health within the <Col N="539" /> local community and throughout the country.  The limited remit of local health committees and the current direction of community involvement in health requires a change in direction for a more effective co-ordination of effort.  I am sure Senators will agree that the measures I have proposed are positive and necessary and will address current health policy developments in the interests of all.</P>
