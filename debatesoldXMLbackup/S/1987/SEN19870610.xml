      <P>I have notice from Senator Denis Cregan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for the Marine the present position in relation to the Free Port in Ringaskiddy, County Cork.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Nuala Fennell of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The question of separate free legal representation for complainants in rape cases to ensure that there will not be a recurrence of the situation regarding prosecuting counsel in the recently published rape trial in the Dublin Criminal Court.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator David Norris of the following matter:</P>
      <P>To request the Government to honour immediately their commitment given in writing in February of this year to the Dublin Crisis Conference that they will:</P>
      <P>(a)  amend section 56 of the 1963 Planning Act so that zoning of land is a non-compensatable reason for refusal, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="784" /> (b)  amend the 1977 Planning Act so that An Bord Pleanála will have a code of practice requiring it to specify non-compensatable reasons for refusal where these apply, and</P>
    <P>(c)  as a matter of urgency amend sections 55 (1) and 52 (2) of the 1963 Planning Act to modify the &ldquo;market value&rdquo; rule to ensure that &ldquo;existing use&rdquo; value and purchase price, other than &ldquo;potential use&rdquo; value become the main criteria for assessing compensation.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Katharine Bulbulia of the following matter:</P>
    <P>That building would commence on the new primary school at St. Paul's, Lisduggan, Waterford.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Cregan and Bulbulia as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Cregan's motion for today's Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m.  Senator Bulbulia may give notice for another day of the matter she wishes to raise.  I regret I have to rule the matter raised by Senator Fennell is not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds of lack of ministerial responsibility.  I also have to disallow the matter raised by Senator Norris on the grounds of advocacy of legislation.</P>
    <P>I should, however, say that I have an application under Standing Order 29.  If I decide to allow it Senator Cregan's matter cannot be taken until tomorrow. I will announce my decision at 3.30 p.m. I want to make this clear as there will be confusion.  Senator Cregan's motion was decided on and I had cleared it for 8 p.m. tonight.  At 2.10 p.m. this motion by Senator Brendan Ryan was laid on my desk.  I have not decided on it yet.</P>

      <P>No. I decided this <Col N="785" /> morning to take the Senator's motion as the first one at 8 o'clock tonight.  This special one came in from Senator Brendan Ryan.  I have not made a decision on it yet.  If I decide to accept it Senator Cregan's will be postponed until tomorrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Standing Order 29 (1) reads:</P>
      <P>A motion for the adjourment of the Seanad on a specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration may be made if a Senator, not later than 2.30 p.m. on a day on which the Seanad meets before noon and not later than 4.30 p.m. on a day on which the Seanad meets at or after noon, gives written private notice of the matter to the Cathaoirleach and upon which being called on by the Cathaoirleach not later than one hour subsequent to the time of the notice risen in his place and states that he requests leave to remove the adjournment of the Seanad for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration whereupon he shall state the matter.</P>
      <P>We will leave it because I have not decided yet whether we are taking the matter.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Cathaoirleach for considering my motion.  I accept her ruling but I regret <Col N="786" /> that this matter cannot be discussed. Since I put down this motion we have had the response of the Bar Council to an examination of the events in the Cavan rape case.  The response is inadequate and disappointing.  There is deep public concern about this matter and aspects of this trial.</P>

      <P>I accept that.  It has been accepted that we need reform of the 1981 Rape Act.  We have an item on this Order Paper dealing with the all party committee's report on womens rights, which was published in January, which I have already asked to have debated, I seek support from the Cathaoirleach as a woman and from Members of this House to bring it forward for debate.  It is the second time I have asked for this.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that the Senator is upset about my ruling but there has been discussion already about that item on the Clár.  The conduct of the prosecution case is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I have made my ruling that it is not suitable for debate here because there is no ministerial responsibility.  Last week the Leader of the House said he would bring forward the item the Senator was concerned about.  That is a matter for the Leader of the House and the Whips and not for me. If the Senator is worried about it I will talk to the people concerned if it helps in any way.</P>

      <P>Could the Leader of the House give us an assurance that Item No. 19 &mdash; the Item raised by Senator Fennell &mdash; will be taken as a matter of urgency, within a week if at all possible?  Secondly, would it be possible to have time put aside, either today or tomorrow &mdash; probably tomorrow &mdash; for a debate on the closure of the Hyster plant because I believe it raises questions of enormous public importance and involves the manner in which multi-national companies operate in this country with the involvement of a large sum of public money.</P>

      <P>Is the Leader of the House aware of the fact that there is a most disquieting rumour that Dáil Éireann is going into summer recess some time towards the end of June?  Would he agree that it would bring this House into serious disrepute at a time when it is very much discussed in the media for anyone to consider starting the summer recess quite so early?  Could he give an assurance that this House will not rise for the summer recess at such an early stage?</P>

      <P>Of course I agree with the Cathaoirleach that what the Dáil does does not concern us, but when people who should know better start asking questions about the expenses of Members of this House perhaps Members of this House should reply.  I have made every effort to get a Member of the Dáil to ask a similar question about Members of the Dáil and they have all resolutely refused, whatever their political views.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the question of Ministers who are responsible for handling business in this House.  I would like the Leader of the House to assure us that the Ministers who handle business in this House will take the House seriously. The behaviour of the Minister for Foreign Affairs last Wednesday night in this House was a &ldquo;thundering disgrace&rdquo; to quote a famous phrase.  He gave us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness to Senator Brendan Ryan, no matter what Minister was involved, I would have to defend him from the Chair.  That does not arise on the Order of Business in the Seanad today.  Will Senator Ryan please resume his seat?  Last week when the said Minister was in the Chamber, the Senator should have said what he wanted to say and not when he is not here.  That applies to any Minister of any party while I am in this Chair.  The Leader of the House to conclude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did say it and his reply was so objectionable and offensive that I felt obliged to raise it again today.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs was a disgrace here last Wednesday night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business for today will be as stated.  A point was raised by the Leader of the Opposition in connection with the Hyster closure, which we all regret and was unforeseen by anybody in Government or in the IDA as late as 8 o'clock this morning.  If it is appropriate to the House, we will try to <Col N="790" /> get a debate going on that matter tomorrow. I am not promising that it will take place.  I do not think that there is anybody here who does not regret what happened. If we cannot have a debate today we will have it tomorrow if possible.  I will approach various people.  I do not think it is a concern of the Senator only; it is the concern of everybody in the country.</P>
      <P>The question raised by Senator McGowan is a matter for the Garda authorities. In general it is recognised by most of us who travel on the roads that vehicles from outside the State do not comply with the laws as they are here.  There will have to be more concern for the repercussions of overloading by vehicles from outside the State and of speeding by vehicles from outside the State, but I do not think that is a matter we can discuss now.  I will discuss with Senator McGowan whether we will take this as a substantive three hour motion.  If we do not take it as a substantive three hour motion, he can put it down as an Adjournment matter.</P>
      <P>As to Senator O'Toole's remarks about the Dáil, I do not know when the Dáil will go into recess but, if I were Senator O'Toole, I would not be making any arrangements for holidays on 26 June, the following week or the week after.  I have no control over what happens in the Dáil.  I guarantee that anybody who has made arrangements for holidays around 26 June should cancel them as of now unless they have pairs.  There will not be very many pairs coming from this side of the House in that period.</P>
      <P>The questions raised by Senator Brendan Ryan are more appropriate to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. I do not intend to answer the accusations he made here this evening.  If he wants to raise these matters with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges he is quite entitled to do so.  If he is not a member of that committee he has the opportunity to pass on his comments to his representative and they can be dealt with by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>

I give a guarantee that it will be taken as soon as possible.  I cannot give a further guarantee because I am not in a position to do so at present.  It will be taken at an early stage.</P>

      <P>In order to relieve the accommodation space in the Seanad four Senators, including myself, voluntarily agreed to take accommodation in a house owned by the Office of Public Works in Merrion Square.  Since then the rooms we have taken have been refurbished by the Office of Public Works.  There is one essential amenity lacking, that is, we have no division bells.  There could be a vote in this Chamber without our knowing about it.  It is essential that any room occupied by a Senator should have that facility.  I ask you to use your good offices to urge the Office of Public Works to carry out this work and see that these bells are put in immediately.  Up to this morning there seemed to be some reluctance on the part of the Office of Public Works to provide this facility.</P>

    <Title>Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments (European Communities) (No. 2) Bill, 1987: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to enable Ireland to ratify the 1968 EC Convention on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters. This convention, as its title implies, deals with two separate but related matters. First, it regulates, as between the contracting states, the rules governing the jurisdiction of courts of those states in civil proceedings covered by the convention, and, second, it provides speedy and informal procedures for the recognition and enforcement in one contracting state of civil judgments given in another.</P>
      <P>The background of the convention can be stated very briefly.  Article 220 of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community requires that member states shall enter into negotiations to simplify the formalities governing the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts or tribunals.  The philosophy behind this provision is that the free movement of goods, persons and services must be complemented by the free movement of judgments so as to ensure adequate legal protection for domicilaries of one member state doing business, or working in other member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Negotiations to draw up a judgments convention commenced in 1959 and eventually, on 27 September 1968, all of the then six members signed the convention at Brussels and it duly entered into force between them on 1 February <Col N="793" /> 1973.  A separate protocol on interpretation of the convention by the Court of Justice of the European Communities entered into force in 1975.  When Ireland, Denmark and the United Kingdom joined the Community in 1973 they were required to accede to the convention and the protocol on interpretation.  This obligation was expressly laid down by Article 3 (2) of the Act of Accession.  Following negotiations a Convention of Accession of Ireland, Denmark and the UK to the 1968 Convention and 1971 Protocol was signed by the then nine member states in October 1978, which in addition to containing the necessary adjustments for the purpose of adapting the convention and protocol to the legal institutions and systems of the new member states also made amendments to the convention to rectify defects which had appeared since it had entered into force.</P>
    <P>The Bill, when enacted, will enable Ireland to ratify the 1978 Accession Convention and, thereby, accede to the 1968 Convention and 1971 Protocol as adjusted.  In 1982 a further Accession Convention for Greece was signed by the then ten member states, containing technical adjustments only.  The Bill will enable Ireland to ratify that convention also.</P>
    <P>The main provision in the Bill is section 3 which provides that the conventions, that is, the 1968 Convention, the 1971 Protocol, and the 1978 and 1982 Accession Conventions shall have the force of law in the State.  For ease of reference a composite version of the 1968 Convention and 1971 Protocol as adjusted by the two Accession Conventions is scheduled to the Bill.  It is, of course, the actual conventions, which are equally authentic in the languages of the contracting states, including Irish, which are being given the force of law.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the 1968 convention itself.  Unless I indicate otherwise, I will be referring to the convention as adjusted by the Accession Conventions.  The purpose of the convention is set out in the Preamble, which indicates that the convention is concerned with determining <Col N="794" /> the international jurisdiction of the courts of the contracting states and facilitating the recognition and enforcement of judgments, court settlements and authentic instruments.  Its scope is set out in Article 1 &mdash; the convention is to apply to civil and commercial matters but not to judgments concerning the status or legal capacity of natural persons, matrimonial property, wills, succession, bankruptcy, arbitration, social security, revenue, customs or administrative matters.  While matters relating to status, for example, divorce, are excluded, maintenance orders are included within the scope of the convention.</P>
    <P>I will deal first with the jurisdictional rules in the convention and their main effects on Irish law.  The general rule under Irish law at present is that, unless the defendant voluntarily submits, an Irish court will only have jurisdiction if he has been duly served with the appropriate summons.  If the defendant is within the state &mdash; even temporarily &mdash; he may be served as of right.  If, however, he is outside the state he may be served only with the permission of the court in circumstances set out in rules of court. Under the convention, however, jurisdiction will be determined in accordance with Title II, in particular Articles 2 to 18, of the convention.  The main effect on Irish law will be that it will not be possible for an Irish court to assume jurisdiction over a person domiciled in another contracting state by reason only of his temporary presence in this country &mdash; this is specifically prohibited by the second paragraph of Article 3, which lists similar rules of &ldquo;exorbitant&rdquo; jurisdiction in other contacting states, which are also prohibited.  By virtue of Article 4, however, these rules will remain in force with respect to proceedings against persons who are not domiciled in a contracting state.</P>
    <P>As to the grounds on which jurisdiction may be assumed under the convention, the main ground, set out in Article 2, is that a person domiciled in a contracting state shall be sued in the courts of that state.  I will deal later with the meaning of domicile, which for the purposes of the <Col N="795" /> convention and this Bill, is being given a different and more straightforward meaning from its technical common law meaning.  Articles 5, 6 and 6a, which contain a number of alternative grounds of jurisdiction, supplement the general jurisdiction based on domicile.  Articles 7 to 15 contain special provisions in relation to insurance and consumer contracts. Article 16 grants exclusive jurisdiction to specified courts in relation to certain matters and Articles 17 and 18 provide for agreements on, and submission to, the jurisdiction of particular courts.  The overall effect of these provisions will mean little change in the existing position under Irish law.</P>
    <P>Article 5 sets out seven categories of disputes in which, in addition to the court of domicile, a court in one of the other contracting states may exercise jurisdiction. Point 1 of Article 5 provides that in a case involving a contract the courts of the place of performance of the obligation in question will have jurisdiction. This represents a compromise between the various national laws.  At present Irish courts may, generally speaking, assume jurisdiction in relation to a contract where the contract was made within the jurisdiction, or where the contract is by its terms or by implication to be governed by Irish law or where the action is brought in respect of a breach committed within the jurisdiction.  Henceforth, the fact that a contract was made within the jurisdiction or that it was to be governed by Irish law will cease to be sufficient in themselves to found jurisdiction against a person domiciled in another contracting state.</P>
    <P>Point 2 of Article 5 relates to maintenance and is framed with the interests of the maintenance creditor in mind.  It confers jurisdiction on the courts for the place where the maintenance creditor is domiciled or habitually resident.  This accords with our present law.  The practical effect of this will be as follows: where a woman living in Ireland wishes to sue for maintenance from her husband, who is domiciled in another contracting state, <Col N="796" /> she may institute proceedings in Ireland, by virtue of Article 5, or in that other state, by virtue of Article 2 and any judgment she obtains will be enforced against her husband in the other contracting state under the convention.  At present, such judgments will be enforced in the United Kingdom only, under the maintenance agreement that is in force between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  If the husband in question wishes to have the maintenance order varied or revoked then, by virtue of Article 2, he can only apply to the Irish courts, i.e., the courts for the state where the maintenance creditor is domiciled.</P>
    <P>Point 3 of Article 5 confers jurisdiction in matters relating to a tort on the courts for the place where the harmful event occurred.  This again accords with present Irish law.  The phrase &ldquo;where the harmful event occurred&rdquo; has been interpreted by the European Court as meaning either the place of the event giving rise to the damage, or the place where the damage occurred and the plaintiff has the option to sue in either place.</P>
    <P>In regard to the remaining categories of disputes in Article 5 one particular matter calls for comment.  Maritime law was not the subject of any special provision in the original convention.  The application of the general jurisdiction rule based on domicile would have seriously eroded the in rem jurisdiction of Irish courts in maritime claims, which is based on the arrest within the jurisdiction of the ship or cargo to which the claim relates.</P>
    <P>During the negotiations it was decided that maritime claims would best be provided for if all contracting states ratified the 1952 Brussels convention on the Arrest of Sea-going Ships which permits jurisdiction to be assumed when a ship &mdash; or, indeed, a sister ship &mdash; is arrested. The jurisdictional provisions of that convention would then supersede those of the 1986 convention in accordance with Article 57 of the 1968 convention.  As Ireland and Denmark have not ratified the 1952 convention transitional provisions modelled on that convention were inserted in Article 36 of the 1978 <Col N="797" /> Accession Convention for the benefit of Ireland and Denmark.  These provisions will have effect for a period of three years after the coming into force of the 1978 convention for Ireland or until we ratify the 1952 Arrest Convention, whichever is the earlier.  It is our intention to bring forward legislation at an early date to enable Ireland to ratify the 1952 Arrest Convention.</P>
    <P>Articles 7 to 12a of the convention, determine jurisdiction in insurance matters and provide the policy holder with a choice of jurisdictions, including the court for the place where he is domiciled. On the other hand, he can be sued only in the country where he is domiciled. Articles 13 to 15, determine jurisdiction in the case of consumer contracts made by way of credit sale or hire-purchase, or resulting from mail order or direct advertising from abroad.  The consumer may bring proceedings in the courts of his domicile as well as in the state where the defendant is domiciled, while proceedings against him are confined to the court of his domicile.  As in the case of maintenance, these provisions reflect concern for the weaker party i.e., the policy holder and the consumer, respectively.</P>
    <P>Article 16 of the convention grants exclusive jurisdiction to specified courts in relation to certain matters.  These are matters which have traditionally been regarded as coming within the exclusive competence of the courts in question.  For example, point 1 of Article 16 provides that in proceedings which have as their object rights <i>in rem</i> in, or tenancies of, immovable property the courts of the contracting state in which the property is situated shall have exclusive jurisdiction. This principle is already reflected in our law under which Irish courts assume jurisdiction where the sole subject matter of an action is land within the jurisdiction. The rules of exclusive jurisdiction in Article 16 apply whether or not the defendant is domiciled in a contracting state and even if the parties have purported by agreement to grant jurisdiction to another court under Article 17 or have <Col N="798" /> submitted to the jurisdiction of another court by virtue of Article 18.</P>
    <P>Articles 19 to 23 contain certain procedural rules designed to ensure that the jurisdiction provisions in the convention are given practical effect in the contracting states and to resolve conflicts which may arise where more than one court has jurisdiction over the same dispute, a situation that may occur since in some cases a plaintiff will have a choice of jurisdiction.  Article 24, which authorises provisional measures when proceedings are being commenced in another contracting state, requires a change in our law which I will deal with more fully when I come to discuss the detailed provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the jurisdictional provisions let me say that they will apply whether or not it is sought to have the resultant judgment recognised and enforced in another contracting state, although this, more often than not, will be the case.  On the other hand, the provisions in the convention relating to recognition and enforcement will apply whether the judgment resulted from an action against a person domiciled in another contracting state or in some third state.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the inclusion in the convention of uniform and comprehensive rules on jurisdiction has meant that the provisions relating to recognition and enforcement of judgments are less complicated than would otherwise be possible. Let me explain that.  Hitherto, a condition has always been placed on the party desiring to enforce a foreign judgment to show that the judgment was given by a court of competent jurisdiction, that is, that the court which gave the judgment had assumed jurisdiction on a basis which was in accord with the recognition rules of the country in which it is sought to enforce the judgment.</P>
    <P>For example, under our rules of recognition a foreign court is considered competent where the defendant submitted to its jurisdiction in the original proceedings or was residing in the country of that court at the time the action was initiated. Recognition rules vary from country to <Col N="799" /> country but invariably one finds that they are very restrictive &mdash; being designed to protect each country's own nationals.  As a result there is often little point in commencing an action in one country against someone domiciled in another country if the resulting judgment will require to be enforced in that other country.</P>
    <P>However, since the jurisdictional rules in the 1968 convention are common to, and binding on, courts in all contracting states, the country in which enforcement is sought no longer has any need to investigate the grounds on which the judgment granting court assumed jurisdiction. Indeed, apart from a number of cases expressly mentioned in Article 28, the convention expressly forbids such an investigation by the enforcing court.  As a result the enforcement of a judgment delivered in one contracting state is made, as nearly as possible, automatic in all other contracting states.</P>
    <P>Articles 26 to 45 of the convention relate to recognition and enforcement and, as I have said, are relatively straightforward. These articles lay down entitled procedures for enforcement.  However, if a party requires recognition only of a judgment Article 26 provides that he may apply for this by using the enforcement procedures.  Articles 27 and 28 lay down the circumstances where a judgment shall not be recognised, and, of course, not enforced.  The main grounds relate to breaches of public policy or natural justice.</P>
    <P>Point (1) of Article 27 provides that a judgment shall not be recognised if such recognition is contrary to public policy in the state in which recognition is sought. This is already the position under Irish law.  One example of a breach of public policy is where the judgment in question was obtained by fraud.  That is a ground for refusal to recognise a foreign judgment under our law at present.  Point 2 of Article 27 (2) states that a judgment is not to be recognised if it was given in default of appearance and the defendant was not duly served with the document which instituted the proceedings in sufficient time to enable him to arrange for <Col N="800" /> his defence.  This is a matter of natural justice and it will fall to the enforcing court to satisfy itself in this regard.</P>
    <P>Article 28 sets out the only instances where the enforcing court can look at the grounds on which the judgment granting court assumed jurisdiction.  It provides that a judgment shall not be recognised if it conflicts with the provisions of sections 3, 4 or 5 of Title II or in a case provided for in Article 59.  Sections 3 and 4 of Title II refer to jurisdiction in matters relating to insurance and consumer contracts respectively, and section 5 relates to matters of exclusive jurisdiction.  Article 59 allows a contracting state to undertake not to enforce judgments given in another contracting state against a person domiciled in a third state where jurisdiction was assumed on one of the exorbitant grounds mentioned in Article 3.</P>
    <P>Articles 31 to 49 of the convention deal with applications for enforcement and appeals against decisions authorising or rejecting enforcement and are in the main self-explanatory.  Article 33 provides that the procedure for making the application shall be governed by the law of the state in which enforcement is sought.  It is with this aspect that the Bill is mostly concerned.  I will, therefore, discuss the enforcement provisions of the convention and the relevant provisions of the Bill together.</P>
    <P>Article 32 of the convention provides that an application for the enforcement of a judgment in Ireland shall be made to the High Court and Article 34 provides that the party against whom enforcement is sought shall not at this stage of the proceedings be entitled to make any submission on the application.  Section 5 of the Bill provides that the application will be made to the Master of the High Court and, in accordance with Article 34, it will be made <i>ex parte.</i>  By virtue of Article 36 an appeal against a decision authorising enforcement of a judgment may be made within one month of service of notice of the decision if the defendant is domiciled in the state or within two months of service if he is domiciled outside the state. Article 37 provides that the appeal shall <Col N="801" /> be made to the High Court and a further appeal on a point of law only may be made to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Article 39 is an important provision.  It provides that during the time specified in Article 36 for making an appeal and pending the determination of that appeal no measures of enforcement, other than protective measures, may be taken against the property of the party against whom enforcement is sought.  The article also provides that the decision authorising enforcement shall carry with it the power to proceed to any such protective measures.  I have already mentioned that Article 24 of the convention, which authorises provisional measures when proceedings are being commenced in another contracting state, requires a change in our law.  Section 11 of the Bill gives effect in Ireland to Articles 24 and 39.</P>
    <P>First, in regard to the Article 24 provision, the section extends the power of the High Court to grant provisional, including protective, measures to the case where it has not jurisdiction as to the substance of the case.  At present the High Court may grant provisional or protective measures only where the substantive issue in question will be litigated before it.  The purpose of Article 24 and section 11 (1) of the Bill is to ensure that, when the judgment eventually comes here for enforcement, there will be assets to satisfy it.  The measure that is likely to be most commonly applied for under this provision will be what is often referred to as a Mareva injunction, which restrains a defendant from transferring his assets out of the jurisdiction or otherwise disposing of them so as to defeat any judgment that may be given against him.</P>
    <P>As to the Article 39 provision, the Court of Justice in a recent decision on that article ruled that a person who has obtained authorisation for enforcement does not need to obtain a separate court authorisation for the purpose of proceeding with protective measures.  In line with that decision subsection (3) of section 11 of the Bill provides that an application for enforcement may include <Col N="802" /> an application for the granting of such protective measures as the High Court has power to grant and, where an enforcement order is made, the order will include a provision granting the protective measures requested.</P>
    <P>The remaining articles in Title III make provision in regard to legal aid and the documentation which will accompany the request for enforcement.  Section 10 of the Bill provides for the proof and admissibility of these documents in our courts.  Section 12 relates to the provision of documents by our authorities where it is sought to enforce an Irish judgment abroad.</P>
    <P>Articles 50 and 51 of the convention deal with legal instruments which are not known in this jurisdiction.  Article 50 provides that authentic instruments, which are enforceable in one contracting state, shall be enforced in another contracting state in accordance with the procedures which the convention lays down for the enforcement of judgments.  Authentic instruments are used mainly in continental countries and usually provide for the enforcement of financial obligations without the need to have recourse to the courts.</P>
    <P>Since these instruments will be new to our courts, it has been decided not to include them in the jurisdiction which the Bill is giving to the Master of the High Court.  Applications for the enforcement of an authentic instrument will, instead, be made <i>ex parte</i> to a judge of the High Court by virtue of Articles 32 and 34. Article 51 provides that a settlement which has been approved by a court in the course of proceedings and is enforceable in the state in which it was concluded shall be enforced in the judgment enforcing state in the same manner as authentic instruments.  The settlements in question arise in the German and Dutch legal systems.</P>
    <P>Once an order for the enforcement in the State of a judgment from a contracting state has been made, enforcement will be a matter for Irish law.  For this purpose section 6 of the Bill provides that a judgment, other than a maintenance order for periodic payments, in <Col N="803" /> respect of which an enforcement order has been made, shall be of the same force as a judgment of the High Court.  Section 7 provides for the enforcement of maintenance orders for periodic payments and contains provisions modelled on those used in the Maintenance Orders Act, 1974, for the enforcement in the State of maintenance orders originating in the United Kingdom.  Any detailed analysis of these provisions would, I think, be more appropriate to Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I might mention at this point, however, that the general position relating to the maintenance agreement which we have with the United Kingdom is under discussion at present with the UK authorities. The original intention was that, when the EC Convention came into force, the agreement with the United Kingdom would lapse and the Community provisions would then apply between the two countries.  However, by virtue of Article 57 of the convention it would be possible to maintain the maintenance agreement with the UK.  If we were to do that the enforcement and other provisions at present in operation in the case of Irish and UK maintenance orders under that agreement would continue to apply, subject to any amendments that might be agreed.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill is a technical provision dealing with the payment of interest and costs on judgments.  Section 9 makes provision for fixing the currency and rate of exchange for the payment of maintenance orders for periodic sums in respect of which an order for enforcement has been made.</P>
    <P>Section 13 and the Fifth Schedule of the Bill provide for the definition of domicile for the purposes of the Act and the convention.  The convention does not define domicile or the seat of a company or association, which is to be treated as its domicile.  It was agreed during the negotiations on the 1978 Accession Convention that the common law concept of domicile was not suitable for the purposes of the convention and that the term should be defined in our enabling legislation in a way that approximated to the <Col N="804" /> definition of domicile in continental countries.  This we have done.  Senators will note that the definitions are in both Irish and English.</P>

    <P>Before I conclude there is one final matter with which I want to deal; the position relating to the interpretation of the conventions.  As I have already mentioned, the 1971 Protocol confers jurisdiction on the European Court to interpret the conventions.  References for a ruling on interpretation will be made to the European Court by national courts in a similar way to references under Article 177 of the Treaty of Rome, except that, under the 1971 Protocol references may only be made by appellate courts.  Rulings of the European Court made as a result of such a request will be binding on the courts of contracting states.  In addition, national authorities, to be designated by the contracting states, may request rulings from the European Court &ldquo;in the interests of the law&rdquo; in the event of a <Col N="805" /> conflict of interpretations arising from different judgments, for example, as between a judgment handed down by the appellate courts of different contracting states, without, however, affecting those judgments.  While references from courts have been quite common since the coming into effect of the Protocol in 1975, no references have yet been made by a national authority.</P>
    <P>In addition, as an aid to interpretation of the 1968 and 1978 conventions, two explanatory reports have been produced. The first by Mr. P. Jenard deals with the original 1968 Convention and the 1971 Protocol and the second, by Professor Peter Schlosser deals with the amendments made to the 1968 Convention and 1971 Protocol by the 1978 Accession Convention.  Both Mr. Jenard and Professor Schlosser were closely involved with negotiations on the respective conventions. Section 4 (2) of the Bill provides that their reports, which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Communities, may be considered by any court when interpreting the conventions and the protocol.  While these reports have not been formally approved by the contracting states, they were intended to express the view of the drafters as to the meaning of the conventions.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

Is mian liomsa freisin dar ndóigh fáilte a chur roimh an Aire Dlí agus Cirt, Gearóid O Coileáin go dtí an Teach seo agus comgháirdeas a ghabháil leis as ucht an Bille seo a thabhairt ós comhair an tSeanaid i dtosach báire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to welcome the introduction of this Bill, the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcements of Judgments (European Communities) (No. 2) Bill, 1987, a Bill which was first initiated by the previous Government in December 1986 and is now being introduced in the Seanad for the tirst time.  The purpose of <Col N="806" /> the Bill is to enable Ireland to ratify the EC Convention of 1968 on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters, otherwise known as the Brussels Convention, and the Protocol of 1971 on the interpretation of that convention by the European Court of Justice of the European Communities, both instruments as amended by the Conventions of Accession, 1978 and 1982, which provided for the accession of Denmark, Ireland, the United Kingdom and Greece to the 1968 convention and the 1971 Protocol.</P>
    <P>The harmonisation of the rules of jurisdiction in international disputes and the rules governing the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments is an obvious and desirable objective of the EC.  Such harmonisation was set down in Article 220 of the Treaty of Rome, as the Minister said, as one of the goals of the member states.  Article 220 provides that:</P>
    <P>Member States shall so far as is necessary enter into negotiations with each other with a view to securing for the benefit of their nationals and simplification of formalities governing the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts or tribunals or arbitration awards.</P>
    <P>Thus the objective of the 1968 convention, as amended, is to enable judgments given in one member state to be freely recognised and enforced in another member state as quickly and as cheaply as possible.  In the words of the Jenard report:</P>
    <P>The 1968 Convention seeks to facilitate as far as possible the free movements of judgments and should be interpreted in this spirit.</P>
    <P>When Ireland, Denmark and the United Kingdom joined the European Economic Communities on 1 January 1973 the 1968 Convention was already in existence as well as the 1971 Protocol on the Interpretation of the Convention by the European Court of Justice.  Article 3 of the Act of Accession of the new member states required them to accede to the <Col N="807" /> 1968 Convention and the 1971 Protocol subject to the necessary safeguards.  The adjustments made by the Convention of Accession must be considered in the context that it was not open to the new member states to challenge the fundamental provisions of the convention and the protocol.  The negotiations, as the Minister has indicated, lasted from 1972 to 1978 and they resulted in a Convention of Accession of new member states to the 1968 Convention and the 1971 Protocol signed by the nine Ministers for Justice in Luxembourg on 9 October 1978.</P>
    <P>On 25 October 1982 a second Convention of Accession was signed whereby Greece became a party to the convention and the protocol.  When the convention is ratified by all member states and comes into force, it will bring about fundamental changes in Irish law.  The implementation of the convention will in the words of an editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 2 February 1987, &ldquo;occasion the most fundamental restructure of the rules of the civil procedure in Ireland since the foundation of the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Title II of the convention deals with jurisdiction.  Its detailed rules will determine in which country a defendant ought to be sued.  Title III of the convention deals with the recognition and enforcement of judgments and sets out the conditions in which Irish judgments will in future be enforceable abroad and in which foreign judgments will be enforceable here.  Thus the main effect of the 1968 Convention and the 1971 Protocol may be considered under three broad headings: (1) Jurisdiction, (2) Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Judgments, (3) the 1971 Protocol which provides for the uniform interpretation of the 1968 convention throughout the Community.</P>
    <P>The Irish legal system, unlike the EC Convention, draws a clear distinction between (a) the question of assumption of jurisdiction and (b) the issue of enforcing foreign judgments.  In (a) we are concerned with jurisdiction in the domestic <Col N="808" /> sense, that is, the circumstances in which our courts are capable of exercising jurisdiction over a defendant either present in Ireland or absent from Ireland.  In (b), however, while jurisdiction or, more precisely lack of jurisdiction, is invariably the primary point of inquiry particularly where enforcement in Ireland is being resisted, our courts are concerned with jurisdiction in the international sense &mdash; in other words whether according to our rules of private international law the foreign court properly assumes jurisdiction. In the private international law sense jurisdiction has been defined by Professor Cheshire as &ldquo;the power of the court to hear and determine the issue upon which its decision is sought,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Irish courts, as has been indicated by the Minister, operate a liberal jurisdiction regime and in regard to actions <i>in personam</i> jurisdiction may be established in three ways: (1) the basic or general rule is that an Irish court would have jurisdiction or competency to hear a civil action against a defendant provided (a) the defendant was properly served with the writ or its equivalent and (b) the defendant was in Ireland at the time of service; (2) any defendant who voluntarily submits to the jurisdiction of an Irish court thereby gives the Irish court jurisdiction over him; (3) an Irish court has the power in some circumstances to order service of the writ or notice of the writ on any person not within the jurisdiction of the court under Order XI of the Rules of the Superior Courts, and such service will give the Irish court jurisdiction over that person.  With regard to method (1) &mdash; service within the jurisdiction &mdash; it is a fundamental principle, and has been a fundamental principle of Irish law for many, many years that a person who is physically present in Ireland and who is validly served with a writ, or its equivalent, is subject to the jurisdiction of the Irish courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying, a Chathaoirligh, with regard to method (1) &mdash; service within the jurisdiction &mdash; it is a fundamental principle of Irish law that a person who is physically present in <Col N="810" /> Ireland and who is validly served with a writ, or its equivalent, is subject to the jurisdiction of the Irish courts.  There must normally be personal service, that is, a copy of the writ or its equivalent must be left with the defendant and, if he requests it at that particular time, the original writ must be shown to him.  In circumstances where it appears impracticable to serve the writ personally, the court may order substituted service and direct the writ to be brought to the attention of the defendant in other ways, for example, by advertisement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In essence, therefore, the general common law rule is that jurisdiction depends upon the presence of the defendant in Ireland and if the writ is validly served the defendant is subject to the jurisdiction of the Irish court for the matter complained of in the writ, regardless of any lack of connection between the defendant in Ireland and regardless of any lack of connection between the action and Ireland.  For example, in Colt Industries <i>v.</i>  Sarlie (1966) a writ was served on the defendant Sarlie, an American who was staying for a few days in a London hotel.  The action concerned an American debt and the plaintiff was an American company.  The court, however, held that it had jurisdiction because there had been no fraud inducing Sarlie to enter the country for the real purpose of serving the writ.  In the Maharanee of Baroda <i>v.</i> Wilderstein (1972), the Maharanee served a writ on a well-known art dealer, Wilderstein, when he was at the Ascot Races on a temporary sojourn from France.  I see the Minister smiling at that remark.  The action concerned a painting which Wilderstein had sold to the Maharanee called &ldquo;La Poesie&rdquo;.  He had certified the painting as a genuine Bouchee and had received the equivalent of £32,000. The Maharanee alleged that the painting was worth only about £500, because it was from the school of Bouchee and not by Bouchee himself.  Although the gist of this action was clearly French, and although the Maharanee and Wilderstein were based in France, if the jet set can be said to be based in any particular spot, the court held that the service of the writ <Col N="811" /> within the jurisdiction gave the English court jurisdiction.  The jurisdiction thus based on the mere service of process is, however, subject to limitations, the effect of which is to render the court incompetent to determine the issue, notwithstanding that the defendant has been properly served.</P>
    <P>The limitations had been judicially classified into three main types, (a), limitations that affect the subject matter of the issue-broadly stated these limitations preclude a right of action if the issue relates to foreign immovables, foreign revenue laws or foreign penal laws; (b), limitations that affect the kind of relief sought &mdash; these restrict the power of the court to grant relief affecting the matrimonial stance of the parties; in such a case it is not enough that the respondent has been served with process; the competence of the court is conditioned by such factors as the domicile of the parties and (c), the limitations relating to the persons between whom the issue is joined.</P>
    <P>There are certain persons against whom the jurisdiction cannot be enforced and others by whom it cannot be invoked. Finally, the court may decline jurisdiction or State proceedings notwithstanding the fact that the jurisdictional rules have been satisfied in situations such as (i) on the ground that to proceed with the case is contrary to a choice of jurisdiction clause, and (ii), that on the basis of the plea of <i>Lis Alibi Pendends</i> which may be raised where the same cause of action between the same parties is <i>sub judice</i> both in Ireland and in some other country.</P>
    <P>A similar jurisdictional liberality, of course, extends to companies.  Assuming their compliance with the statutory registration requirements, there is little difficulty about the amenability to Irish courts of companies, either incorporated in Ireland or incorporated outside Ireland but establishing a place of business in Ireland.  Indeed, the common law displayed its customary inventiveness in treating companies doing business in Ireland as by analogy with individuals <Col N="812" /> resident in Ireland and thus subject to service.</P>
    <P>Service of process on companies depends on presence in Ireland, just as in the case of individuals.  Under Section 379 (i) of the Companies Act, 1963, a document may be served on a company: (a), by leaving it at the registered office of the company; (b), by sending it by post to the registred office of the company; (c), if the company has not given notice to the Registrar of Companies of the situation of its registered office, by registering it at the office for registration of companies.  Regardless of incorporation and registration under the Companies Acts, a company can still be present &ldquo;in Ireland&rdquo; and served with a writ.  It is regarded as present in Ireland if it carries on business in Ireland.  This concept has been developed by the cases, and we can conclude that a company carries on business in Ireland (a), if business is done in Ireland but it must be business and not merely, for example, a share transfer office for the convenience of Irish customers, and it must be business done in Ireland and not merely with Ireland.  The distinction is shown most clearly in the case of an agent.  The criterion is whether the agent has been employed in Ireland with authority to enter into transactions which bind the company.  On the other hand if he is merely as a conduit pipe for orders this is not carrying on business in Ireland.  A particular case here is Okura <i>v.</i>  Forsbacka (1914).  (b) The company must have a fixed place of business in Ireland and a fixed period of time.</P>
    <P>However, in the words of Professor Cheshire:</P>
    <P>Neither the impermanency of the place nor the brevity of time during which the business was done in Ireland is in itself sufficient to render the company immune from process.</P>
    <P>Thus, in Dunlop Pneumatic <i>v.</i>  Action Gesellschaft (1902) the defendants were held to be present in England where they hired a stand for nine days at an exhibition in London and employed an agent to explain and take orders.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="813" /> In a further case Littaur Glove Corporation <i>v.</i>  Millington (1920) a director of the defendant English company, having no place of business in the United States, was staying at a hotel in New York and was making occasional use of an office belonging to a customer of the defendant.  A writ was served on him in this office in his capacity as a director of the defending company.  Salter J. held that the company was not in any true sense of the term carrying on business in the State of New York.  &ldquo;A corporation is not present in a country if it is merely an agent there to seek customers and to transfer correspondence between them and the corporation in England but has no power to make contracts on the corporation's behalf.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The second way in which an Irish court assumes jurisdiction is where there is submission by the defendant.  Despite the fundamental principle that a court cannot entertain an action against the defendant who is absent from Ireland, it has long been recognised that an absent defendant may confer jurisdiction on the court by submitting thereto.  This may be done in a variety of ways such as (1) entering a non-conditional appearance; (2) instructing a solicitor to accept service on his behalf; (3) where a defendant commences an action as a plaintiff he is deemed to submit to a counterclaim and an Irish court would have jurisdiction over the counterclaim; (4) although a defendant who appears to contest the case on its merits will be held to have submitted to the jurisdiction an appearance merely to protest that the court does not have jurisdiction does not amount to an implied submission.  In the words of Lord Denning in Re Dulles' Settlement (No. 2) (1951):</P>
    <P>I cannot see how anyone can fairly say that a man has voluntarily submitted to jurisdiction of a court when he has all the time been vigorously protesting that it has no jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The third method whereby an Irish court assumes jurisdiction is by service of the <Col N="814" /> writ or notice of the writ out of the jurisdiction under Order XI of the Rules of the Superior Courts.  We have seen that the service of the writ is the foundation of jurisdiction in the Irish courts.  However, the common law rule that an action <i>in personam</i> will not lie against the defendant unless he was properly served with the writ or its equivalent and was in Ireland at the time of service has been found to be inadequate.</P>
    <P>For example, an Irish person could commit a tort in Ireland and escape liability in Ireland by going abroad, or in the case of a foreigner by returning to his own country.  This happened even if the tort feasor had property in Ireland.  The only remedy of the aggrieved party was to follow the wrongdoer to his place of residence in accordance with the maxim, <i>actor sequitur forum rei.</i></P>
    <P>Owing to considerations of this nature exceptions to the common law rule were introduced by the Common Law Procedure Act, 1952.  This Act introduced an entirely new kind of jurisdiction called the &ldquo;assumed jurisdiction&rdquo; which gave the Irish courts the discretionary power to summon an absent defendant, whether Irish or sovereign, and who was unwilling to submit to the jurisdiction of the Irish court.  The exercise of this jurisdiction is now governed by Order XI of the Rules of the Superior Courts which empowers the courts, on application being made, to permit the issue and service of a summons upon absent defendants in specific circumstances. Notice of the writ, instead of the writ, of course, is served on non-citizens. The issue of the writ or the notice of the writ is under the judge's discretion.  Application is made <i>ex parte</i> to a judge on a motion paper founded on an affidavit.  In all applications the plaintiff applies for leave to issue the writ and to serve the writ out of the jurisdiction.  The long-arm jusisdiction of Order XI has been referred to an &ldquo;exorbitant jurisdiction&rdquo; by Lord Diplock in Amin Rasheed Shipping Corporation <i>v.</i> Kuwait Insurance (1984) and per Webster J. in Amanuel <i>v.</i>  Alexandros Shipping, (1986).</P>
    <P>The justification for the epithet lies <Col N="815" /> in the fact that the Irish courts are not prepared &mdash; and, indeed, the English courts are not prepared &mdash;<i>mutatis mutandis</i> to concede a similar competence to other courts.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the Order XI jurisdiction can be excused only on the ground that a significant connection exists between the cause of action and Ireland, or between the absent defendant in Ireland.  <i>Prima facie</i> is sufficient to attract the litigation to Ireland as an interested forum.  Moreover, the Order XI jurisdiction is a jurisdiction that may &mdash; not which must &mdash; be exercised.  In other words, the order is not imperative, but discretionary.  It merely confers upon the court the power which it is enabled to exercise in cases which come within the spirit and the letter of Order XI.  The ultimate question, therefore, in regard to Order XI is will justice in all probability be obtained in the foreign court?</P>
    <P>The following are the main headings in which Order XI, rule 1, may be made to an Irish court for leave to serve and issue a writ or notice of a writ on a defendant who is out of the jurisdiction; (a) Where an action is being brought to enforce, rescind, dissolve, annul or otherwise affect a contract or to recover damages or other relief for or in respect of the breach of the contract in the following cases:</P>
    <P>(i)  Where the contract was made in Ireland rule 1 (e) (i).</P>
    <P>(ii)  Where the contract was made by or through an agent trading or residing in Ireland on behalf of a principal trading or residing out of Ireland, rule 1 (e) (ii).</P>
    <P>(iii)  Where the contract is by its terms or implication governed by Irish law or is one brought in respect of a breach committed in Ireland of the contract wherever made, rule 1 (e) (iii).</P>
    <P>It is sufficient for rule 1 (e) (i) to apply if the contract was substantially made in Ireland &mdash; B.P.  Exploration <i>v.</i>  Hunt (1976).  Rule 1 (f) applies if &ldquo;the action <Col N="816" /> is founded on a tort committed in Ireland.&rdquo;  It was held in Krochan <i>v.</i>  Russell and CIE (1937) that leave to serve notice of a writ under rule 1 (f) would not be granted unless the tort had a substantial connection with Ireland.  Rule 1 (g) applies &ldquo;if any injunction is sought as to anything to be done in Ireland or any nuisance in Ireland is sought to be prevented or removed whether damages are or are not also sought.&rdquo;  To come within rule 1 (g) the injunction must be part of the substantive relief to which the plaintiffs cause of action entitled him.  Rosbery <i>v.</i>  Hilbery, (1925) and The Siskina (1977).</P>
    <P>This, then, in general terms is the present jurisdiction of the Irish courts in civil and commercial matters.  Under the convention, jurisdiction will be determined in accordance with Title II of the convention.  The scope of the convention is defined by the Preamble and also in Article 1 of the convention.  The Preamble provides that the member states of the European Communities have concluded this convention desiring to implement the provisions of article 220 of the Treaty of Rome whereby they undertake to secure the simplification of formalities governing the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts or tribunals and to strengthen in the Community the legal protection of persons therein established and for this purpose to determine the international jurisdiction of their courts, to facilitate recognition and to introduce an expeditious procedure for securing the enforcement of judgments, authentic instruments and court settlements.</P>
    <P>The first paragraph of Article 1 provides that the convention &ldquo;shall apply in civil and commercial matters whatever the nature of the court or tribunal.&rdquo;  It shall not extend in particular to revenue, customs and administrative matters.  The second paragraph of Article 1 provides that the convention shall not apply to four specific areas: (i) The status or legal capacity of natural persons, rights and property arising out of a matrimonial relationship, wills, succession; (ii) bankruptcy, proceedings relating to the winding <Col N="817" /> up of insolvent companies, etc.; (iii) social security; (iv) arbitration.  The scope of the convention has been summed up by the Jenard report in the words: &ldquo;It governs international and legal relations, applies automatically and covers all civil and commercial matters apart from certain exceptions which are exhaustively listed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Article 1 has given rise to several important judgments of the European Court of Justice.  It is clear from the report of the drafters of the convention and from the judgments of the ECJ that the term &ldquo;civil and commercial matters&rdquo; was intended to be, and will be, interpreted broadly, whereas the exceptions will be interpreted more restrictively. The first of these four areas expressly excluded from the scope of the convention by the second paragraph of Article 1, namely that the convention shall not apply &mdash; and I quote: &ldquo;... To the status or legal capacity of natural persons, rights in property arising out of matrimonial relationships...&rdquo; came up for interpretation by the European Court of Justice in De Cavel <i>v.</i>  De Cavel (No. 1), (1979), case 143-78.  In that particular case Mr. De Cavell, a French man, and Mrs. De Cavell, his German wife, were resident in Frankfurt, Germany.  They had a flat there as well as an apartment in France.  Mr. De Cavell instituted divorce proceedings against his wife in Paris.  One of his allegations was that his wife had taken from their apartment in France some valuable carpets which belonged to him and had also taken some items of furniture and furnishings from their flat in Frankfurt.  The husband, therefore, applied to the French court for interim protective measures against his wife preventing her from dealing with their joint property until the court had given its judgment.  This was granted and, among other things, the court ordered the placing of seals on the furniture and effects in the couple's Frankfurt flat and the freezing of the two bank accounts in the wife's name in Germany.  The interim orders were made, of course, in compliance with French law.  The husband <Col N="818" /> applied to a German court for enforcement of the orders under Article 31 of the convention.  The German court had its doubts as to whether the interim protective orders could be enforced in Germany and it, therefore, referred the matter to the European Court.</P>
    <P>Two grounds in particular were put forward against the enforcement of the orders: (1) since the divorce itself clearly related to status and was consequently outside the scope of the convention, and since the interim orders were ancillary to the divorce proceedings, ought they not to be regarded as outside the scope of the convention as well?  And (2), even if they were not to be excluded because they were linked to the divorce proceedings should they not be regarded as relating to &ldquo;rights and property arising out of a matrimonial relationship&rdquo; and consequently, ought they not to be regarded as outside the scope of the convention as well?</P>
    <P>The European Court of Justice held that such matters were excluded but the judgment is, perhaps, rather obscure.  In one passage it states:</P>
    <P>The enforced settlement on a provisional basis of proprietary legal relationships between spouses in the course of proceedings for divorce is inseparable from questions relating to the status of persons and from the settlement of rights in property arising out of matrimonial relationships.</P>
    <P>This suggests that all such orders are automatically excluded.  However, in a later passage in the judgment it is stated that such orders may, in some cases, fall within the scope of the convention.</P>
    <P>The court said that disputes related to the assets of spouses in the course of divorce proceedings may, depending on the circumstances, concern or be closely connected with (1) questions relating to the status of persons, (2) proprietary legal relationships between spouses resulting directly from matrimonial relationship or the dissolution thereof, and (3) proprietary legal relationships between the spouses which have no connection with the marriage.  Disputes relating to <Col N="819" /> Articles 1 and 2 would be excluded from the scope of the convention but disputes relating to category (3) would fall within the scope of the convention.  Thus it seems reasonable to conclude that disputes concerning proprietary legal interests between spouses only fall within the scope of the convention where they have no connection with the marriage itself.</P>
    <P>Finally, the court said that for the purposes of the convention interim protective measures should be treated in the same way as final measures and that, in the case of interim protective measures relating to property, the important question is not the nature of the interim measure itself but the nature of the right it is intended to protect.</P>
    <P>The main jurisdictional effect on Irish law of the convention will be that it will no longer be possible for an Irish court to assume jurisdiction over a domiciliary of another contracting state by reason only of the service on him of a summons during his temporary presence in Ireland. Article 3 declares:</P>
    <P>Persons domiciled in a contracting state may be sued in the courts of another contracting state only by virtue of the rules set out in sections 2 to 6 of Title II, and in particular the following provisions shall not be applicable as against them.  In Ireland the rules which enable jurisdiction to be founded on the document instituting the proceedings having been served on the defendant during his temporary presence in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Wilderstein case and the other cases in regard to temporary sojourns from one country to another would seem to be about to be brought to an end.</P>
    <P>The primary or general jurisdictional case of the convention is, as the Minister has indicated, based on domicile.  Article 2 lays down the basic rule for determining general jurisdiction.  It provides that:</P>
    <P>Persons domiciled in a contracting state shall, whatever their nationality, <Col N="820" /> be sued in the courts of that State ... except where the Convention... specifically allows them to be sued elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The convention does not define what &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; is to mean but Article 52 of the convention indicates how it may be defined.  Title II, Articles 2 to 18, contain: (1) special jurisdictional rules which supplement the general jurisdiction based on domicile, for example.  Article 5 sets out several instances where the plaintiff has a choice of jurisdiction; (2) exclusive jurisdictional rules which exclude the general jurisdiction based on domicile, for example, in the case of immovable property.  Article 16 gives exclusive jurisdiction to the courts of the contracting state in which the property is situated. These rules correspond broadly to the grounds on which leave to serve out of the jurisdiction may be granted at present under Order XI of the Rules of the Superior Courts.</P>
    <P>Article 5 (1), mentioned by the Minister in detail, provides that in matters relating to a contract a person domiciled in the contracting state may be sued in another contracting state in:</P>
    <P>... the courts for the place of performance of the obligation in question.</P>
    <P>Article 5 (1) has given rise to a number of important interpretations by the European Court of Justice.  In de Bloos <i>v.</i> Bouyer (1976), case 14/76, the French defendant company granted a Belgian company an exclusive right to distribute their products in Belgium, Luxembourg and the Belgian Congo.  The plaintiff, de Bloos complained that there had been a unilateral breach of contract without any notice by Bouyer and they brought an action in the Belgian court seeking the dissolution of the contract and damages. Bouyer objected to the jurisdiction of the Belgian court and the court upheld this objection.  De Bloos then appealed to the court of appeal of Mans which formulated the following question for the European Court of Justice:</P>
    <P>In any action brought by the grantee of an exclusive sales concession against <Col N="821" /> the grantor in which he claims that the latter has infringed the exclusive concession, may the term &ldquo;obligation&rdquo; in Article 5 (1) of the Convention be applied to the obligation in dispute or forming the basis of legal proceedings?</P>
    <P>The European Court of Justice held as follows:</P>
    <P>(1)  As stated in the preamble the Convention is intended to determine the international jurisdiction of the courts of the contracting States, to facilitate the recognition and to introduce an expeditious procedure for securing the enforcement of judgments.</P>
    <P>(2)  These objectives imply the need to avoid, as far as possible, creating a situation in which a number of courts have jurisdiction in respect of one and the same contract.</P>
    <P>(3)  Because of this Article 5 (1) of the Convention cannot be interpreted as referring to any obligation whatsoever arising under the contract in question.  On the contrary, the word &ldquo;obligation&rdquo; in Article 5.1 confers the contractual obligation forming the basis of the legal proceedings.</P>
    <P>Article 5.3 which the Minister dealt with in great detail, provides that in matters relating to a contract, a person domiciled in the contracting state may be sued in the courts of another contracting state where the harmful event occurred.  Of course the phrase &ldquo;where the harmful event occurred&rdquo; is ambiguous for if the <i>tort feasor</i> acts in country A, for example, and causes harm in country B, it is not clear whether the harmful event should be regarded as having occurred in Country A or country B.  In Bier <i>v.</i>  Mines De Potasse d'Alsace, 1976, the European Court of Justice was called upon to clarify this matter.  The defendants in this case, a very topical case, were a French concern operating in Alsace.  They discharged approximately 11,000 tonnes of chloride each day into the river Rhine which considerably increased the salinity of the <Col N="822" /> water.  Bier was a nursery man living near Rotterdam who used water from the river Rhine for irrigation purposes.  Because the water was so polluted, he was obliged to take expensive measures to purify it. Thus the defendant's action in discharging pollutants into the river Rhine in France had caused harm to the plaintiff in Holland.  The question arose: which court had jurisdiction under Article 5.3, the French Court or the Dutch Court? The European Court of Justice held that the phrase in Article 5.3 &ldquo;where the harmful event occurred&rdquo; must be understood as being intended to cover both the place where the damage occurred and the place of the events giving rise to it.  Thus the plaintiff has two choices of jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>This decision must be seen in the light of the recent decision on Greham <i>v.</i> Medical Incorporated and Pine Valley Associates, where our Supreme Court formulated jurisdictional rules for the determination of the locus of a tort different from those set out by the European Court of Justice in the Bier <i>v.</i>  Mines De Potasse case.  However, when this convention, which is derived from the EC Treaty, becomes law, it will have supremacy over the provisions of our national law or any national law which conflicts with it.  Under the convention also, the jurisdiction of our courts will be enlarged, as the Minister has said, in cases concerning insurance and consumer contracts.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 4 of Title III give the policy holder and the consumer a choice of jurisdiction not presently available.  It has been excellently summed up in the Minister's speech when he says &ldquo;as in the case of maintenance, these provisions reflect concern for the weaker party &mdash; that is the policy holder and the consumer respectively.&rdquo;  I certainly welcome that. The doctrine of <i>forum non-conveniens,</i> which enables an Irish court to decline jurisdiction in favour of a foreign court which it considers would be more suitable to determine the issue, will cease to have application in actions, including domiciliaries of contracting states.</P>
    <P>Under existing Irish law, the first and <Col N="823" /> over-riding essential for the effectiveness of a foreign judgment in Ireland is that the adjudicating court should have had jurisdiction in the international sense over the defendant.  There are three conditions which must be satisfied for the enforcement in Ireland of a foreign judgment in common law: (1) the judgment must have been given by a court of competent jurisdiction; (2) the judgment must be final and conclusive; and (3) the judgment must be for a definite sum of money.</P>
    <P>However, despite the fact that a foreign judgment upon which the defendant is sued is final and conclusive, it is still open to the defendant to escape liability not only by pleading that the foreign court had no jurisdiction but also by pleading one of three further defences: (1) that the foreign judgment was obtained by fraud; (2) that the enforcement of the foreign judgment would be contrary to public policy of Irish law; and (3) that the foreign judgment was contrary to natural justice.  Under the convention.  Title III deals with the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments.  The intention of the drafters of the convention is summed up in the following statement from the Jenard report:</P>
    <P>As a result of the safeguards granted to the defendant in the original proceedings, Title III of the convention is very liberal on the question of recognition and enforcement.  It seeks to facilitate as far as possible the free movement of judgments and should be interpreted in this spirit.</P>
    <P>The Jenard report continues:</P>
    <P>This liberal approach is evidenced in Title III, first by a reduction in the number of grounds which can operate to prevent recognition and enforcement of judgments and second, by the simplification of the enforcement procedure which will be common to the member states.</P>
    <P>Recognition is governed by Articles 26 to 30.  The effect of Article 26 is that a <Col N="824" /> judgment given in one contracting State shall be automatically recognised in another contracting state without any special procedure being required.</P>
    <P>The Jenard report states:</P>
    <P>Under Article 26, there is a presumption in favour of recognition which can be rebutted only if one of the grounds for refusal listed in Article 27 is present.</P>
    <P>The Jenard report highlights two novel developments: (1) that judgments no longer have to be <i>Res Judicarta</i>; and (2) in general, the jurisdiction of the original court does not have to be investigated. There are two main exceptions to recognition. Under Article 27.1, a judgment need not be recognised where recognition would be contrary to the public policy of the state in which recognition is sought. The Schlosser report, referred to by the Minister, adverted to the fact that fraud is regarded in the Irish courts as a special ground separate from public policy and it has been suggested by the Schlosser report that the obtaining of a judgment by fraud &ldquo;can, in principle, constitute an offence against the public policy of the State addressed.&rdquo;  Furthermore:</P>
    <P>... that a court in the State addressed must always ask itself whether a breach of its public policies still exists in view of the fact that proceedings for redress can be or could have been lodged in the courts of the State of origin against the judgment allegedly obtained by fraud.</P>
    <P>Under Article 27.2 a judgment will not be recognised:</P>
    <P>... where it was given in default of appearance, if the defendant was not duly served with the document which instituted the proceedings or with an equivalent document in sufficient time to enable him or her to arrange for his or her defence.</P>
    <P>There does not appear, however, to be any objective standard of what constitutes &ldquo;sufficient time&rdquo; and it is stated in the Jenard report that it is for the court <Col N="825" /> in which recognition is sought to decide whether the defendant was given sufficient time to arrange for his defence.</P>
    <P>Finally, in regard to enforcement the drafters of the convention clearly realised that the progress made by the jurisdictional provisions of Title II would in the words of the Jenard report &ldquo;be rendered nugatory if a party seeking enforcement in a contracting State of a judgment given in his favour were impeded by procedural obstacles.&rdquo;  Because the recognising court is strictly limited in its powers to look into the judgment and because the defendant is adequately protected in the original proceedings, the Jenard report considers that &ldquo;it is proper that the application for enforcement be enabled to proceed rapidly&rdquo; and &ldquo;that enforcement be obtained without unnecessary complications.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I believe the convention will have far-reaching implications for the Irish legal system and, indeed, the Irish legal profession.  Irish lawyers will have to familiarise themselves with the provisions of the convention in many disputes which have an international aspect. Our judges will have to apply the rules contained in the convention regardless of whether they had been pleaded or not. A great lot of the discretion formerly exercised by our judges in fact will be restricted.  Be that as it may, in general I welcome this Bill.  Go raibh maith agat.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill. The purpose of the Bill is to enable Ireland to ratify the EC convention of 27 September 1968 on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgment in civil and commercial matters and the Protocol of 3 June 1971 on the interpretation of that convention by the Courts of Justice of the European Communities, both instruments as amended by the convention of 9 October 1978, to provide for the accession of Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom.  The convention of 25 October 1982 provided for the accession of Greece to the 1968 convention and 1971 Protocol.  Accession to the convention and to the Protocol which has <Col N="826" /> been in force between the original six member states&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;since 1973 was a condition of our membership of the European Communities under Article 220 of the Treaty of Rome and article 3 of the Act of Accession of 1972.  Adjustments to the 1968 convention and the 1971 Protocol to suit Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom were included in the 1978 Accession Convention. Enactment of the Bill will enable Ireland to ratify that convention and thereby accede to the 1968 convention and 1971 Protocol, as adjusted.  Enactment of the Bill will also enable Ireland to ratify the Greek Accession Convention of 1982. The Minister has explained in some detail the provisions of both the Bill and the convention.  Rather modestly he has not mentioned that he was the Minister who signed the convention providing for the accession of Ireland, Denmark and the United Kingdom to the judgments convention back in 1978.  The Minister must be particularly proud to have this opportunity now to steer through the legislation necessary to allow the judgments convention come into force for Ireland.</P>
      <P>I know that the judgments convention, as amended by the 1978 convention, came into force for the first time in any EC state in November 1986.  It came into force for Britain at the start of this year. I am sure the Minister is anxious to have it in force in Ireland as soon as possible and I understand that is one of the reasons that the Seanad rather than the Dáil is now dealing with this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The convention and the Bill are rather technical and I imagine that the average man in the street would have great difficulty in trying to understand them. Nevertheless, the principle behind this measure is quite clear.  The other EC states will enforce Irish judgments in their countries and in return we will enforce their judgements here in Ireland. This is not a new concept.  As far as I <Col N="827" /> understand, Irish courts already enforce certain types of foreign judgments. However, the existing arrangements are disorganised.  Not all countries will enforce Irish judgments, even though we may enforce theirs and all countries impose some kind of restrictions on the enforcement of judgments against their own nationals.  The judgments convention will put all countries on an equal footing and ensure that Irish judgments will be automatically enforceable in other EC countries.</P>
    <P>I understand that great care has been taken in drawing up the jurisdictional rules to protect the weaker party.  The general rule is that you can only be sued in your own country so there is no danger of me being sued in some far away place, like Sicily, where I would not be able to defend myself without great expense.</P>
    <P>I notice special provision has been made to look after consumers and deserted wives who are normally at a disadvantage in legal proceedings.  This is to be welcomed.  It is only right that a husband who deserts his wife cannot escape his financial responsibilities by fleeing to another country.</P>
    <P>It is a sure sign of progress when nearly all the countries in Europe can agree that we all have trust in the courts of the other states.  We are all democracies and despite the differences between the various legal systems we all cherish the same concept of justice.  We will be reaching the stage where we will have a common market in justice.  When the convention is in force and if someone crashes into my car it will be of minor importance whether the person lives in Kerry, Dublin or indeed in any European city. The judgment of the Irish court will have the same force in Germany as it has in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The advantages of the convention are clear.  The business and commercial sector, particularly those involved in international trade, will benefit from a clear set of jurisdictional rules which will apply through the EC.  Irish judgments will be enforced automatically in all the contracting states.  While the major benefits <Col N="828" /> of the convention will accrue to the business sector, I am glad to see that the rights of the individual are not being neglected.  I have already mentioned the special provision to look after consumers and persons seeking maintenance.</P>
    <P>I note that the Bill pays special attention to the problems facing deserted wives trying to enforce maintenance orders.  Section 7 of the Bill, which deals with enforcing maintenance orders, is by far the longest section and I commend the Minister for the detailed attention given to that problem facing the weaker members of our society.  The legislation will also help those who are claiming insurance when foreigners crash into Irish citizens.  Now, under the Bill, an insurer domiciled in the contracting state may be sued in another contracting state in the courts where the policy holder is domiciled or in the court of the contracting state in which proceedings are brought against the leading insurer.</P>
    <P>We will have a much better opportunity to discuss each section more thoroughly on Committee Stage and I look forward to discussing the Bill more thoroughly then.  The sooner this convention comes into force the better.  I am sure the Minister will do everything in his power to achieve this.  I hope this Bill will get a speedy passage through this House and through the Dáil.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the European Communities Convention.  This Bill is entitled &ldquo;Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments (European Communities) (No. 2) Bill, 1987&rdquo;.  As various speakers have pointed out already, the purpose of the Bill is to ratify the EC convention of <Col N="829" /> 27 September 1968.  It is based on Article 220 of the European Treaties Bill referred to by the Minister.  This provides that:</P>
    <P>Member States shall, so far as is necessary, enter into negotiations with each other with a view to securing for the benefit of their nationals the simplification of formalities governing the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts or tribunals and of arbitration awards.</P>
    <P>The legislation makes a fundamental change in case law and our legal profession, as Senator Kennedy pointed out, will have to deal with many civil and commercial cases.  If cases are challenged, and channelled through the High Court, the High Court may become over burdened with work.  It is probably over burdened at the moment.  Many of the legal problems and claims that will arise over legal liability and limited liability in the Companies Bill legislation will find themselves in the High Court as well. The Minister for Justice may have to provide extra accommodation in the High Court to deal with the backlog that may arise.</P>
    <P>We have become accustomed over the years to hearing of people evading their responsibilities to the Revenue Commissioners. We have heard of people who are escaping their responsibilities in Ireland and going abroad to avoid paying what they owe either in taxation or in maintenance orders.  I am glad this legislation will tidy up those matters in relation to the European Communities.</P>
    <P>I realise that it does not enter into the area of extradition or criminal law which is a separate matter.  But in the area of civil and commercial matters we have had malpractice, Public disquiet has been expressed about this and it has been getting media attention over the years.  This legislation will assist in changing courts procedures to ensure that people who evade their responsibilities will be brought to justice in EC countries.  The object of the convention is to enable judgments given in the member state to be recognised and enforced in another <Col N="830" /> member state as quickly and, above all, as cheaply as possible.  That there is a need for this may be seen from the large number of bilateral conventions which exist.  It is necessary because of the huge number of bilateral conventions that exist not only in the European Communities but throughout the world.</P>
    <P>We are bringing together all these bilateral conventions under the one heading in this legislation.  The legal systems in operation in member states are different. We must be conscious of this when dealing with civil and commercial cases.  We do not want to see any individual or national in this country victimised under the legal system of another member state.  The Minister will have to keep a close eye on this Act in the initial stages to ensure that the legal system in an other member state of the European Community does not treat Irish citizens unfairly when they are being tried abroad.  I have some reservations about this legislation.  Perhaps we will not know the extent to which this may take place until we have seen the Act in practice for a time.</P>
    <P>Persons who have lawful claims require speedy and effective protection in cases where the legal relationship out of which the claim arises extends beyond national frontiers into another member state. Recently we signed the Single European Act.  We aspire under that Act to speed up the decision making process in Europe and to bring together the member states in all aspects of life and in all aspects of decision making.  I see this very important legislation as a step forward and a step towards improving decision making in legal matters.  I look forward to the day when all member states of the EC will have a common legal system.  This will make it much easier for nationals in this or any other country to have their claims on civil or commercial and criminal matters finalised as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>One of the aims of the Community is to make it easier for people to carry on their activities beyond the frontiers of their home state.  Here one has in mind the right of free establishment, the freedom to supply goods and services, free movement of capital.  Of course, the <Col N="831" /> removal of existing barriers to inter state trade may enable some types of debtor or obligee to escape from the grasp of the claimant.  The general improved protection of claimants will operate to the benefit of every person who has obtained judgment in any court or tribunal throughout the Community.</P>
    <P>The European Communities judgments convention is a double convention. The application of its rules has a double aspect.  First, they are to be applied in a state in which the proceedings are commenced.  The court must decide whether it has jurisdiction under the convention.  Secondly, they must be applied in the state in which application is made for enforcement of a judgment given in another contracting state.  The court in the state addressed must apply those rules of the convention which deal with recognition and enforcement.  The two parts of the convention complement each other in that the first part, relating to jurisdiction, creates certain safeguards for the benefit of the defendant, and this enables the enforcement procedure to be simplified and speeded up.</P>
    <P>The application of a simple convention does not involve this dual aspect.  In our present context the rules would be applied only in the state in which application was made for enforcement of a judgment given in one of the other contracting states.  Under a simple convention the court has to decide whether the judgment was pronounced by a foreign court whose judgments it is bound to recognise and enforce.  The jurisdictional element comes into play only indirectly, and it is for this reason that such conventions are known as <i>conventions a regles de compétence indirectes.</i>  My French is not the best but that is what is meant in the legal jargon of the European Communities.</P>
    <P>The binding nature of the rules of the convention is one of their characteristic features.  Identifying and defining domicile will probably be the most difficult feature of the legislation.  The sense is that the courts must have their own motion to decide whether they have jurisdiction. <Col N="832" /> We could have a difficulty in establishing who has the right of jurisdiction in taking the case.  The arguments will be to-ing and fro-ing between member states for a long time and this could slow up and make protracted the cases which will be taken under this legislation. Once jurisdiction has been established the case can be taken rather speedily.</P>
    <P>As the convention does not alter national laws, it is for the law of each contracting state to determine whether the court must have proof of the facts on which its competence is based or whether it may, or must, make its own inquiry into the matter.  A court must use the utmost care in determining whether it has jurisdiction, for the court in which enforcement is sought abroad is not to inquire into the competence of the court of origin.  Once jurisdiction is established the court must take its decision within that jurisdiction and all other European countries are obliged to enforce it.</P>
    <P>Where after careful examination, the court which is seized comes to the conclusion that it has jurisdiction under the convention, it must exercise that jurisdiction. It must not decline jurisdiction merely because by the application of the doctrine of <i>forum conveniens</i> it considers that the interest of the courts in another contracting state is substantial.  Where the plaintiff is entitled to choose between a number of courts, and the court which is seized is competent, it must not remit the case to the courts of another contracting state.  These provisions give rise to a fundamental change for the courts in Ireland and in the UK.  Hitherto the courts of these two states have been able to reach a decision only on the basis of submissions of fact of law made by the parties.</P>
    <P>The binding nature of the rules of the convention can also be seen when one examines the provisions governing enforcement.  The court in which the enforcement is sought abroad is not to inquire into the competence of the court of origin as stated in Article 28, save in relation to matters which are termed <Col N="833" /> under exclusive jurisdiction, that is, insurance, consumer contracts and cases falling under Article 16.</P>
    <P>The insurance matter which falls under exclusive jurisdiction is something the Minister could examine.  Fairly frequently I come across cases where non nationals, non-members of the EC, on holiday in Ireland unfortunately had an accident with an Irish national.  There might be a protracted case to be taken and a very uncertain course of action to be taken by the Irish national.  I have come across a number of cases where, for example, a person from Australia who goes back, having had an accident in Ireland, and is very difficult to trace. It is even more difficult to make him take responsibility for his action in this country.  This is something which the law does not provide for adequately.  I ask the Minister to have this matter investigated to see if the law could be tightened up.  Perhaps it would have to be taken in the context of the European Communities.</P>
    <P>The convention applies irrespective of the nationalities of the parties, to all cases brought before the courts or tribunals of the contracting states.  Thus, contrary to Article 220 of the EC Treaty, it is not limited to nationals of the European Communities member states.  The reason for this is two-fold.  If free circulation of judgments is to be ensured, any distinction between judgments according to the nationality of the plaintiff or defendant must be abandoned.  On the other hand, it would, in many cases, be difficult for the court to determine a person's nationality or to get proof of it.  The rules governing jurisdiction have, therefore, been based on domicile rather than on nationality.</P>
    <P>The convention applies not only to judgments in commercial matters but also to decisions given in private law disputes, irrespective of the type of claim and of whether the result is described as a judgment, decision, decree or award.  It covers orders for enforcement, decisions made in taxation of costs, enforcement of authentic instruments and of settlements approved by the court.  It applies not only <Col N="834" /> to enforcement of judgments given in debt cases, but also be judgments relating to the supply of goods or the provision of services.</P>
    <P>There is, unfortunately, some difficulty in deciding what is meant by &ldquo;civil and commercial matters.&rdquo;  Civil law and, to a large extent, commercial law are both branches of private law.  The clarification of certain sectors of law under the heading &ldquo;private&rdquo; or &ldquo;public&rdquo; does not depend on any uniform set of criteria in the six original member states.  In view of the difficulty of defining private law and public law with any exactitude, the Accession Convention provides simply that revenue, customs and administrative matters are, in particular, excluded.  But, of course, the questions of whether a judgment falls within the scope of application of the convention and, if it does, must therefore be recognised and enforced, are ones which must be answered by the court to which the application for enforcement is made.</P>
    <P>Certain fields of law are excluded from the scope of application of this convention. These are for the most part classified as private law and they are matters relating to the status or legal capacity of natural persons, rights in relation to property arising out of what we know as matrimonial relationships, wills and succession, for example.</P>
    <P>In the original member states the expression &ldquo;rights in property arising out of matrimonial relationship&rdquo; does not refer to maintenance applications but to the rights and corresponding duties which each spouse has <i>vis-a-vis</i> the other in regard to property which they own jointly.  I am glad this section has not been taken under the jurisdiction of the European Communities because the sysstem of justice would relate very differently from one country to the other.  In Ireland we have a traditional legal system in relation to inheritance and succession which is complex and complicated and we do not want to make it more complicated under the European Communities system.</P>
    <P>The basic rule under the convention is that persons who are domiciled in a contracting state are to be sued, whatever <Col N="835" /> their nationality, in the courts of that state.  Domicile is not defined in the convention which brings about a difficulty and will create an ambiguity in regard to what exactly domicile will mean from one state to the other.  It is different from the notion of domicile as understood in Ireland and the United Kingdom, for example and it is by no means the subject of any consensus in the continental member states.</P>
    <P>It should be emphasised, however, that the convention is not built on a uniform definition of domicile.  Article 52 contains conflicts rules for the purpose of determining the domicile of natural persons and Article 53 refers to the conflicts rules for the purpose of determining which law is to be applied in ascertaining the location of a seat of a company or other legal person or association of natural or legal persons.</P>
    <P>In France and Luxembourg a person's domicile depends largely on his permanent address; in Belgium one's domicile is at the address registered in the resident's register and in Germany the domicile is determined by reference to the closeness of one's connection with a particular borough or district.  Under the Irish and UK system domicile will mean something different from what it will mean to other member states of the European Community.  This could create difficulty in finalising cases under this Act.</P>
    <P>In the case of payment of a capital sum to provide income by way of compensation under tortious injury award, the courts of the defendant's domicile and those of the place where the harmful event occurred are competent.  In this connection it should be noted that the European Court decided that the latter place may be either the place where the damage was inflicted &mdash; for example, in an accident case &mdash; the place where the damage was experienced.  This underlines the fact that we need a common legal system in order to have proper cases taken under this legislation and good decisions coming therefrom.</P>
    <P>Where a person domiciled in one of the contracting states is in the position of <Col N="836" /> plaintiff he is entitled to sue a person who is domiciled outside the Community in the courts of the state of the plaintiffs domicile upon the basis of any ground of jurisdiction which applies in the case of a national of that state including the exhorbitant grounds.  Thus a Portuguese citizen domiciled in France could, under Article 14 of the French Civil Code, sue in a French court a person having no domicile within the European Community, regardless of the defendant's nationality.  In the course of a case there frequently arises a preliminary question which has been decided already by a foreign court.  The court seized must then decide whether to recognise that foreign judgment.  Article 27 sets out the grounds on which recognition can be refused.  If, in the opinion of the court, the criteria for recognition are satisfied, it must accord recognition without any special procedure being required.  If for any reason it refuses to accord recognition, the party who seeks it can apply for a declaration, as provided for in the enforcement procedure that the judgment is to be recognised.</P>
    <P>A judgment will not be recognised by a foreign court if it is contrary to the public policy of the State addressed, for example, if it was obtained by fraud; secondly, if it was given in default of appearance; thirdly, if it conflicts with another judgment given in relation to the same parties in the State addressed or; fourthly, if the court of origin in pronouncing judgment on a preliminary question relating to one of the matters excluded in the scope of the convention has contravened the provisions of the conflict rules of the State addressed.</P>
    <P>An additional ground for refusing recognition is where the court of origin has failed to apply one of the rules of exclusive jurisdiction, for example, insurance matters, credit sale and hire purchase.  It was the expressed wish of all member states when bringing forth this convention and this legislation to simplify and speed up the enforcement of judgments within the Community.  Certain formalities have to be fulfilled before enforcement is granted, for example, the <Col N="837" /> applicant must show that he or she has an address for service in the place where the court has jurisdiction or, at least, must designate a representative in those states in which the furnishing of such an address is not required.  Furthermore, he must submit a copy of the judgment of which enforcement is sought together with all documents establishing that it is enforceable under the law of the state of origin and was served on the defendant. A summons must be issued in that state of origin or the case can be thrown out. Additional documents have to be produced if the foreign judgment was given by default.  A translation of these documents must be provided only if the court requests.  Legislation or other similar formality is not required.</P>
    <P>In summing up, it would be fair to say that proceedings under the convention give every assurance to the parties and enable the successful party to obtain rapid enforcement of the foreign judgment.  The essential features of the convention which contribute to achieve this result are (a) that the application of the convention by the courts of their own motion can be taken in each member state, (b) that the criterion of nationality has been replaced by that of domicile which might cause difficulty in arriving at consensus and (c) the exhaustive rules relating to the international jurisdiction of the courts within the EC will apply. There will be unification in all member states of simplified procedures for obtaining recognition and enforcement and there will be a uniform interpretation guaranteed by the European Court of Justice.  In the final analysis there will be appeal of last resort to the European Court of Justice.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to say that the European Court of Justice in dealing with an appeal of last resort will be a last resort in that it will not be taken on board by many of the Supreme Courts of member states because of the length and protracted nature of a case like that.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Hogan, I welcome the Minister to the House and <Col N="838" /> I also welcome the Bill.  The purpose of this Bill is to enable Ireland to ratify the EC convention of 27 September 1968 on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters and also the Protocol of 3 June 1971 which was the interpretation of that convention by the Court of Justice of the European Communities &mdash; to ratify both of these instruments as amended, first, by the convention of 9 October 1978 providing for the accession of Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom, and the convention of 25 October 1982 providing for the accession of Greece.</P>
      <P>As the Minister stated, the Convention of Accession had its origins in Article 220 of the Treaty of Rome.  That Article obliged the member states to enter into negotiations with a view to securing for the benefit of their nationals the simplification of formalities governing the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts and tribunals. When Ireland, Denmark and the United Kingdom entered the Community on 1 January 1973 the convention on jurisdiction and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters was already in existence, as well as the 1971 Protocol on the interpretation of the convention by the European Court.  Article 3 of the Act of Accession of the new member states require them to accede to the 1968 convention and the 1971 Protocol, subject to necessary adjustments.</P>
      <P>Any adjustments made by the Convention of Accession must be considered in that context.  It was not open to the new member states to challenge the fundamental provisions of the convention and Protocol.  It was not, for example, open to them to question the inclusion of direct jurisdiction provisions or the exclusion of status or other matters or, indeed, the fundamental principle of interpretation by the Court of Justice. The new member states were limited in the negotiations to seek necessary adjustments to suit their particular circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The negotiations, which lasted from 1972-1978, were conducted by a working party representative of all member states <Col N="839" /> and the Commission.  This country was represented by an official of the Department of Justice and of other Departments as required, for example, Mr. Justice Kenny in relation to maritime matters gave valuable assistance.  I would like to compliment our own officials on the way they conducted these negotiations and the final outcome.</P>
    <P>I would like to look at the currently applicable principles of Irish law to the assumption of jurisdiction by our courts in cases which, <i>inter alia</i>, through the nationality or domicile of the parties involved or the location of the cause of action, potentially raise questions of private international law, and also to discuss the rules which our legal system employs in determining whether a judgment rendered by the courts of a foreign jurisdiction is enforceable in Ireland.  I would like to do this so that the Members can acquire a more informed view which will enable them the better to appreciate the implications for Irish law and practice of the EC convention on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters.</P>
    <P>There are three headings under which I will deal with this.  The first is the assumption of jurisdiction by Irish courts; the second is the enforcement of foreign judgments in Ireland and the third is the defences available to the defendant.  The Irish legal system, unlike the EC convention, draws a clear distinction between the question of assumption of jurisdiction and the issue of enforcing a foreign judgment.  In the former cases we are concerned with jurisdiction in the domestic sense &mdash; the circumstances in which our courts are capable of exercising jurisdiction over a defendant either present in or absent from Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the latter case of enforcing judgments of a foreign court, while jurisdiction, or more precisely lack of jurisdiction, is invariably the primary point of inquiry, particularly where enforcement in Ireland is being resisted, our courts at this level are concerned with jurisdiction in the international sense, in other words, <Col N="840" /> whether, according to our rules of private international law, the foreign court properly assumed jurisdiction.  Thus our courts are not concerned with the likelihood or otherwise of their decision being enforced abroad in a country in which the defendant may have located all or part of his assets, either in cases where the Irish court is deciding whether to assume jurisdiction or deciding whether to exercise it in cases where the jurisdiction undoubtedly exists.  We can, therefore, note at the outset that changes will occur in this practice following the implementation of the EC convention at least in those areas to which the convention will be applicable.</P>
    <P>The primary jurisdictional base of the EC convention is domicile &mdash; persons domiciled in the contracting state are, in general, subject to suit only in the courts of that state.  The employment of the concept of domicile indicates a recognition on the part of those responsible for the convention that there should exist a significant connection between a defendant and the forum in which the litigation takes place.  At common law in Ireland such a significant connection is not a precondition of our courts having jurisdiction over a defendant.  Our primary jurisdictional base is predicated on a notional control over a defendant evidenced by the ability of the plaintiff to personally serve the defendant with the relevant court processes for originating litigation in our courts.  Clearly then, the residence of the defendant within Ireland will enable our court to take jurisdiction. No one can have any objection to this because a significant connection between the defendant and the forum exists in that case.  However, if the ability to effect personal service is a touchstone in this context, is it applicable only to the defendant whose presence is due to residence within the jurisdiction?  The answer is no.</P>
    <P>Mere presence for whatever purpose, providing service has been properly effected, gives our court jurisdiction to deal with a cause of action which might have no connection with Ireland involving litigants who also might have no connection <Col N="841" /> with Ireland.  This exorbitant jurisdiction which has been referred to already has been unequivocally established by case law in England.  It is equally applicable in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Article 3 of the convention renders it inapplicable to defendants who are domiciliaries of contracting states.  However, it retains its efficacy in respect of litigation not covered by the convention.</P>
    <P>Personal service is therefore the primary basis of jurisdiction in Ireland and there are no pre-conditions to its availability, such as domicile, residence, nationality of the parties, or that the cause of action is located in or substantially connected with Ireland.  All these factors are irrelevant.  The only qualification appears to be that the defendant should not have been fraudulently induced to enter the jurisdiction in order that service might be effected.</P>
    <P>If a company is registered in Ireland under the Companies Act, 1963, service can always be effected by leaving the process at its registered office.  Similarly, if a company is incorporated outside Ireland but establishes a place of business in Ireland &mdash; the so-called &ldquo;overseas companies&rdquo;&mdash; it is required to provide the registrar of companies with the names and addresses of one or more persons resident in the State authorised to accept on behalf of the company service of process and also to provide the address of the company's place of business in the State.  Service can then be effected on the person or persons so named or delivered to the address so provided.</P>
    <P>If a company is neither registered in Ireland nor establishes a place of business in Ireland, but, being incorporated outside the State, conducts business in Ireland, can it, by analogy with private individuals, be said to be present within Ireland for the purpose of effecting service? The courts have answered this question in the affirmative by equating presence with carrying on its business in the country.  Two pre-conditions, however, must be satisfied.  One, there must be an agent employed in Ireland with power, or who has had the power to enter into contracts on behalf of the <Col N="842" /> company.  The second is that the agent must have operated at a fixed place of business for a definite time.  Assuming that these requirements are satisfied, service on the agent within the jurisdiction would make the company amenable to the Irish courts.</P>
    <P>If a potential defendant is not subject to the jurisdiction by virtue of personal service obtained as a result of his residence here or his fortuitous presence we face the prospect of instigating proceedings against an absent defendant. This is effected through reliance on Order 11 of the Rules of the Superior Courts, 1962, which is headed &ldquo;Service out of the Jurisdiction&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The first thing to note about the procedure under Order 11 is that the plaintiff cannot serve a defendant out of the jurisdiction as a matter of right.  The prior permission of the court is required and the court may in its discretion allow such service or refuse to permit it.  Given the nature of the practice &mdash; service on a defendant either resident or present in another country &mdash; there are many judicial utterances which clearly indicate that permission is not something which should be given lightly.  Three general considerations can immediately be identified. One, since the application is necessarily <i>ex parte</i>, the affidavit which grounds the request must contain a full and frank disclosure of all material and relevant facts.  Two, applications must fall not only within the letter of the sub-headings of Order 11 but must also be within the spirit of Order 11.  Three, in the event of doubts the benefit thereof should be extended to the absent defendant.</P>
    <P>Various judicial reservations expressed about the desirability of the concept of extended jurisdiction provided for in Order 11 have been indicated.  However, the sub-headings of Order 11, within which the plaintiffs claim must fall before permission to serve out may be given, mitigate to an extent any guilty feelings of jurisdictional imperialism by reflecting a genuine interest of the forum in respect of the litigation.  This is evidenced in the connection, reflected in the sub-headings, between Ireland and both <Col N="843" /> the defendant and subject matter of litigation. This feature of connection with the jurisdiction finds an echo in article 5 of the EC convention which gives the plaintiff alternatives to suing a defendant in the contracting state in which he is domiciled.  These alternative jurisdictions are founded on similar connectional principles to our own Order 11.</P>
    <P>There are certain contractual provisions to the courts of the place of performance of the obligation in question whereas Order 11 gives the Irish court the choice of assuming jurisdiction where a contract is entered into in Ireland, breached in Ireland, or where it is governed by Irish law.  But Article 5 (3) is more expansive in the area of tort in that, while Order 11 (1) (f) refer simply, and as has transpired rather unhelpfully, to a tort committed within the jurisdiction.  Article 5 (3), as interpreted by the European Court of Justice, gives a dual point of reference to the expression &ldquo;where the harmful event occurred&rdquo; as either the place where the damage occurred or the place where the event gave rise to and is at the origin of that damage occurred. Apart from the not infrequent difficulty of bringing a case within the sub-headings of Order 11, a plaintiff who has managed to comply with the requirements still faces the additional obstacle of showing that Ireland is the convenient forum for the proposed litigation.  After all, a contract might have been entered into in Ireland thus giving the Irish court the ability to assume jurisdiction under Order 11 but having no connection with Ireland in any other respect.  The factors which a court will take into account in deciding whether Ireland is the appropriate forum include, <i>inter alia</i>, the location of the witnesses and, if documentary evidence will be involved the present location of that evidence.  Clearly major expense to the defendant without any significant personal advantage to the plaintiff would justify the Irish court in declining to hear the case.  Secondly, whether the plaintiff will receive a full and fair trial of all the issues abroad. Unlike Scotland, the presence of moveable <Col N="844" /> property in Ireland is not in itself sufficient to give an Irish court jurisdiction over an absent defendant.  A plaintiff who wishes to assert a claim against a defendant, even in respect of the assets, must first establish the jurisdiction of the Irish court by either of the methods outlined earlier.  Clearly, therefore, an absent defendant with assets in Ireland who is unwilling to submit to the jurisdiction of the Irish court is likely, upon receiving notice of the issue of the Irish court process, to attempt to remove his assets from Ireland to protect them from execution at the suit of a plaintiff who will have obtained a judgment in default of appearance.  It is in this context, and specifically to prevent this latter occurrence, that the English courts recently reactivated a procedure which has been referred to by the Minister in his contribution as a Mareva injunction. A Mareva injunction is described as follows. The whole point of the Mareva injunction is that the plaintiff proceeds by stealth, so as to pre-empt any action by the defendant to remove his assets from the jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I can make only a brief reference to the pre-conditions which have been established by the courts for the exercise of this extremely important jurisdiction. Suffice it to say that the plaintiff must establish the jurisdiction of the court. The plaintiff must show that he has good cause of action within the jurisdiction and, finally, which is the whole <i>raison d'être</i> of the procedure, that the defendant is attempting to remove his assets from the jurisdiction with the intention of thwarting any possibility of the plaintiff satisfying his judgment.  The assets of the defendant within the jurisdiction are not attached as a result of the order.  The defendant is merely enjoined from removing them from the jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Initially, the injunction, which has become very popular &mdash; for example 1979 applications were being made at the rate of about 20 per month &mdash; was only employed against defendants who were foreign based.  This limitation on the jurisdiction was noted but left open by <Col N="845" /> the House of Lords and an extension was later denied by the High Court. However, recently it has been held both in the High Court and in the Court of Appeal that the procedure is applicable to any defendant whether permanently resident within the jurisdiction or not. Finally the injunction will not have the effect of making the plaintiff a preferred creditor with a greater standing than the defendant's secured creditors.</P>
    <P>The final method whereby a defendant who would not otherwise be amenable to the jurisdiction can find himself subject to the jurisdiction of our courts is where he voluntarily submits.  This can occur, for example:</P>
    <P>(1)  by virtue of a contractual term, or</P>
    <P>(2)  by the defendant bringing an action as plaintiff and finding himself subject to a counter claim.</P>
    <P>As with any legal system our courts have a general discretion to stay actions where justice so requires.  In our present context there are two well defined circumstances in which this discretionary power may be exercised: (a) where the plaintiff establishes or seeks to establish the jurisdiction of our courts in contravention of a clause which provides for jurisdiction to lie with a foreign court; and (b) where the plea of <i>Lis Alibi Pendens</i> is available to a defendant.  There is a third context which is rather more equivocal, namely, where a defendant requests the Irish court, whose jurisdiction is clearly established, to stay the action on the ground that Ireland is <i>forum non conveniens.</i></P>
    <P>Article 17 of the EC Convention in common with our own courts, recognises the desirability of giving effect to foreign jurisdiction clauses.  The first step for a court in this context is to decide whether the clause provides for the exclusive jurisdiction of the foreign court, or merely an optional jurisdiction in the sense that the parties will not object to the assumption of jurisdiction by the named foreign court.  This initial issue is determined by the proper law of the contract.  If the nonexclusive jurisdiction of a foreign court is chosen, the existence of the clause will <Col N="846" /> undoubtedly be a factor available to a defendant who seeks to have the proceedings in Ireland stayed or to have notice of the summons under Order XI set aside.  If the exclusive jurisdiction of a foreign court is chosen, it is the general practice of our courts to give effect to that choice by staying proceedings commenced in Ireland or by refusing leave to serve out of the jurisdiction.  The court does, however, have a discretion.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the action would be stayed unless the plaintiff shows that it is just and proper to allow it to continue. The most usual grounds for refusing a stay would be that the issue between the parties is essentially factual and the evidence relevant thereto is to be found almost entirely in Ireland and that a trial abroad would constitute real hardship to the plaintiff and not mere inconvenience.</P>
    <P>The issue of <i>Lis Alibi Pendens</i> arises when simultaneous proceedings are pending in Ireland and in a foreign country involving the same parties and on the same or similar issues.  This eventuality, which is clearly possible under the EC Convention, is provided for in Articles 21 to 23.  Our courts deal with this eventuality in one of three ways:</P>
    <P>(1)  Putting the party so suing to an election;</P>
    <P>(2)  Refusing an election and simply staying the proceedings in Ireland;</P>
    <P>(3)  Staying the proceedings in the foreign country by enjoining the plaintiff from continuing the foreign litigation.</P>
    <P>This does not involve an interference with the foreign proceedings but is merely an exercise by the Irish court of its <i>in personam</i> jurisdiction over the plaintiff.</P>
    <P>The burden to be discharged by the defendant varies in accordance with whether the issue is: (a) the plaintiff suing the same defendant here and in the foreign country; or (b) the plaintiff here is defendant abroad and <i>vice versa.</i>  The burden is greater in respect of (b), that is, where the plaintiff here is the defendant abroad and <i>vice versa</i>, but in both cases the defendant will be obliged to show <Col N="847" /> that to refuse a stay would cause hardship and oppression.  The third context in which a court has discretion to grant a stay is where proceedings have been instituted in Ireland by personal service and such service does not involve disregard of a foreign jurisdiction clause or give rise to a question of <i>Lis Alibi Pendens.</i></P>
    <P>Personal service on a defendant within the jurisdiction, irrespective of whether he resides here or is merely a fleeting presence, establishes the jurisdiction of our courts.  It is apparent from this that neither the parties nor the issue involved may have any real connection with Ireland but may instead be a case of a reluctant foreigner being made subject to our jurisdiction by another foreigner.  It follows that in this situation the defendant is likely to be faced with the prospect of great inconvenience and possibly hardship if the litigation is to continue in this jurisdiction and he wishes to remain involved.  What we are thus faced with is a case in which our courts undoubtedly have jurisdiction but a jurisdiction which the defendant would prefer they declined to exercise.</P>
    <P>Is there a justification for having a general doctrine of <i>forum non conveniens</i> which would be available to a defendant in this context?  What powers, if any, reside with our courts to prevent the possibility of &ldquo;forum shopping&rdquo; which our very liberal jurisdictional rules appear to encourage?  It is possible when the EC Convention becomes operative and ratified in this jurisdiction that our courts may be used as a method of gaining access to funds of a non-domiciliary of a contracting state which may be temporarily located within the Community.</P>
    <P>Scottish law has clearly recognised a plea of <i>forum non conveniens</i> and it has been suggested that a similar document existed in English law, although they are not referred to by that expression. Recent English authorities have sought to clarify precisely the circumstances in which a stay will be granted and they indicate that, while no general doctrine of <i>forum non conveniens</i>, in the sense <Col N="848" /> that it exists in Scots law, is available in English law, the future approach of the English courts will be such that it will almost certainly render the need for such a doctrine superfluous as a method of preventing forum shopping.</P>
    <P>The oft quoted criteria for granting a stay in this context were enunciated by Scott LJ in St. Pierre <i>v.</i>  South-American Stores Ltd. in 1936:</P>
    <P>(1)  A mere balance of convenience is not a sufficient ground for depriving a plaintiff of the advantages of prosecuting his action in an English court if it is otherwise properly brought.  The right of access to the King's court must not be lightly refused.</P>
    <P>(2)  In order to justify a stay, two conditions must be satisfied, one positive and the other negative, (a) The defendant must satisfy the court that the continuance of the action would work an injustice because it would be oppressive or vexatious to him or would be an abuse of the process of the court in some other way and, (b), the stay must not cause an injustice to the plaintiff.  On both, the burden of proof is on the defendant.</P>
    <P>Mere inconvenience is, therefore in itself, insufficient to justify a stay.  Indeed in the earlier decisions, where a court declined to exercise an undoubted jurisdiction it appears that the vexation and oppression were evidenced in what was a clear attempt by the plaintiff to harass the defendant and force him to a settlement rather than an illustration of a bona fide desire on the part of the plaintiff to pursue the cause of action to a judicial conclusion.</P>
    <P>The decision of the House of Lords in MacShannon <i>v.</i>  Rockware Glass Ltd. in 1979 continued the liberalisation.  This former case countenanced a more flexible interpretation of the expressions &ldquo;vexation&rdquo; and &ldquo;oppression&rdquo; which Scott LJ had employed and suggested that in future a defendant may secure a stay if he persuades the court that there exists an alternative, more appropriate forum, to which he is amenable and that obliging the plaintiff to resort to that forum will <Col N="849" /> not deprive the plaintiff of any real, rather than imaginary, legitimate personal or judicial advantage in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Weintraub, who was a distinguished American international lawyer, in Commentary on the Conflict of Laws 1971 page 155 states:</P>
    <P>It is true that the adoption of <i>forum non-convenience</i> will produce additional issues for the parties to argue and the courts to decide.  The question, however, is whether intelligent use of the doctrine produces benefits in terms of both increased efficiency in the administration of justice and fairness to the parties that outweigh its costs.</P>
    <P>When we come on to the enforcement of foreign judgments in Ireland the chief significance for this jurisdiction of the EC Convention in the area of the enforcement of foreign judgments is that the rigid jurisdictional rules imposed by the convention render the enforcement of a resulting judgment a matter of procedure rather than a process which might involve detailed consideration of our rules on enforcement.  While, of course, recognition and enforcement of the judgment of the court of another member state is not in all cases obligatory the opportunity of refusal to enforce is considerably reduced.  In order, therefore, to better locate the significance on our legal system of this aspect of the convention I will outline the current applicable principles of Irish law in regard to the enforcement of foreign judgments.</P>
    <P>The initial point might be made that a plaintiff who is successful in an action against a defendant in domestic Irish law is precluded from suing again on the same cause of action.  This doctrine of merger &mdash; cause of action being merged in the judgment &mdash; is not a doctrine which is applied in relation to foreign judgments. The effect of this is that the plaintiff has an option of either resorting to his original cause of action or proceeding on foot of the judgment.  Generally speaking, plaintiffs will proceed on foot of the foreign judgment, but one possible advantage of this &ldquo;illogical survival&rdquo;&mdash;<Col N="850" /> the non-merger principle is that if the defaulting judgment debtor is out of Ireland when enforcement is sought in this jurisdiction application to serve notice out of the jurisdiction will be necessary and reliance on the judgment would reduce the grounds of Order XI available to the plaintiff to the sole heading allowed for service out when the defendant is &ldquo;domiciled or ordinarily resident&rdquo; in Ireland.</P>
    <P>There are three requirements for the enforcement in Ireland of a foreign judgment of common law:</P>
    <P>(a)  The judgment must have been rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>(b)  The judgment must be final and conclusive.</P>
    <P>(c)  The judgment must be for a definite sum of money.</P>
    <P>If we look at the first one, a precondition of the enforcability of a foreign judgment in Ireland is that, in the view of the Irish court, the rendering court was justified in a certain jurisdiction over the defendant. As a result of the case law in this area we can assert with some confidence that the following will be acknowledged as an acceptable jurisdictional basis of our courts:</P>
    <P>Residence of the defendant within the jurisdiction of the judgment rendering court.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that this is the most appropriate basis.  I bow to the Minister in this regard.  I will mention the other ones.  There are three of them.  The other is that the judgment must be final and conclusive.  What we require for the purposes of enforcement in this context is that the judgment must be regarded by the rendering court as <i>res judicata.</i>  The third one is that an <i>in personam</i> judgment must be for a fixed sum.  In order for a judgment <i>in personam</i> to be enforceable in Ireland the foreign court must have definitely and finally determined the amount which is required to be paid by the judgment debtor.</P>
    <P>In referring to the judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, the <Col N="851" /> question of submission to the jurisdiction becomes more contentious when a defendant, who would not otherwise be amenable to the jurisdiction of a foreign court, appears as defendant to contest a jurisdiction which the court has served over him.  This is an issue to which Irish lawyers must pay particular attention where, for example, a client resident in Ireland is served with a notice of a process taken out in England or in the Six Counties and he has no assets or little assets in that jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Clearly, if the client voluntarily appears in response to the process and involves himself fully in the litigation, with or without a counter claim, and loses, he will be unable to resist enforcement of the judgment against his assets in Ireland on solely jurisdictional grounds. Equally, if the defendant ignores the process and plays no part whatever in the foreign proceedings, the judgment will be unenforceable in Ireland.  However, if the defendant should have assets in England, or again in the six occupied counties of Ireland, he obviously cannot ignore the foreign action since a judgment in default of appearance will result and will be satisfied against his assets in that jurisdiction although, of course, his assets in Ireland will remain protected.  I have been asked by the Minister to conclude at this stage and I bow to his wishes.</P>

      <P>I dtosach ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na Seanadóirí a bhí páirteach san díospóireacht seo, go mór mhór mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leo as ucht an fáilte a chuir siad rómham an chéad turas dom sa Seanad nua seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Senators who were involved in this debate here this afternoon and I am thankful to the Senators who welcomed me to the Seanad for the first time. I hope to be back very often with quite a number of Bills which I have in the Department of Justice which, I hope, we can initiate in this House.  This Bill, as Members know, was before the Dáil.  I went through it last week, not for the <Col N="852" /> purposes of lightening the load of the Dáil, as was alleged by Members of the Dáil one particular morning but for the purpose of having the Bill initiated in the Seanad so that we can start the processing of this important legislation.  I thank the Senators for their contributions to the debate and their general welcome for the Bill.</P>
    <P>Before I respond to the particular points raised I should like to make some general comments.  While ratification of the 1968 Brussels Convention is one of the obligations arising from membership of the European Communities, I would not like the impression to be created that ratification is a mere technical exercise. The Bill is a very significant step forward in the development of private international law in Ireland.  This will be the first occasion when the State has entered into a multilateral international agreement to accept common rules of international jurisdication and to undertake to recognise and enforce foreign judgments.</P>
    <P>The implication of this will be better appreciated if put in a historical context. In many respects private international law has been the Cinderella branch of Irish law.  Of course, the development of law is influenced by the social and commercial realities of the society within which it operates.  Questions of private international law arise only when there is an international aspect to a case.  Until recent times such cases, particularly in the commercial sphere, have not arisen frequently in Irish courts because, for historical reasons, we did not have very active trade links with continental European countries.</P>
    <P>Traditionally our international trading links have been with other common law countries and because of the similarities between our legal system and other common law countries there was little demand to supplement Irish private international law by, for example, the ratification of appropriate international conventions.  Gradually, however, it has come to be recognised that the common law rules on their own are no longer adequate to deal with the legal problems which can arise in today's world.  That <Col N="853" /> this is so is reflected in the developments in our private international law in the last decade or so.  For example, the common law does not permit the enforcement of foreign maintenance orders for periodic payments, on the basis that they are not final and conclusive.</P>
    <P>To resolve this problem with respect to relations between the UK and Ireland both countries entered into an agreement in 1974 providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of maintenance orders, which agreement was given effect in Ireland by the Maintenance Orders Act, 1974.  This was the first ever international agreement entered into by Ireland providing for the reciprocal enforcement of judgments.  As Senators are aware the 1968 Convention will extend this arrangement to all member states of the EC.</P>
    <P>Since 1981 foreign arbitral awards have been more readily enforceable in Ireland by virtue of the Aribitration Act, 1980, which was passed so as to enable Ireland to ratify, <i>inter alia</i>, the 1958 New York Convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards, which was drawn up to replace a more cumbersom procedure contained in an earlier convention to which we were a contracting party since 1954.</P>
    <P>Ratification of the 1968 Brussels Convention will represent a very significant step in this development of our private international law.  Ratification will, in addition, have great practical advantages particularly to business people for whom legal certainty, in so far as this can be achieved, is a matter of no small importance. When the convention is in force it will be known in advance which country's courts will have jurisdiction in the case of a particular dispute and, perhaps of greater significance, the enforcement of any subsequent judgment in another Community country will be more or less guaranteed.</P>
    <P>The existing position under which a plaintiff has no guarantee any judgment he might obtain in an Irish court would be enforced in a Community country has probably deterred people from initiating proceedings which they would otherwise <Col N="854" /> have taken.  The 1968 Convention will eventually apply in all the 12 member states of the European Economic Community. Members may be interested to learn that negotiations involving all the 12 member states and a number of the EFTA states with a view to concluding a parallel convention to the 1968 convention are in progress at the moment.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal specifically with some points raised by the Members in their contributions.  I will start by thanking Senator Pat Kennedy for his welcome for the Bill and complimenting him on his most erudite contribution to the debate. Senator Kennedy, quoting an editorial in <i>The Irish Law Times</i> said that the enactment of this legislation would mean a major change in the rules of civil procedure in Ireland.  It is true that the rules of court governing procedure, particularly in the area of service outside of the jurisdiction, will have to be amended. This will be carried out by the various rules committees of the courts following the passing of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Kennedy, when dealing with Article 5 (3) of the convention, which concerns jurisdiction in cases of tort, compared the Supreme Court decision in Grehan <i>v.</i>  Medical Incorporated with the European court decision on Article 5 (3) in Bier <i>v.</i>  Mines De Potasse.  While the decisions may not be on all fours in matters of detail they are, in general, in harmony. Both favour a pragmatic approach generally favouring the plaintiffs rather than a strictly legalistic approach to decide the place of a tort.  In the case I mentioned the Court of Justice decided that &ldquo;the place where the harmful event occurred&rdquo; is to be defined so as to give the plaintiff the option to commence proceedings either at the place where the damage occurred or at the place of the event giving rise to it.</P>
    <P>In Grehan <i>v.</i>  Medical Incorporated, which related to personal injury caused in Ireland as a result of the insertion in the plaintiffs heart of a defective heart valve manufactured in the United States Judge Walsh interpreting Order XI, Rule 1 (f), which allows service out of jurisdiction in a case where a tort was <Col N="855" /> committed within the State, decided it was sufficient, in order to come within this rule, that &ldquo;any significant element occurred within the jurisdiction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senator Hogan also raised the possibility of victimisation of an Irish citizen by a foreign court.  The convention is based on mutual trust in the integrity of the courts of the contracting states.  We share a common cultural background with all of the states involved, and all equally cherish the concept of democracy and justice.  There is no reason to belive that, for example, the judgment of a Dutch court will be in any way less just then the judgment of an Irish court.</P>
    <P>Under existing law we already recognise this in the Irish courts' willingness to enforce certain types of judgments from foreign courts.  We expect the other countries in the European Economic Communty to recognise the integrity of our courts.  It is not unreasonable for them to expect the same for their courts.  If it should appear that there has been a blatant miscarriage of justice, the convention does allow, under Article 27, the Irish courts to reject such a judgment.</P>
    <P>Senator Hogan raised the question of the increase in the workload of the High Court.  To avoid increasing the workload of the High Court unnecessarily the Bill provides, in section 5, that applications for the enforcement of judgments shall be made to the Master of the High Court. It is hoped in this way that most of the burden of processing applications for enforcement shall fall to the Master and not to the High Court itself.</P>
    <P>Senator Hogan was worried about the possible differences in the meaning of the word &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; between Ireland and other countries in the European Economic Community.  He is quite right when he says that the traditional concept of &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; used in Ireland is different from the continental concept.  It is for this reason that this Bill provides a special definition of &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; in section 13 and the Fifth Schedule to the Bill to bring us into line with the continental view of &ldquo;domicile&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Lydon and Senator <Col N="856" /> McEllistrim for their generous welcome for the Bill and for their very valuable contributions to the discussion which we had here this afternoon.  They gave examples of how the Bill will prove of particular benefit to the country and, in particular, to the business community.  I look forward to a very detailed discussion when we have an opportunity to move on to the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It is an extensive Bill.  It is not as complicated as it looks or as it sounds.  I hope Members will find an opportunity to study the Bill between now and Committee Stage.  Any amendments will be welcome and will be dealt with entirely on their merits.  I would welcome anything which would lead to a good and fruitful discussion.  Whenever the House so orders I will come back for Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Committee Stage ordered for Thursday, 18 June 1987.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose having been here for over 20 years &mdash; 26 years &mdash; I could say a little on this motion.  Like other speakers I want to say how pleased I was that Senators Ross and Murphy decided to table it.  However, I do not congratulate them on it because they could have tabled this motion down through the years but they did not do so until a threat circulated by the new political party &mdash; the Progressive Democrats &mdash; to have this House abolished. Then suddenly people became interested <Col N="857" /> in having a review of the conditions here. They know the House cannot be abolished without a referendum.  There are many other things we could do here through committees and I am sure that, when Senator Lanigan is replying tonight, he will point out those things.</P>
      <P>Of course it is much easier for the university people to table motions.  They have more time for that than those who have been elected on the panels.  Personally, I feel there is no comparison between the work we do as panel elected people and that of the University elected people.  We have to be here every day the Seanad is sitting.  We have to listen to speeches from Senator Ross and Senator Murphy and others.  Then they go away and we have to stay here because a vote may be taken.  I understand that Senator Ross said in his opening remarks that he would prefer to see all university graduates voting and the Seanad elected by the universities.  Well, I would not like to see that happen and certainly I am not opposed to graduates being here as Members of the Seanad.  I congratulate those who have gone through this Chamber in the past and those who are there now.  They made very good contributions and I am sure that many of the present 43 are also university graduates.  But in my experience, and indeed I think most people agree, the best politicians in the Dáil and Seanad come up the hard way. They start at local government level. Many people now get degrees in politics but the best university in which to get that degree is the local authority.  Many people who began as local authority members ended up as Cabinet Ministers or Ministers of State in later years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ross also read out a litany of names last Wednesday &mdash; defeated Dáil candidates and defeated Deputies who are now Members of this House.  I would like to know from Senator Ross what is wrong with that.  I am sure Senator Ross has the same ambition as every other young person who comes in here has &mdash; to be a TD &mdash; but of course Senator Ross knows very well that he has no hope of getting that far.  There is nothing wrong with defeated TDs or Dáil candidates <Col N="858" /> being Members of this House.  Many of our well known statesmen began their careers here and, if they had not been elected to this House, they might never have reached the positions they held later, men like Garret FitzGerald, John Kelly, John Boland, Brian Lenihan, Michael O'Kennedy and many others. When statesmen have given service for many years I see nothing wrong with their retirement to this House for a short term before they leave public life.  I have served with men like Dr. Jim Ryan and Gerry Boland and others who had given a lifetime to politics.  It is only fair and reasonable that such people should get one term in this House before they finally retire.</P>
    <P>We have had quite a lot of talk in recent times by one political party &mdash; the new party &mdash; about this House being abolished. One would imagine from all they say about this House that if it was abolished it would pay off the national debt. You would get that impression by what is being said.  One of their members had the cheek &mdash; even though she was entitled to do it &mdash; to ask a question about the expenses of Senators and have them referred to by name.  But she did not ask what were the expenses of Deputies by name.  I wonder was that because it would embarrass some members of her own party who have been here for a while.  I believe the Minister had no option but to give the information but I think that it is the first time a Deputy asked in the Dáil about what was happening here.  Deputies should look after their own House and we can look after ours.</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of ways that moneys could be saved in the Dáil as well as here.  We have 60 Senators &mdash; it has been 60 since the House was established in 1922 or 1923.  The Dáil increased their membership as the population went up and perhaps we could do without some Dáil Deputies.  Certainly we could do without many five-seat constituencies.  I know if that happened &mdash; if we had fewer five-seaters &mdash; we would have fewer PDs in the Dáil.  If you compare a Dún Laoghaire five-seater with constituencies like Mayo, Kerry or Donegal, where <Col N="859" /> there are only three-seaters, I doubt that a Deputy in Dún Laoghaire would have to travel five miles from his or her own house to the farthest end of the constituency whereas Deputies in those other places may have to go 100 miles.  I am merely pointing out that there is no comparison between the amount of work a Dáil Deputy in the city and a Dáil Deputy in the country have to do.</P>
    <P>It is well worth recalling that in 1969 or 1970 the then Minister for Local Government who happened to be Deputy Bobby Molloy, now a member of the Progressive Democrats, attempted to bring in a Bill to abolish all local authorities in areas with a population of less than 12,000.  If he had succeeded at that time every urban council in the country would have been abolished and a number of corporations.  The next thing would be that our county councils would have been abolished.  Is this democracy, starting with the abolition of urban councils, then the county councils, then the Seanad and perhaps the other House?</P>
    <P>There are many countries in Europe and in the world today where they would love to have two Houses, or to have even one proper one.  They have so-called Houses of Parliament behind the Iron Curtain where they have elections but only one candidate is allowed to stand.  Is that democracy?  We should be proud of the way we conduct our business in this House and in the other House, too.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the media.  We got little or no publicity down through the years.  In my time here there was a reporter from the <i>Irish Independent</i> who sat every day in the Press Gallery when we were there, and he was on his own practically all the time.  He has now retired and I do not know whether he has been replaced.  An article appeared in <i>The Irish Press</i> on Monday, 1 June which I consider a scurrilous article about this House written by a man named Jim Hastings. I never heard of this man before. He is probably trying to make a name for himself.  He might be interested in politics and he might be hoping to end up as other press people have in the Oireachtas. <Col N="860" /> There is an old saying: &ldquo;If you cannot beat them, join them&rdquo;.  That is what some of those press people might be doing.</P>
    <P>In that article he reported that two Senators had claimed no expenses and he printed photos of the two Senators who claimed no expenses.  That is not true. One of the Senators mentioned &mdash; I am not blaming the Senator in any way but there was only one, former Senator McGuinness, who did not claim expenses.  That appeared in <i>The Irish Press</i> and I did not see it corrected since then.  That paper had a headline that Senators had a salary of £10,500 a year for 78 days work.  Most people are aware that most Senators work 365 days a year, seven days a week and 18 hours a day. They do exactly the same work as a Deputy; everyone on the panels has to do that type of work.  They have to travel the country to meetings night after night. It is most unfair that <i>The Irish Press</i> should publish a one-sided story especially when they never come into this Chamber.  Last year, on numerous occasions our Leader referred to the poor attendances of the press group in this House.</P>
    <P>Talking about the salaries we get as Members, I am not sure of this but I would say I am not too far wrong &mdash; I reckon that we are probably the worst paid people working in this House and that includes everyone, cleaners, ushers, everyone else.  The salaries of Senators have changed a lot because when the Seanad was first established a Senator had the same pay as a Deputy and that was £1 a day.  People said he had a colossal salary at that time.  When I came in here and when you came in here a Leas-Chathaoirleach, in 1961, our pay was £750 and a TD got £1,000.  Today the gap has widened; we get £10,000 and they get close on £20,000 which I think is wrong for the amount of work we do.  I have often said to people talking about the salaries we get that I was prepared to swop my salary for theirs but nobody has taken me up on that offer yet.</P>
    <P>Again, the method of election was criticised by Senator Ross.  That has been changed.  Different methods have been <Col N="861" /> tried since 1922 and none of them was a success until the present one was established whereby we are elected by councillors and members of corporations.  I have been nine times around the course and I never regretted it; I never saw anything wrong with it.  We enjoyed it; we met councillors; we discussed their problems with them.  After the election they kept in touch with us.  We have to keep in touch with those people from time to time also.  If any of the press think we are doing nothing and they are prepared to come around with us for a week, we will prove how wrong they are. In conclusion, I am sure Senator Lanigan will say at the end of the debate what we propose to do about this motion.  If we had a standing committee to look into the possibilities, apart from changing the system of election, there are many things we could do to make this House more interesting.  Thank you.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar dtús ba mhaith liom a rá gur mór an onóir dom bheith i mo Bhall den Oireachtas.  Pé sórt díospóireachta a bheas againn ar an rún seo, seans thar barr d'aon duine é bheith sa Seanad agus óráid a dhéanamh ar whatever type of legislation is being discussed at a particular time.  I must say that in terms of the debate over the past couple of days I would take issue with many things.  I have found a certain sense of defensiveness about the responses by some Members from the Government side of the House.  I would also say, incidentally, that that does not go for all that came from the other side of the House. Much of it to my mind was very constructive and very progressive.  I certainly feel it is right for Members to defend the House.  There is a clear duty on Members of this House to defend themselves and to defend the institution.  It was very difficult for me to listen to the way in which those of us on the Independent bench were sort of cast aside as elitist, and different, and with nothing to contribute. As an aside I should like to say that my mother was very pleased to hear I was referred to as elitist during the week by the powerful people of Leinster House. <Col N="862" /> She feels I have made it at this point in time.  For the record I should like to say &mdash; it was raised by Senator McGowan and Senator Fennell in their contributions &mdash; that I can make as many connections with one side of the House as the other.  I see Senator FitzGerald from Dingle who can establish for anyone in this House that I was raised in a nest of blue shirts in Dingle, as he will quite clearly tell you. By the same token, people should recognise that I have two very near relatives on that side of the House in Senator Martin O'Toole agus Nioclás O'Concubhair.</P>
      <P>I could extend those connections to many parts of the Fianna Fáil Party.  The party do not in any sense set themselves up to represent the common people of Ireland.  We are no different from the rest of them.  In terms of who I am, what I am, or my right to speak, Joan and I have a mortgage, two ten year old cars, five children and a cat.  We have as clear an indication of what input needs to be made as anybody else around here.  The idea of our removal here from the national school or from the vocational institutions is something I resent very much being a principal of a national school, the product of a national school and a worker in a national school.  Indeed, my children attend a vocational school and I hope they did well in their group certificates today.</P>
      <P>The reason we are on the university panel raises a question of its own.  I am here because of my commitment in many ways to society, to education, to the trade union movement.  I believe that, having worked at all levels of education, I might look to the educational panel to be elcted here.  I have worked in first level, second level and third level.  I have represented and negotiated at all those levels.  There is no way that I could be elected to represent an educational interest because I am not a member of a political party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that but it is not a criticism of political parties.  I recognise that the system and the structure have been built around political parties, but they have done many things which to me have been incorrect.  It is incorrect that there are <Col N="863" /> only six seats in this House that can be filled by people who are not members of political parties.  That is not right.  That cannot be right and that is one of the reasons the system of election should be looked at.  It is not that there needs to be a total and radical change, but there certainly is some indication that the vocational input should be in some sense broadened and that perhaps those people representing vocational interests, whether it be the labour interest or the education interest, might in some sense be elected by people working or occupied in that particular area.  Before somebody stands up and shouts about it that is not a put-down of county concils.</P>
    <P>There is no need for anybody to stand up here and speak about the good work the county councils are doing and have done.  We are all aware of it and aware that they represent people on the ground. For the record let me say I believe they should have an input into the Constitution of this Chamber.  What I do not believe is that they should have almost a 100 per cent decision on how this Chamber is structured.  I think it should be widened.  That is all I am saying.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I differ from the rest of my colleagues here but I do not object to the nominations procedure because I think that, used properly, it can actually broaden the perspective of the Chamber. I do not object to it as an idea.  It is a good idea provided it is not abused.  I object to the cynical abuse of the Chamber merely as a stepping stone down to the Dáil but there is nothing any of us can do about that.  If people set out to do that it is very clearly an abuse of the Chamber.  The whole system of election and selection should be looked at very closely so that it could be, in a sense, broadened.  Everybody's interest can be responded to in different ways.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister, Deputy Flynn, is not here.  That is no reflection on the Minister of State but the Minister, being an old adversary of mine I recall &mdash; as I recalled to him yesterday &mdash; that about seven years ago in the hall downstairs at <Col N="864" /> the end of a dispute over teachers' salaries when part of the settlement was that teachers were to be granted &mdash; as they still have unfortunately &mdash; a 25 year salary scale before they reach the maximum. The Minister, being a Member at the time of the Fianna Fáil Government, indicated to me that the INTO had settled for an agreement which put him nine years away from the maximum of his scale whereas when he came into the Dáil he was at the maximum.  He felt that his union were not representing him.  I recall that because the Minister clearly said that his views also needed to be represented.  I feel I can represent here the views of members of a party in a way that their party might not represent them.</P>
    <P>A party, of course, will always have to base their policy on the lowest common denominator of agreement that can be reached among all members.  Very often that does not cover the needs of all their members.  This is the reason for a vocational input.  It is not to state that, because somebody comes from an agricultural background, or an educational background, or an engineering background, or a management background, he or she is in some sense more important or has something more important to contribute than people who have been elected without any qualifications.  That is not the point.  The point is that they give a different perspective.  The point is that they give a different input.  The point is that they can broaden the ambience of discussion and the parameters under which any Bill or any item has been drafted.  That is the reason for it.  There is need for an extension of it.  There is certainly need for a change and a broadening of the election process.</P>
    <P>Saying these things is not a criticism of the Seanad as an institution.  It is something that I feel would strengthen it.  One message I would stress more than all else in what I have to say is that we should be our own most stringent critics and it is the self-examination and self-exploration of the role of the Seanad that will eventually give us the strength to develop it and to sell it.  In terms of the response of the media it is all very well to say to the <Col N="865" /> media they do not report what goes on here.  I am long enough dealing with the media to know that the media only report news.  If what we are doing here is not news I do not in any sense object to the media not covering it.  It is up to us to present the arguments that will be acceptable.</P>
    <P>The type of facile media comment which I object to very much is the kind of score line that is kept in some papers. I saw it in one of the Sunday papers two weeks ago where there was a headline about the number of Senators in the Seanad Chamber at a particular time.  It is very easy to respond to that by showing the number of members of the press gallery who are working in either House of the Oireachtas at a particular time.  In terms of preparation for speeches, in terms of preparation for an input or a contribution Members here have to work in the library, in their offices and in many other places.  It is absolutely facile and simple reporting to say that because people are not in the Chamber they are not working.  It is not clear and it is not true.</P>
    <P>Every Member of this House should respond to what has been said by the PDs.  I am sorry none of them is here to make the case.  Of course they will not have anybody here.  I suspect one of the reasons they object to the Seanad is that they have no way of getting anybody elected to it.</P>
    <P>It always worries me when people begin costing a principle.  I always feel for my wallet when somebody says: what is the cost of a right?  What is the cost of a principle?  This State and the Supreme Court of the State are in operation for 60 or 70 years and in that time to my knowledge in terms of damges etc. the courts have never attempted to put a price on the loss of a constitutional right. There is no way of doing it.  Neither is there a way of putting a price on democracy. The facile argument of saying: &ldquo;Let us abolish the Seanad&rdquo; is very populist though I am glad to see that the media in their deeper insights over the past week or two are beginning to look slightly differently at it and their attitude to it, I <Col N="866" /> sense, is changing.  You could stand up in any pub in Ireland and say: &ldquo;Let us abolish taxation; let us abolish the Seanad; let us abolish the Presidency; let us abolish the Dáil&rdquo;, and they would all get precisely the same response &mdash;&ldquo;a great idea&rdquo;.  It is just simple feeding the prejudice and the ignorance of people who know no better.</P>
    <P>The idea of cutting down on the democratic institutions of the State is very definitely a most specious argument.  It is anti-democracy and it represents the &ldquo;regressive&rdquo; democrats, as far as I am concerned.  It is the specious argument of regressive democracy and it is the first step down the road to Fascism, a statement I made about it during my campaign and it cost me votes.  I am saying it now for the record.  I defy anybody to stand up and explain to me how it is in the interests of democracy to abolish one of the institutions of the democratic structure of the State.  Beyond that, in terms of the constituencies we are supposed to represent, it bothers me to hear people referring to their constituency in the terms of their &ldquo;narrow constituency&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I want to take issue one more time with Senator McGowan about what he said about his difficulties in going around the Twenty-six Counties and in meeting all the different county councils, and the effort he put into it.  Senator McGowan should consider himself lucky that his party still recognise the Border.  I had meetings in thirty-two counties in order to be elected here.  I had to go outside the State.  We represent thirty-two counties which is, in a sense, part of the width that we can bring to it.</P>
    <P>Speaker after speaker stood up to defend county councils which, in a sense is defending the people who are going to vote them in or out the next time around. That is perfectly understandable from my point of view.  I was elected by the graduates of Ireland.  I was elected by them in the knowledge that I had no intention of representing their interests in here.  I have never set out to do that.  I believe that the interests of those of us who have survived and exploited the third level of <Col N="867" /> education are really concerned with the needs of those who do not have pressure groups, who do not have support, who do not have a voice and who do not have representation.  I am here to represent what the graduates of Ireland consider to be those who are not represented at all. It is important that this be stated and clearly seen.</P>
    <P>In terms of extending the franchise I state for the record &mdash; and I will take on what I represent &mdash; the university and the constituencies are incorrectly set up at present.  I qualified as a national teacher from St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, and also I have a university qualification. For somebody to say to me that because I spent a couple of years at night school at university that gives me a greater right to vote than the years I spent in becoming a national teacher is total and absolute balderdash.  It makes no sense whatsoever to consider that people in certain third level institutions do not have a vote while others do.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell stated that we represent an elitist section of society.  That is quite true, but I wish Senator Farrell had asked why do we do it.  Why is it elitist to get to third level night education?  Why do only one-tenth of the population get it?  That is the question the political parties must ask themselves.  That is anathema to me.  It is unacceptable and it is wrong.  Third level education should not be a privilege.  It should be an investment in the future in a real and certain way.  It is quite in order for 10 per cent. of the population to be elected from the community, not in an elitist sense but in a representative sense.  I am sorry for going over my time.  I have said only half of what I have to say.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying that there should be an extension of Private Members' Time.  There should be discussion in areas which are non-threatening to the executive Government.  The Seanad should not pervert the course of democracy as outlined by the First House, but it should review the position and initiate more legislation.  We should certainly extend the third level franchise. <Col N="868" /> We should have fuller and tighter debates.  The Second Stage debates of Bills go on for too long.  I believe 15 minutes is long enough.  We should also encompass special purpose committees in areas like foreign policy, neutrality and the national question, if we dare to speak about it.  We could do a lot of good work in those areas and sell ourselves to the people in a most persuasive fashion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>In deference to at least one of my colleagues on this side and others who wish to speak, I will not go on at considerable length.  Like other Senators, I welcome the opportunity to discuss the motion before the House.  It is a good thing to take a critical look at ourselves and at the institution of the Seanad.  Let me first focus on the powers of the Seanad.  It is a fact that the role of the Seanad is subordinate to the Dáil.  It is also a fact that the duties of the Seanad are political and the decisions that we are required to take will always be political, irrespective of changes in the format of the Seanad.  This subordinate role is not peculiar to this country.  It is characteristic of indirectly elected Upper Houses in other countries also.</P>
      <P>Despite the subordinate role of the Upper House the Seanad can and does serve as a safeguard against ill-conceived or hasty action on the part of the Dáil. Furthermore, it provides a second scrutiny of legislation by a second group of representatives.  It is fair to say that the Seanad &mdash; and the record will bear this out &mdash; takes a constructive, balanced approach to legislation and other issues that come before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much comment and criticism in relation to the Seanad is focused on its composition and the method of election. In 1937 Éamon de Valera acknowledged this difficulty and recognised how difficult it was in practice to devise a completely satisfactory scheme for the Second House.  The clear intention of the Constitution is that the elected element of the Seanad, at present 43 of the 60 Senators, should be composed on a vocational basis.  The issue of vocationalism &mdash; and Senator Murphy underlined this &mdash; was <Col N="869" /> much in vogue in the thirties at the time the Constitution was enacted.  It is a fact, nonetheless, that the 43 elected Senators in the House now, some 50 years after the enactment of the Constitution, possess certain minimum requirements based on knowledge and practical experience to qualify for the specific vocational panels. The record shows that many of these elected Senators can and do make effective contributions to legislation by drawing on their vocational experience and qualifications.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, the duties of the Seanad are political.  Therefore, overwhelmingly, the Members of the Seanad are politicians rather than delegates of particular interests on nominating bodies.  Unlike Senator Ross, I do not favour direct election by nominating bodies of their own representatives to the Seanad.  Such direct nomination would immediately reduce the democratic element of election which obtains at present, and would introduce unnecessary party political activity in commercial, professional, vocational and cultural bodies.  Political activity of this kind would be rejected by most of the nominating bodies themselves.  Furthermore, it would hinder, if not prevent, the political decisions which the Seanad is obliged to take.  Neither the Government nor the Dáil of the day could tolerate a situation where legislation could be held up by a number of Senators who would, in effect, be merely delegates of particular nominating bodies and interest groups. The very fact that most Senators are now elected by people who themselves have been elected ensures a democratic element in the composition of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross favours direct election by the nominating bodies themselves.  He describes the Seanad campaign as degrading, humilating and absurd.  Like previous speakers, I have been through the course a number of times.  I certainly have not found it matching any of these headings.  It should be pointed out that Senator Ross has never gone through this particular means of election, through the vocational panels, and therefore cannot <Col N="870" /> talk from first hand experience.  I personally find the campaign tiring.  Who would not, as it is so intensive?  However, I find it a highly instructive, informative experience.  I wish to spell out some of the realities about the people who elect the 43 Senators.  For the most part they are county councillors and county borough councillors who put themselves before the people for election.</P>
    <P>They are unpaid, public representatives who are prompted to enter public life by a sense of service to their local communities, councils and cities. They are practical people who are in touch with and understand people's problems on the ground.  They are voluntary representatives who give generously of their time and expertise.  They are experts on local issues and they have a very clear vision of what the Dáil and the Seanad should be doing to solve people's problems. I can say quite objectively that I have learned a lot from Seanad campaigns and from the contacts I have had with councillors throughout the country. This means that I can contribute to the work of the Seanad, a House of the Oireachtas, in a more meaningful and practical way.</P>
    <P>The composition of the Seanad has also been criticised because some of its Members are said to use it as a route to the Dáil, and others are elected having failed to secure Dáil seats.  Does this criticism really hold up in practice?  Many of the people who are elected en route to the Dáil, or on the way back, have proved to be outstanding parliamentarians. Surely we want all the knowledge and expertise in the House that we can get as a contribution to political progress.</P>
    <P>There are others who choose to serve in the Seanad rather than the Dáil and who, for one reason or another, wish to make a career in the Seanad.  The recently retired Senator Eoin Ryan of Fianna Fáil and Senator Jim Dooge of Fine Gael come readily to mind in this respect.  They made outstanding contributions but had no desire to serve in the Dáil.  They were able to make a very substantial contribution through their <Col N="871" /> work on the Seanad.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I think this critical look at the Seanad is worthwhile.  I am glad Senators Ross and Murphy put down the motion.  I would hold that a detailed study of its reform should be in the context of Oireachtas reform, that is, a study of the reform of the Seanad and the Dáil should take place at the same time.  In the absence of such a comprehensive review of the Oireachtas I think there is scope for improving the work of the Seanad. We could do a better job.  The debate on this motion has produced a range of views and ideas from Senators which may form the basis for improvements in how we conduct our business.  I will leave it to Senator Lanigan, when he is replying, to indicate how we might advance this fruitful discussion and provide some mechanism so that we can give effect to some changes without constitutional or Oireachtas reform being undertaken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the debate so far with great interest.  I welcome an opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I also welcome the spirit of the motion put forward by Senators Ross and Murphy, though I regret on another level the sort of &ldquo;us&rdquo; and &ldquo;them&rdquo; element which has crept into it and a certain attitude of superiority on the part of Senator Ross in particular, which I have no doubt he will defend when he replies to the debate.  As I see it, there are many of us who got selected on the panel system of election who could have contested a university seat but who, because of the party political commitment and involvement, have deliberately chosen this route to the Seanad.  It is a far harder and more arduous route.  I do not wish to claim that it is a superior method or that one's involvement because one is elected on the panel system is in any way better than the involvement of anybody else who arrives here by a different route.  Overall, I would say that the debate has shown a very positive commitment to the Upper House and a marked willingness on the part of everybody who has contributed to make this House work effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="872" /> Given such a broad area of agreement and so much goodwill, it should be possible to harness the energy and commitment of Senators to pursue that end. Certainly we in the Fine Gael group of Senators would be very much in favour of supporting the suggestion brought forward in the course of the debate by Senator Robinson, who mooted the idea that a committee of Senators should be established to examine ways in which the Seanad might work to a fuller potential. That is something the Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Chathaoirleach might give consideration to at the conclusion of this debate.</P>
    <P>It saddens me to think that one of the institutions of our relatively young State should be the subject of so much adverse criticism and denigration.  In recent months this attack has been spearheaded by a neophyte party who have jumped on what they perceive to be a populist bandwagon.  Their criticisms are, in the main, ill-informed.  A recent Dáil question which has been alluded to by Senator Willie Ryan, the Dáil question concerning legitimate expenses of Senators, only serves to illustrate this attitude.  It is clearly intended that crude inferences should be drawn from this so-called revelation. By all means seek information about State expenditure, but I contend that the information should equally be sought and given about Members of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I expect that members of the Progressive Democrats claim expenses and that, too, should be a matter of public record, lest anyone should think for a moment that these claims are being waived in the national interest.  It is extremely disappointing that a political party should become infected by the national malaise of denigrating and debunking our own institutions.  We have, sadly, a tendency in this country to undervalue our own institutions and to speak disparagingly of them &mdash; a sort of national begrudgery.  I contend that this attitude is part of a folk memory.  Indeed, it is a relic or a hangover from our colonial past and one that we would be well rid <Col N="873" /> of.  As Senator O'Toole said, it is antidemocratic.</P>
    <P>It occurs to me that it is all the more surprising that a brand new, shiny political party should adopt such a dated and antediluvian attitude.  Why not be proud of our Seanad?  Why not be proud of the distinguished people who gave many years of service to Irish political life and to national thought through membership of this House?  By all means reform, renew and revitalise the workings of the Seanad but it is utterly extreme to promote the abolition of our Upper House of our National Parliament.  As many Senators have said, it is unconstitutional to propose such an abolition.</P>
    <P>The Seanad should not be a sacred cow either.  There is no reason why it should not be a vital and dynamic arm of the Oireachtas.  In my almost six years' membership of this House I have seen it at its best and also I have seen it at a low ebb. The potential of the Seanad is largely untapped because it is constrained by too many outdated rules, conventions and structures.  I have some constructive ideas as to how it could be revitalised and revamped.</P>
    <P>I would like to see our MEPs being invited into this House to report regularly to the Oireachtas and to the Irish people on the major events of the European Parliament.  I am not happy that our MEPs have an adequate method of communication with their electorate and, even more than we as Senators, I feel they are often squeezed out by domestic political happenings.  In particular they, and we too in the Seanad, suffer from a concentration by the media on events in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>I am confident that our MEPs would welcome such an opportunity and that it would add greatly to our sense of being European and having a real voice in Europe.  It must be remembered that when our Seanad was brought into being under the Constitution there were no MEPs and, as such, reform and development have not taken cognisance of the fact that they are now an important part of our political process.</P>
    <P>The initiative to broadcast proceedings <Col N="874" /> of the Oireachtas began in the Seanad. We should be very proud of that fact, because it was initiated in this House.  It is high time that the next logical step forward in media terms was also initiated. Again it should be initiated in this House. I refer to television.  I would welcome such a development with a view to having both Houses televised as speedily as possible. Again, the net effect of this would be to make the proceedings of the democratic Parliament of this State more relevant to the people it represents.</P>
    <P>There is considerable scope for the establishment also of a foreign relations committee of the Seanad.  A number of speakers alluded to the possibility of such an establishment.  Such a committee got under way in this House under a former Senator, Mrs. Gemma Hussey, now a Member of the Dáil.  The then Ambassador of the United States to Ireland, William Shannon, met with an informal committee of the House.  Although I was not a member of it I am glad to understand that there was a useful exchange and that all involved saw considerable value in the exercise and, indeed, spoke for an expansion and development of the idea.</P>
    <P>If the recent campaign on the Single European Act proved anything, it proved the obvious need for that type of parliamentary forum.  The absence of such a forum at present, prior to any review or revamping of the Seanad, need not stifle Senators' initiatives in this area.  Foreign policy resolutions can be raised on the Adjournment or, indeed, brought forward by groupings within the Seanad. In view of the reservations expressed by people opposed to the Single European Act and, indeed, the manifest apathy and ignorance of so many people, regular progress reports on political co-operation with our European partners would be welcomed in this House.  I would hope, of course, that such debate would be constructive and would avoid being polemical or scrappy.  Such a type of unseemly debate is not the normal tenor of this House.  That very fact is one of the strengths of this House and should be recognised.  Most people who know about <Col N="875" /> the level of debate in this House praise it for the fact that in the main it is free of party political rancour and is well thought out, constructive and deliberative.</P>
    <P>I would like to make reference to the methods of election which form part of the motion put forward by Senators Ross and Murphy.  I see a need for reform in this area.  I would like to make reference to the nominating bodies.  The obtaining of a nomination either by a nominating body or by an Oireachtas party, is an art in itself and one which the university Senators know nothing about because they have not had to experience that particularly rigorous test.  I would agree with Senator Hillery in that I would not wish to see nominating bodies having a direct right of election to the Seanad themselves.  It would, as Senator Hillery so rightly said, have the effect of politicising voluntary bodies.  That would have a very negative effect on these bodies and would really drag them in the direction which would not enhance their whole <i>raison d'être.</i></P>
    <P>There is room for reform in the actual method of election.  I can claim to be a veteran of four successful campaigns and so I can speak with a certain degree of feeling in this area.  I remember once having a discussion with a former Deputy, Gerry L'Estrange, who in a conspiratorial fashion indicated to me that it was he who had initiated the whole business of taking the campaign on the road.  Prior to that, he told me, intending Senators wrote to their electorate in much the same way as the university Senators conduct their campaign.  Gerry L'Estrange had the idea that it would be so much nicer to personalise the campaign and to go visiting the members of the electorate.  He got into his car and proceeded on the odyssey.  Of course, once one person did it, all did it.  It has become a feature of Seanad campaigns now.</P>
    <P>In find it an interesting exercise and Senators who have spoken called it instructive.  It is all that.  Indeed, I would invite Senator Ross on a future occasion to consider accompanying me on the <Col N="876" /> odyssey.  I feel that there are still certain gaps in his knowledge.  He could very clearly benefit from such an outing.  It would be to his benefit and to the benefit of the county councillors.  They would really like to see Senator Ross, who has such an interest in and concern for the fact that they have right of direct election to the Seanad.  Senator Ross has a limited view of this campaign.  He spoke about candidates from the same party conducting their campaigns on the basis of back-stabbing and deals.  I quote from the record of the House of 3 June.  I would ask him to verify this statement when he replies to the debate and to give concrete examples of exactly what he is talking about.  Personally, I did not engage in back-stabbing nor did I engage in deals in the course of my four times successful election to this House.  That kind of &ldquo;off-the-wall&rdquo; comment brings this House into disrepute.</P>

      <P>I categorically reject such arrant nonsense.  The Seanad campaign, unfortunately, as it is currently conducted, is about stamina.  It is about orienteering skills.  It is about the ability either to drive a car or be driven.  It is also about having the necessary funds to take part in such an exercise.  That type of approach to any democratic election excludes certain categories of people who should have the opportunity of contesting Seanad elections and who should have the right to consider being represented in this House.  I refer to the disabled and marginalised people.  I refer also to many women of ability who, because of a lack of funding or a lack of the specifics required by the campaign as I have outlined them, are precluded from taking part in this particularly arduous and difficult campaign.  For that reason I would like to see the method of election on the panel system looked at again to see if it could be regionalised or in some way rationalised in order to allow more people who are interested and more people of ability to take part in the campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I conclude by saying that Fine Gael <Col N="877" /> have a concern that there should be meaningful reform of our parliamentary systems in order to up-date, streamline and fine tune these Houses so that they will be of immediate relevance to the electorate.  We in Fine Gael intend to bring forward a series of proposals for strengthening the Seanad.  These recommendations will be made public within the next two weeks.  On one level it could be said that by debating this subject in the House at the moment when there are so many severe recessionary problems and so much that is bothering the electorate, we are indulging in navel-gazing and could of course, be accused of fiddling like Nero while Rome burned. Those who moved the motion perhaps thought about that before they put it on the Order Paper.</P>
    <P>At the start of a new Seanad it is a good idea to take a harsh look at ourselves, to shine the bright light of scrutiny on this House and on the method of election and how it works.  It is a good idea to bring forward constructive, meaningful proposals which would allow us to be more relevant and more accurately to reflect those whom we represent.</P>

I know that there are certain Senators who have not yet spoken.  I am not suggesting that we finish this motion this evening.  At the end of my contribution I will be suggesting a continuance, after consultation with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, and the possible setting up of other committees. Having heard committee reports we might come back again to continue the debate.  I do not want this to be an open-ended discussion.  I do not want any <Col N="878" /> open-ended discussions in the Seanad, but this is an important discussion.  I would like Senators who want to speak and who have not had the opportunity to do so, to bear with me.  We do not have time.  The Minister is entitled to speak and it is right that Senator Ross should speak.  It is suggested that Senator Ryan wants to get in.</P>

It is essential that Senator Ferris should speak as there has not been a Labour Party contribution to the debate.

      <P>When this debate started it was my intention that anybody who wanted to speak should not be deprived of the opportunity.  We decided to extend the time limit but that did not mean that everybody had to take up the time that was allotted to them.  If the Senator on the Fine Gael side who did not get in is feeling a little bit peeved I suggest that he goes to his own party and asks that in future a proper allocation of time be given as between the Members of the party.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to take part in this important debate initiated by Senators Ross and Murphy.  It is appropriate for all institutions, whether they be elected or selected, to consider from time to time the direction in which to proceed.  There are those who question the motives of the proposing Senators in having this motion brought before the House, at a time when a new political party have, as one of their main aims, the total abolition of the Seanad.  I do not subscribe to this viewpoint.  I do not subscribe to the view expressed by the Progressive Democrats that the Seanad is an irrelevant and expensive debating society and a haven for failed politicians.  There are as many failed aspirant Senators in the Dáil as there are failed aspirant TDs in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I do not consider that failure to get elected to the Dáil means that one has failed politically and I reject the disparaging remarks of certain members of the PD Party about Senators who ran for the Dáil and failed to get elected.  Indeed, in Dáil elections the majority of people now Members of the Seanad gained a far higher number of first preference votes than the majority of PD TDs.  We are not here to consider the abolition of the Seanad but rather to discuss how the role of the Seanad can be made more relevant to current political and social needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I address this problem it should be pointed out that there is a greater real public concern about the role and conduct of the Dáil than there is about the role and conduct of the Seanad.  I would not like to have the Seanad operating on a &ldquo;them&rdquo; and &ldquo;us&rdquo; basis.  This <Col N="881" /> theme has gone through many of the speeches that have been made.  There is a role within the Seanad for Senators who have been elected through the panel system or, as the university Senators would say, the political system, as there is a role for those selected by the Taoiseach of the day.  Equally, there is a role for university Senators, even though in 1967 the report of the committee on the Constitution suggested that in arguments adduced against university representation, item 84, that whatever historical reasons there may have been for special representation for universities in the Dáil or Seanad in the past this could no longer be justified today and the Constitution should be amended to abolish it.  This recommendation did not mean abolishing the Seanad, but abolishing university representation.</P>
    <P>I do not subscribe to the suggestion that those of us who are elected under the political panel system are any better or worse in our political judgment than those who come in through the so-called academic road.  People who live their lives in academia are often removed from the hurly-burly of political needs &mdash; I must say here, that my typist must come from a hurling county because she put down &ldquo;hurley&rdquo; and &ldquo;burley&rdquo; for hurly-burly, and for that I thank her &mdash; and this makes them no better or worse than those of us who live our lives very nearly totally immersed in politics.  There is a need for having a balanced Seanad where the viewpoints of everybody in society are taken into account and where there can be a divergence of opinion as to how best solutions to our, economic, social and cultural problems can be addressed and, hopefully, found.</P>
    <P>It was suggested by some speakers from the proposing side that it would be better to have the Seanad election totally changed.  The major changes proposed refer to the direct elections of Senators by Seanad nominating bodies.  I cannot for the life of me see how this method of election would produce a Seanad with as broad a spectrum of society represented as we have not alone in this Seanad but <Col N="882" /> indeed in previous Seanads.</P>
    <P>The election process to the Seanad is a brutal, punishing exercise in terms of physical and financial discomfort.  Anybody who has travelled the roads and the by-ways of Ireland would know that, and our bank managers unfortunately know it too well.  The electors are representative of every section of society &mdash; we have millionaire councillors, we have employed county councillors, we have academic councillors, we have unemployed councillors and we have rural and urban councillors.  I believe you will not find a more representative electoral college in any other limited franchise election and, without labouring the point, an electoral college which takes its elections very seriously and vote responsibly so as to have pride in the people they elect and respect for the institution of the Seanad as a result.</P>
    <P>Even though I do not consider that any system of election is sacrosanct and cannot be changed, the present system has been successful in producing a balance of opinion, education, age and ability within the Seanad and because of this we should not change for the sake of change.  This point was addressed by An tUasal Seanadóir Mícheál Ó hAodha on the first sitting day of the new Seanad on 27 April 1938 when he said, &ldquo;The more it changes, the more it is the same thing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The arguments put forward by Senators Ross and Murphy and, indeed, some other Senators, about the composition of the House are not new ones and indeed we read that on the first session of that 27 April 1938 debate Senator Tierney had the following to say:</P>
    <P>The position that arises now is that the real character and composition of the Seanad have been rudely and thoroughly emphasised right at the start of its proceedings.  We were supposed to have a Seanad in which Vocational considerations were to prevail over all other considerations.  We were assured very virtuously by members of the Government Party that they objected even to sitting together as a Party.  The unfortunate <Col N="883" /> thing is that, once you get a Party complexion introduced into the House, that Party complexion, from whatever side of the House it comes, is altogether incompatible with any real or honest vocational character in the House.  Whenever there is anything like an election, and particularly when the election is bound up with any kind of job, you might as well try to keep a cat from cream or a duck from a puddle as to keep political parties from getting in.</P>
    <P>He also said that &ldquo;we still suffer in this country from weaknesses and that Parliamentary Government is still threatened&rdquo; and so the argument goes on.  The attitude of many of us in this House does not digress too far from the comment of Senator Condon in the same debate when he said:</P>
    <P>I cannot see for the life of me see why because a man is a politician that he must be ruled out as a vocational representative. Every one of us has been elected on a Vocational Panel and most of us are politicians but politicians are not such terribly vile beings as some people seem to imagine.</P>
    <P>The comments made in 1923 are the comments being made now.  The comments of Senator Condon and Professor Tierney of the day mirror what is going on in this House today.  As has been said, things do not change.</P>
    <P>It would appear that the argument as to the best method of election to the Seanad will continue and I am quite certain that an ideal solution will never be found.  The argument as to whether you will get better Senators or a more meaningful Seanad by changing the method of election is one which has no real impact on the motion before us.</P>

      <P>It can truthfully be said that there have been very eminent Senators on all sides of the House, and long may it continue to be so.</P>
      <P>Like many of the preceding speakers, I have often felt frustrated by the operation of the Seanad.  I have often felt that we find ourselves in a type of political straitjacket from which there is very little chance of extricating ourselves.  I have taken part in debates in this House on matters of grave public importance in which extremely valuable contributions have been made by Senators from all sides.  I have truly felt that these contributions have been of major value and that they contributed, in no small way, to the betterment of legislation.  But I have found myself totally frustrated by the almost total lack of interest by the media in these deliberations.  There are some elements of the media who attempt to report the proceedings of the Seanad and we appreciate the work of those journalists who sit here day after day, taking note of our proceedings.  I cannot, however, let the occasion pass without commenting on the almost total lack of coverage given to this House by the Irish Press Group of newspapers.  I seem to be harping on that group each time I get up to speak here, but they feel they can comment on the operation of the Seanad and can publish critical articles about the operation of the Seanad.  Apart from their critical attitude they have carried only one non-attributed report on the operation of the Seanad in the past number of months.  At least the other newspapers who cover this House allow the reporters to have their names over the articles printed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in this House do not look for coverage of our proceedings for the sake of self aggrandisement but, rather, so that the public should be informed of the activities of a House of the Oireachtas &mdash; a House without which, constitutionally, the Oireachtas would be invalid.  One should look at the validity of the Seanad in terms of the Oireachtas.  The totality of the Constitution would have to be changed if the Seanad were abolished. We must realise when we are debating in <Col N="885" /> the Seanad that we are not speaking in, as some people would have it, a debating society.  We are speaking in a House of the Oireachtas, without which this country could not be governed unless there was a complete change in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I suppose that the reporting of Oireachtas Bills is not the stuff from which headlines are made and I suppose that because we do not have a Question Time the journalist who thrives on crossfire and gossip &mdash; which Question Time can generate &mdash; feels out of place in an atmosphere which is not seemingly charged with that fire.  The problem with the Seanad is not so much a problem of what is not being done by us here, but rather the problem of seeing that there is a fair media presentation of our work.  It has to be acknowledged by any student of political systems that the role of the Seanad has changed over the past number of years.</P>
    <P>In the areas where Senators live the public do not differentiate between the roles they expect of a Dáil Deputy and that of a Senator.  While the intention in establishing the Seanad may not have included a role for Senators carrying out local constituency work in the manner of TDs and councillors, this is the way the job has evolved for many Senators. Despite the expectation that Senators should carry out similar work to TDs, the salary of Senators has declined relative to the TDs.  Between 1938 and 1960 a Senator's salary was 75 per cent of that of a TD.  It has declined as a proportion of a TD's salary throughout the sixties and seventies and this trend has continued in the eighties.  Today, a Senator's salary is only 56 per cent of that of a TD.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to quantify the quality of work in the Seanad and the contributions which it makes.  On a quantity basis, from 1965 to 1971 the Seanad met on average 33 times per year for 224 hours per year; from 1972 to 1978 it met on average 37 times a year for 232 hours per year; from 1979 to 1986 the Seanad met on average 42 times per year and for 270 hours per year.  At sittings of the Seanad Senators carry out more detailed work on Bills, <Col N="886" /> especially on Committee Stage where there is more scope for amendments to be made.  The Seanad serves to provide a second scrutiny of Bills in a less politically motivated atmosphere than the Dáil where the opportunity for such changes arises.  There is less public and media attention focused on the workings of the Seanad.  This is a double edged sword as it also acts to diminish the public image of the workings and contributions of the Seanad and serves to downplay the work of Senators.</P>
    <P>Apart from increased sittings and longer hours of sittings, there has been a major increase in the level of committee work in which Senators are involved.  In the period from 1965 to 1971 there were 160 committee meetings which lasted for 179 hours.  By 1972 to 1978 the number of committee meetings had increased to 289 and the hours of meetings had gone up to 353 hours.  In the period between 1979 and 1986 the number of committee meetings increased to 802 and involved 1,359 hours of work.  The amount of time involved in preparing for these committee meetings must also be taken into account and the level of detail and complexity of the issues raised at these committee meetings.  Senators were also involved in the work of the New Ireland Forum in 1983 and 1984.  There was a total of 28 private sessions and 13 public sessions of the Forum and submissions were received from 317 different sources.</P>
    <P>When people talk about the Seanad some people also talk about the cost.  The salary of a Senator in 1986 was £10,298. Since 1980 the Seanad salary increased by 57.3 per cent up to May 1986.  During this period the consumer price index rose by 76.4 per cent and the increase in average manufacturing wages was 93.2 per cent.  The ratio of a Senator's salary to gross domestic product per person employed was .72 per cent in 1982 and this had fallen to .60 in 1986.</P>
    <P>These comparisons do not take into account changes in the nature of the job of Senators.  It is quite obvious that the role of the Senator has been changing and that individual Senators have to devote more and more of their time to Seanad <Col N="887" /> work.  Within this atmosphere of change, we must ensure that the relevance of the Seanad comes more and more to the front and we must look at our procedures and amend or change them where necessary. Our best instrument for initiating change is the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. Not enough use is made of Standing Order 29 under which matters of urgent public concern can be brought before the Seanad by suspending business for the discussion of urgent matters whether they be of a national or international nature.  Adjournment debates should be addressed more to matters of national concern rather than as at present when the time is used for purely local issues of very little political or national relevance.  I am delighted to see today that Senator Brendan Ryan, without any hinting from me, used Standing Order 29 to initiate a debate.</P>

      <P>Not for the first time, but the Senator uses it and I use it myself. It just shows the possibilities.  The committee should address the possibility of having a Question Time type of confrontation with Ministers.  This format should be examined with a view to having a question and answer session which would not be based on seeking information on social welfare or associated issues but where policy matters could be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Seanad Members in the past have been very active on committee work, particularly on committees which have had a very heavy workload.  This should be acknowledged when the new Oireachtas joint committees are formed.  Consideration should also be given to the formation of an <i>ad hoc</i> house committee of the Seanad which might be useful to investigate issues which concern the public.  Many Bills, in recent years, have been introduced in the Seanad and I am delighted that the present Government have continued this practice and that the first Bill introduced in this Seanad is major legislation.  The introduction of <Col N="888" /> Bills in this House tends to place the spotlight on Seanad business and I see this as a major way of making the Seanad more meaningful.  I assure the House of my concern for the future and stature of this House of the Oireachtas and I will do my utmost to preserve it from the onslaught of those ill-advised and badly informed people who would diminish this very important element of democracy.</P>
    <P>I welcome the discussion that has taken place and thank the proposing Senators. However, before we have an urgent review of the activities of the Seanad by the Government there is a great deal of work which we can undertake ourselves before placing our review findings in the hands of the Government who have many other priorities at present.  I suggest that, at the end of the discussion this evening, we go back with the total report of the debate that has taken place here to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges should set up a committee to analyse what has been said, analyse what the public are supposed to be feeling, and analyse the work being done here and the potential of this House for good within Irish society.</P>
    <P>I ask the proposer and seconder of the motion to accept what I am saying in the light of what has gone on.  I suggest that we adopt that kind of procedure and if they are not satisfied that we can do our own work ourselves, we can come back again and ask the Government to have an urgent review of the working of this House.  Again, I thank the proposer and seconder for bringing the motion before the House.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on it and I sincerely hope that as a result of this motion we will have a Seanad which will be more relevant and which will have a major part to play on the Irish political scene.</P>

      <P>A Cathaoirligh, I wish to thank you and Members of the House for giving me an opportunity to speak briefly on this very important matter.  I want to make it very clear I have great respect for the men and women who have represented us over many years here in this House and given very loyal and faithful service to our people.  I want to put it on record that many of them were elected by local authorities, Members who have given service to the people.  I thank them for that.</P>
      <P>I would prefer to contest 20 General Elections in a row than one Seanad election. It is a very major and costly campaign as you travel throughout the country.  There is no doubt about that. The people who put themselves forward are very much respected by all members of the local authorities and they look forward to see them putting forward their views on many matters affecting our country.  I have been a member of Dáil Éireann for 18 years this month.  I have heard excellent contributions from Members of this House over the years.  I want to thank the newly elected Members who made their maiden speeches here and performed in an excellent way.  The Taoiseach said if there was agreement among all the parties that there should be a look at this House in regard to constitutional change that could be done. There is no organisation that cannot be improved.  We must look at it in an objective way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Members of this House who were Members of Dáil Éireann have made a wonderful contribution here.  Many who are here today were formerly Members of the Dáil.  They are here to continue to give a loyal service to our people.  I would not like anyone to think this House does not give a service to our people.  Legislation going through this House has been debated in great detail over the years.  Some very good <Col N="891" /> proposals have come from this House and returned to the Dáil.  I thank Senators for that also.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the proposers of this motion put it down in good faith.  It is a very worthwhile motion.  It has been debated in detail.  It has been a good debate but to come up with all the answers is another day's work.  It will be difficult to get a consensus of opinion to suit everybody.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept the motion.  I believe that this House of Parliament here serves us and has served us well.  The Progressive Democrats have decided in their policy document that it should no longer be here.  I cannot agree with that.  It is a cheap form of publicity and a case of sour grapes since they could not elect anybody to this institution.  I could not let the occasion pass without saying very clearly what I think of this Chamber.  It has been a good Chamber down through the years. This is my third time to hold Government office and I have seen the Seanad operating very well.  This House is very good at debating issues without any rancour. The debates here have been of a very high standard.</P>
    <P>Regarding the subsistence allowance to Members of this House, they received nothing but what they were entitled to under the Act, no more and no less.  It is only right that I should say what the position is.  The media and others would create big headlines if anybody here got a penny more than they were entitled to. They get only what they are statutorily entitled to under the Act.  I want to make that clear.  That is their right.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I am very glad to have had an opportunity to speak on this matter and I have no doubt there will be further debate on it in the future.  If we can bring about improvements they will be welcome and we will see a wider scope of debate.  If that could be agreed on, it would be very good for parliament.  In no circumstances do I see a role for abandoning the Seanad.  It is cheap publicity on the part of the Progressive Democrats to try to suggest that.  In my opinion that <Col N="892" /> is not on because past and present Members of this House have given excellent service over the years.  I respect that.</P>
    <P>The Seanad is representative of all shades of opinion, culture, ideas and views.  I do not wish to refer to who is here and who is not here but the panels speak for themselves.  Many Senators are doing constituency work also, and more perhaps than Dáil Members do.  I say that with due respect.  They also have to keep in contact with their local authority members who keep them informed of what is going on, and who are very quick to explain the position.  I respect those people who represent universities.  They play a very important role here.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I could not agree to the motion but if a proposal comes forward to streamline the Seanad we will look on it very favourably.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <P>It has been decided by the Whips that those who have offered to speak should be allowed a limited time to speak tomorrow.  Tomorrow we will discuss the ACOT Bill until 12.30 p.m. From 12.30 p.m. until 2 p.m. we will take a motion which, in my opinion, is non controversial on the closure of the Hyster plant.  It is controversial in one sense but it is not politically controversial.  I suggest that we break from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. and the debate will continue at 3 p.m. giving everybody an opportunity to speak for a maximum of 15 minutes each and that the proposers of the motion will conclude at the end of the debate tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a matter of principle in future if we have a three hour motion I will insist that it be limited to three hours because I think I have given this House &mdash; purely because of the importance of the matter &mdash; an amount of latitude which I do not think we should have allowed.  I gave an extra hour and a half to this motion and certain people who did not go to their Whips and get in early are now cribbing about the fact that they are not getting in.  Senators should not expect in the <Col N="893" /> future that I will allow Independent Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael motions to drift on as this motion has drifted.  There are other ways in which we can address the business of the House.  Again, I thank the proposers for moving the motion and I sincerely hope we can get away from the contention which arose at the end of the debate, a debate which was extended far beyond what was intended.</P>

      <P>I could not agree to the arrangement for tomorrow afternoon simply because at the time the debate will be taking place &mdash; and I wanted to speak on the motion &mdash; I will be in another part of this House with a deputation to a Minister.  This is another part of the role of a Senator.  I will be doing my public duty.  In the spirit of what the Leader of the House said, I was prepared to confine myself to five minutes to allow the debate to conclude in time.  That agreement was reached with Senator Ryan and myself. We have not tried to extend beyond the period agreed.  The time chosen and agreed by a majority does not suit me but I have to accept a majority decision.  We are a lesser group in the House now and I have to accept majority decisions. Agreement was reached but not with my consent.  I mentioned to the other people that the time chosen to conclude the motion did not suit me.  I am on the record as saying I wanted to speak and was prepared to limit myself to five minutes but was not allowed to do so.</P>

I am glad somebody agreed to extend the debate.  I actually agree with the Leader of the House that extending the time of a debate by 50 per cent and then extending everybody's time to speak by 50 per cent means no extra speakers are allowed to speak.  Let us go ahead <Col N="894" /> and finish the business.  I have a view about this House which is quite different from many people.  I think it can be quite useful if people only make use of it.</P>

It happened on another item within the past fortnight.  This cannot be allowed to continue if we are to run the business of the House properly.  As a Senator of ten years standing I say with the greatest respect to everybody, new and old Senators, that about half way through a debate somebody gets a fresh wind and decides he wants to contribute.  At an earlier stage we are asking Senators to contribute.  We must get back to the hours.  If we have a three hour debate that is what it should be.  I am genuinely sorry that Senator Ferris did not get his five minutes.  By agreement the debate is adjourned until 3 o'clock tomorrow afternoon.  We move now to the Adjournment Matter.

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Seanad do now adjourn.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I may be wrong, but to be on the proper side I would like to welcome the Minister. I am not sure if he has been here before in his present term of office.  If he has, I do not think I met him.  I met him in another forum in Cork a long way from Roscommon in which he has some very interesting things to say.  I hope, in passing, that the things he had to say then have not got lost in the welter of chaos and confusion and upset that has descended on us, particularly in the area of children's legislation.</P>
      <P>I do not think, a Cathaoirligh, that the words I used in seeking to have this matter discussed were an over statement in any way.  It seems from week to week, and indeed from day to day, that crisis piles upon crisis in the health services.  It is getting to the stage where I, or any Member of this House, could almost every week propose a motion under Standing Order 29 to adjourn the House to discuss a matter of urgent public importance.  One week it is the closure of hospitals; another week it is the reduction in the number of beds; another week it is the appalling situation in my own home city where the victims of miscarriages are now consigned to the same ward as the women who are celebrating the births of their children; another week it is the return almost to 19th century custodial conditions in psychiatric hospitals; this week it happens to be the industrial action taken by junior hospital doctors or by non-consultant hospital doctors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The term &ldquo;junior&rdquo; is a particularly unhappy and offensive phrase to people many of whom are senior to me.  Whatever claims I make, and all politicians <Col N="896" /> make extraordinary claims, I no longer qualify for either the minor or the junior team.  In fact, I am probably too old for the senior team at this stage.  They are not junior doctors by any means.  Many of them are extremely well qualified. Many of them are at an advanced level of training and experience.</P>
    <P>The best way to avoid accusations of special interests is to reveal them yourself. I am married to a member of the medical profession who was, until recently, a non-consultant hospital doctor and is now even more vulnerable because she is a temporary consultant and, therefore, comes under the gimlet eye of those who want to reduce the numbers in employment.  She is not on strike.  Therefore, I am not directly affected by this issue and that is why I felt happy to raise it.</P>
    <P>Non-consultant hospital doctors are a particular breed within the medical profession. I have had many harsh things to say here about the medical profession even though, as I have said frequently, they are in large part constituents of mine and, therefore, I am not doing myself any great favour by some of the things I say about them.  Within that category the conditions of work and the salaries paid to non-consultant hospital doctors are nothing that any respectable trade unionist would make a huge song and dance about.  It is very easy for people to produce scales of salary for juvenile consultant hospital doctors, but the salary scales presuppose a number of years working at the job.</P>
    <P>The actual minimum levels of payment for non-consultant hospital doctors are quite low and are not different from, and in some cases are less than, the salaries paid to people of comparable levels of qualification and education.  I accept, of course, that there is a section among the consultants who are both ripping off the hospital service, ripping off the State and, indeed, ripping off patients.  Very often patients are charged for the services of people who are called junior housemen who never see any of the fees paid to those junior non-consultant hospital doctors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="897" /> It is one of the peculiar ironies of the philosophy of the medical profession that intolerably long hours are apparently acceptable when they are being worked by the most junior, those who are least competent, least trained and least experienced. They are the ones who are expected to work extraordinarily long hours in extraordinary circumstances.  I refer in particular to the interns, followed in their turn by the house officers, by the registrars, and by that rare specimen in Irish medical circles, the senior registrar, and then by the only permanent medical positions in the hospital services, the consultants. It is important that the public at large understand that there is only one grade of permanent employment within the hospital services on the medical side and that is of consultant.  Every other grade is a temporary appointment for six months or a year, open to reappointment, renegotiation or dismissal and in many cases people are dismissed.  That is why this industrial action took place so quickly because at the end of June all, or virtually all, of those on strike at present will be up for reappointment and they know, given the draconian measures that have been taken and are currently being taken, they are well and clearly targeted as being in a major area for cutbacks.  That is not the only area for cutbacks.</P>
    <P>If I have any criticisms of the doctors &mdash; and I have a number &mdash; one is the unfortunate refusal of the Irish Medical Association, which claims to be a trade union, to identify and affiliate with the campaign of the other health service trade unions to protect the health services. I am somewhat astonished that the journals which circulate amongst the medical profession.  The <i>Irish Medical Times</i> and the <i>Irish Medical News</i> seem to have taken the most astonishing crisis in the health service totally in their stride and by and large confined it to the inner pages as if it were a minor hiccup in the continuing development of the services.</P>
    <P>I have a distinct feeling that the action of the non-consultant hospital doctors and their hopes and intentions to extend their actions is not viewed with much enthusiasm by many of their senior colleagues <Col N="898" /> in the medical profession, the consultants, or, indeed, by their own organisation.  I await proof to the contrary. It appears that in many health boards the consultants, who are members of the health boards, voted for these cutbacks. The fact that their own organisation has kept its distance from the remaining groups campaigning to protect and vindicate the health services suggests that these non-consultant hospital doctors are the expendable commodity in the medical establishments' fight to defend not the health services but their own interests in the health services.  It is true that those who are established as consultants in the health services will not lose as a result of these cutbacks.  In fact, they are likely to get rich following these cutbacks because those who cannot get access to a reduced, if not entirely castrated, State health service will pay through insurance for what was up to then their entitlement.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that astonishing things are expected from non-consultant hospital doctors: hours of work, hours on call that defy description. People are on call for periods of 80, 90 and 100 hours a week.  Many of them work a large part of that time and many work 24 hour days without sleep.  I have never been able to understand how it was acceptable in a profession where judgment, understanding and proper rational analysis was so important that these sort of primeval conditions could be tolerated.  I cannot, therefore, accept any suggestion of further cutbacks in this area, any more than I can accept cutbacks in any other area of frontline medical care in this country.</P>
    <P>I was quite astonished to hear the Minister for Health referring to the number of acute case beds per head of population and comparing us with a number of other countries.  One of the countries be compared us with was our nearest neighbour. What has emerged over the last three or four weeks in Britain is that the state of their health service is no model for anybody's health service.  The idea that Thatcherite versions of the national health service would become acceptable <Col N="899" /> models for our own seems to be reprehensible in principle and also reprehensible in terms of the philosophy that underlies it.</P>
    <P>Some of the figures quoted about either the number of acute case beds we have, or the expenditure on our health services, are the sort of cosy figures that right wing economists, with their allies in the media, have foisted upon us for the past three or four years.  One problem within the media is that the numbers of people who are actually constantly numerate are few and far between.  Consequently, when an authority figure, masquerading as an independent economist, says, this figure is awful, this figure is unrepresentative or this figure shows poor levels of performance then of course newspapers accept this.</P>
    <P>It would be invidious of me to name names, within the privilege of this House, but there is no doubt that a number of economists have contributed to a level of public acceptability in the area of cutbacks in the health services that is based as much on their politics as it is on their economics.  For example, the alleged large proportion of our gross national product that we spend in the health services is in the region of 6.9 per cent to 7 per cent, which is as high as many countries with comprehensive health services. The truth is, as has been pointed out frequently, that if we were to run a comprehensive national health service the actual proportion of increase on what we currently expend would not be very large, because up until now a large proportion of the population had access to free hospital care, to both accommodation and to the hospital services, and 40 per cent of the population have medical cards and have access to full general practitioner service as well.  The actual extra cost would not be very large.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the figure of 7 per cent. We have talked about acute case hospital beds, for instance, and the alleged large numbers of them.  This country has a birth rate which is virtually twice that of any other country in Europe.  We also have one of the best standards of maternity <Col N="900" /> care, or we used to have until recently, in the world.  We have an infant mortality rate which is lower than that in the United States, which is four times as rich as we are.  We have an infant mortality rate which rates with the most developed countries of Europe and of North America and we are not nearly as wealthy or not nearly as rich as any of those countries.  We did it because we chose to do it and because we believed that it was a good thing.  One cannot have the levels of maternity care of the wealthiest countries in the world proven and demonstrated by our impressively low infant mortality rate without putting the resources into it.</P>
    <P>The idea of many of these economists which, unfortunately, both the alternative Government and the present Government have swallowed, that we are spending too much and therefore spending inefficiently on a large scale on our health services is palpable nonsense.  The cost of health care will not vary between Ireland, Britain, the United States and Germany.  You will have to pay for the equipment, for the buildings, for the medicines, for the technology and, in a free labour market, you will have to pay for the labour.  Therefore, you cannot provide west European standards of health care on the cheap just because you happen to be a poorer country.</P>
    <P>About 25 years ago we made a choice that in the area of maternity care we would provide a maternity service as good as any available anywhere else in Europe.</P>
    <P>A great man, a man who was pilloried at the time, Noel Browne, was the initiator of much of that.  Noel Browne did no more than work from the legislation that a Fianna Fáil Government had introduced in 1947, legislation which was described by one member of the hierarchy as reminding him of the worst excesses of Stalin and Hitler because it actually dreamed to suggest socialised medicine.</P>
    <P>That was the history of this country and that is why we, a poor country in terms of the developed world, the 26th richest country in the world, have an <Col N="901" /> infant mortality rate lower than that of the richest country in the world.  When you bear in mind that we do not, and quite rightly so, allow abortion in this country and therefore high risk pregnancies and handicapped pregnancies cannot be terminated and that therefore the large number of pregnancies in this country which would be terminated in other countries go their full term, the achievement of such an astonishingly low level of infant mortality is a proud boast. You will not find any of our right wing economists referring to this when they write their detached, academic essays on the state of our health service.</P>
    <P>If you are going to accept the ideology which stands behind the scale of cutbacks now being imposed upon us then you are effectively saying to mothers and children, &ldquo;We can no longer afford that level of maternity care&rdquo;.  We have already seen in the Erinville hospital in Cork that women who have had miscarriages and who need bereavement counselling and support have no longer got separate accommodation and now have to share accommodation with women who have just had babies.  That is the direct antithesis of a caring service and that is what is being done in one hospital in Cork.</P>
    <P>That is part of what we are doing.  If you add on the fact that we have a huge young population and that children up to the age of five tend to need more medical care, the disproportionately large number of old people that we have, and that for reasons to do with history, isolation etc., we have significantly higher incidence of mental illness, then it is understandable that we have a large number of acute and long term hospital beds.  When you understand as well that we actually believe in looking after our old people and that we cannot just abandon them because they have not made provisions for themselves, this allegedly excessive level of expenditure in the health services is put in perspective.  It is in that context that this industrial dispute should be judged and deserves to be judged.</P>
    <P>This industrial dispute is about the front line quality of care in our hospitals. <Col N="902" /> We have had nurses dismissed, we have had other people dismissed and we will now have a large number of doctors dismissed. It is not my intention in any way to suggest that the doctors are more important than anybody else, it just happens to be this week's part of the savaging of the health services and this week's part is just one part of the continuing process. Because of that, it was most regrettable that the offers by these doctors to negotiate a different way of achieving the same savings which would not involve the same level of redundancies, to involve themselves in cost-cutting negotiations, in cost-cutting procedures, to accept some redundancies, were not accepted. The diktats of the gurus of the Stock Exchange have insisted that the Government must show no flexibility in the area of health care, no flexibility in the area of welfare, no flexibility in the area of education, not because the Government do not wish to and not because, unlike our friend in Britain, the Government actually do not believe in a health service.</P>
    <P>This Government do.  I know the history of Fianna Fáil.  It is because economic absolutism of a particularly repulsive kind has dictated to the Government that they must be seen to be hard on the health services, they must be seen to be hard on social welfare, they must be seen to be hard on education or else the Stock Exchange will not wear it, interest rates will rise and the financial markets will turn downwards.</P>
    <P>That is the motivating force behind these cuts.  There are plenty of other areas in which expenditure could be reduced.  It is astonishing, at a time when psychiatric patients in Cork are threatened with expulsion into a world that, in some case they have not seen for 40 years, that we spend nearly £5 million on the FCA every year.  It seems astonishing that we can produce a 7 to 10 per cent increase on headage payments to produce more of a product that nobody wants to buy and spend £70 million on this in the current financial year and still tell women who have lost babies that, &ldquo;You must share wards with people who have just <Col N="903" /> had the joy of a healthy childbirth&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It seems astonishing that we can tell hundreds more of our young doctors, &ldquo;You will have no job&rdquo; while at the same time the old, the sick and the infirm will be confronted with longer and longer queues, longer and longer waiting lists and the glib assurance, &ldquo;All you have to do is pay your few bob to the VHI and all these queues will miraculously disappear&rdquo;. It seems astonishing that we can pillory people who attempt to defend the health services as either unrealistic or worse.  It seems astonishing that we are told that people will not die.  Perhaps that is true because we will probably make sure people will not die.  One of the convenient reasons for tackling the psychiatric service is that whatever happens to psychiatric patients they rarely die directly as a result of psychiatric illness. They may die as an indirect consequence of it but you can discharge psychiatric patients, you cannot admit psychiatric patients, you can give them poor treatment and, conveniently, the one thing they will not do, unless they commit suicide, is die.  Therefore, it is easier to say that people will not die because of these things, particularly when you tackle the psychiatric service.  People will suffer enormously; they will die as an indirect consequence of it; the incidence of suicide will increase.</P>
    <P>There is evidence from medical literature that the disturbances in psychiatric hospitals, movements in wards, reductions in staffings, all have a profound effect on psychiatric patients and produce a significant increase in tendencies towards suicide.  At the centre of what looks like yet another industrial dispute is another manifestation of the simple fact that there is not an enormous amount of fat on the areas of the health service that are being decimated in these cutbacks.  Areas of waste have never been identified; areas of the cavalier use of public facilities by private consultants for their private gain have never been quantified. We still do not know what proportion of the time of our public hospitals, what proportion of the <Col N="904" /> resources, what proportion of the capital costs, what proportion of the running costs are actually consumed in the interests of private patients paying private fees to private consultants.</P>
    <P>How can we talk about reducing the burden on the State of the health services until we know what proportion of the State's expenditure on those services is actually directly or indirectly subsidising the incomes of some of the wealthiest people in our society?  What do we do? We give them a common contract which must be unique in its terms.  I have seen that contract and I have not seen any other contract between any State body and its employees that bears any comparison with it.  I am a professional within the public service; I am on a salary scale, which is not as large as that of a consultant but it is comparable with it.  My contract is quite specific about my duties, quite specific about what my employer is entitled to expect of me, quite specific about the limitations of the expenses I can claim, quite specific on the fact that I cannot carry out any additional work without the approval and permission of my employer.  My employer is entitled to be satisfied that that work will not interfere with my first duty, which is to my employer, the City of Cork VEC.</P>
    <P>In the case of consultants you have no such guarantees.  You have escape holes and bolt holes written in in language that I have not seen in any other contract. That contract has been due for renegotiation, or for re-writing, for at least a year if not two years, and that still has not happened.  It would have been a very healthy place to start if you wanted to win over public opinion that these health cuts were meant to apply fairly, to apply best to those who could most afford to carry them, to have started with those who have done best in terms of their own income.  Instead we have a position where those who have benefited most will get richer because of the cutbacks and those who have benefited least, whether they be paramedics, junior doctors or the ordinary people, the domestics who cook the food, the people who clean the floors, the occupational therapists etc., because <Col N="905" /> they are in temporary appointments, are easily let go.  They have no contractual obligations which cause problems.</P>
    <P>All the evidence in the area in which I live is that far from having a strategic plan based on an assessment of relative need and on an assessment of where cutbacks could be achieved with the least affect on ordinary people, what is being done is that the areas which are easiest to dispose of, the areas which are most likely not to answer back, are the ones which are being targeted.  I do not understand why we have accepted with extraordinary fatalism the fact that these things must happen.  It will be only in a year or two, if &mdash; I hope it is only an if &mdash; things like the infant mortality rate begin to go up that we will realise what we have given away, what we have thrown away.</P>
    <P>If cutbacks in the health service were needed they should have been preceded by a proper analysis of expenditure in the health service, a public debate which identified where there was waste and excessive capacity and not on the basis of spurious international comparisons. Because of our unique demographic conditions we could not make a real, valid international comparison.  If that identified areas of waste, I doubt if it would identify significant areas of waste, it would be easy to get public opinion to accept it.  I do not accept that you can tell somebody in Bantry, &ldquo;If you happen to be pregnant now you can take a 50-mile trip to the nearest maternity hospital in Cork.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Very often those who draft these plans and the economists who advocate these plans mostly live in Dublin where they have a choice of three maternity hospitals within a five or ten minute drive of where they live.  It is only economists who can come up with these extraordinary notions and ideas that you can do a cost benefit analysis based on cash inputs and cash outputs and decide what is good health care.  At the centre of health care are the feelings and needs of human beings. People who are told that because it is more efficient in terms of money they must now travel 50 miles where they previously <Col N="906" /> travelled ten miles do not see it in terms of a saving to the State.  They see it as an imposition on themselves.</P>
    <P>The tragedy of what we are doing and what is going on, which seems to get worse from week to week, is not that we have <i>largesse</i> in the public health service which enables people to do very well out of it, or a kind of affluent national health service which spent money as if it was going out of style.  We had a very limited health service in terms of what it could deliver but which delivered that which was minimally necessary to provide basic civilised standards of health care.  We now have a health service which increasingly is a network of patches with gaps between the patches, with places which people can fall through, places where people can be missed, places where people will be without early diagnosis, proper treatment, proper after care etc.</P>
    <P>We are actually allowing people whose interests are not in the area of health care, whose interests are not in the area of public health generally, who believe in a very crude, marketed, economic version of health services, to dictate to this State how we should look after our service. I reject that and I particularly reject the idea that money is not available.  If international interest rates rose by 10 per cent next week we would find the money to pay the interest on our national debt and not one member of the Government or Opposition would say we cannot afford it, but when it comes to health services, to education and to welfare we can turn around and say of course we cannot afford it.  We can afford it if we want to afford it, if we choose to afford it.  The truth is that none of us who talk about this and take decisions about this will be affected by these cutbacks because we can pay for our medicine, we can pay for our education and we will not need welfare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>When Senator Brendan Ryan moves a motion he does it with very deep conviction.  I listened attentively to what he had to say.  I know he spoke very sincerely about the problems that exist in the country today with regard <Col N="907" /> to the health services.  It is only two weeks since we had a debate on this subject and I spoke on the matter.  It is a very complex problem.</P>
      <P>We have a significant budget of over £1,300 million being spent on our health services.  It is not an insignificant figure. A recent OECD report said that we are ahead of Britain, France, Belgium and Italy as well as Spain and Portugal, so that we need not hang our heads in shame at the amount that we spend on our health services.  I have said before that health services in Ireland are an industry; it is no longer a caring profession.  Patients are the very last to be considered.  We have had the hyped up situation where babies will die, children will die, but the people who have been out parading, carrying placards, were not talking about babies, children, the ill or mentally ill, but about their own career structures.  I feel we must put the whole thing into perspective and say that jobs that are at stake is the consideration, not the health of the children.</P>
      <P>Tremendous changes have taken place in the health services.  There have been major breakthroughs almost daily.  I remember making a statement in the Dáil that we would see heart transplants in this country.  It immediately caught the headlines.  I invited Professor Barnard over here to explain the technique.  I thought this would never happen or indeed that we would see an operation such as a coronary by-pass, but these are routine, common procedures now.  The only question now is that these are costing lots of money.  A coronary by-pass surgery operation costs a minimum of £12,000.  You can take into consideration the fact that the Mater Hospital last year performed 1,100 of these operations at a cost of £1.3 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take, for example, the case of a woman on renal dialysis &mdash; the sum can be anything up to £30,000 a year while she is awaiting a kidney transplant.  We have liver transplants, bone marrow transplants and hip replacements which are considered routine procedures and demanded as of right.  I accept that.  Our <Col N="908" /> health budgets have not gone up except that these are grabbing money which should be allocated to the old, the infirm, the handicapped, psychiatric patients. These are losing out.  That has to be borne in mind.  If you look at the health services you must look at this situation first.</P>
    <P>The next thing we are seeing is that in the past couple of years health boards have run amok with regard to their spending. If I may digress for a moment, in the seventies when people could order a taxi to bring them to the out-patients department of a hospital, this was done on a very large scale.  I remember patients &mdash; patients of mine as well as others &mdash; and when the taxi called they would fall asleep and wait there for an hour and a half or two hours.  This is a fact.  When they were brought to the hospital these patients told the taxi men to wait for them.  When they came out and got into the taxis they asked to be taken to Moore Street for shopping. Officials in the Department of Health are aware of this fact.</P>
    <P>We thought there was no limit to the money that could be spent.  I am trying to put in perspective what was happening. We demand these operations and we think they should be provided as of right. Of course they should.  Of course it would be a wonderful world if we could provide all these but we have a finite sum to spend on the health services.  In the past couple of years health boards have been running amok in their spending.  They have been spending without regard to any form of discipline.  They accumulated losses or overruns to the tune of £55 million, spent without the knowledge of the consent of the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>As well as that the election was in the air at the latter end of last year.  There was no budget for these health boards; they were just spending <i>ad nauseam.</i>  The election took place and the new budget did not come until April.  One quarter of the year had gone by and these people had overspent in that time.  Now budgetary allocations had to be given to these health boards which caused panic.  There were no selective cutbacks in each health board.  It was done willy-nilly.  Wards <Col N="909" /> were closed and beds had to be left unoccupied.</P>
    <P>I would be dishonest if I did not say it is causing a lot of concern.  I went to one area and they told me about Our Lady's Hospital closing at 5 o'clock and nothing could be done for the children.  I accept that and it is a serious thing.  I would be more than happy to offer my services every night free, gladly, if they would take me to help.  No one knows the anxiety of a parent when a child is ill as a result of an accident, or anything like that, and there is no help available.</P>
    <P>We have been throwing money around like confetti.  Our memories are short, I did not see anything about it in the election campaign.  I do not want to make this an election issue because it has nothing to do with that.  We gave £250 million to Allied Irish Banks because they panicked the Government and said the economy was in danger of collapse unless £250 million was given to rescue the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  Do Senators remember that £250 million?  That £250 million would solve all our problems in the health services.  It is galling to know that that same Allied Irish Banks, with triumphant smiles on the faces of their directors could announce a profit of £150 million four weeks ago, these people who got £250 million of the taxpayers' money. We should hang our heads in shame at having allowed that to happen, that they should bamboozle us and force us into a situation they thrived in.</P>
    <P>Deputy Garret FitzGerald, the Taoiseach at the time, did it with full serious intent.  He did it in the best interests of the country &mdash; I must say that &mdash; but these people fooled us and conned us into doing this.  We should demand the return of this money.  We let them away with too much.  These same banks will do nothing for the country except extract everything they can from it.  They have no concern for the country except what they can use it for.</P>
    <P>We have spent money like confetti. Moneys were given by Ministers and junior Ministers.  One junior Minister gave £40,000 to a pigeon club.  This is not party political.  A group came to me about <Col N="910" /> £40,000 that was given to a pigeon club that had five members.  This is morally wrong and we should not have allowed it to happen.  There should be more scrutiny of things like this.  We will not talk about one party or another.  No party should be allowed to do that.  There should be greater control over spending.  The semi-State bodies have spent money without regard to their responsibilities to the public.</P>
    <P>I am trying to put the whole question of the health services and how we spend money on them into perspective.  The Minister gave a 1 per cent increase to the health boards with a 7 per cent cutback for the voluntary hospitals.  The 1 per cent increase was not enough taking into account the unlimited spending that took place.  I would prefer to have seen these cutbacks phased in over a five year period.  We cannot have drastic cutbacks so suddenly because the repercussions are too serious.  We should talk about a five year budget for the health boards and for the health services in general and do it on a phased basis.  It is very difficult to expect anyone to suddenly do this.</P>
    <P>As regards the junior doctors I have to declare my interest.  I am a medical doctor, I practice but I do not charge.  I have three children who are doctors, one of whom is a junior doctor.  I can understand their frustration.  They have been trying to negotiate a proper overtime structure, proper payments for overtime. I am not in favour of overtime.  I feel that doctors in training &mdash; I said this before and was rebuked for saying it &mdash; should not be talking about overtime.  They should be talking about caring for patients.  It is a sad situation when doctors resort to talking about overtime.  That is my opinion and I am afraid I am the only one who holds it.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Junior&rdquo; is a misnomer as Senator Brendan Ryan very rightly pointed out. They are far from junior. Many of them are in their forties and there is no proper career structure for them.  It is a pyramid system.  The man at the top does not move, does not die and they wait to get to the top.  We have got to look at <Col N="911" /> those who have already embarked on their careers.  We must do something for them.  We cannot have this situation of insecurity.  While saying that, and recognising their right to a proper method of pay, I believe we train too many doctors. Indeed, we could do with one medical school less.  I have always maintained that.  I saw a report issued last week from the World Health Organisation asking countries such as ours to review their medical manpower requirements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope you will.  We shall have to ensure that emergency services are provided in hospitals at out-patient and casualty departments.  We will have to ensure that there is no abuse of that.  I have worked in out-patient departments and in casualty departments and there was open abuse.  People who need not have attended took up unnecessary time which could more profitably have been applied to emergency cases.  We must look into that aspect of it.  We must see if there are other areas from which money may be transferred to the health services to overcome his problem.  That must be done.  We should have five year health budgets to enable proper planning to take place.  It has been <Col N="912" /> said by Senator Brendan Ryan that consultants are using the public services for their private patients.  I checked this a few days ago and found that 15 per cent of their salary is deducted for that in rural areas and 20 per cent of their salary is deducted in the Dublin and eastern region.  I do not know if that is enough, but I checked it out only a few days ago.</P>
      <P>If we are to have cutbacks in the health service we will have to have a public debate to see what the public want.  It is very important that we should initiate this debate to decide whether the money should be applied to the elderly, the handicapped, the mentally handicapped, and the infirm, or if we should take it from them to provide a coronary by-pass operation for a man with a young family. Perhaps the public are prepared to pay more money to ensure that a proper health service is provided.  This must be done very soon.  We cannot delay it unnecessarily.  The public must understand and appreciate where the money is going.  We must ensure that administrative staff do not gobble up all the money.  We have over 4,000 administrative staff in the health services.  We may need for nurses aides to do a lot more work.  That should be done.  We must look again at the prescribed relatives allowance because many patients are detained unnecessarily in homes and hospitals when they could, very readily, be kept at home if we were to ease the restrictions in this prescribed relatives allowance.  For instance, a married woman maintained by her husband cannot claim this allowance in order to provide this service for her mother.  This is wrong.  I have investigated it.  We could save £10 million by trebling the amount of money which we pay in prescribed relatives allowance so that many of the patients could leave hospital and be provided for at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are areas where we could bring about reductions and savings in the service. For instance, why cannot we consider earlier retirement for nurses so that we can leave some of the younger people in the service?  It can be done.  Nurses would willingly go for such a service.  I <Col N="913" /> would appeal to consultants to give their Saturday mornings free of charge in the interests of the country to help to clear up the backlog of out-patient appointments; it is sad that people have to wait for so long.  That could be done without extra cost.  The problem with the health service is that the dedication is gone.  We used to have the nuns doing much of the work but that is all gone now.  We must bear this in mind when we are talking about the health service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly with Senator O'Connell about the money which was spent and which was given to the AIB in particular.  I make no apology for saying I think we should recoup that money over a ten year period and I hope the Government may even be considering that.</P>
      <P>I should like to emphasise that after seven months in power the Coalition took £5 million from the banks and in the budget after that took another £20 million per year.  We made no apologies for that. I do not remember any other Government doing so.  For that matter I hope that the present Government will increase that amount.  Senator O'Connell is right.  The banks are taking a lot of money; they are making a lot of money; and there probably are areas where we can get more money from them.</P>
      <P>Being a public representative in the Cork region and very much involved in the voluntary hospitals areas &mdash; I am chairman of a hospial and involved in the twinning of two hospitals &mdash; I am annoyed to think that the Department are giving the impression too strongly that the onus is on the health boards.  An allocation of moneys goes to the health boards every year.  For instance, something in the region of £238 million per year goes to the Southern Health Board.  That health board had overrun by about £11 million and they are being asked to eliminate that £11 million in one year.  That figure could be wrong, but I do not think it is too far out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="914" /> The previous Minister had ongoing discussions to ensure that, over a rationalised period, the health board would be told: &ldquo;This is what you will get and this is what you should be considering over a period.&rdquo;  Faceless people &mdash; the Minister knows this as well as I do &mdash; officials in health boards have made cuts in areas where they were most unfair to people. We are not saying that not enough money is being spent.  We know that not enough money is available.  The unnecessary situation which has been created is most unfair to the less well-off, to the person who cannot fight back.</P>
    <P>In a psychiatric unit in Cork patients were prevented from being taken out of a hospital to be brought to a better facility. Where would you hear of it?  It is unbelievable that people are prepared to go so far.  That hospital had 1,200 patients five years ago.  Now it holds only 600 patients.  That is good rationalisation. That is good thinking.  Probably, in another two years it could be down to 500 patients.  Perhaps the same hospital was not cutting back on staff.  There is no doubt about it; there was an over-expenditure on staff in that hospital and less on the patient.  The conditions which prevail in Our Lady's Hospital, Lee Road, Cork &mdash; one of the first buildings built in Cork which is still standing &mdash; are unbelievable.  St. Stephen's Hospital in Glanmire has been maintained over the past eight or nine years by the Department of Health and by the Southern Health Board so that it can be used again for the benefit of patients.  My priority is the patient.</P>
    <P>In the area of voluntary hospitals the junior doctors have been frightened into a position where they see themselves being stifled and smothered.  They got nervous because of the cutbacks.  There are hospitals where massive rationalisation is going on.  To give an example, I take a particular hospital in Cork with 120 beds approximately and spending about £3.9 million.  Because of the late budget and the election, in the month of April the Department said that five must now cut back in the region of 9 per cent.  The health boards were asked <Col N="915" /> to cut back 1 per cent; the voluntary hospitals were asked to cut back 9 per cent.  We were told, &ldquo;You must save £709,000 before the middle of May and the end of December&rdquo;.  In other words £100,000 per month, £25,000 per week, or £3,000 a day in a hospital that is only spending £3.9 million a year.  Have they any idea what that means to a complex like that?  It just cannot be done.  You cannot save £3,000 a day in a complex where there are 120 beds.  The people asked to save it were the chef, the cleaning staff, the cleaners, the nursing aids, the junior doctors but no consultants, no question of where we are going from there.  Please consider the idea of having more private beds, it was said.  That is good; you get more private money in.</P>
    <P>I do not disagree with it.  That is good thinking over a period, but to emphasise that it must be done before the end of the year and not alone must you save £709,000 this year but you must save £836,000 next year, £1½ million in a period of 1.7 years.  That is most unfair and yet for the last three years, might I say, genuine discussions have been going on between genuine people interested in this particular complex and the Victoria Hospital, the hospital next door.  We were considering the idea, on the instructions of the Department with which we did not disagree, that we must tie them together.  We must not have a doubling up of the same type of patients in one hospital 50 yards away from another. That is perfectly right &mdash; rationalise, bring about a situation where the same type of patients are not going to be in both hospitals.  We agree with that and we have gone a long way in considering it.  We had gone a long way with ongoing discussions with Department officials every week for a full three years.  We had a situation where it was totally agreed we would now tie in and not alone that but we brought about a situation where we were able to close &mdash; through rationalisation &mdash; another hospital in Cork that was not needed; we do not deny that. The eye, ear and throat service was to <Col N="916" /> go; the ENT services were to come to this complex and eye services were to go to the Regional Hospital.</P>
    <P>We totally agree with that.  Money was even given by the Department to make sure that we put in proper capital investment so that this complex would be working properly, so that we would regionalise particular services in this complex, regionalise other services in other complexes and regionalise other services and other complexes between the voluntary hospitals in Cork.</P>
    <P>The same discussion was going on for over two years between the Mercy Hospital and the North Infirmary and now the Department suddenly say, the North Infirmary must go.  There is a total turnabout.  We had a situation where over £100,000 was given for the improvement of a theatre facility in the South Infirmary so that ENT services could be provided in that complex.  We had a situation where £300,000 was given for physiotherapy and rheumatology services in the South Infirmary unit so that all the services within the voluntary hospitals area in Cork would be sited in their area.  The same Department, no more than six weeks ago, after spending £300,000 on this unit, have now said that the physiotherapy unit should be used as a canteen.</P>
    <P>I just do not understand this.  I understood that the total pysiotherapy and rheumatology services among all the complexes in Cork would be situated or stationed in that particular area but the Mercy Hospital has still its physiotherapy units.  That is very bad planning.  That is very bad thinking.  A lot of money is being spent.  A lot of thinking went into making sure we would rationalise properly.  All sorts of discussions went on to make sure that we would tie in with the Victoria Hospital, which has about 98 beds, with this complex of 120 beds to make one unit; we would link up both hospitals because they are only 50 yards away from each other.  We would tie in and form a link at a cost of £225,000.  The Department said more than 12 months ago to get a tender.  Furthermore, they added to that updated commissions for outpatient facilities, which I totally agree with.  With <Col N="917" /> 9.7 beds per 1,000 people in a country with a population of 52 per cent under 25 years &mdash; under 23 years for that matter &mdash; we have too many beds.  I am not denying that.  So what you do is rationalise or bring about a situation where outpatient facilities and conditions would be such that you would not have the same type of patient in both hospitals.  That is very good thinking.  But suddenly the Department says no.  They asked us to consider getting a tender for tying in both hospitals at a cost of £225,000.  That proposal has been with the Department for over 18 months.  Nothing has been said about the tie-in.  Yet over £700,000 has been spent on a particular hospital to tie in with the other hospitals and now they are saying, &ldquo;We are not considering the link; we are not considering the idea that maybe there should be rationalisation. We are not considering saying that no physiotherapy should go on in another voluntary hospital.&rdquo;  It is still going on there.  As a matter of fact, there are plans in that hospital to extend that physiotherapy unit even though they spend £300,000 on the one that is already built and the Department have now agreed with the same hospital that we must chahge our physiotherapy unit into a canteen.</P>
    <P>I do not believe this but it is a fact of life.  It has been discussed and it has been agreed.  What kind of thinking is that? No more than 12 months ago they said all the physiotherapy must go on in this area and now suddenly they are saying, &ldquo;No, do not bother, we will have physiotherapists all over the place again.&rdquo;  It is going to cost more money.  I do not see the logic in that, and that is why I can understand the junior doctors saying, &ldquo;What is going on?&rdquo;  That is why the junior doctors are saying, &ldquo;Where is my long term commitment&rdquo;?  Where is my long term consideration?&rdquo;  That is why the IMO seriously ask these questions.</P>
    <P>We do not deny for a moment that there is certainly a need for proper rationalisation measures.  But at the same time we have a situation where the Department &mdash; and I would like clarification on this &mdash; are now saying, &ldquo;We are now <Col N="918" /> considering the tie-in between these two hospitals&rdquo;.  That is just one example.  I carry no flag for any health boards.  I have no hesitation in saying that I had great admiration for the previous Minister involved with health and, my God, he took a lot of stick.  But in comparison to what is going on at this time, is he not now a guardian angel?</P>
    <P>May I bring up one particular matter, cardiac surgery, which is now going on in the Southern Health Board area?  The first day cost was £1.2 million.  I am glad to say that excellent work is going on in this unit as regards cardiac surgery in the Southern Health Board region, which is the Cork-Kerry region, and I suppose it is probably needed, but again, I have no hesitation in saying that probably &mdash; I would hope so anyway &mdash; in five to seven years time if you have a head cold they will do cardiac surgery on you because they will have nothing to do.  Cardiac surgery is an area which should be regionalised in one particular spot and the Mater Hospital was proving that.  The capital investment in that was £1.2 million but it is costing £1 million a year to keep it there and that is the problem. At the time that the health board were pushing very hard for this cardiac surgery in the Southern Health Board region, they were told by the Department that the money to keep that surgery going was to come out of their capital allocation every year; no extra moneys would be allocated for it.  But the officials in the health boards just do not seem to hear these things and irrespective of what Government are in power I would not hesitate to say that it should be clarified and emphasised to these people in particular and to particular health boards that it is their responsibility.  In comparing health boards and voluntary hospitals how can anybody explain to me why there is a cost of over £800 per week for a bed in the Regional Hospital in Cork and for the same operation or for the same sickness, it costs £400 per bed in a voluntary hospital?</P>
    <P>I think a lesson has been learned.  A lesson is being learned by the junior doctors.  I see a situation &mdash; in my eagerness, <Col N="919" /> I suppose &mdash; where I think that the Department officials are &ldquo;sussing&rdquo; out the situation as to what is really needed while the junior doctors are on strike.  It is sad to be taking it out on these people. There is a &ldquo;sussing&rdquo; programme going on &mdash; and rightly so &mdash; if they feel that we will be able to learn something.  The junior doctors are also learning.  The common contracts signed in 1979 between consultants &mdash; and I have seen some of them as chairman of a voluntary hospital board &mdash; are frightening and unbelievable.  I cannot believe that people can do so little and get so much.  We have no right to say to any patient, or anybody else, that he or she must suffer the consequences because some people can make up to £80,000 per annum or more.  I resent that very much.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden) Terry Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, any point made here will be considered by the Department and there may be some follow-up to the points made by Senator Cregan.  At their meeting yesterday the Government confirmed that no further funds can be allocated for the health services for which a total of £1,314 million has been already provided in 1987.  This amount is sufficient to provide an adequate and comprehensive health service and is £16 million more than was made available in 1986.  The Government have made it clear that the financial realities are so grave that there can be no departure from the limits set and there is no room for concessions whether in the health services or in the other services which involve additional expenditure.  No one group can be exempted from the action which is required for the resolution of the present crisis in the public finances which is so vital for the future of all the people of the country.  Senators will readily appreciate the domino effect of yielding to the special pleadings of sectional interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the record I should indicate the very determined efforts made to resolve this dispute.  The Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, met the representatives of the Irish Medical Organisation recently and <Col N="920" /> discussed the proposed action by the non-consultant hospital doctors.  Following the meeting the Minister asked his officials to contact the health boards and voluntary hospitals, asking each of the agencies to hold discussions with the medical staff, in particular local non-consultant hospital staff representatives, explaining the implications of any decisions taken affecting the non-consultant hospital doctors and asking them to participate in any discussions which might ameliorate the effect of such decisions, such as revised rostering arrangements and so on.  There has been widespread consultation at local level and in many cases it has proved successful. Where agreement has not been reached both the Government and the Minister have urged that such consultation should continue.</P>
    <P>In addition officials of the Department of Health had detailed direct discussions with the IMO to try to resolve the dispute. As a result of these efforts agreement has been reached in many hospitals, and agreement is very close in many others.  I am aware that directions to local non-consultant hospital doctors representatives have prevented agreement being reached in many places without any breach of the 1986 agreement on conditions of service.</P>
    <P>Despite the considerable progress which has been made, the non-consultant hospital doctors have now taken the drastic step of escalating the dispute from Saturday next.  I consider it unreasonable that a section of the medical profession, with its long tradition of caring service, should, in the light of the progress being made, respond in this way.  It is important in the case of all disputes, but particularly in the case of disputes in the health services, that staff should weigh in the balance the scale of the action proposed and the distress likely to be caused.  I think the action proposed is totally disproportionate to the issues remaining unresolved. It is a reflection of a sense of grievance felt by some non-consultant hospital doctors rather than the reality of their circumstances and, unfortunately, <Col N="921" /> they seem to impose their views on the majority.</P>
    <P>There are two impending developments which reduce further the justification for the action now being taken. First, there exists at present a specially formed steering group with equal representation from management and the IMO who are examining the existing organisation of medical activity in hospitals with particular reference to arrangements etc. for non-consultant hospital doctors.  The work of the steering group has progressed satisfactorily and the IMO have expressed to the Minister their satisfaction with progress made to date.  The report of the steering group will be available in a matter of weeks and it is potentially of major importance for non-consultant doctors and the hospital services generally.</P>
    <P>The main reason for undertaking the exercise was to provide information which would enable the payments made to the doctors to be reassessed to encourage the most effective use of skilled medical manpower.  While meeting non-consultant hospital doctors objections to the present arrangement for out-of-hours work, it would also provide a basis for a possible restructuring of the out-of-hours remuneration package.  For the record the steering group set themselves the task of gaining a full understanding of and describing how all medical activity in hospitals employing non-consultant hospital doctors is organised, gaining a full understanding of and presenting an accurate, representative account of the extent and components of such activity in terms which will be relevant and helpful to the determination of an acceptable method of payment; analysing and describing the present methods to which medical activity in hospitals is determined, monitored and controlled and presenting a full analysis of their findings and drawing such conclusions as they consider appropriate.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, the report of the steering committee group is expected shortly.  There is no reason, given the goodwill on the part of the Irish Medical <Col N="922" /> Organisation why preliminary discussions on issues arising from the report cannot be got under way quickly.  I would be very concerned that the action now contemplated might jeopardise these discussions.</P>
    <P>It might be useful for the House if at this point I give some details of the remuneration package currently available to the doctors.  A house officer's basic salary for a 40 hour week rises from £11,335 to £16,411.  A registrar's salary rises from £15,083 to £18,189.  In addition, for hours in excess of 40 for which non-consultant hospital doctors are rostered, hourly payments rising to £4.18 per hour are payable.  It must be emphasised that while non consultant hospital doctors may be rostered for such additional hours and are available, they are not necessarily working.  Non-consultant hospital doctors have perks which cannot be regarded as ungenerous.  For example, they are entitled to 32 days leave per annum plus eight working days in lieu of the liability for being rostered for duty on public holidays.  Payment while on leave is on the basis of ten notional hours for each day's annual leave or 70 hours for each week of annual leave.  That is 40 hours basic pay plus 30 hours at the appropriate rate for excess hours.  In addition they are entitled to study leave &mdash; 14 days with pay &mdash; prior to certain examinations, accommodation or a substantial living-out allowance, allowances for higher qualifications and the cost of telephone installation and rental &mdash; in all, a reasonable remuneration package by any standards.</P>
    <P>The second major development which one would have thought would render action at this stage premature is the rationalisation of the acute hospital services which is currently under way.  This rationalisation will necessarily mean the provision of a comprehensive service with reduced beds.  The first elements in that rationalisation have already emerged and it will progress as quickly as possible. In such a situation I would expect that hospital managements would be in a position to resolve outstanding problems in a small number of areas where a basis for <Col N="923" /> immediate agreement has so far not been found.</P>
    <P>The Minister has repeatedly made it clear that there will be full consultation with all staff interests on the rationalisation plan.  He has, for example, met the Alliance of Health Service Unions, the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish Nurses' Organisation.  Until the rationalisation plan has been put in place, even with the best will in the world there will be limited local difficulties.  These, however, could not justify the scale of the action now proposed.  The Government in a statement yesterday urged that where agreement has not been reached by non-consultant hospital doctors in local discussions, such discussions should continue because the necessary detailed information required to reach agreement is available locally and the financial implications involved, which differ from hospital to hospital, can only be properly assessed by local managements.  The fact that agreement has already been reached in many areas through local discussions underlines this position.</P>
    <P>It would be a sad commentary on a learned profession with its total tradition of caring that non-consultant hospital doctors should embark on this action when the negotiations are far from exhausted.  At the very least, the action should be deferred to await the outcome of further local discussions.  The Minister is contacting health boards and voluntary hospitals regarding the provision of emergency cover.  I expect that those doctors who have already carried the burden of emergency cover, despite difficulties, will continue to do so.  Officers of the Department will be in touch with the IMO about the level of emergency cover to be provided by those taking industrial action.</P>

      <P>Senator Norris, I understand there is a quarter of an hour left.  This debate finishes at 9.45 p.m. Five minutes, Senator Norris, is it?  Then Senator Fennell with five minutes.</P>

      <P>Could I say, in preface, that it would be a great help to long <Col N="924" /> winded persons like myself if there was a clock that was clearly visible from here? I speak in the context of my great respect for the Irish medical profession, both doctors and nurses.  This is something of which we can be extremely proud in this country.  I would hate, however, to think that, as a result of the cutbacks which eventually gave rise to this motion, this resource is principally now for export.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to two points made by Senator O'Connell.  He first of all listed a number of areas where there could be cutbacks that would be more legitimate.  I would like to point also to the TB eradication scheme, where an allied profession continually subvert the attempts of the Government to complete that process in a scandalous attempt to continue their own pay-packets.  I would very much like to see something done there so that we could afford to give the human component of this country correct and adequate forms of treatment.  I would like to express my reservations at the statement of Senator O'Connell that we could do with one medical school less.  I do not believe this to be the case, particularly when we look at the different ethical contexts into which medical education is placed by the various medical schools in this country.</P>
      <P>It seems that one has to have a degree of sympathy with the non-consultant hospital doctors.  I find it difficult to understand how a young doctor, or even a middle aged doctor, can have a proper capacity to deal with medical problems and situations when over-tired through overtime that in many cases is not voluntary. I know a number of these people. They seriously resent the impositions upon their time.  If one considers the whole question of their conditions of work one sees that a serious problem arises.  It arises in the general context of the cutbacks which may be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We may, in fact, need to get better value for money to have a more efficient system.  In order to get that I believe we need to have clear principles laid down by central Government.  We have, it seems, arbitrary cuts and at the dictates of the <Col N="925" /> Department of Finance these cuts must take effect after five months of the financial year have already gone and must be implemented within the remaining seven months.  I do not see any principle involved.  It seems because of this lack of principle there is an arbitrary application of these cuts by the boards of hospitals. This affects the doctors.  It also affects the nurses.  These people very often are temporary employees even though they may have worked for long periods &mdash; there are instances of nurses having worked for ten years.  As temporary nurses they can be got rid of and shed by the system without proper redundancy compensation or proper pension arrangements.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Connell mentioned that one element in this was jobs.  So it is.  I can sympathise with people who are placed in that situation.  You cannot negotiate drastic changes without a framework and a set of principles.  Health boards are, in fact, attempting to implement these kinds of cuts in the absence of principles and on a piecemeal basis.  Three and a half thousand jobs, I understand, will be taken out of the health service by the end of the year although, admittedly, that includes some unfilled jobs that have had an embargo placed on them.  This is worrying.  In the James Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown 129 staff are to go, including 59 nurses.  This hospital serves a working class area which extends out into County Meath.  It provides casualty and emergency services.  I would be interested to know where is the Save the James Connolly Hospital Committee now.</P>
    <P>I would like to make one further point in regard to the £10 charges.  It is just an illustration of what I feel on this.  Returning from the country I had to pull in at a newsagents' shop at the back entrance of the Mater Hospital.  The newsagent said to me that his heart was broken by people who wanted to visit the hospital but when they came to the hospital they felt they had no right to enter because of the £10 charges and and left his shop in tears.  It takes a lot, a Chathaoirligh, to break the heart of an inner city newsagent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for giving me time to contribute to this debate.  I have already spoken on the health cuts here not long ago.  I welcome this extra time given to examine exactly what is happening. It is relevant to the concern and public alarm that is there and that, I am afraid, is increasing all the time wherever one goes.  We hear of it on the buses, in the shops, and here in the House.  In the country one hears people talking about the health cuts and the difficulties created. We are seeing a cloak of fear and distress not only among people, who need hospital treatment but among their relatives.</P>
      <P>I accept, of course, that cuts are necessary. We in Fine Gael have been saying this for years.  In the Departments with heavier budgets cutbacks are needed.  I am prepared to accept that, but how this is done and the approach that Fianna Fáil have taken to it are unacceptable to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister honestly does not have a mandate to continue with the programme of savage cutting that is going on.  It is creating devastation.  We have closed wards, closed hospitals, empty beds and unemployment.  We have nurses for export.  That is all we can say. Anybody who looks at any of the weekend papers can see the appointments pages where it is indicated that obviously the word has got around the world that we are paring down the nursing staff in all the hospitals.  I was watching the news and saw that wards where there is a need for very specialised and careful nursing for the most vulnerable people are being closed.  I do not think one could find more vulnerable patients than newborn babies but the neonatal ward in the Rotunda Hospital is now at breaking point.  This is inexcusable and very worrying.  We are exporting excellent nurses of wonderful calibre throughout the world.  Everybody is delighted to get them.  We need them. We should be examining this.  We should not have this dreadful state of affairs.  I <Col N="927" /> worry considerably about the cutbacks in, say, physiotherapy, chemotherapy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us deal with that. The Minister in an interview I heard recently was unconvincing on that.  I am concerned that we, like the nurses, are seeing the decimation of the teams of junior doctors.  They are showing great courage in taking this action.  I am quite sure they will suffer for it in their careers. They are asking for a directive from the Department and the Minister.  They want to ensure that the Minister takes note of their conditions.  Individual doctors at local level should not have to suffer, as they will in their career structures, if they have to continue taking the severe measures which, I am sure, they do not particularly want to take.  I ask on behalf of hospital doctors that intervention will be made soon so that we will not have a situation where the entire hospital system breaks down.</P>

      <P>Thank you, Senator Fennell.  Deputy Brendan Ryan, you have five minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can quote figures about junior hospital doctors, but the truth is that if somebody starts at £11,500 a year that is about 25 per cent higher than the average male industrial earning. It is not an enormous salary.  I would like to put it on record that the salaries they are paid are not excessively low or excessively high.  It is not an issue which ought to be touted around.  None of them is paid as much as a Dáil Deputy, for instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fundamental, philosophical question here, as has been addressed by the Minister, is the insistence that there is no money available.  If the limit is the money available, which manifests itself this week in the doctors' dispute and which will manifest itself next week in some other issue, as it manifested last week in some <Col N="928" /> other issue, that is a fundamental fact and it should not have been presented to the health services in a two-week orgy of cannibalism to take off the arms, legs, etc., of what was a tottering health service. If that is the scale of the problem, then it deserves a considered, planned, phased response.  The reason why we have the present position has nothing to do with the level of taxation and the level of public expenditure.  It relates to the need of this Government, as with its predecessor, to satisfy the financial markets. That is why action was being taken.  That is the fundamental philosophical, political issue in this country.  Government policy in the allocation of resources to the areas of health, welfare and education is no longer dictated by need nor by public policy.  It is dictated by the vagaries of financial markets and stock markets which effectively have told Governments that if they do not do certain things interest rates will go up or if they do certain things interest rates will go down.</P>
    <P>I do not find much satisfaction in listening to Fine Gael Members whom I know, from people who shared Cabinet office with them, would have done precisely the same thing &mdash; and worse &mdash; five years ago, if they had been allowed.  I have very little time for the crocodile tears that are being shed by members of Fine Gael on this issue.  The only regret &mdash; and it is a most painful thing for me to say and I say it sincerely &mdash; I have is that I thought Fianna Fáil had the guts not to do it.  I, for the first time in my political adulthood, voted for Fianna Fáil this time because I thought they had the guts to do it differently. Their history suggested so.</P>
    <P>I never thought that I would see Fianna Fáil giving in to the financial marketplace and to the Stock Exchange.  It is not their history.  It is not their tradition and it is not what I expected from them.  I do not think they believed it themselves, because the Minister said in his own constituency that a vote for him was a vote for the hospital.  The hospital had 140 beds before he was elected and it has 49 beds now.  That is what disappoints me.  I thought their sympathies were with those who are suffering from these cuts.  Let us <Col N="929" /> not play games about the facts.  Of course, there are jobs at risk.  It is playing games to blame people for worrying about their jobs.  It is perfectly reasonable to worry about your job.  In the case of the doctors the problem is that those doctors will have no jobs in three weeks time.  They are employed on a six-monthly contract which runs out at the end of June.  It is gamesmanship of a scandalous proportion for any Minister to appeal to them to postpone their action.  If they postpone their action 300 of them will have no jobs in three weeks' time.  That is why the action must be justifiably and correctly taken now.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to meet the doctors in order to discuss their problems with them, and to come out from behind the incompetent managements of a number of the health boards who have <Col N="930" /> ducked behind their desks and have refused to meet the media, refused to meet anybody and have not discussed anything with the medical profession.  I know from my own domestic circumstances that major decisions were taken about reallocation of medical resources in the medical area.  None of those nurses or doctors from the frontline of medicine were consulted in any way.  At this stage half the executives of half our health boards deserve to be sacked for the way they have handled this crisis.  I appeal again to the Minister to deal directly with the doctors concerned and avoid the crisis that is going to descend upon us next Saturday.</P>
