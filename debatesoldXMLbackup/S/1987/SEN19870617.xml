    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>With some reluctance we agree to this motion.  We should be thankful at this stage to the Government for small mercies.  Four months after the setting up of the Government, two months after the election of this House, we now see very small signs of a committee system emerging.  I want to register the enormous disappointment of my party and our sense of impatience at the very truncated list of committees which has emerged here today.  Of the five committees included today two have no bearing whatsoever on legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Joint Services Committee is important but it is concerned merely with housekeeping duties here in the House. The Irish language committee is a worthy committee but it is mainly concerned with encouraging the use of spoken Irish in <Col N="1037" /> both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It has no function as far as the scrutiny of legislation is concerned, or for making proposals for legislation.  It is not, in the strictest sense, a parliamentary committee.</P>
    <P>At long last we have three real Joint Committees.  All are welcome.  I welcome especially the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities which was, Members would agree, the most hardworking committee in the last Oireachtas.  Overall, it produced over 45 reports, many of them on major issues, including European union, the Single European Act, acid rain and a very wide variety of agricultural issues.  The committee had a very significant Seanad participation.  I hope that tradition will be continued in the new committee.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Leader of the House and, through him, the Government, what of the other major committees of the last Oireachtas.  The small businesses committee was excellent. Under Deputy Ivan Yates it produced a series of major reports and it was brimful of positive ideas for the improvement and development of small businesses.  Surely Members would agree there is a need for a committee like this, indeed, a new committee with its base broadened out to encourage ideas on enterprise and employment and to provide access to the Oireachtas for people in the wide community who have ideas on these matters.</P>
    <P>Members will be shocked to see the absence of any committee on development aid.  In the last Oireachtas there was a vigorous joint committee chaired by former Senator Nora Owen.  It raised the profile of development aid throughout the entire country and it established very good relations with those countries with which we have bilateral aid arrangements. It also had a very important educational function, both within this House and outside, in bringing to public attention an increasing awareness of Third World issues.  Are we to assume that the Government have no interest whatsoever in development aid?  Are we to assume <Col N="1038" /> that the proud record of the last committee is to be totally abandoned?</P>
    <P>What of that most vocal, if not the most substantial of the committees of the last Oireachtas, that on crime, lawlessness and vandalism?  It is extraordinary that, at a time when huge questions are being raised about every aspect of our legal system, about the efficiency and the effectiveness of the courts, restrictive practices among lawyers, the public accountability of lawyers and judges, Garda procedures and the prison service, when every day all of these major questions are being discussed by the public at large, this committee is being abandoned.  Surely, the time has come for a much more broadly based committee on law reform and law enforcement.  Surely that is the least we could ask for at this stage.</P>
    <P>The most depressing thing about this list of committees which the Leader of the House has given us here this afternoon is not just that the Government are cutting back on the reform of the Oireachtas, which was such an important part of the programme of the last Government, but that they have no ideas of their own.  Do the Government really want to get the best out of us here in the Oireachtas?  It hardly appears so from this list of cutbacks we have been given, a list as badly thought out as the cutbacks we have seen taking place in health, social welfare and education.</P>
    <P>Surely we could ask whether the Government have some ideas of their own so far as Oireachtas reform is concerned. We in this House spent the past few weeks in very fruitful debate and many ideas emerged as to how we could better reform ourselves.  Surely we have a right to ask the Government to come forward with some distinctive ideas of their own on how this House and the overall Oireachtas could be made more effective.  Surely we have a right to ask for the setting up of some select committees where, over the course of the summer recess ideas for legislation could be teased out, where outside voices could be heard, where Members of the Oireachtas <Col N="1039" /> could be seen to have some sort of overall input into the framing of our laws.</P>
    <P>This side of the House will demand that this paltry offering of committees be at least in place by the beginning of the summer recess, that these committees have a full programme of work for the summer recess, that the Government come forward before the end of this session with specific thought out ideas for the detailed setting up of committees, so that the ideas expressed in this House over the past few weeks about the need for a more vigorous participation in the whole work of the Oireachtas can become a reality and that we will be seen by the public and by ourselves to be serious about the whole business of making the Oireachtas work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Manning in welcoming the establishment of the committees that are before us today.  I regret, as he does, that the number is small and that the range of those committees is quite narrow.  I did not get a clear idea from the Leader of the House whether this is the first batch of joint committees being established and that there is an intention of coming back to both Houses, preferably before the summer recess, with motions to re-establish the important committees which existed under the previous Oireachtas, the development co-operation committee and the committee on small businesses. The work of these committees was extremely important and an expertise was gained not only by the members of those committees but also by the staff who serviced those committees.  I hope they will be re-established.  The crime, lawlessness and vandalism committee was not a committee of both Houses so perhaps Senators would be less immediately concerned with it unless it were to be re-established as a joint committee. Certainly the subject area is extremely important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other significant areas. There has been a very lively debate here and a very lively debate in the outgoing and previous Seanad about the necessity <Col N="1040" /> to establish a committee on foreign relations.  There is a motion in the other House on that.  There is a very general recognition, partly because of the whole debate at the time of the referendum on the Single European Act, of the need for a parliamentary expertise, a parliamentary vigilance and an informed committee examination of issues relating to Ireland's relations with the world, be it in the United Nations, in the European Community and so on.  I know the Leader of the House in a personal capacity shares that interest.  I very much hope that it will be possible to see the establishment of a committee on foreign relations.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Manning and as a former member I welcome the re-establishment of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities. That committee has a statutory function so its re-establishment could not be in doubt.  It has a statutory duty to examine European Community legislation and to examine its implementation here.  I hope that committee will be brought together and commence its work. The Leader of the House, as a former member of that committee, will know there is a backlog of European Community legislation to be examined and statutory instruments implementing directives, regulations and so on.  That committee has a well established secretariat; it has a work programme.  The sooner the committee gets back to that work programme the better.</P>
    <P>I would have hoped that, when introducing the brief debate on these motions, the Leader of the House would have given the House some indication of what the intention of the Government is.  The Seanad is receiving in these motions ideas from the Dáil.  There is a Dáil motion in relation to each of these joint committees which has been passed and the Dáil is requesting this House to join with it to establish a joint committee.  I should like to ask the Leader of the House if he would favour the idea of the Seanad taking the initiative in proposing the establishment of some other joint committees, either re-establishing the existing ones, or giving some thought to the <Col N="1041" /> possibility of extending the range of joint committees.</P>
    <P>The Seanad is entitled to consider taking the initiative in proposing the establishment of committees because, as the Leader of the House and other Members who have participated on committees well know, it is very often Senators who put in the major portion of time and commitment to these committees. I re-echo what Senator Manning said about the recent debate on the role of the Seanad.  We have fulfilled a role in participating in joint committees.  We have a very considerable part to play and I hope this is only the first of the initiatives in this regard.  I welcome the initiative but I regret that the range of committees is somewhat limited and I hope it will be expanded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret very much that I was unable to be here for the discussion on the future of the Seanad and the ideas which presumably were debated and discussed during the past few weeks.  Therefore, I am a little in the dark and perhaps what I am about to suggest may have already been taken up.  I should like to support very much what other Senators have said, in particular Senator Robinson, about the function of the Seanad in relation to the possibility of setting up committees which we feel are important.</P>
      <P>I remind the Leader of the House that many of us were very encouraged by remarks made by the Taoiseach at the time he was elected to the effect that he felt the time had come perhaps to consider a relook at the Constitution. With that in mind I would say there is a very important place for a sub-committee which would be prepared to look at the Constitution.  I say that for a number of reasons.  It is 50 years since the Constitution was ratified.  It has now had, if I am correct, ten amendments and it looks as though it may be subject to further amendments.  It was originally passed by less than 40 per cent of the people living in the Republic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I heartily commend to your attention the possibility of having a select committee set up to study the Constitution as it now stands and look to the future to see if any change is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with speakers who have reservations about the number of committees that have been formed.  I can see the problem the Leader of the House has in that it is a decision of the other House to set up these committees.  It is obvious that the Seanad is not being consulted at all in regard to the setting up of some of the joint committees.  It is obvious also that the number of them and the range of areas that they cover are the absolute minimum required to carry on the business of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The Houses of the Oireachtas could not run without the Joint Services Committee. The statutory committee dealing with joint EC legislation could not be done without and, as members of that committee will know, in a period when we had quite a lot of elections, this committee was not re-established.  The amount of damage done in that area, because of a lapse of time in setting up the committee, was great.  This affected the committee's ability to consider EC legislation that came before it.  It was a suggestion from the Seanad that triggered off the need for an Oireachtas joint committee on the Irish language.  That debate originated here and the need for it was confirmed here.  The Dáil followed suit when we showed the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Robinson that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges should discuss Oireachtas joint committees we feel as Senators are important and need the continuing involvement of Members from both Houses in the specific areas that are of interest to us.  It has been said that Members of the Seanad in particular have always been very good attenders of these Oireachtas joint committees. They are the people who make up the quorum usually and make the most input as well.  In asking the Leader of the House to try to further those interests and to extend the area of Oireachtas joint <Col N="1043" /> committees, I also ask that serious consideration should be given to the setting up of a joint committee on foreign policy. That suggestion was initiated in the Seanad by the Labour Party group and, was eventually amended by the Fine Gael Party group, but the principle was accepted.  There was resistance by the Government party, who were then in Opposition, to the concept of a committee on foreign policy.  It would be refreshing for us if the Leader of the House could reassure us that he still believes in the idea of a foreign policy committee or an Oireachtas joint committee and that we will be suggesting that to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    <P>With regard to the committee referrred to by Senator Manning, the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism, for some obscure reason the previous Government excluded Members of the Seanad from that committee.  We were not allowed to sit on it; there was no place for us on it.  Members of this House could and should play a major role on that re-established committee.  I hope when the Government are looking at that new committee, Members of the Seanad will not be excluded.  Members of this House have a role to play in that area and indeed can make a major contribution to that committee.  I want to defend Members of this House from being excluded by the Government from membership of any Oireachtas joint committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point I should like to make.  I am sorry that we do not have the same number of committees. Indeed I thought we might even have an extension of them.  I have been in the Seanad since 1982 and I felt that the one area where the Oireachtas was getting recognition was at committee level, in the discussions that went on at committee level and, indeed, the reports that came before both Houses.  An example of that was the report on marriage breakdown.  It was an excellent <Col N="1044" /> report.  We had other committees like the small businesses committee.</P>
      <P>I should like to add to what Senator Robinson said.  If the Seanad is to be seen as in some way productive, why not consider the idea of asking for a particular committee to be set up?  For instance, there is the massive problem within our society of unemployment.  A committee should be dealing with that.  I see no reason why the public should not be aware that Members of both Houses were discussing the setting up of an incentive committee to create employment.  That is a problem we do not have enough opportunity to discuss.  We should ask the other House to set up a committee to create an incentive for employment.  That is a very serious area and we should look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion and I am very pleased that the Seanad will participate in committees in the future.  It is rather petty and regrettable that the same committees which operated in the last Oireachtas will not be a feature of this one.  It is regrettable that there is such a diminution in their numbers.  I believe they were a vital aspect of the last Oireachtas.  I have to say that because I did not serve on any of them being a Minister of State.  Certainly I am aware that they drew great public attention to the role of Members of both Houses and produced reports which got a great deal of publicity.  Unfortunately they were not discussed as they should have been in both Houses.  The Seanad was the only House that debated some of the reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People are elected to both Houses who bring with them expertise, skills and talents which should be utilised fully and the committee system is one way to use them.  I am aware that if all of us were to propose committees we would all suggest committees to deal with our own pet subjects. That would be ridiculous because we might end up with an endless list of committees, and they would be badly attended.  I absolutely believe that the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism, which was such an important feature of the last Administration, should <Col N="1045" /> be a feature of this one.  I well recall in the Dáil that, when it was proposed by the then Opposition, we on our side of the House had an open mind about it.  I appeal to the Leader of the House to have an open mind about suggestions for setting up further committees and not just leave them at the number we have before us today.</P>
    <P>I should like to pick up a point made by the last speaker.  One of the most important jobs done at committee level last time was done by the Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  I know that was a specific committee set up with a specific purpose, but I believe the need is still there to examine family law reform and family legislation.  That would be one of my pet areas if I were to look for a further committee.  It would be desirable to discuss those matters in a less pressured area.  While I welcome the motion and the setting up of these committees, I ask the Leader of the House to be a little bit more open and to accept suggestions for further committees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my disappointment at what I regard as a parsimonious announcement by the Government.  Five committees are too few.  I have done a quick calculation here and the number of Senators who will be entitled to partake in these committees is just 30 Senators out of 60.  That means there will be a certain mad scrambling by those who are enthusiastic to have a place on one of these committees.  I would welcome some sort of assurance from the Leader of the House that other committees are in the pipeline because it may be that there are certain Senators who would have an interest in serving on another committee rather than on the ones that have been brought forward today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Manning said if one takes away the housekeeping committee, the Joint Services Committee, and the Joint Committee on the Irish Language which may not, although it is important, actually rivet such a number of Senators to offer to take part in it in fact it is a difficult situation.  I certainly would like <Col N="1046" /> assurances that more committees are coming on stream although I welcome what is on offer today.</P>
    <P>About half the membership of the Seanad is new this time.  I should like to indicate to new Senators what a very valuable experience it is to serve on a committee of the House.  It is an opportunity to take part in debates, discussions and analysis out of the heat of party political cross fire.  It is an opportunity to call in experts, people who are working in the fields in which the committees have terms of reference, to examine in detail and at length issues affecting the concerns of the committee.</P>
    <P>It is a valuable learning experience.  It is an opportunity to ventilate concerns. Certainly the press in the past have very often been kinder to the committees than to the deliberations of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The general public found the committees something of value.  In reference to the Seanad all the reports of the various committees received extensive debate in this House and we did justice to the painstaking and carefully assembled reports of these committees.  I should like to think we will continue to have an opportunity to take part in that type of activity.</P>
    <P>I am particularly disappointed &mdash; other speakers have made this point &mdash; that there is no announcement of a committee on development co-operation.  That was a very good committee in the last Oireachtas.  Most of its reports were debated fully in this House.  The Taoiseach went on the record during the period of the previous Administration as calling the post of Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with special responsibility for development co-operation superfluous and supernumerary. Many people at the time were incensed at such an attitude.  Fortunately in the appointment of a Minister of State that did not obtain on this occasion.</P>
    <P>I am tempted to ask if the introduction of a committee on development co-operation is being regarded as superfluous and supernumerary, I hope not, because it is an important and significant committee and one which has a large constituency. <Col N="1047" /> The response to Band Aid is an indication of the huge interest and awareness amongst the community at large in matters of development co-operation.  Following the debates on the reports of the committees in this House a growing body of Members of the Oireachtas as Irish parliamentarians expressed an interest in matters of development co-operation, became involved and grew in knowledge and in expertise.  It would be a great pity if this committee was not brought forward.</P>
    <P>I am also disappointed not to see a committee on foreign relations.  Item No. 27 on the Order Paper of the Seanad is a request from Senators John A. Murphy, Shane Ross and Joe O'Toole for an Oireachtas joint committee on foreign policy in order to encourage maximum accountability and participation in the area of politics.  I agree that such joint committee should be brought forward and I should like to express my disappointment that to date there is no sign of it.  Certainly the level of apathy and indeed, ignorance which we all experienced in the wake of the debate on the Single European Act should be further evidence, if evidence were needed, that we badly need to establish such a committee. I express my disappointment and my awareness of the fact that 60 Senators will be scrambling for 30 places on the committees that have been brought forward to date.  I would like indications that more committees will be coming on stream and I express my disappointment at how few there are to date.</P>

      <P>I welcome the idea of committees being set up.  I first proposed that a committee be set up to inquire into semi-State bodies in 1975.  However, the record of committees during the period of the past Administration left a lot to be desired because no action was taken on recommendations of these committees. Indeed, if I remember rightly, in the case of one committee, the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism, the Minister for Justice at the time, Deputy Dukes refused to meet that committee.  I <Col N="1048" /> would say, not from a party political point of view, that no matter what committee is set up its recommendations should receive serious consideration from the Administration.  Otherwise it becomes a mere talking shop and a very expensive process with the backup services that are provided for such a committee.</P>
      <P>We should not set up a committee for the sake of setting up a committee.  We should be very selective about this and get an assurance from the Adminstration that its deliberations will be considered seriously.  Otherwise we are wasting our time.  I do not think this is the final say. I would say a number of committees will evolve but I earnestly ask that the committees that are set up should be treated seriously.  If that is done, we will feel we have achieved something.  I hope that future Administrations will treat the deliberations of joint committees of the Oireachtas seriously.</P>

      <P>I too am very disappointed that a committee I served on &mdash; the Joint Committee on Small Businesses &mdash; has not been set up.  This was one of the best committees.  It was presided over by Deputy Ivan Yates and we had a very good team from across all the parties with great attendances.  There were more reports issued by that committee than by any other committee.  Also, we had two of those reports discussed in this House. I know Senator O'Connell was not here at the time so to say no action was taken is not correct, but it might be correct to his knowledge.  We have discussed two of those in the Seanad and there is one before the Dáil at the moment, the one on under cost selling and small businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Adoption Bill, was started in the Dáil from a committee.  There was a change there and the Government are bringing in their own Bill and it is coming before this House.  Even though the reports may not be acted upon directly they are acted upon indirectly.  The Government have used the information that is available in them.  If the Dáil is not prepared to set up any more than they have set up, will the Leader of this <Col N="1049" /> House initiate the setting up of the balance of the committees and let us get our fair share?  As far as I can see, we in this House are second class citizens although it is supposed to be the upper House.  The Dáil only uses us when it wants to.  It may not be correct but my information is that this House will be loaded down with business for the month of July when the Dáil will not be sitting.  If that is true, at least we should be recognised and get the committees to which we are entitled.</P>

      <P>I welcome the decision to have the committee system reintroduced into both Houses but I would like to support my colleague, Senator Daly, and express my disappointment at the omission of the Joint Committee on Small Businesses.  For example, the last Joint Committee on Small Businesses brought to the forefront the unfavourable aspects of some of the things that happened in building societies which had a great effect on most people within our society.  I might add that the Government acted on the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Small Businesses in regard to the building societies.  Small businesses are set up and run by Irish entrepreneurs who stay in the country.  Young people should be getting involved in businesses.  They create much needed employment specifically in rural areas.  The Joint Committee on Small Businesses had a major effect on the establishment of businesses and I ask the Leader of the House to try to get it reintroduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of points have been raised and quite a number of Senators made the same point over and over again.  I should like to remind the House that, rather than having had major cutbacks in the setting up of committees, under the last Government there were 13 committees and as of today eight committees have been set up.  It is not the intention of the Government to leave it at eight.  If the Leader of the Opposition had checked with his own party Whip or with his counterpart in the Dáil he would know that there has been an agreement <Col N="1050" /> that there will be further committees set up.  It was necessary to speed up the setting up of the committees so that at least the committees which are to be set up on a statutory basis could get on with their work.  Mention was made of the fact that an Oireachtas joint committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities did not sit for many years and a certain amount of legislation coming from the EEC has passed without having been dealt with by this Oireachtas joint committee.</P>
      <P>Over the past number of years different committees have evolved but, of course, committees have evolved for different reasons and there is no reason why, just because a committee was set up to deal with a problem at a particular time, that committee should remain in being.  There is always a need to have an evolvement of committees.  Different committees should be set up at different times to develop specific areas of concern. Of course, some of the committees that were set up in the past were set up to deal with specific problems and, once those problems were addressed and reports issued by the committees, it was quite obvious that there was not sufficient work for them.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Connell said that sufficient action was not taken as a result of the deliberations of the committees and, indeed, this is true.  This House at all times, and in particular over the past three years, addressed reports from the committees.  On most Thursdays these reports came before this House.  Having said that, I must say that very few of the Senators from the last Seanad who are here present, who have been querying the work and the setting up of Seanad committees, took part in those debates on Thursdays.  There were very few people here on Thursdays when the Seanad was debating reports from committees. Very few of these reports came before the last Dáil to be discussed.  They never even appeared on the Order Paper in the other House.  If one looks at the Order Paper here before us there are quite a number of reports which still have to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1051" /> The role of the Seanad was mentioned by a number of people.  It is suggested that because these committees were initially addressed in the other House this is running down this House.  I do not agree.  If this House had been sitting yesterday, these motions could have come before us.  They came before the other House yesterday; they come before this House today; and they go back to the other House tomorrow.</P>
    <P>In relation to running down the Seanad, I can guarantee that many of the Senators who are talking about running down the Seanad will have their eyes opened within the next number of weeks. I can guarantee that there will be quite an amount of new legislation coming before this House in the next month and in the months throughout the summer.  As I said last week, anybody who had intended to arrange holidays for the months of July, August and September would want to make certain that they send their wives and families away and make arrangements for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Again, sexism raises its ugly head.  A number of committees have been mentioned as desirable. In particular people mentioned the necessity for the formation of the foreign affairs policy committee and the small businesses committee.  Since they are joint committees they have to be discussed by both Houses before they can be set up. There is nothing I know of to stop the Seanad, through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges setting up an inhouse committee on any subject.  I would want to see Standing Orders before I make any definite statement on that but I do not think there is anything in the Standing Orders that would prevent us from doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention was made of the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism. Many people mentioned the fact that there is a lot of crime around and that there is concern about the situation <Col N="1052" /> regarding lawyers, courts etc.  The committee had nothing to do with lawyers or courts.  It dealt with the problem on the streets and how to solve it.  It was said that we will have 30 Members out of 60 on the current number of committees. Other committees will be set up and obviously there will be a greater number of Senators on committees then.  In relation to our numbers, <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Dáil numbers, we are getting a reasonable balance. There will be a bigger percentage of Senators on the joint committees when they are all set up, <i>vis-a-vis</i> the percentage of Members of the Dáil on committees.</P>
    <P>I am glad there was a welcome for the number of committees that were set up. I do not agree that the committee on the Irish language is of secondary interest to this House or of secondary interest to the country.  This is a most important committee.  I, for one, would not accept that it is secondary in nature to any of the other committees which are being set up today.  The role of the Senators on committees has been addressed.  As a member of the joint committee on secondary legislation, I would say that at all times there was a better attendance by Senators on that committee.  This has also been true of the attendance by Senators on other committees.</P>
    <P>I can guarantee to the House that the points raised here today will be brought before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to see how best we can organise our affairs as regards committees of this House.  Points were raised about the urgency of setting up other committees. I presume Members on the Opposition side will report to their parties what has been said here.  When the remainder of the committees are being set up the points raised will be taken into account.</P>
    <P>The role of committees is important but it is a secondary role to the role of bringing legislation before the House.  An enormous amount of legislation will be brought before this House before the recess.  I would not worry too much about the recess; it will be short.  There is a vigour in this Seanad but we should not set up committees for the sake of setting <Col N="1053" /> up committees, or because they give an added impetus to publicity or whatever for either House.  It has to be said that they are costing an enormous amount of money, there should be, for the State and the people, a very definite sign that they are of financial value to the State.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take this opportunity, in resuming my contribution on this Bill, to add my congratulations, with other Members of the House, to the Minister of State who has graced us with his presence and to wish him well in his important responsibility for science and technology.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to go over a lot of the ground which has been covered by other Members on both sides of the House on this rather detailed and complex Bill. There are areas of it which relate to fundamental changes in company law that should be emphasised.  Perhaps in some cases there will be repetition.  I propose to look at areas of the Bill in which I have taken a particular interest and I signal my intention, if amendments are put forward in these areas, to debate them in more detail.</P>
      <P>Members of the House have gone through the various Parts of the Bill so I will take the areas that have a particular interest for me.  Section 32 (1) states:</P>
      <P>Where a relevant company is a member of a group of companies, consisting of a holding company and its subsidiaries, subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) of section 31 (1) (b) shall not prohibit that relevant company from&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  making a loan or quasi-loan to another member of that group; or</P>
      <P>(b)  entering into a guarantee or providing any security in connection with a loan or quasi-loan made by any person to another member of the group;</P>
      <P>Section 32 (3) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without prejudice to any other provision of this section, section 31 (1) (a) <Col N="1070" /> shall not prohibit any company from making a loan to a director of the company or of its holding company if the aggregate of the relevant amounts does not exceed £2,500.</P>
    <P>I would like to question the limit of £2,500 on the basis that a director of a solvent company with surplus funds may require a bridging loan to finance the purchase of a house, or something that is fundamental to his livelihood, but he would be guilty of an offence under the proposed new Act if that loan exceeds £2,500.  I do not think the figure is realistic in that context.  I can understand the thinking behind it, that there could be an unscrupulous company director in a successful company who was using his privileged position as a director to fleece the company of its profits.  I can understand why this section is included in the Bill but a commonsense approach would seem to suggest that there should be some flexibility in that area.  Perhaps the limit of £2,500 might be looked at in that context.</P>
    <P>Part VI relates to circumstances where companies might be wound up by the court.  Section 95 states:</P>
    <P>Section 214 (a) (which relates to the circumstances in which a company is unable to pay its debts) and section 345 (5) (a) (which relates to unregistered companies) of the Principal Act are hereby amended by the substitution in each case for &ldquo;£50&rdquo; of &ldquo;£300&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is suggesting that the figure in the Principal Act of 1963 should be increased from £50 to £300.  I suggest that this amount is too low.  An account could be in dispute and a solvent successful company could face the embarrassment of the legal costs and exposure of a High Court action.  The original figure of £50 at that time might have seemed like an appropriate amount but 24 years on it seems rather low.  I would suggest that this could be looked at and an amount substantially higher of £1,000 to £2,000 might be more appropriate in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 117 is a restriction on a director <Col N="1071" /> of an insolvent company acting as a director of another company.  The Bill stipulates that if a person is a director of an insolvent company, on winding up he may not act as a director or shareholder of another company unless he invests in cash £50,000 in the case of a public company and £10,000 in the case of a private company.  A person with special expertise could be invited to act as a director of a public company and, through no fault of his own or her own, this person may have been associated with a previous insolvent company and will be prevented from being appointed a director unless he or she invests £50,000 in the company, I know that several other speakers from all sides of the House referred to this section and some said the figure is too low, that the cash limit of £10,000 for a public company and £5,000 for a private company is too low.</P>
    <P>I understand the reasons behind this. A cowboy director fleeces a company, retains substantial sums of money and over a period of time is aware, because of his privileged position within the company, that it is going downhill and will eventually become insolvent.  Perhaps for fraudulent reasons he may decide to use the company's assets for his own uses and take whatever funds are there, fold up the company at an appropriate time leaving creditors, the Revenue Commissioners and the banks clamouring for money. These people can then set up again tomorrow morning literally in the same premises with the same office staff and all they have to do is change the name.  I can understand why this aspect of the Bill has been looked at closely and has attracted a great deal of comment.</P>
    <P>However, there are people who through no fault of their own get involved in companies which because of the prevailing market conditions are unable to trade properly and effectively.  I would hate to think that in this country, where there seems to be within the national psyche a negative attitude towards failure, any legislation dealing with company law would take account of that national characteristic.  One does not find that in <Col N="1072" /> the largest trading bloc in the world, America, or to a lesser extent in some of the European countries where being a failure in a company is not looked on in any way as a social stigma.  If one were to delve into the family history or the business history of some of the most successful entrepreneurs internationally one would find that in a substantial number of cases they failed not just once or twice but several times before they have eventually came up with an idea that proved to be successful in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>I would hate to think that would happen in Ireland which is a developing economy and where we should be encouraging as many people as possible to set up business.  If business is successful it creates wealth and a country that creates wealth is in a position to help the less well off in the community.  We are in favour of that.  For that reason I am questioning the sum of money and I am wondering if there could be an exemption when this law is implemented and that the director or directors involved might have some recourse, some appeal.  There are people who through no fault of their own have failed and who might not have the financial wherewithal to start up again but who, at the same time, have a sound business idea and would like to get involved in business again and who are not fraudulent, are not criminals or people who in any way wish to defraud &mdash; just honest brokers who have failed. There is also a disqualification included in that section.  Perhaps it should be for a limited period of, say, three years.</P>
    <P>Part IX deals with the appointment of examiners to companies in difficulties. Section 145 (1) reads:</P>
    <P>During the period beginning with the presentation of a petition for the appointment of an examiner to a company and ending with the expiry of three months from that date or the withdrawal or refusal of the petition, whichever first happens, the company shall be deemed to be under the protection of the court.</P>
    <P>I do not think a period of three months <Col N="1073" /> is long enough.  Other Members of the House referred to this.  As someone who is involved in business I do not think it is fair that a company in difficulties because of prevailing market conditions should only be given three months to get themselves back on the rails again.  For example, the books and records may be in a very poor condition.  There could be many reasons other than just the simple matter of a product not being successful in the marketplace.  To give just three months for the sort of restructuring and reorganisation that is necessary seems to be a little stringent and perhaps might have resulted from an attitude within the draftsman's office amongst people who may not have been involved in business themselves or involved in the day-to-day operation of business.  On paper it may look to be a sufficient length of time, but I suggest that it should be considered and that a longer time, say six months, should be given to it.  That would be much more logical.</P>
    <P>Part IX, deals with costs and remuneration of examiners, and states specifically in section 165 (1):</P>
    <P>The court may from time to time make such orders as it thinks proper for payment of the remuneration, costs and expenses of the examiner.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say in subsection (2):</P>
    <P>Unless the court otherwise orders, the remuneration, costs and expenses of an examiner shall be paid and the examiner shall be entitled to be indemnified in respect thereof out of the revenue of the business of the company to which he has been appointed, or the proceeds of realisation of the assets (including investments).</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) states:</P>
    <P>The remuneration, costs and expenses of an examiner which have been sanctioned by order of the court shall be paid in full and should be paid before any other claim, secured or unsecured, under any compromise or scheme of arrangement or in any receivership or winding-up of the company to which he has been appointed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1074" /> Subsection (4) states:</P>
    <P>The functions of an examiner may be performed by him with the assistance of persons appointed or employed by him for that purpose provided that an examiner shall, insofar as is reasonably possible, make use of the services of the staff and facilities of the company to which he has been appointed to assist him in the performance of his functions.</P>
    <P>Subsection 5 states:</P>
    <P>In considering any matter relating to the costs, expenses and remuneration of an examiner the court shall have particular regard to the proviso to subsection (4).</P>
    <P>Section 165 (4) is of particular interest. It is difficult to compel the examiner to use existing staff.  The experience in these cases seems to be that the examiner will be inclined to use his or her own staff to augment the company fee.  On that subsection I suggest that the doctor's bill could kill the patient.  Where an examiner is coming in he will be more inclined to use his own staff rather than use the staff of the company.  Again, it is an aspiration but I think it could be strengthened a little, keeping in mind that the reality of the marketplace is that an examiner going in will be as concerned about making money for himself and for his company as he is in helping the particular company he is helping to salvage.</P>
    <P>Part X, specifically section 173 (1), relating to the appointment of a close family relative as auditor of the company states:</P>
    <P>A person shall not be qualified for appointment either as an auditor of a company or as a public auditor unless&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  he is a member of a body of accountants,</P>
    <P>(b)  he is, having regard to the obtaining by him of an accountancy qualification...</P>
    <P>(c)  he was authorised by the Minister ...</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1075" /> None of the following persons shall be qualified for appointment as auditor of a company&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  an officer or servant of a company...</P>
    <P>(b)  a person who has been an officer or servant of the company within a period in respect of which accounts would fall to be audited by him if he were appointed auditor of the company,</P>
    <P>(c)  a parent, spouse, brother, sister or child of an officer of the company...</P>
    <P>It is limited to a parent, a spouse, a brother, a sister or a child of an officer of the company but it does allow a grandson or granddaughter to act as an auditor of the grandparent's company.  Perhaps that prohibition could be extended in section 173 (2) (c) because the area of family involvement is a bit restrictive if one is concerned &mdash; as obviously this particular section is &mdash; to ensure that everything is done according to the law.</P>
    <P>Sections 168 to 183 of the Companies Act, 1963, are dealt with, that is, in relation to auditors.  This country accepts the self-regulatory concept for the control, standards and discipline of accountants who act as auditors to companies. None of these bodies stipulates that their members should be adequately insured when they accept appointments as auditors. I suggest that the Minister should at the least threaten legislation if the accountancy bodies fail to compel members to be adequately insured, particularly when they act as auditors to public companies, friendly societies, trade unions and credit unions.  In this way an element of protection and confidence will be given to the public because when you have auditors going in who are not insured it obviously leads to enormous difficulties at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Recent cases such as the PMPA and the Insurance Corporation of Ireland give credence to that.  Audited accounts indicated solvent companies in both instances but subsequent investigations revealed massive deficits.  I suggest that perhaps <Col N="1076" /> the professional bodies who recognised auditors should put their house in order. The Minister should look at that area and perhaps threaten that, unless they put their house in order for the protection of the public, particularly where it related to the companies I have mentioned, he will force them to do so by introducing legislation.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to reiterate what I said at the outset.  It is the easiest thing in the world for any Administration to introduce legislation that tightens up. This legislation was introduced in response to public clamouring for a number of years that the increase in the number of private companies over the past 25 years necessitated a critical look and an indepth analysis of the original Companies Act, 1963.  It has been generally recognised on all sides of the House and by those outside that the Minister has attempted successfully to strike a balance. I am sure this can be dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I echo what has been said about the honest broker to the people who are involved legitimately, honestly and conscientiously in business.  We are a developing economy.  There is no hope for this country unless we can manage to manufacture products which we can then sell effectively in the wider world.  We are a trading nation.  It is important that every possible incentive is given to the enterpreneurs who wish to stay in this country, to make a living here, to create wealth not only for their own company but for their workers and ultimately for the country itself.  There is a very real obligation on whatever Government are in office to ensure that the business community is given as wide a latitude as possible to carry out trading effectively, fairly and honestly.</P>
    <P>This is not to diminish in any way the reasons behind many of the sections in the Bill which are to outlaw fraudulent and reckless trading.  All of us would welcome those aspects of the Bill but, at the same time, I would not like to think that when the Bill eventually becomes law and is being operated and worked in subsequent years, there will be criticism from <Col N="1077" /> the business community that it has proven to be too restrictive in ordering their business affairs, in helping them to develop their products, to create more employment and ultimately to create more wealth which is something this country needs.  All in all, it is an excellent Bill, one that is welcomed by all sides of the House.  I would like to expand more on some of the points I put before the Minister on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that this important Bill has been revived and introduced into the Seanad.  I was pleased by the approach adopted by the Minister in introducing the Bill.  He made it quite clear that he wished to revise the Bill as it had stood under the previous Government because of a concern for the importance of introducing safeguards against malpractice, against fraudulent trading and so on.  I sensed an openness to the possibility of amendments or improvements to the Bill but that the emphasis was rightly laid on introducing and commencing a debate on the Companies (No. 2) Bill.  I welcome this debate because there has been a long gestation time.  It has been a very considerable time since the initial worries and concerns were expressed in the public arena and also by an increasing number of public representatives who shared the concern to ensure that our company law contained adequate safeguards.</P>
      <P>I should like to pay tribute to the work done and the commitment given at an earlier stage to this proposed legislation by Deputy Frank Cluskey in his time as Minister with responsibility and also by the subsequent Ministers of the previous Government.  There is a bipartisan or across-the-political divide view about this.  Some of the concerns of Members may differ.  I would certainly differ in emphasis from Senator Mooney, but I want this Bill to be a good one appropriate to Irish circumstances and one which addresses the main purpose of having the Bill which is to eliminate, deter or penalise certain abuses and malpractices which can occur in the management and direction of companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1078" /> I should like to turn to the main provisions of the Bill.  Before I do so, I want to make it clear that although I am a lawyer &mdash; somebody told me that I am now the only lawyer in the Seanad which is an astonishing change from previous Seanads &mdash; I am not an expert in company law.  Therefore, Senators can be relieved that I am going to speak neither at great length not with great technicality.  I simply want to make some observations and also to raise questions on the broad scope of the provisions of this Bill.  From the whole shape of the Bill and its sheer technical content it is obviously a Bill we shall have to look at with considerable care and over some considerable time on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I noted that the Minister emphasised that he had sought and was indeed receiving a number of representations from interest groups and those who would be concerned to make representations to him and that he was not in an hurry for the conclusion of the debate on the Bill for that reason.  Although it is important that this legislation should be on the Statute Book fairly quickly, there is something to be said for allowing adequate time for those who have an expertise and an interest on both sides of the divide in relation to company law to make representations. When I sought the views and advice of certain individuals with expertise in this area, the reponse I got was of some surprise that the Second Stage debate had already started.  These were people whose views had been sought and who thought they would have an opportunity to make their views known in more of a lee time, to put it that way.  That does not matter provided we have the benefit of this feedback and this reaction from informed groups and individuals by the time we get to Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn to the broad provisions which are of particular interest. Part II of the Bill, as the Minister made clear, strengthens the provisions in relation to the investigation of the affairs of companies.  There was already provision for the Minister to cause such investigations to be made under the 1963 <Col N="1079" /> Act.  There is now to be a change and the appointment of inspectors will be made by the High Court.  When I looked at that provision, my first reaction was: are we quite satisfied that that will achieve a substantial improvement?</P>
    <P>I would be interested when the Minister is replying to the Second Stage debate if he would explain why there have been so few investigations of public companies up to now.  There have been approximately six in past years.  They have tended to be inconclusive.  It would appear that they tended to put enormous strains on the resources of the Department when investigations were caused to be made.  Our courts do not have unlimited administrative capacities or administrative efficiencies.  We would need to know what exactly this will result in as a proposed change.  For example, in the United States they have a structure of insolvency courts.  They have specialist insolvency judges, a number of them certainly in my experience with considerable business acumen and experience. Indeed, they are appointed to the insolvency courts: they are not lawyers in the normal sense, sitting in the ordinary courts.</P>
    <P>The United States is a very different country and a different size.  They have different company law.  Can we be satisfied that the High Court as it exists is adequately equipped and in a position to respond to this new statutory function and can we be confident that this in itself is a significant improvement?  As I understand it, the scope of the power to inspect will extend to private companies.  I will be interested in the Minister's response as to what are envisaged to be the appropriate circumstances in which such an inspection would be likely to be warranted and to be called for.</P>
    <P>The next area I want to look at at this stage &mdash; I am really concentrating on the main provisions of the Bill &mdash; is Part IV which deals with the disclosure of interests in shares of companies.  I welcome this further improvement in the scope of disclosure but I join with some Senators who have already contributed <Col N="1080" /> to this debate in looking for a greater disclosure in relation to contributions, particularly contributions by political parties to companies.  I recall supporting a Private Members' Bill former Senator John Horgan promoted in 1975 or 1976. It was published as a Bill before the Seanad and there was an initial debate on it.  It proposed the disclosure by political parties of contributions to companies. That is a matter of clear public interest. We are one of the few countries where that kind of disclosure is not required. We should include that kind of disclosure in a Bill such as this which is basically addressing the possibility of abuses or malpractices, which is basically looking for fuller information as a safeguard to the nature and quality of the companies.</P>
    <P>I turn next to Part V of the Bill which contains provisions in relation to insider dealing.  This, of course, is the buzz issue of the moment in company law in other countries, in America and in the United Kingdom.  I noted the Minister's concern that there did not appear to be very full information or feedback from the Stock Exchange, in other words, not very full evidence of self-regulation in the area of insider dealing.  I find it very hard, on the basis of the existing information accessible to me, to estimate to what extent we have a serious problem, or a potentially serious problem, or a small problem which needs to be nipped in the bud. It would be useful if the Minister could elaborate on that in his reply.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill contains a number of provisions relating to winding-up.  My question is rather general, but I would appreciate it if the Minister would respond to it.  One of the major problems in liquidation is the lack of resources available to the liquidator to chase up those who have allowed the company to go into liquidation, causing a shortfall in relation to creditors.  This problem does not seem to be tackled in the Bill.  Yet it is an urgent problem because when a company goes into liquidation the strong are generally protected.  You have a bank which will be an insured creditor; you have the Revenue Commissioners who are preferred creditors.  Who loses out? <Col N="1081" /> Small traders, small pensioners who put their funds into what they thought was a good thing.  There is no real provision because there are no real resources &mdash; for liquidators to chase up the malefactors and get some of that money.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the appropriate mechanism would be but we should be considering, in the context of a liquidation, devising some sort of resources, whether by the insured creditors deferring a little and the Revenue deferring a little as a preferred creditor in order to create a resource for the liquidator, specifically to take up.  Our law, as I observe it, in relation to liquidation is highly unsatisfactory.  Often the problem meanders on for years and may never really come to a termination but the strong are reasonably protected and the vulnerable and insecure are not protected. We should come back to this specific area on Committee Stage and see whether it is possible to provide greater safeguards for small, unsecured creditors in the context of a liquidation.</P>
    <P>Part IX of the Bill introduces a new legal mechanism for the rescue or reconstruction of ailing but potentially viable companies.  Again, this Bill proposes that the High Court should have a major role in the appointment of an examiner and that the company would, in effect, be placed under the protection of the court for a period of three months.  I was interested in Senator Mooney's comment on the period involved &mdash; three months. There were other areas where I did not share his specific comments on the Bill &mdash; although they were obviously informed comments.  I have a different approach and philosophy in some measure from Senator Mooney &mdash; but I feel that the period of three months is very short for an effective approach to the revitalisation and reconstruction of a company which is in trouble but which is basically viable. The Minister might look at that and see whether it would be possible to have perhaps an initial three months which could be extendable, and if so, what criteria would be appropriate for extending it.</P>
    <P>Standing back from the new legal mechanism which would be involved in <Col N="1082" /> this Part of the Bill, we are again imposing a considerable responsibility on the courts.  I have to ask the question again, as I did in relation to the Part on the appointment of inspectors: are we in a position to be confident that the courts will be equipped, will be effective, will follow-up and will be able to discharge, in an adequate manner, that responsibility?</P>
    <P>Those were the main specific comments I wished to make, other than in relation to the redefinition of fraudulent trading which is contained in section 106 of this Bill.  As the Minister pointed out, we had a concept of fraudulent trading under the 1963 Act, which is simply being redefined, in relation to the criminal liability of persons who are concerned with fraudulent trading in section 106.</P>
    <P>In section 107 there is provision for civil liability of persons concerned for fraudulent or reckless trading of companies. I would like the Minister to tell the House why, in his estimation or in the estimation of the Department, there have been relatively few cases under the 1963 Act where fraudulent trading has been followed up and pursued.  If we knew why that was perhaps we could be more sure that the provisions of sections 106 and 107 of this Bill would close a gap and help in that regard.</P>
    <P>I have a certain concern &mdash; it is not a primary anxiety &mdash; with this Bill.  I have read with care the definition of reckless trading, the carrying on of any business of the company in a reckless manner and there is some indication of how that is to be considered:</P>
    <P>Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing the contracting of a debt by the company, which the officer did not honestly believe, on reasonable grounds the company would be able to pay when it fell due for payment as well as all its other debts (taking into account the contingent and prospective liabilities)...</P>
    <P>I would be concerned that a concept such as recklessness is often something which is much easier to discern <i>ex post facto</i>, afterwards.  It may not be quite so evident at the time.  Like other Members of the <Col N="1083" /> House, I am deeply anxious that we would have a possibility of controlling and imposing civil liability for what is behaviour which, in a genuinely irresponsible manner, causes loss to others even if it was not fraudulent.  I have a certain hesitation with the approach and the concept of reckless trading simply because it may be quite difficult for somebody making decisions at the time to be aware at the time of something that may become much more obvious subsequently. Perhaps we can talk about that in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Like other Senators who have contributed, I believe one of the important reforms in the Bill, and one which must be brought in as a matter of some urgency, is in Part VI, dealing with the so called fly-by-night directors.  I am not happy that that part is, as yet, strong enough.  We need to go further in ensuring that the well known fly-by-night boys who have been able to form and dissolve companies, either to evade their tax responsibilities or to evade creditors, can be limited not only in establishing future companies but can, in effect, be barred from being involved in establishing companies for a period, if necessary.  If their track record is such that it has caused the kind of suffering and hardship which a number of these people have caused by the manner in which they acted, I do not see why they should be able to capitalise &mdash; for a quite small figure of £50,000 &mdash; to yet again establish themselves in a similar position and potentially cause further problems down the line.  I should like to see a strengthening of that part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>My overall view of the Bill is not dissimilar from the comments made by a number of other Senators.  It is very elaborate. Perhaps we have to be elaborate in this area in the kind of rules we devise precisely because it is a difficult area and we are talking about potential abuses and malpractices.  I am concerned that it is a heavy overlay of complex law to achieve frontline objectives, to protect, in many instances, the weak and less secure in dealing with companies in Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1084" /> We must ensure on Committee Stage that, despite the technicality of the language and despite the elaborate sections of the Bill, it meets the particular objectives. I would like the Minister, in responding to the debate, to go into as much detail as he is in a position to at this stage about the new and expanded role for the High Court in relation to this area.  That is one device that I have to be sceptical about unless substantially reassured by what the Minister says. Simply moving the appointment and role of inspectors from being something which the Minister did to something which the High Court does, in itself, would achieve very little and could even be a retrograde step unless it is well thought out and intended and equipped to be effective. Similarily we have an entirely new legal mechanism for ailing companies putting them under the protection of the court, allowing the court to appoint an examiner, and so on.  I would like to know what steps will be taken in relation to the personnel of the courts, the administrative backup, expertise and so on, to ensure that the mechanism will work.</P>
    <P>In broad terms I welcome the Bill.  I have for long been among those who have called for reform of company law.  I look forward to a more detailed opportunity to tease out some of these issues on Committee Stage.  I commend the Minister for having given this House an opportunity to examine it on this stage.  I hope that we will improve it and then pass it on the other House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me begin by saying that in general I welcome this Bill because I believe there is a need for fundamental reform of insolvency and related company legislation in Ireland.  I believe it is essential to have a balance between the need to protect companies and their directors and the need to protect the interests of trade suppliers, employees and other unsecured creditors. There has been considerable debate over many years on the need for company law reform.  There have been a number of attempts in recent years to bring this <Col N="1085" /> sort of legislation forward.  As Senator Robinson said, it has been a long time in gestation.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Bill should interest an enormous number of people directors, employees, and so on.  There are more than 80,000 limited companies, admittedly many of them non-trading and, while there are no official statistics of which I am aware on the number of individuals who are executive or non-executive directors, it is hard to see how this number could be less than 100,000, even allowing for the holding of multiple directorships.</P>
      <P>There are about five main issues in the Bill.  I will refer to them briefly.  First, there are restrictions on and provisions for disqualification of company directors and other company officers in the event of being convicted of any indictable offence in relation to a company, or involving fraud or dishonesty whether in connection with a company or not.  There is the introduction of the concept of reckless trading and the power of the court to consider the conduct of a person which would be such as to make him unfit to be concerned in the management of a company.  There is the question of liabilities of related companies in the event of liquidation.  There is the prohibition of insider dealing which makes it unlawful for a person connected with a public limited company to deal in its securities if he has any inside information relating to it, or to deal in the securities of any other company if he has inside information related to it based on his employment in the first company.  The section also makes it unlawful to engage in tipping on the basis of inside information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally there is a legal mechanism for the rescue of reconstruction of an ailing but potentially viable company.  This provision is for a period of protection by the courts in order to allow the ailing company to consider the possibility of rescue or reconstruction.  In other words, the Companies (No. 2) Bill is a very complex piece of draft legislation.  Before discussing it and putting some questions to the Minister there are a number of <Col N="1086" /> preliminary comments in relation to company directors and to insolvency law that I should like to make.</P>
    <P>In relation to company directors I fully support any move to impose appropriate penalties on those who seek to trade in a fraudulent manner.  The existence of appropriate penalties will serve to protect bona fide business interests as well as to protect employees, creditors, customers and suppliers.  It is essential, however, that any steps which are legitimately taken to protect the public from the actions of those who seek to trade fraudulently should not be such as to virtually undermine limited liability status which is the cornerstone of commercial enterprise and has been for more than a century.</P>
    <P>It is important that, in any change relating to the position of directors, great care must be taken to distinguish between the various categories of directors in a company.  I feel a distinction should be made between a director who is the entrepreneur or controlling director, the full time executive director, the non-executive director, the employee who is also a director, the director who is a nominee of a development agency of the State, the director who is a nominee of a financial institution and the director who is essentially a company doctor and who has been brought in to assist recovery operations of a company in difficulty.</P>
    <P>If we attempt to deal with all of the various categories of director under a single generic heading of director the result could be most confusing and could be very inequitable for certain persons. A change in relation to the position of directors must also be such that it does not of itself force the directors of a company to cease business prematurely as soon as the company is incurring a loss rather than make an attempt to rescue the company.  This pressure for premature closure of a business is obviously not in the interests of a company, or its employees, or its suppliers, and not in the interests of the general community.</P>
    <P>The changes in relation to insolvency law should have regard to at least six basic principles.  First, there is a need to <Col N="1087" /> ensure equity and justice for all parties who are affected by an insolvency.  Secondly, there is a need to ensure that changes in insolvency law should not hinder the many types of credit transactions which are now an essential and integral part of the commercial life of the community and without which the volume of trade would diminish to the detriment of all members of the community.  Thirdly there is a need to ensure that legislative change should not be of such a punitive nature for those business people who, while they might be commercially imprudent are not in any way fraudulent in a criminal sense.  There is a need to ensure that every possible legislative measure should be designed to help the continued existence of a potentially viable company in the interests of all parties including employees, suppliers and customers.</P>
    <P>In this context the suggested new legal mechanism for the rescue or reconstruction of ailing, but potentially viable companies, is very much welcomed. There is a need to ensure that legislative changes will not create any additional and unnecessary administrative burdens for the trading companies in circumstances where enterprise in Ireland is already grossly overburdened by administrative requirements.  In a small country like this with an extraordinarily high level of unemployment and with the national output per head of population only 70 per cent that of the EC average, the main focus of our efforts should be to ensure the creation of a climate which will attract more people to establish enterprises.  We should ensure that an appropriate balance is always maintained between the need to encourage enterprise and the need to protect the legitimate interests of all those upon whom the enterprise will in any way impact.  The Bill goes some way to do this.</P>
    <P>I should have read this Bill sooner but I have to confess that I did not really read it until this morning.  I have made some notes along the sides of my pages.  I trust, a Chathaoirligh, that you will bear with <Col N="1088" /> me as I refer to some of the sections which pose certain questions for me.</P>
    <P>Part III deals with transactions involving directors.  In section 28, I feel that the limit of £50,000 or 10 per cent of the company's relative assets, whichever is the lower, is too restrictive particularly for larger companies.  I suggest that the limit of 10 per cent of net assets or £50,000, whichever is the greater, might be more realistic.  In section 32 that figure of £2,500 in respect of loans is much too restrictive and should be at least £10,000, as should the sum in respect of quasi loans also be increased to £10,000.</P>
    <P>Section 32 (8) deals with house loans. The figure there is a little impractical. Loans to directors for housing should be flexible and should be dictated by practical commercial criteria.  A maximum of £50,000 is totally unrealistic in this day and age and should be at least £100,000. If you are to have a director or somebody who will make money for you, you have to reward him appropriately.</P>
    <P>On section 36, the naming of directors in accounts should be limited as far as possible.  I agree that the transaction should be reported in the accounts but I am not sure what can be achieved by including the actual director's name here. I do not know what is intended by that.</P>
    <P>Looking at section 38, again the figure of £2,500 is very low and should be around £5,000 to £10,000.  I welcome and agree with the statement in section 39 that the accounts should be made available for inspection by the members at the annual general meeting.  I realise that providing those accounts may lead to some spurious questioning from the floor but, in all fairness, and in keeping with the philosophy of openness, freedom of information, and so on, they should be available to the people at the AGM.</P>
    <P>In section 40 the figure of £5,000 is a little low and it could be raised to £10,000.  I want to read into the record section 46 (9):</P>
    <P>This section shall not require to be kept a copy of, or memorandum setting out the terms of, a contract or a copy of, or memorandum setting out the <Col N="1089" /> terms of a variation of, a contract at a time at which the unexpired portion of the term for which the contract is to be in force is less than twelve months or at a time at which the contract can, within the next ensuing twelve months, be terminated by the company without payment of compensation.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister what exactly does that mean.  Much of this legislation bears the imprint of a legalistic rather than a business mind.  Surely it could be written in clearer terms.  I do not know what it means, but I am sure it is very important.</P>
    <P>Section 47 (1) reads:</P>
    <P>Every company shall keep at its registered office a register of its directors and secretaries.</P>
    <P>Under section 47 (2) (a) his name is required and under (b) his date of birth. If a director is over the age of 21 what do you want his or her date of birth for?  I do not see the relevance of that.  In section 47 (6) the 14 days could be extended to 21 days to give a little more time.</P>
    <P>Part V deals with insider dealing.  This is one of the most important parts of this legislation.  I welcome the introduction of measures to prohibit insider dealing.  I have some reservations concerning the confinement of the scope of insider trading being extended only to public limited companies.  While it might be considered excessive to extend Part V of the Bill to small or medium sized companies, there are many large private companies where a shareholder, or a group of shareholders, could suffer from the activities of insider trading.  Some consideration should be given to the extension of the measure to include large private limited companies.</P>
    <P>Section 91 makes it unlawful for a person connected with the company to deal in its securities if he has any inside information related to it.  Such a person is also precluded from dealing in the securities of any other company if he has information related to his employment in the first company.  A person who receives <Col N="1090" /> inside information is also precluded from dealing.  We can all recognise that there is a very close relationship in the Irish investment community and there may be difficulties in enforcing some of the subsections of section 91.  In particular, difficulties could arise with regard to subsection (4).  For example, what will be the position of a stockbroker who is advising a company and is expected by his clients to comment on that company? Even the larger stockbroking firms in Dublin do not distinguish between their company finance role and their purely agency stockbroking role.  It is a pity that Senator Ross is not here.  Perhaps he could advise me on this one.  For the smaller stockbroking firms I think this would be impossible.  I ask the Minister to look at this and perhaps there might be a need for some clarification.</P>
    <P>Section 91 (5) confines the offence of insider trading to securities quoted on a recognised Stock Exchange.  I underline the word recognised.  I suggest that this might be extended to any public limited company whether quoted on a recognised Stock Exchange, an alternative investment market, or otherwise.</P>
    <P>Section 92 (1) (a) seems to me &mdash; I am not a lawyer &mdash; to be a veritable minefield.  It attempts to compensate for loss, but it will be well nigh impossible to determine the loss incurred and, indeed, to identify each and every individual shareholder who may be affected.  I suggest that we either get rid of this section or nominate some State official to decide what loss is incurred and the amount of compensation due as a result of such loss.</P>
    <P>Section 93 deals with exempt transactions. The provisions in the Bill for exempted transactions do not, I feel, provide for the exercising of share options under approved share option schemes. Perhaps the provisions should include under exempt transactions the holders of shares under approved share option schemes where they are required to take up their options within certain time limits.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill deals with winding-up and related matters.  Section 94 (1) presents a major loophole in that in many <Col N="1091" /> companies the pension scheme is funded in the whole or in part by the company. Consequently the officer in possession of inside or price sensitive information could use employees' pensions schemes to reduce the company's liability to the scheme by trading in the shares at the expense of other or potential shareholders. If the object of Part V of the Bill, as I see it, is to protect the innocent shareholder, it seems to make little difference to him if the other parties to his loss are the company's pension scheme or an officer of the company benefiting on his own account.  Subsection 1 (c) is also a little loose and I feel it needs to be tightened up to avoid the entering of underwriting agreements designed solely to circumvent the impact of Part V of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 103 provides an opportunity, which should be taken, to amend section 285 of the Principal Act in a much more fundamental way so as to encourage all creditors to be more vigilant in the collection of debts due to them.  Tardiness in debt collection tends to encourage, and thus result in, bad debts, trading under the appearance of solvency and ultimate fraudulent trading.  In particular, the Revenue Commissioners and local authorities have a public duty to collect unpaid tax and other charges.  They should carry out this duty without reliance on preferential status in the event of winding-up.  Unpaid taxation does not justify any preference and, accordingly, income tax, corporation tax, capital gains tax, capital acquisition tax and rates should not receive preferential status.  A bad debt owed to the State is likely to be insignificant in terms of total Government receipts.  However, the loss of a similar sum to a supplier of an insolvent company could result in serious hardship and bring further insolvencies in its train.</P>
    <P>Sections 109 and 110 make provision for the liquidator or any creditor of a company to make application to the court to have a related company in certain circumstances made responsible for some or all of the debts of the company being <Col N="1092" /> liquidated.  These sections should not be used where the liquidation arises as a result of misfortune or bad judgment, rather than fraudulent or improper dealings. Some provision should be made for protection of the minority shareholder in the related company where the majority shareholder has been abusing his position, particularly if this involves improper or fraudulent activities in relation to the company being liquidated.</P>
    <P>Some protection should also be provided for creditors in related companies who are made the subject of a section 109 order.  Clarification of the ranking of amounts due under a section 109 order is needed also.  Section 109 (1) to (4) gives very wide discretion to the courts making it difficult to know whether related companies are put at risk.  With regard to section 109 (2) consideration should be given to requiring the court to have regard to other matters, in particular the benefits received by the related company being wound up.  We need to take a look at section 110 and perhaps write it so that in the event of a joint liquidation the creditors of each company would not be in a worse position than if the liquidation had been carried out separately.  That is not the case.  If you look at that carefully and take some examples you will see that that is not the case.</P>
    <P>Section 116 deals with the responsibility of directors of holding companies for subsidiary companies.  There appears to be a danger of damage being done to the innocent directors of holding companies by the application of this section. This is especially relevant to the non executive director who, in many cases, would be unaware of actions within a particular subsidiary.  Such damage is particularly likely if, as seems likely to be the case, any liquidator making application under section 298 of the Principal Act automatically applies to the court for an order extending that section to directors of the holding company under section 116 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part IX deals with companies under court protection.  Section 144 empowers the court to appoint an examiner.  Senator Robinson referred to this earlier.  The <Col N="1093" /> grounds for appointment of an examiner could be enlarged to enable an examiner to be appointed to a company in sufficient time to enable constructive salvage to take place.  In section 147 the examiner's power could be extended.  In particular he could be vested with the powers of a <i>de facto</i> chief executive of the company and give express power to carry on the business to continue trading, to borrow and if necessary to charge the property to the company.  Section 166 deals with publicity.  Information concerning the company's trading strategies or other confidential information should not be disclosed in the examiner's report.  I do not think there is a need for that.</P>
    <P>Part ten deals with accounts and audits. Section 171 provides for the resignation of auditors and appears to provide that an auditor may resign with immediate effect on a matter of disagreement. Under section 169 (b) the directors of the company have the discretion, but not the obligation, to fill the casual vacancy or to convene a meeting of members to fill such a vacancy.  Should the directors not exercise this discretion, the Minister's power to appoint an auditor would not be exercisable until after the next AGM. The consequences of this may be that, first of all, should the directors not fulfil their responsibilities, the company may be left without an auditor during the period at least to the AGM and possibly until the Minister intervenes.  Secondly, the resigning auditor has the right to convene an extraordinary general meeting to present his case to the members.  This meeting need not be held until 56 days later, so it is unlikely that any other auditor could accept an appointment until such a meeting had taken place.  There will be at least a 56 day period when the company does not have an auditor.  The provision should try to ensure that the onus is clearly on the directors to appoint a new auditor immediately after the resignation of the auditor or, if he requests an extraordinary general meeeting, immediately after the meeting of members convened by the outgoing auditor. In the event that the directors do not do this, the Minister should have <Col N="1094" /> the power to intervene.  This might be achieved by requesting the resigning auditor to notify the Registrar of Companies, once he has resigned, with a follow-up notification by the directors of the appointment of a new auditor.  Provision should be made for the resigning auditor to remain in office until the conclusion of any EGM which he had requested.  He would probably require protection from the penalties as laid out in sections 181 and 182 of the Bill during this period.</P>
    <P>Section 172 deals with the &ldquo;requisitioning of general meeting of company by resigning auditor&rdquo;, I love the way that is written.  This section gives the right to the company or others to apply to the court to restrict a resigning auditor from circulating material to the members which the court judges defamatory and an abuse of the auditor's rights.  I wonder could it be made clear that access to the courts for such a restriction should be available without undue cost or delay through application for notice of motion procedure.  I was going to comment on section 173 but I think I will leave it.</P>
    <P>Section 175 deals with the auditor's report and the right of access to books. This section brings the provision of the Seventh Schedule of the 1963 Act into the body of this Bill and makes some wording changes.  While many of these changes clarify existing provisions, there are several difficulties which may arise from the proposed changes.  First, in subsections (4) (b), (4) (c), (4) (e) and (4) (f) when referring to the auditor's report the phrase &ldquo;they are satisfied that&rdquo; has been substituted for &ldquo;in their opinion that&rdquo;.  This latter phrase has been retained in (4) (g).  &ldquo;In their opinion that&rdquo; is a phrase the meaning and intention of which is known to all parties concerned and has been tested in court.</P>
    <P>It is not clear that &ldquo;they are satisfied that&rdquo; means more or less than the accepted phrase and there does not appear to be any good reason for the change.  In subsection (4) (b) the auditors are asked to report on the maintenance of proper books.  In the 1963 Act the requirement is to report &ldquo;as far as appears from their examination&rdquo;.  This <Col N="1095" /> limitation on the requirement is omitted in this Bill.  The omission of this limitation may require the auditor to conduct a 100 per cent test of the books in order to report as required.  An unlimited examination would be impracticable and expensive.  In subsection (4) (e) the auditor is required to report that the accounts have been properly prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Act. There is no indication given of the meaning of &ldquo;properly prepared&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In common with other parts of the Bill the section refers to reports for the financial year.  It is not uncommon for reporting periods to be longer or shorter than a year but the phrase &ldquo;financial year&rdquo; should be defined as a period for which the company is reporting.  In addition to the difficulties arising from the rewording of the auditors reporting requirements the section retains the requirement introduced by section 40 of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1983, to report on the maintenance of capital. The requirement to make such a report has been found in practice to give rise to difficulties, for example, the position of companies where the financial position was known to directors prior to the implementation of the Act, the position of companies who already convened the meeting required by the Act, and the difficulty of reporting where there is a qualification for uncertainty in the auditors opinion on the balance sheet.  In the light of these difficulties the opportunity should be taken to reconsider the usefulness of the wording of the requirement.</P>
    <P>In section 176 we are dealing with the duty of auditors if proper books are not kept.  The potential effectiveness of this section must be questioned for the following reasons: first, it is unlikely that the Bill is intended to impose a requirement for a continuous audit and, in most cases, the auditors visit will be after the year end.  In such circumstances the auditor will be reporting well after the failure to maintain proper books has occurred and the usefulness of such a report is highly <Col N="1096" /> questionable.  Secondly, in the circumstances envisaged by the Bill the auditor will in any event be qualifying his report on the accounts.  This report will be available to the members and through the Companies Registration Office to other interested parties.  Thirdly, if the directors agree with the auditor's opinion they have only 21 days to remedy the situation which is too short.  There is no requirement for the provisions which they put in train to be completed within any period so there is no assurance that they would be effective.  It is unclear what will happen if the auditors and the directors disagree on whether proper books have been maintained.  In the light of these difficulties and of the fact that the members and third parties will be informed of the auditor's opinion that proper books have not been maintained and through the audit report, the Minister might like to clarify this section and perhaps reconsider it both as to its usefulness and its construction.</P>
    <P>The last section in Part X to which I should like to refer is section 180 which deals with the keeping of books of account.  One of the principal changes introduced by this section is the requirement to maintain proper books of account on a consistent and continuous basis.  Arising from this requirement there are several issues which I feel require clarification.  First, in the case of a small business, will it be adequate to maintain prime books on a continuous basis from which a general ledger and set of accounts can be prepared?  Secondly, is it necessary for a business to maintain continuous stock records or fixed asset registers in order to enable the financial position to be determined at any time? Thirdly, what does the requirement in section 180 (1) (b), &ldquo;will at any time enable the financial position of the company to be determined with reasonable accuracy&rdquo; imply?  Does this requirement allow the directors a reasonable time to make such a determination?  Fourthly, is there a limit on the time which may be taken in preparing the annual accounts?</P>
    <P>There is a second issue addressed by this section and it is the definition of <Col N="1097" /> proper books of account.  In connection with this definition the following points require clarification.  Under subsection (2) (c) (i) detailed records of goods purchased or sold must be maintained except those sold for cash by way of ordinary retail trade.  Does this definition of cash recognise such means of payment as credit or charge cards?  Does the definition of &ldquo;retail trade&rdquo; encompass such businesses as wholesale cash and carry. A clearer guidance on what forms of business are relieved from the requirements to maintain detailed records of goods sold is required.</P>
    <P>Under subsection (2) (d) companies providing services are required to maintain a record of the services provided.  I can find no definition in the Bill of what constitutes a service and what type of company would be covered by this section.  It is also unclear what form of records must be kept to record the nature of services provided.  In essence it could include a lady of the night.  This could be particularly significant when taken together with a requirement to maintain books.  We should enable the financial position to be determined at any time. Clear guidance on these matters is required.</P>
    <P>Subsection (8) requires that records should be maintained for six years.  It does not specify which records should be maintained or guidance on which records require maintenance.  These may seem small points but when a case reaches a court of law strange things can happen.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on one last section here.  It is in Part XI headed &ldquo;General&rdquo;.  This section is a joke.  It is hopelessly inadequate.  The offence may relate to profits of several million pounds made from illegal activities.  To fine a man these amounts of money on summary conviction &mdash; a fine not exceeding £1,000 &mdash; is not enough.  However, those are the general points I want to make.  I would welcome the Minister's comments on them.  Depending on the Minister's reply I will consider putting down some amendments. I welcome the Bill as a whole.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Explanatory and Financial <Col N="1098" /> Memorandum for the Companies Bill says:</P>
    <P>The underlying aim is to create a climate of confidence for business activity in which genuine commercial endeavour will prosper and the prospects for economic development in general will be enhanced.</P>
    <P>Naturally I welcome the statement on &ldquo;underlying aim&rdquo;.  I am in accord with the view that measures should be taken which are aimed so specifically at curbing certain identified abuses while, at the same time, introducing provisions which inspire more confidence among those directly affected by the activities of limited companies and encourage companies which get into difficulties to address those difficulties in a positive and constructive manner at a much earlier stage.  In general I welcome the Bill.  Subject to some of those questions I wish it well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important Bill.  I listened to many contributions from Senators over the past three weeks. each emphasising their own interest in the specific sections which they would like to see strengthened for the betterment of this Bill.  One of the chief things that struck me was the number of comments made in relation to rogue directors and limited liability.  One got the impression from listening to some of the contributions that some people set up in business to defraud creditors, to defraud colleagues, the State, the Revenue Commissioners and so on.  This is not the case.</P>
      <P>In my experience of business I have found that the vast majority of people involved in companies are straightforward and honest people.  No matter what profession or organisation you get involved in you will always have rogues to some extent.  It should be clearly understood from this debate that the vast majority of people in business today with limited companies are people who are giving employment and who have set out to comply with the rules and regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1099" /> The Minister said that when the Companies Act, 1963, was enacted there were about 11,500 registered companies. Today, there are well over 100,000 and company law is only beginning to respond to these changes.  The changes incorporated in this Bill must be seen in the context of the need, which is well recognised by the Minister, to recreate a healthy business environment.  Overly restrictive legislation with the intention of catching the few who abuse the privilege of limited liability has clearly been detrimental to business development. However, restrictions on company directors' freedom to cease operations, walk away from their debts and immediately restart a new company are prominent in the changes in this Bill and are to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The Bill specifically addresses the situation and a director of a company which goes into liquidation, which turns out to be insolvent leaving unpaid creditors behind, no longer will be able to set up a business the next day under a different name without meeting certain conditions. If such a director becomes involved in a new company the capital requirement will be £50,000 fully paid up in cash for a public limited liability company and £10,000 in the case of a private company.  This type of safeguard is undoubtedly necessary because honest businessmen must be encouraged rather than discouraged to stay on a straight path.  It is not unreasonable that directors of insolvent companies when starting up in business again should meet certain requirements in the interests of their future creditors.</P>
    <P>Part V of this Bill deals with the unscrupulous practice of insider dealing. This is a malpractice which is contrary to the principle of maintaining an efficient and fair shares market involving equal access to information.  This practice will, with the introduction of this Bill, become illegal.  This will be widely welcomed as it is inexcusable to think that such abuses have up to the introduction of this Bill been perfectly legal in this country.  Part V of the Bill, therefore, proposes to make <Col N="1100" /> it a civil offence to deal in securities on the basis of inside information.  My main complaint about this section is that, while the Bill brings us into line with legislation in Britain, we are still treating insider trading simply as a civil and not as a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill deals with the winding-up of companies and is extremely important.  The Minister stated that this is one of the most important parts of the Bill.  This section deals with the problem of fraudulent and reckless trading. Section 107 has a twofold objective.  First, the question of civil liability for fraudulent trading has been separated from criminal liability and it now forms this section in its own right.  Secondly, the separate liability provision is being expanded to cover reckless trading.  It will apply to the person who, while in office in the company, was knowingly a party to the contracting of a debt by the company which he did not honestly believe on reasonable grounds the company would be able to pay when it was due for payment, as well as all other debts, or was otherwise knowingly a party to the carrying on of any business of the company in a reckless manner.</P>
    <P>If a company is wound up and unable to pay its debts a person in such a situation may be made personally liable for all or any part of its debts, or other liabilities. However, if the court considers that the person has acted honestly and responsibly it may well relieve him, either wholly or partly, from certain liabilities on whatever terms it thinks fit.  Part VII of the Bill covers the area which has been the subject of most comment, which is the fly-by-night director who liquidates one company leaving a trail of unpaid creditors behind him and turns up in business again shortly afterwards under another name.  I do not propose to say any more on this, as I dealt with it at the beginning of my speech, and I would hope to make further comment on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Part VIII of the Bill deals with the appointment of receivers and the power given to receivers.  Section 136 is a new section which states that a receiver of <Col N="1101" /> the property of a company who sells any other property shall exercise all reasonable care to obtain the best price obtainable for the property at the time of sale. For different reasons in the past, some people have suffered very severely at the hands of a receiver.  While it might not always be possible to get the best possible result, I have no doubt that people have had very bad experiences at the hands of receivers and for that reason I welcome the introduction of section 135, whereby a creditor, or a person involved with the company, may apply to the courts for a direction in connection with the performance by the receiver or his functions.</P>
    <P>Part IX of the Bill introduces a new legal mechanism for the rescue or reconstruction of ailing but potentially viable companies.  This is one of the most important and constructive proposals contained in this Bill.  Companies in difficulty can seek court protection under which the rights of all creditors are temporarily frozen.  The court appoints an examiner to examine the affairs of the company and keep a supervisory role in its affairs while it is under court protection.  The examiner reports to the court on the viability of the company and, if viable, prepares a rescue plan.  The plan is submitted to the interested parties &mdash; for example, the creditors &mdash; for acceptance. When the plan comes into operation both the court protection and the examiner will see it.  I will deal with Part IX in different sections because it is a novel piece of legislation and its implementation is to be encouraged.  It takes its idea from chapter II of the bankruptcy equivalent in the United States. However, it suffers by comparison in that the period proposed in this Bill, three months, is considerably less than the United States equivalent, which is up to one year.  Furthermore, there has been no move in the United States, in spite of the number of years that this legislation has been in force, to reduce the time span from one year.  A number of Senators have commented on the space of three months.  I agree with Senator Mooney and, indeed, with Senator Robinson who spoke today on the same issue.  In my <Col N="1102" /> opinion, this legislation cannot be satisfactorily implemented unless a discretion of one year is vested in the court on the recommendation of the examiner.</P>
    <P>There would also appear to be a practical problem in the implementation of the court's powers because, unlike the United States, or Holland, where there are specialist courts and specialist judges dealing solely with insolvencies and bankruptcy matters, there is no such arrangement in the Irish court, which deals with all types of cases.  Accordingly, you have different texts laid down by the different judges and different views being taken by different judges, some of whom may have no experience in the insolvency or bankruptcy fields.</P>
    <P>Section 143 (3) deals with companies under court protection.  I can see no logical reason why the Industrial Development Authority, and possibly the ICC and ACC, should not be included under this section.  Why is it limited to Fóir Teoranta?  Perhaps the Minister, in his reply, might indicate what difference it would make to the Bill if the other three were to be included and why should it be just specific to Fóir Teo.</P>
    <P>Section 144 (b) deals with the powers of the court to appoint an examiner. Surely section 144 (b) is putting the cart before the horse.  Surely it is unreasonable to expect the company to approach its creditors to enter into a compromise before the appointment of a court examiner. If the creditors got wind of the fact that the company was in trouble there may not be time to appoint a court examiner. Surely it should be one of the functions of the examiner to see if there is a possibility of entering into a compromise or arrangement with the company's creditors.  Again, I would like a comment from the Minister on that section.</P>
    <P>Section 145, although fairly wide, does not appear to prevent creditors who are claiming retention of title on goods of the company from seizing these goods.  In view of the fact that retention of title is now a fairly common commercial practice it would seem desirable that some clause be inserted to enable the examiner to properly freeze all assets.  It would <Col N="1103" /> also appear that plant, machinery and equipment financed by a company, either by means of leasing or hire purchase, are not covered by this section; and, as these assets are in most cases fundamental to the continuance of the business, this section should be amended to give the examiner powers in this area.  Again, I would ask the Minister to have a look at that area.</P>
    <P>It would appear that section 146 may conflict with the remedies of the holder of a fixed charge who is appointed a receiver to realise only the assets the subject of that fixed charge.</P>
    <P>In section 147 there appears to be one fundamental defect which goes to the root of the powers of the examiner and, that is, that he is given no powers himself to manage the company.  In other words, you could have the anomaly of a company under the protection of the court over which an examiner has been appointed still carrying on business through its existing structures.  Subsection (7) gives the power to change, and that is only by reference to the court, but no power to manage the company and run the business, which surely must be essential before the examiner can evaluate the viability or otherwise of the particular business in question.  I propose that this section be amended to give the examiner powers to manage and carry on the business of the company.</P>
    <P>Regarding section 158, in view of the known fact that the Revenue Commissioners will not compromise in a scheme of arrangement under the 1963 Companies Act, surely the proper way to deal with the creditors' arrangement/ compromise proposals would be for the unsecured creditors and the preferential creditors, and normally the Revenue Commissioners, to be treated as one particular class.</P>
    <P>The hostility of the Revenue Commissioners to schemes of arrangement under which they can stand to do better than in a liquidation is hard to fathom. The courts have ruled that in schemes of arrangement the Revenue, because of its potential to be preferential, is entitled to be treated as a separate class to <Col N="1104" /> unsecured creditors.  The distinction may satisfy the intellectual conceit of the legal profession.  Its practical effect, however, is to make schemes of arrangement next to impossible to construct.  As I have stated, the intentions expressed in the Bill and in particular Part IX, which deals with companies under court protection, while very laudable do not go far enough. For any country person I can see that there will be apparent difficulties and additional expense in the frequency with which the examiner has to seek court approval for any activity under the legislation as presently framed.  For example, if the company to which the examiner was appointed was situated in my own area, namely, Macroom, it would still be necessary for the examiner to apply to the High Court in Dublin to get the approval of the court.  These court appearances will be both costly and time consuming.  I suggest that the examiner be given more autonomy.</P>
    <P>Against the underlying factor of all this good legislation there is one particular matter that does not appear to have been dealt with, namely, who will pay the examiner?  What priority will the examiner have for his fees?  Clearly, there will be some need for consultation with creditors &mdash; for example, if companies wish to keep trading.</P>
    <P>Part X of the Bill deals with the area of company accounts and audits.  The Minister stated that many companies got into difficulties because of bad accounting procedures and bad management.  Companies can keep on going for years believing that they are either making money or at least are in a break even situation.</P>
    <P>Section 176 places a new duty on company auditors if it appears to them that the company is not keeping proper books of accounts.  In such a situation the auditor will be required to notify the company immediately and to request it to rectify the situation.  The directors must then take appropriate action or notify the auditor that they do not agree with his assessment of the situation.  A meeting of the company must be convened to consider the matter.  The Companies Registration Office must be notified of <Col N="1105" /> any action taken under this section.  This is a welcome section in the Bill and I am sure nobody will disagree with it.  It certainly puts the onus on the auditors to carry out their duties correctly and, in turn, puts the onus on the company to ensure that they have a proper control and management within the company by having their bookkeeping system and accounts in order.  I have no doubt this section will cause some degree of hardship in some small businesses but, in the long term, they will gain enormously by having tighter and more strict control over their affairs.  The duties of the auditors have been clarified in this part of the Bill and this is to be welcomed.  I agree with the Minister that it is important to strike a right balance in this section so that auditors do not go overboard in interpretations and put restrictions on companies which are not required.</P>
    <P>This is a good Bill and I thank the Minister for initiating it in the Seanad. Like many other important Bills brought before this House, I have no doubt it will be improved upon before it leaves the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I congratulate the Minister for Industry and Commerce for bringing this very important Bill before the House.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Treacy, to this Chamber.  I hope that much legislation will pass through his hands in the future.</P>
      <P>The amendments proposed in this Bill are long overdue.  The updating of the Bill, had it been done earlier, could have saved many people, the State and companies, large amounts of money by not allowing fly-by-night companies to be formed with cowboy businessmen running them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know very little about company law. On one occasion I was on the receiving end when a company went bust.  For the calendar year 1986 the source of this information was the Companies Registration Office &mdash; the number of court windings-up of companies was 49.  These were companies who applied voluntarily <Col N="1106" /> to the courts for winding-up.  Five hundred and sixty companies went into liquidation and 120 companies went into receivership.  Of those 120 companies, most eventually went into liquidation. That gives a total of 729 companies in one year.  To put it bluntly, they left a fair old mess behind them.  I do not have a figure for the amount of money but I am sure it must have run into millions or billions of pounds owed to creditors, shareholders and the State.  The people who got fat were the liquidators, receivers, accountants and financial consultants.</P>
    <P>Financial consultants are employed to safeguard and remove assets for the benefit of directors before a company goes into liquidation.  I cannot understand how an accountant can submit accounts on behalf of a company showing that it is in a good financial state and a month or two later that company goes into liquidation. A company does not go into liquidation overnight.  It must surely be slipping, or on the way down, over a long period, long enough for the accountant to detect trouble and take remedial action, or report to the proper authorities that it is working on borrowed time.</P>
    <P>In the calendar year 1986 &mdash; this information came from the Department of Labour &mdash; there were 22,790 redundancies. The bulk of these redundancies were the result of 729 companies going into liquidation, this had a disastrous effect on an already ailing economy through unemployment benefits, social welfare and a huge loss to the State by way of increased dependency.  The failure by the State to provide new jobs led to emigration, mainly to the United States, most of which was illegal.  The problem was never ending.</P>
    <P>In my own county I know of at least three companies that had to go into liquidation because of arrears of taxes and VAT.  The arrears of VAT in one case were in excess of £200,000 going back over three years.  The blame rests with the Revenue Commissioners for allowing someone to go on for three years accumulating a VAT bill of over £200,000 without putting a stop to it on the first <Col N="1107" /> year.  In that case an offer of a settlement of £100,000 was made to the Revenue Commissioners by the owners.  The Revenue Commissioners would not accept £100,000 as a complete and absolute settlement.  In the end the company went into liquidation with a loss of 35 jobs. The Revenue Commissioners got most of the money owed to them and a small town depending on this business was decimated. There were no winners in that case.</P>
    <P>Where a reasonable offer is made to the Revenue Commissioners they should be empowered to accept it, thereby saving many jobs and many businesses. Many parts in this Bill are not severe enough.  The penalties should be doubled for fraudulent trading.  I am not saying every company in this country is trading fraudently or that those companies which have gone into liquidation or receivership over a number of years were all trading fraudulently.  I am referring to those that are and that will, in the future, be accused of fraudulent trading.  The penalty should be very severe on those companies.</P>
    <P>In many cases the creditors are working hard to survive after getting nothing, or possibly lOp in the pound, and the cowboy directors are driving around in big cars living it up, or retiring to holiday villas somewhere in Spain or wherever these people go.  They disappear in any case.</P>

      <P>That would be a good place to go to.  I could recommend it to Members.  In many cases going into liquidation sees these cowboys right for the rest of their lives.  I can only brand those people as leeches in our society. The actual formation of a company is much too easy.  In many cases companies <Col N="1108" /> shirk their financial responsibilities and use their newly formed company for their own benefit.  You see in newspapers from time to time that a company can be formed for £2.  This is crazy.  The actual documents cost £2 and legal fees cost more.  There should be a big fee.  It is far too easy to form a company for £2.  I do not know what price I would put on it, but I would make it so expensive that people would think twice about losing what it cost to form a company.</P>
      <P>I had an experience with a company in 1986 which I could ill-afford.  I paid a deposit of £1,500 for a boat engine to be delivered in seven weeks.  The engine had to be ordered from the manufacturers by the company.  This was not done.  At the end of 13 weeks when I rang the company I was informed that they had gone into liquidation.  The new company had taken over and they would look after my order provided I sent on another deposit.  This new company were in the same building, had the same telephone number and the people from the other company worked there.  I knew them personally.  The man who owned the company had flown and nobody has seen him since.</P>
      <P>At a creditors meeting about a week after that &mdash; I was represented at the meeting by a solicitor &mdash; I found out that the company owed over £250,000 and their assets were valued at £46,000.  The premises were leased, three cars were leased and a van and office equipment were leased.  The only assets they had were a few bits and pieces of old engines thrown around the place.  If I did anything to get my £1,500 back, my solicitor told me, it would cost me a substantial amount of money and at the end of the day the maximum I could get out of the company was 50p in the £.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company are now trading under a different name and they got away free.  I cannot understand how this could happen in this day and age.  To some people £1,500 may not be a lot of money.  You make a deal across the desk with a man. He looks you straight in the face as if he is telling the truth.  He takes your money. He is robbing you.  I do not care if it is £20, £20,000 or £20 million &mdash; once these <Col N="1109" /> people carry on like that, regardless of the size of the company I would deal severely with them.</P>
    <P>I will not go into every detail of the Bill.  I would like to refer to the part of the Bill dealing with the barring of directors of former liquidated companies when their dealings are found to be fraudulent.  I would penalise them severely.  I would never again allow them to become directors or managing directors of any company.  I would bar them for life.  In some cases where a company goes into liquidation the owner's wife, son or other relative takes over the newly formed company.  Where the husband is the owner of a company found to be dealing fraudulently and the company goes into liquidation, I would not allow the wife, son or a near relative to become a director of a company.  I would penalise them as well.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the part of the Bill which allows three months to apply to the court and gives a breathing space of three months.  Some Senators said the time is not long enough and others think it is too long.  Three months is sufficient. I welcome the Bill and I hope some of the recommendations I mentioned will be included because companies are not my friends.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, to the Chamber. His presence deprives me of the opportunity to congratulate my colleague from my constituency who was here earlier. While I might often have disagreed with him politically in other fora in which we sit, today would have been my first opportunity to congratulate him in the House. I ask the Minister of State to give him my best wishes.  It sounds better when it is said in this House.  He will not believe it otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister had the political initiative to bring forward the Bill.  The fact that it was initiated in the Seanad means it is getting the thorough examination all legislation initiated in this House gets.  An indication of the complexities of the Bill is that it stretches over 144 pages, 189 sections <Col N="1110" /> with 11 different Parts.  The Minister said that it is one of the most radical Bills to overhaul the Companies Act introduced in the past 24 years.</P>
    <P>It is no secret that the Labour Party have been involved in trying to ensure that legislation along these lines was brought before the Oireachtas for consideration and approval.  It was initiated by John Horgan in the seventies, was pursued vigorously at all levels and in Cabinet was pressed by Deputy Cluskey. The heads of the Bill were agreed and it was continued actively up to the printing of the Bill at the end of the previous Government's term of office.  There was a consensus across the political spectrum that something needed to be done in the area of company law.  It was needed because of public disquiet, expressed to us as public representatives, about the various company problems.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's courage in bringing this Bill forward.  I welcome the initiative he showed when he launched the Bill, when he publicly stated that he was open to suggestions from the various Members of the House and, indeed, the public at large about amendments to what is, in fact, a very complex Bill.  That kind of openness in Government is to be welcomed.  It allowed Senators today and over the past three weeks to speak from their experience in business.  We all have the same interest &mdash; to see the economy developing and creating employment for people which will recompense them for their labour and give a return to investors in companies.  We want to ensure that these people conform to the normal, acceptable standards we all expect from one another and, in particular, that we expect from people in business.</P>
    <P>The tragedies outlined by Senator Fitzgerald heighten our awareness of what has been happening in the commercial world and the way people who trust one another when doing business exchange money in the belief that people are honest.  Of course, nothing could be further from the truth in many areas in life today in Ireland and throughout the western world.  There is an old saying that &ldquo;a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush&rdquo;. <Col N="1111" /> It makes us aware that we should never trust anybody and that money should change hands only when the product has been delivered.  In everyday life there is an element of trust and it is unfortunate that people tyring to do business find that the person they are doing it with cannot be trusted.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to fly-by-nights. Many of the public have become aware of the anomaly whereby people can set up a business, go into liquidation refusing to meet their commitments and restart with the same directors the same staff, the same premises, the same telephone number and a change of name which removes from them the responsibility to repay debts to the community, to suppliers and to the State.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget that in the winding-up of many companies, voluntarily or otherwise, the State is quite a major loser.  The State means everybody.  It means in particular the PAYE sector who fund the State to a very large extent for most of its enterprises and pay their tax. Government assistance is available to the private sector industry by way of industrial grants, which most of us welcome as an incentive to stimulate employment. That also places a certain responsibility on the companies to deal honestly with people, to deal with their employees in an honest fashion and, in turn, to honour their statutory obligations to the State.</P>
    <P>We are aware of the anomalies that arise when companies go into liquidation with money due to the State under the various headings of PAYE, PRSI, VAT and so on.  It is appropriate that the State should have first charge on the assets of a company in that situation.  As legislators we must be responsible for public money and if money is due to the public purse under these headings which, generally speaking, has been collected from the workers in the company, the least we should expect is that they would pay it. Because of that problem legislation became necessary in the area of employees' rights and the first charge on companies which went into liquidation.</P>
    <P>When my colleague.  Deputy Quinn, <Col N="1112" /> was Minister for Labour he brought forward legislation insisting that in the area of employer liabilities, particularly in the case of company loses and the collapse of companies, the State should be responsible for all the statutory entitlements of employees, whether it be holiday pay, pay in lieu of notice, pay due to them or other such areas.  The tragedy is that we did not foresee the anomalies that arose in industries, particularly with pension funds.</P>
    <P>Senator McKenna knows that we had companies in Nenagh which did not make pension funds available to employees, as was their right as they had contributed to them.  That happened in many other companies as well.  There is the possibility that in future the pension rights of employees will be included under the employer-employee insolvency Bill which was introduced to protect workers.</P>
    <P>There are times when we make representations as public representatives to the Revenue Commissioners on behalf of companies which have run into difficulties through no fault of their own.  I have not been slow to consult with the Revenue Commissioners in cases where genuine concern was expressed by the directors of a company at their inability to meet sudden debts they had incurred. I use the word &ldquo;sudden&rdquo; advisedly because I know of a certain set of directors who had two companies, one of which was up to date with all their commitments and the other which was up to date with all their commitments with the exception of VAT and discovered that through an accountancy error VAT contributions were left unpaid because it was presumed that the VAT from the other company had covered it.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners proved that there was a figure outstanding and the company accepted that figure but pleaded inability to pay it all immediately. They offered a settlement to the Revenue Commissioners immediately and a commitment to continue payments over an agreed period to allow the company to stay in business and continue employing 29 people.  The total amount of money offered up front in that instance <Col N="1113" /> was £100,000.  The Revenue Commissioners refused to accept that offer and the company were put into liquidation and realised £60,000.  The Revenue Commissioners lost £50,000; 29 men lost their jobs; the Government had to pick up the tab for all the redundancy and other entitlements of the employees and reason seemed to be the furthest from the minds of anybody.  You can have sympathy for both sides.</P>
    <P>Although the Bill is fairly detailed and will lead to a very interesting Committee Stage debate I believe it has the proper balance between what we accept as responsibilities in the commercial world and the responsibilities all of us have to the public purse.  The State should not be immune from trying to facilitate people who are making a genuine offer.  I have no time for people who refuse to pay their commitments, who have deliberately avoided them over a period in the knowledge that, if they could get away with it as long as possible, it would be the last bill they would pay.</P>
    <P>Some interesting statistics were produced in the September 1986 edition of <i>Business and Finance</i> which outlined in detail the number of receiverships, liquidations and, most important of all, the total amount of money lost to the State by companies who refused to take on board their commitments.  VAT, PRSI and PAYE are, to a large degree, collected from somebody else by the company.  They collect it from the clients, from the customers in the VAT area and from the employees in the PAYE area.  A large proportion of PRSI is also collected from employees.</P>
    <P>There is no excuse for some companies who use Revenue Commission money as a cashflow basis for themselves.  When that happens there is a disadvantage for the honest company who are meeting all their requirements and commitments and who find it impossible to compete with companies who are deliberately putting others out of business because they are undercutting in the knowledge that they are not paying their full commitment to the State.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald mentioned some of <Col N="1114" /> the figures that were available to him in 1986.  It is interesting that in a pattern of collapses itemised by the Irish Trade Protection Association from 1979 onwards the receiverships went from 15 in 1979 to 59 in 1980, 33 in 1981, 98 in 1982, 207 in 1983, 111 in 1984, 114 in 1985 and for the six months of 1986, 68, which is in line with what Senator Fitzgerald was talking about.  The liquidations in the same periods stretched from 121 in 1979 to 213 in 1980, 434 in 1981, 626 in 1982, 502 in 1984, 460 in 1985 and in the six months of 1986 to 298.</P>
    <P>These are startling figures.  They are an indication also of the difficulties businesses have faced over the period from 1979 onwards.  For those of us who are concerned about developing the economy and having a vibrant industrial section and manufacturing service industry, that kind of collapse of companies over that period is frightening.  Apart from all the losses to suppliers, to employees, to the districts generally where these companies have collapsed, the actual loss to the State over those periods as follows was itemised.  The total amount due to Revenue was £1.307 million. The amount lost to Revenue was £1.24 million.  Those are the kinds of amounts lost by the State as a result of cowboy companies, inefficient companies, or companies who have just run into difficulties.  The State should be the priority creditor, because simply to take a company director to court to prove that he was in breach of company law would cost the State about £50,000 or £60,000. Senator Fitzgerald is right.  It is difficult to take these people to court because this is the kind of money required to try to make them meet their commitments.  If we follow through the list of collapses in that particular document and if we follow through the amount of money due to the State, it is obvious that in any particular year of reckoning the amount of money due to the State by companies collapsing, particularly in the areas of PAYE, PRSI and VAT, runs into hundreds of millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>That is an indication that State intervention at times is necessary.  One would <Col N="1115" /> like to see total freedom in the private sector for people who want to operate in that sector; but, unfortunately, in the private sector you get quite a lot of people who ignore their commitments to the State.  That is what has the economy as it is.  That is why there is a shortage of finance available to the Government. That is why we have a collapse of our health services of all the other areas of social involvement by the Government. It is because of the refusal of the private sector to pay their debts to the State and this ensures that funds are available to enable us to care for the old, the sick, the unemployed and the disabled.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to deal in detail with the various sections.  There were some excellent contributions today, particularly from some Senators who talked about possible amendments and their inability to read some of the sections.  We often criticise parliamentary draftsmen. In this instance I must compliment the draftsman, because to put the Bill into readable English was an achievement. Obviously, it is a consolidation of Companies Bills ranging back over more than 25 years and bringing all that legislation together in a new Companies Bill.  It will now be easier to refer back to Companies Bills because they will all be consolidated in this Bill.  I take it that the reason why it is so complicated is because it brings up to date some of the sections of previous Acts.  I will not deal with the concept of insider trading because the expert on that.  Senator Ross has arrived in the House and I would welcome his comments on this.</P>

      <P>In my opinion it is not, because as far as I am concerned the Senator could have been here for the past hour but he is now admitting he has just <Col N="1116" /> arrived.  I was welcoming the Senator's presence because he is an expert in the area of the Stock Exchange and I was being complimentary to the Senator.  The only stockbroker rural Senators know of is Senator Ross.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I also conferred the honour on him of being an expert in the field of the Stock Exchange and as a broker.  He is the only one who knows anything about this insider trading.  I do not know anything about it.  I hear Tony O'Reilly and other people, whom I should not mention in this House because they are not here to defend themselves, expressing concern about insider trading.  If it is something that we should address legislatively speaking &mdash; and this Bill does so &mdash; then we must welcome it.  If people can make quick money from insider information it means that knowledge that should normally be available publicly is confined to a certain group of people.  If money can be made as a result of insider knowledge then other people can be damaged. Therefore, as legislators we will have to look at it because the Constitution indicate that we should treat everybody fairly.  It is to be hoped that this Bill will tidy up that area &mdash; the ability of some people to make themselves very rich through the use of secret information. The problem in Ireland, which is a mixed economy, as between the public and the private sector, is that you can get people making a lot by moving money around but creating very little employment.  I always admire the entrepreneur who starts a business, employs people and takes a risk.  I would not like to see any legislation penalising somebody for taking a risk and doing the best he can. It is not a crime for a company to go bankrupt, but we would like to ensure that they would not do it deliberately and fraudently.  This Bill addresses itself to that problem.  I welcome that but let us not be seen to be penalising people who <Col N="1117" /> make a genuine effort to create employment and to create wealth.  There is nothing wrong with that, provided it is all above board.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to one final point, which was touched on by Senator Robinson, that is, subscriptions to political parties, a most worthy cause.  I am all in favour of it, but I would be very much in favour of the amount of money made available to political parties being publicly disclosed, because it is allowable for tax and it can be written off as an expenditure for tax purposes.  Anything that can be written off as an expenditure for tax purposes should be disclosed publicly because it is in the taxpayers' interest.</P>
      <P>I would welcome public disclosure of political contributions.  In that way everybody will know where they stand with companies.  Companies should contribute to all political parties.  It is part of democracy. It is a welcome thing to see a good, viable political movement in any country. There is nothing wrong with companies contributing to that system by making payments available to people to contest elections.  But let us be open and above board about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to express its concern to the US Authorities on the implications of the US Immigration Bill for young Irish immigrants now working in the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1118" /> This motion comes at a time when our country is facing its most severe economic test.  Unemployment is at an unacceptably high level.  People battered by the past few years of economic recession once again have turned on what is euphemistically referred to as the safety valve of the nation, emigration.  This most emotive of words in the Irish lexicon is rarely debated by Governments. mainly because they somehow feel that by not debating it it might perhaps go away.  I can remember requesting a former Minister for Finance to allocate a sum of money to the Irish Centre in London only to be told that by making such an allocation at that time the Government would be perceived to be encouraging emigration.  Happily that point of view no longer prevails and, in recent years, successive Governments have been reasonably generous within the budgetary restrictions imposed by the recession.</P>
    <P>In this context I should like to pay tribute to the Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern, and his colleagues in Government for their substantial increase in the allocation to DION formerly the Committee on Welfare Services Abroad of which I was proud to be a member until the Coalition Government revamped the committee and revamped me out of it.  However, this motion is about the plight of our young Irish citizens in America who, because of recent US legislation, find themselves in a political limbo.  There are some who will argue that the laws and internal affairs of another State are of no interest to us and that a debate on a motion calling for change in such laws has no place in our Legislature.  Due to the emotive nature of the work &ldquo;emigration&rdquo; and its place in the history of this country it is a subject that is rarely debated, yet its consequences affect every family in every town and village in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been an exodus of youth from this State which parallels in its enormity the worst years of the forties and fifties.  Many of these young people, fresh from our educational establishments, well educated, intelligent <Col N="1119" /> and articulate, have found themselves caught in the spiral of youth unemployment and, perceiving no immediate future other than the dole, have opted for emigration.  Between 30,000 and 50,000 young people under the age of 26 are alleged to have left Ireland in 1986.  In that context I should like to quote from a newspaper which is published in America, <i>The Irishman,</i> going back to the pre 1981 period, by Niall O'Dowd in which he said:</P>
    <P>It is a great achievement that no more will the Irish Paddy arrive on some foreign shore equipped for the lifestyle he has to adopt, nor will some of our finest people be stamped for export at an early age.  The physical and mental draining of Ireland's talents has gone on long enough.  It is a poor country that cannot support and nurture her own people and provide them with basic economic and social stability. Ireland has at last begun to achieve that.  We Irish in America should be justly proud that the Irish Government has finally grasped the nettle of emigration and banished its sting, hopefully forever.</P>
    <P>The situation has got so much worse. From 1981 to 1982 the Irish in America expected that emigration had finally ceased and that only those who wished to emigrate voluntarily would be coming to America in the future.  In San Francisco in 1982 the GAA, that great bellwether organisation of how emigration stands, was down to three teams, one of them totally composed of Irish Americans and little hope was held out for the future of the games.  Contrast that with the middle of 1985 when there were no fewer than seven GAA teams, now swelled to nine, and new Irish bars and community organisations were starting up all over.  A most unlikely renaissance in native Irish activities had begun at that time and has continued, one that was mirrored in five other major cities across the country.  New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles.  In Los Angeles they did not have a GAA team <Col N="1120" /> in the city since 1965.  Suddenly overnight there were four and another in San Diego which had never, to the knowledge of people in that area, fielded an Irish football team.</P>
    <P>All these changes have come about because of the numbers leaving Ireland. New organisations have sprouted up; old ones have become regenerated.  In November many of these people took the plane to America, in many cases with a return ticket in one hand and a tourist visa in the other.  On arrival in New York, Boston or Chicago or any of the other cities to which the Irish have traditionally gravitated, the newly arrived immigrant quickly assimilated into the sub culture and within days was working illegally minus the green card and at a job well below what his Irish education had prepared him for.  So Ireland had lost one more bright, inventive, educated youngster.</P>
    <P>However, in November last year a new law was passed in the United States making it an offence from June 1 of this year to give an illegal alien a job.  The American Government are taking their work very seriously indeed.  On May 1 the Immigration and Naturalisation Service opened 108 offices throughout the country to process applications for legal status from illegal aliens who have lived in the country for five years and are now eligible for legal status and, if they so desire, ultimately US citizenship.  From 1 June this year employers become liable for warnings and from next year for fines ranging from $250 to $10,000 if they are found to be employing illegal aliens. These penalties are designed to discourage illegal immigration by drying up job prospects.  They are also causing great confusion and distress to the Irish immigrant community in the United States.</P>
    <P>According to a report in <i>The Economist</i> of 21 March 1987, page 47, column 1:</P>
    <P>A New York state task force recently reported many cases of discrimination and threats of unjustified dismissal. Similar complaints are pouring into voluntary agencies.  The law provides <Col N="1121" /> for a special counsel to hear claims of unfair treatment and to provide redress more quickly and cheaply than the courts.</P>
    <P>However, the American Justice Department, which never really wanted special counsel, has yet to appoint one.  The New York task force argue that this default by the Federal Government has had an alarming effect.  One such effect may be to cost some of our citizens any chance of a hearing since the deadline for filing grievances is six months after the alleged offence.  The Immigration and Naturalisation Service created fresh controversy when they stated that the charge for the legalisation process is $185 for the individual and $420 for a family.  On this question of employing legal counsel it has come to my attention that unscrupulous US based lawyers are advertising for business among the Irish community at allegedly cheap prices and promising success. The Irish community would be well advised to avoid such rip off merchants and seek reputable legal opinion on their status before parting with their hard earned money.</P>
    <P>How does the new law affect the Irish citizen working illegally in the United States?  The law is retrospective and the amnesty applies only to those illegal immigrants who entered the United States prior to 1982.  According to the most recent figures for immigration from Ireland, the trickle became a flood only since 1982.  Consequently the vast majority of young Irish illegals in the United States are not eligible for amnesty under the new law.  The situation is now acute.  Since 1 June the employer must demand proof of the right to work, the elusive green card, on pain of fine.</P>
    <P>The Immigration and Naturalisation Service in America sent warning letters to nine million employers and dispatched 900 armed investigators to examine personnel files in thousands of work places, mainly in Los Angeles, Chicago and New York where half of the alleged illegals are living and certainly where the vast majority of Irish immigrants are living. Although the law states that nobody can <Col N="1122" /> be deported on the basis of a rejected application &mdash; this process can take some time and, indeed, could be used by those who are prepared to be asked eventually to leave &mdash; those found to be working illegally can be pushed out, can be deported.  Interestingly, raids on work places by the Immigration and Naturalisation Service will not be on a random basis but based on inside information.</P>
    <P>According to some surveys I have seen, most informing is done within the same ethnic group, for example, Mexicans on Mexicans, Filipinos on Filipinos and, dare I suggest it, sadly, the Irish on the Irish, especially the older Irish generation who seem to be finding it difficult to come to terms with the large influx of brash, confident, educated Irish into their traditional work and living ghettos.  This type of informing on one's own springs from a fear among the settled legal community that the new illegals are poaching or threatening their jobs.  Indeed, scholarly research would seem to support this view. Mr. George Borjas of the University of California found that, although an increase in the immigrant workforce has only a small effect on the wages of the native worker, resident foreigners can be badly affected.  To quote one example, a 10 per cent increase in Hispanic immigration into the United States produced a 14 per cent drop in the wages of legal Hispanics working in the same locality.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the difficulties facing Irish illegals in the United States is that some companies rely on alien workers and do not employ legal workers.  The reasons are simple and can be summed up in three words: money, money, money. These firms are saving a third of their wages bill by not paying social security contributions or overtime and by not paying withholding taxes or, as we know it in this country, PAYE.  Indeed, I have been informed that this type of company, sometimes owned, sadly, by fellow Irishmen and women, withhold all Government taxes, allowing their unfortunate exploited workforce to delude themselves into thinking they are somehow on the road to legality.  The argument goes: &ldquo;If this guy is stopping my taxes and social <Col N="1123" /> security contribution, Uncle Sam must not mind my being here.  Otherwise he would not take my money, would he?&rdquo; Sadly that money is being taken, but Uncle Sam is not seeing any of it.  Unfortunately this type of exploitation will not be ended by the recent laws.  With over nine million employers and only 900 agents to investigate, they can certainly get away with it for a little while longer.</P>
    <P>However, I wish to restate the Government's commitment to secure legal status for these unfortunate people and I am very pleased that that is the case.  They are our people and because of lack of employment opportunities at home, or because their friends were leaving and they decided to leave with them, they are now in need of our help.  In that context, while no surveys have been carried out I would be very interested to know how many of the people who are now in America and, indeed, in England and other parts, are there because they could not find work at home or because there was no hope for them at home.  This country has an investment that is currently paying its dividends not in Ireland but in America, Britain, the Continent of Europe and, indeed, wherever there are young Irish immigrants.  We have a moral obligation not to desert them.</P>
    <P>My own experience of emigration &mdash; I too took the emigrant ship in my teens &mdash; is that such involuntary departure from the land of your birth, away from familiar places and the strong bonds of family that are so much part of Irish life, the manner of such a departure breeds a certain cynicism and bitterness towards those who are left behind, especially those who are leaders in society, politicians, clergy, industrialists.  It is past time that we in this House said to our separated brethern scattered in the four corners of the world that we are sorry we have let them down, that we could not find work for them, that they had to go if they had to go. Sorrow is not enough.  We need all young people back, the flowering talent of our nation, and towards that end the economic programme embarked on by Fianna Fáil, which has had the tacit support of <Col N="1124" /> all sides of the political divide in recent weeks, will perhaps result in a return of at least some of our wild geese.</P>
    <P>In this new Ireland of rising employment and general economic wellbeing the question is: will they want to return? Only if we as a nation, and through the nation's representatives in this House, come to their aid especially in America. Fianna Fáil promised in their election manifesto and subsequent to taking Government that they will use every diplomatic and political means available to us &mdash; that is, to the Government &mdash; to secure legal status for all these young people.  We wish to mobilise Irish American opinion through all the relevant organisations to bring the maximum political pressure to bear on Congress and the White House.  Towards this end I welcome the setting up of an umbrella group representative of Irish immigrant organisations in New York recently and on a personal level I pledge tham all my help.</P>
    <P>This question of illegal status can only be changed by political action and it can be changed.  The American system of Government is open to lobbying, and effective lobbying.  It is only through such lobbying that change will come.  I applaud the efforts of Congressman Brian Donnelly, who did so much to alleviate the problems of many Irish people earlier this year with the introduction of what have become known as the Donnelly visas. While I felt a certain sadness at the sight of so many of our people in a sense degrading themselves and trying so many desperately different ways to obtain a visa in order to leave Ireland, I am not so naive as to ignore the reality that for so many emigration has been the only option.</P>
    <P>Congressman Donnelly is now attempting a further onslaught on the complex US immigration laws.  Last month in the United States House of Representatives Congressman Donnelly introduced a Bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act, 1965, by providing for a seventh preference category for the admission of natives of countries adversely affected by the enactment <Col N="1125" /> of the immigration laws in 1965.  Indeed, it is in 1965 that much of what has been happening in recent months first started. At that time, for reasons that I have not yet been able to establish, there was no lobbying of the American Government when the immigration laws first excluded Ireland which, up to that time, had received preference.</P>
    <P>In seeking the creation of this seventh preference category Congressman Donnelly's amendment, if passed, would result in an extra 27,000 visas per year. He states that Ireland would receive an extra 5,000 visas per year over and above those granted under the first six preferences. It is a small step in the right direction and one that all Irish American political lobbying groups should get behind.  It strikes me as astonishing that a country with over 40 million claiming Irish origins, where several Presidents, including the present one, have Irish origins, a country that was built by the sweat and toil of so many Irish people has enshrined in its laws an exclusion of Irish immigrants.</P>
    <P>The extra 27,000 visas sought by Congressman Donnelly is 10 per cent of the total number of non-preference visas available to 36 European and other countries. Compare that figure &mdash; here I am talking to the American Government, in a sense, rather than to our own &mdash; with the estimated three million illegal immigrants currently in the United States and still coming in at the rate of 200,000 per year on the most conservative estimates. Most of these unfortunate people are unskilled, semi-literate and undereducated and, in most cases, eventually end up on welfare, a burden on the US Government.  Compare that with the credentials of our young citizens and one wonders at the shortsightedness of the Administration.  Perhaps we should be pleased.</P>
    <P>I stated earlier that political lobbying would ease the position for our people. Already there are reports that political pressure from the El Salvador Government may result in an exemption for them &mdash; an exemption clause is being written into the new anti-illegal immigrant laws, <Col N="1126" /> the reason being that they have got more clout perhaps on Capitol Hill than the Irish have.</P>
    <P>I thought long and hard before I considered putting this motion initially before our party and then before this House.  As I stated at the outset, even the word &ldquo;emigration&rdquo; is very emotive. As someone who has left this country and lived outside of it for several years, perhaps I have a certain empathy with our separated brethren.  That is not to say that, in framing this motion and in debating it, I am in any way attempting to encourage emigration, far from it.  As I stated in the course of my contribution and as I wish to emphasise again, I believe we have a moral obligation to our people abroad.  Some leave voluntarily; there are others who leave involuntarily.  Some leave because of peer group pressure, because their friends are leaving, particularly in rural parts of Ireland, and they wish to go abroad.  Young people have a sense of adventure.  I left, not involuntarily. I left voluntarily, and I know many of my contemporaries did.  I came back, as indeed many of my contemporaries have done, but I believe that in putting this motion before the House we are signalling to our people in America, to the people who ultimately, we hope, will return here, that we have not forgotten them and that in their hour of need we have been prepared to stand four square with them and to help them to alleviate a problem which has now, as I said earlier, reached acute proportions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  I am delighted to get the opportunity to speak briefly on the motion.  I agree with the sentiments expressed by the previous speaker.  Like him I had the opportunity to leave this country and go to the United States legally some years ago.  With the quota system at the time, 5,000 unskilled people were legally entitled to get visas to work in the United States.  The problem has gone from bad to worse, because 5,000 unskilled people can no longer get the opportunity to seek work in the United States &mdash; even 5,000 skilled people cannot get the opportunity to <Col N="1127" /> work in the United States.  People might think that this is a very small problem, but I can assure this House that it is a huge problem and it is a very serious problem.  It is one of which I have first hand experience, because after my ten years living in the United States and having returned home my eldest daughter is now living in the United States with the other 100,000 illegal immigrants.  I visited the United States last February and I had the opportunity to have discussions with the United Irish Counties and with various important people in New York city like John Kerry O'Donnell, who controls the football pitch there and provides games for the Irish.  I had seen attendances there diminishing from 10,000 to as low as 300 or 400 in the seventies.  As Senator Mooney said, the crowds attending those games now are back up again to 8,000 and 10,000 and, instead of the seven or eight teams he was speaking about in San Francisco, there are up to 50 or 60 football teams in New York city.  Yet in some parts of Kerry and the west of Ireland there are no teams at all.</P>
      <P>I also had a series of discussions with Monsignor Barry and I was delighted to hear this week that the clergy in New York city are dealing with the medical aspect of these young people who have no insurance whatsoever, who have no medical attention whatsoever, who are walking in a wilderness.  At least they have now made a commitment that, if any of these young Irish illegal immigrants in the New York city area, where most of the illegal immigrants are based, become ill, they will provide medical attention for them until something is done to legalise these young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem is vast.  As a public representative, I have had numerous people coming to me, parents of young people going to the United States looking for visas and looking for work.  They think it is like going to Dublin or to London, where you have some type of institutions to safeguard these people.  That is not the situation in a large city like New York.  If a youngster gets off a plane a taxi driver <Col N="1128" /> may put him in a taxi cab and he may never again be seen.  When I returned from my last visit to the United States I pleaded with the Government, that was the last Government, to set up some type of information service at the major airports in the United States to try at least to get some type of temporary accommodation for these young people, because they think they can walk into a B &amp; B in a very large city.  We have an organisation there that could held in the interim, that is, Bord Fáilte.  There are sufficient administrative staff in New York city and in the United States at the moment from the various Departments and somebody could at least be at the airports to meet young people and advise them of their rights and where they could go for perhaps a short term.  Some type of accommodation should be made available for young people until they get straightened out.</P>
    <P>I was also glad to hear this week that the 1 July deadline has now been extended to 1 October to try to do something about these people.  It is giving us an extra few months to see if something can be done.  I know many of these young people go to the United States to better themselves because we cannot provide the jobs here at home and we have to face up to reality.  If we cannot provide the jobs here at home the least we can do is to try to provide some kind of work or shelter for them where 40 million of our people are living.  I have been quite critical here of some of the US Senators who claim to have Irish connections such as &ldquo;Tip&rdquo; O'Neill and Kennedy and so on. They are very Irish when it comes to election time when they want to attract the votes of 40 million Irish people living in the States; but when our young people, our emigrants, are today looking for some kind of recognition in order to be made legal, they are burying their heads in the sand.  I would like to congratulate the one Senator who did something for those people.  I know there are young people in New York city and other cities in the United States marrying people they never met in their lives to try to stay in the United States.  They are marrying <Col N="1129" /> people of all creeds, in registry offices and so on at the cost of $1,000 or $2,000. They put the $1,000 in their hand, give them a kiss on the cheek and they are gone.  They can then stay legally in the US, but I think that is very degrading for these people.</P>
    <P>One would have to welcome the extension of the 1 July deadline to 1 October for the employers who take on these illegal immigrants. There are many employers in the United States whom I know personally who are more than willing to give work to these people and who are more than willing to advise them where they can get work and where they can get good jobs.  The jobs are there for them in the financial market and in Wall Street where I worked for a number of years.  I know it is eagerly looking for young, articulate Irish immigrants who could be legalised in the United States and they are prevented from hiring these people for vast sums of money.  Vast sums of money, in the region of £25,000 and £30,000 per year, are offered.  If something could be done to legalise those young people, I am quite sure the experience that they would gain over the years would be of benefit to this country in the future and more than likely help to stop the rot of emigration.</P>
    <P>I have met personally and I know the American Ambassador to Ireland, Margaret Heckler, quite well and I have discussed this with her on numerous occasions.  I know she is trying to do her best from her end of it.  It is just not good enough and I do not think enough pressure is being put on to legalise our own young people.  Even though we have got a breathing space, the situation will burst at the seams in October.  These young people will be out on the streets because the employers will be scared stiff to take on what they know is an illegal immigrant.  Up to now they worked with social security numbers and phony social security cards but from 1 October photographs of these young people will have to be printed one every social security card which means that the number will have to match the face; they will have to <Col N="1130" /> be identified in that way.  That will change the whole trend which is in operation at the moment because the young people will then be working in a black economy and all sort of things can happen in a situation like that.  The scare is on at the moment and I have it at first hand that there are people working for half the wages they would be entitled to if they were legal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I will start because the Minister's absence will not make a lot of difference to my speech.  I agree with the points which have been raised so far.  I welcome the fact that this motion is before us tonight and thank those people who have placed it on the Order Paper for us.  It comes at a very appropriate time, both in the calendar year and also in the political timetable. As we know, at this moment thousands of young Irish people are considering emigration as an option.  Many of those who are presently completing their leaving certificate or even more sadly completing their intermediate certificate, see no option for them but emigration.  They are just waiting for the exams to finish and then they will go on their merry way. There has been quite an amount of talk over the past couple of years about this problem in the political arena and many of the people who were extremely vocal about it are now in Government and in a position to do something about it.  I am sure we all hope they will act appropriately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of emigration is nothing new to the Irish people.  Down through the years the Irish race with their love of travel and adventure spread throughout the world, sometimes as missionaries, in <Col N="1131" /> odd cases as revolutionaries, but frequently in search of work, as so many are today.  Since the great famine, up to and during the Civil War and right up to the fifties, with a slight drop off during the sixties, and again today this search for work has continued unabated.  Those in search of employment made up the greatest proportion of emigrants.  The result of so many people leaving our country down through the years can be seen in almost any country in which one travels today in the high proportion of Irish immigrants.  In particular this it true of the US which we are discussing here tonight.  No country knows more about or has benefited more from Irish emigration than the US.</P>
    <P>The positive effect of Irish emigration in the United States is not something which can be felt every St. Patrick's Day when one sees thousands of people marching; it is not just measured in the dominance of Irish political figures in United States politics down through the years; the place where it has probably made its major impact is in the business life of the United States where many of the Irish people who travelled abroad in search of a fortune have found it.  Some of them have set up in big business, or industry and their adopted country has benefited very much from that.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder, as a result of all that, that so many today still consider emigration to the United States as an option. The lure of the dollar, the fact that far away hills always seem greener and also the fact that almost every person in this country has relations abroad, make it a very easy, perhaps even a too easy option for those who have no work here and find it relatively easy nowadays to travel to the United States.  Almost invariably they have somebody to meet them and they think everything will be fine once they get there.  That does not work automatically and many of them end up in dreadful difficulty.  I am unfortunate enough to live in an age when once again emigration has risen dramatically and is seen as a solution to much of the unemployment which exists today.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1132" /> It is not only to the United States that they go.  I was in London recently on a Mallow-London reunion trip and I met more of my former schoolmates in London that I would have met in Mallow any day of the week.  That helps to concentrate the mind on the fact that emigration has become such a problem and that we will have to do something about it.  Taking into account the record of Irish people's loyalty, commitment and service to the United States down the years, I do not think there is anything very inappropriate in asking the United States authorities to do something for people we feel have been discriminated against &mdash; perhaps the US Government would look at it differently.</P>
    <P>These people did not enter the United States to cause any trouble or difficulties; they entered it to seek a livelihood which they could not find at home.  In most cases they found work and, while they are not working legally, they have contributed their fair share to the United States economy, particularly in the construction line.</P>
    <P>The reputation of Irish workers abroad is often higher than that of Irish workers at home.  Many of these immigrants have very little difficulty in finding work, particularly in the more manual or construction areas.</P>
    <P>It must be said that the illegal position of these workers did not worry their employers very much because many employers saw a chance to make the maximum gain out of minimum wage levels and with a minimum of red tape. Whether we like it or not, the facts prove that many people who found work illegally were encouraged by unscrupulous employers to bring along others who would work in similar conditions.  The employers saw a certain advantage there. They had an easy-fire-and-easy-hire option and took advantage of people who were desperate for work.  The employers benefited from this type of immigration and only wished it would continue.</P>
    <P>This legislation is designed to put an end to all that.  I do not think it will.  Here in Ireland, perhaps on a far smaller scale, people find very little difficulty in working in the black economy.  Admittedly US <Col N="1133" /> resources will be used at a much greater level to try to stop this happening there.  I do not think they will be totally successful because, once an advantage exists for employers in many of the big building projects to use illegal immigrants, they will be very likely to do so.</P>
    <P>When people who go to the United States and find work find themselves with very high wages and perhaps two or three jobs and few ways of spending the money, the wealth that comes to them suddenly makes them think the land of the free is the God-sent answer to all their problems. We must worry, not about what is happening when things are going well but about what happens when things go wrong.  Many people can be involved in industrial accidents and they are left with absolutely nothing.  A worker may have a job illegally for a year or two and suddenly one morning he or she is fired with no entitlements, no social welfare, nowhere to go, nothing to do.  Such people must be our major concern here tonight.  They are unable to apply for any State assistance or State services whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Many of these people are well qualified for positions in Ireland, perhaps in teaching or nursing.  They go to the United States; they over stay their welcome &mdash; if you wish to call it that.  At present I am told there are up 5,000 teaching vacancies in New York and many of these Irish illegal immigrants would be more than qualified to fill the vacancies but, unfortunately, they cannot even apply for them because of their illegal status.  It is the same in the health care area.  Vacancies exist for which many of the people at present in the United States could apply and with the experience of the employers with other Irish workers they would probably get the jobs but, unfortunately, because of their illegal status they can do nothing.  If they come back they are stuck: they cannot even apply for the jobs from Ireland.</P>
    <P>One question we must ask ourselves is why any United States Government, whether now or in the years ahead, should concern themselves too much about Irish people abroad and why they <Col N="1134" /> should try to solve some of our problems. The dedication shown by Irish people to the American system, the US State down through the years in times of peace and also perhaps in times of war, and the support which the Irish people as a whole have given to the American way of life, are not in themselves reason enough for the American Government today to say: &ldquo;Ireland has a special case; we will have to do something for them.&rdquo;  Ninety-five per cent of those we are discussing are at present working in jobs in the United States.  They are making their own contribution to the economy there.  If a loophole is created to allow them at long last to become legal immigrants we are not asking very much.  We are not asking for another job to be created for them and we are not taking a job from somebody else.  All we are seeking is to make their position legal and at least allow them to continue their work on behalf of the American economy in a legal way and let them know that if things go wrong for them there will be some safety net.</P>
    <P>This motion in itself is extremely important but the most important aspect of it perhaps is why all these people had to emigrate.  As I said earlier, this is nothing new.  It has been there since the foundation of the State and for years and years before that.  The problem has become so grave over the past three or four years that it will have to be given special consideration. You hear about how emigration was solved in the glorious sixties but the opportunity to solve it was there and the industrial revolution had not taken place in Ireland.  Once that industrial revolution started, for five or six years you were bound to have an automatic spin-off which would create jobs in numbers not known before and would certainly allow people the option of staying at home.  Regardless of what Government action is taken now, we cannot hope to create jobs at the same speed or level as we did then.  Obviously, we must begin to look for other solutions.</P>
    <P>Education is something we must consider. It is a pity that people who have been educated in this State at enormous cost to the taxpayer find they have no <Col N="1135" /> alternative but to leave our shores.  It is far better that any emigrant should be well educated and prepared to get on in life rather them he just educated at the lowest possible level and be almost doomed to failure before he goes.  At present expenditure on education in Ireland is extremely high by European standards and the standard of education, it must be noted, is very high.  It is no wonder that the United States authorities are so amenable to taking on Irish graduates when they wish to work in the United States.  We all know of people here who are so well qualified that they do not even have to apply for work; the work comes running at them and in many cases it comes from abroad; in many cases it comes from the United States.  In most cases people who go abroad stay for so many years and they improve their qualifications, increase their knowledge of life and come back and make a worthwhile contribution to the Irish economy.  If we did not reduce the numbers in education at third level in particular but increase them and reduce the unit costs of every person educated in this country then those who have to go abroad at least would be better fitted for employment than many of those who are abroad now and would return some time in the future and our whole economy would benefit.</P>
    <P>Obviously a motion like this discussed in the Irish Seanad tonight will not create shock waves in the United States Congress but we must take advantage of a particularly appropriate time &mdash; the United States Presidential election process which is only beginning now and will be going on for quite a while.  We must use the good offices of everybody here and everybody at Government level to lobby all the Irish political interests.  They are more than willing to listen now when they see votes on offer.  It is only a small number of people we are asking about and if we approach the matter in the right way &mdash; even the political sense is not always the right sense &mdash; and in whatever way will work, we will be doing a good deed for our emigrants.  We must show solidarity with them at this trying time <Col N="1136" /> for them and I hope this motion tonight will begin that process.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike Senator Mooney and Senator Kiely I did not have the occasion to emigrate. I was lucky enough not to have to emigrate but members of my family and, indeed, relations and friends from all areas had to take the plane or the emigrant ship.  I am very glad to have the opportunity to speak on this motion this evening.  I doubt that there is anybody in this House or outside of it who has not some association in one way or another with emigrants from Ireland living throughout the world.  We are dealing in particular here this evening with emigrants to the United States.  It is extremely important, as Senator Mooney said, that while acknowledging the efforts being made by the Government in relation to the immigration laws in the United States, we should show our support for our fellow citizens who are in the unfortunate position that they have to seek employment in the US.  Could I correct an impression that may be given in relation to teams mentioned in the various parts of the United States?  I got the impression that it was only football teams that were increasing in the United States.  In actual fact there are many hurling teams there also.  I would like to point out that emigration is taking place <Col N="1137" /> from hurling counties as well as from footballing counties.</P>
    <P>The difficulty at the moment in relation to the emigration laws in the United States arose from the Landmark Emigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. This Bill was passed after many years of deliberation in Congress and intense lobbying from emigration experts, employer interests and advocates for aliens who are anticipating an amnesty. The outcome of that massive document is that there is a tiny provision allowing for an additional 10,000 non-preference visas.  That document subsumed the original Bill, as was mentioned by Senator Mooney in relation to Congressman Donnelly. The provision is for 5,000 a year for the years 1987 and 1988, that is, for the 36 countries.  Very little provision is made for those individuals who, through no fault of their own, are unable to claim one of the narrowly defined existing preference categories.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the Bill in the United States caused consternation in this country, as, indeed, it did in many other countries.  The NP5 programme, as it is now called, resulted in thousands of inquiries from this country and, I understand, 100,000 written requests for one of the 10,000 non-preference visas to be granted during the years 1987 and 1988. The method of selection for the non-preference visas is a mere lottery.  In order to apply for one of the visas a person had to fulfil the following requirements: (a) he had to apply through the post; and (b) only mail received between January 21 and January 27 1987 was processed. Mail received before or after those dates was not considered.  Envelopes received beginning 21 January were registered in strict chronological order on a first-come-first-served basis.  One, I presume, would have a better chance of winning the famous lottery that Gay Byrne has on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; every so often than being successful in getting an application for one of those visas.</P>
    <P>It is very unsatisfactory.  I acknowledge that the Government are deeply concerned about the position of illegal Irish immigrants and the fact that these people <Col N="1138" /> have absolutely no standing and are open to all sorts of abuses.  I readily accept the concern of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to improve the position of those people who now find themselves in this sad situation.  I ask the Minister to use all contacts in the US Administration and Congress who have expressed their willingness to help.  The illegal immigrants have no rights under US law and it is extremely important that they get legal status and be entitled to some rights as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Earlier, Senators referred to people applying for jobs and also to graduates. There is a connection in the fact that in January and February each year, multinationals from all countries and particularly from the United States come to lobby our top graduates for jobs in the United States.  They wine and dine them. It is accepted throughout the world that they are the best qualified graduates. That is why so much importance is attached to them.  The sad fact is that we have quite a number of very well educated people who, through no fault of their own, are unable to gain employment in this country.</P>
    <P>It has always struck me that if you speak to emigrants who return on holiday or visits from London or from America, no matter what their conditions are abroad, they always give a very glowing account of the conditions under which they work.  They are very slow to admit they have to accept conditions they would in no way accept if they were at home. They paint this beautiful picture of far away hills being green.  They give the impression to people at home that the thing to do if they cannot get a job at home is to take the ship or the plane and get to America or wherever and they will be fixed up with a job immediately.  That attitude and frame of mind is open to all sorts of abuses.</P>
    <P>Only last week in my own area at home I was looking for a certain person and I was told that he had emigrated to the United States.  I found that out of a family of 13, 12 had emigrated to the United States and every one of the 12 was there illegally.  It is very sad when a whole <Col N="1139" /> family is absolutely depleted in that way, trying to exist with an illegal status in the United States.  We have a tremendous responsibility and we must give a commitment to those people that there is a voice at home trying to meet their needs and instil into the authorities in the United States the urgency of doing something about the illegal status of those people and making provision for them so that they can live there without fear.  One of the things in relation to emigrants to the United States is this idea of fear.  You have unscrupulous employers who take them on and get them to do absolutely menial tasks of all descriptions under the threat of being reported to the authorities if they do not accept the conditions offered, and we are talking about people who are very well educated.</P>
    <P>It is only fair and right at this stage to compliment Congressman Brian J. Donnelly who introduced a second draft Bill dealing with the problem and which, if enacted, would increase the number of immigrant visas available to Irish citizens. It is of extreme importance that we hold out the possibility of legal immigration to people who now see their only hope as an illegal entry.  The United States has always been a beacon of hope to many generations.  It has prided itself on being a nation built by succeeding generations of immigrants who have constantly enriched the nation with their strong commitment to the ideas of freedom, democracy and opportunity in the new land.</P>
    <P>I was very disappointed and angry listening to a special &ldquo;Pat Kenny Programme&rdquo; recently which was recorded from New York.  Every participant in that programme was very forceful in condemnation of certain Irish-American politicians, Senators who not alone failed to support the original Donnelly Bill but, in fact, worked against it.  The very same American politicians very conveniently use their Irish ancestry at election time and when it suits.  These are people who have always been regarded as friends of Ireland and champions of the Irish cause in America.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1140" /> The US has been a powerful attraction to this country and the attraction will continue in the future.  We must ensure that our emigrants are treated as we would expect them to be treated.  I urge the Minister and the Government to pursue this cause with all the means at their disposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will go to the Government backbenches the next time round.  Senator Mooney is to be congratulated on raising a matter of great public concern which has been echoed by other Senators, and which we all share. A negligible percentage of my own constituency is probably to be found among the illegal immigrants.  They comprise in many cases our own friends and relatives. During a term I spent in Boston in 1985 I could observe for myself the way in which they congregated in that city and the way in which our consular staff looked after them as best they could in an admirable fashion.</P>
      <P>We all share the concern of Senator Mooney but, at the same time, there are sober realities to be considered.  We would delude ourselves if we thought it was simply a matter of putting pressure on the United States Government or on &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; Senators and Congressmen.  We should not overrate our clout or our influence in this matter and we should not overrate the willingness of Americans in general, and of Irish Americans in particular, to help us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1141" /> Let me put some of this debate in context. First of all, immigration patterns into the United States are totally changing in the latter part of this century.  As Senator Mooney implied, the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act was an important turning point and since 1965 Irish immigration has fallen by 78 per cent.  We must face the reality that the age of North European immigration into the United States is over.  The age of English speaking immigration into the United States is over.  We are in a different historical setting and we have a miserable 500 Irish visas issued annually compared to 20,000 visas issued to nations like Mexico and the Phillipines. We had what Senator Mooney admitted was an inglorious scramble for the 10,000 Donnelly visas which was a reflection on the kind of society and politics that have characterised this State since its inception.</P>
    <P>The inscription on the Statue of Liberty, which is lately to be read again after its restoration, still applies.  America, for all the faults we find with it in the field of foreign policy and in certain actions of the State Department in respect of Central America, still has a great vision.  The Statue of Liberty still welcomes the &ldquo;wretched refuse of your teeming shores&rdquo; and the &ldquo;huddled masses yearning to breathe free.&rdquo;  But they are different wretched refugees now and different huddled masses.  We have had our day.  It is now the turn of the Asians and the Mexicans.</P>
    <P>Asians account now for 46 per cent of all immigrants at the moment.  Half of the State of California is Spanish speaking and the people who pour in from Asia particularly are victims of economic misery and of political terror.  They are the &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; of the late 20th century.  It is they who deserve the pity and the generosity of Americans far more than our people.  We have to face these facts. They are much more in need.  They are in the same measure of need as our people were in the period from 1845 to 1849. Just as we deserved American generosity and American opportunity in the 19th century, so they now deserve it.</P>
    <P>Americans do not owe us anything in <Col N="1142" /> spite of what has been said here that because we made a contribution to the building of the United States somehow they owe us a living.  They do not.  We have had our whack out of that country. We are having our whack out of that country.  Our settled and established emigrants, people of Irish extraction who have made it to the top have been rewarded by the contribution to the building of America.  I draw your attention, a Chathaoirligh, to the Harvard-<i>Irish Times</i> debate which was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 13 March.  In that debate the Harvard team who opposed our visiting <i>Irish Times</i> team, won the debate by a unanimous decision of the judges for the first time in the history of these debates.  One of the reasons they won the debate was not so much their ability but, as well as their ability, the convincing subject matter of what they had to say. They made the case that the United States did not owe Irish emigrants a living any longer.</P>
    <P>Let us remember that we are Europeans of which we have been frequently reminded at public expense through newspaper advertisements and otherwise in the last several months.  We are Europeans. Our place is in Europe, in the embryonic united states of Europe.  There are some politicians who very honestly tell us that that is where we should be emigrating and that is where we should be preparing our young people to go. Very quickly the Americans will say to us: &ldquo;You are Europeans.  Go there.  Exert your pressure on the West Germans and on Brussels to get a good deal for your emigrants.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The historic mission of the United States has been &mdash; and what makes it unique in world history is &mdash; its function of welcoming new contributions to the melting pot.  We have made that contribution; others now have to make it. Young Americans are not particularly eager to see our young people coming and therefore competing with them for jobs.  As Senator Mooney pointed out &mdash; and it is a very good point &mdash; older Irish immigrants, the settled immigrants of the previous decades, are not too happy to <Col N="1143" /> see our young people coming out and competing with them for jobs.  That generation of the fifties particularly, people who are now in their middle to late fifties, are a very bitter generation indeed.  They blame this country and they blame the system which made them emigrate and they are in no mood to co-operate with any new generation coming out to America.</P>
    <P>Several Senators have expressed disappointment with the attitude of the big Irish-American political names and their attitude in this matter of immigration, the fact that the O'Neills and the Kennedys and so on have not pulled their weight in this matter in helping our emigrants. But this simply bears out the point I am making.  It is not worth their while politically anymore, even at election times.  It is extremely doubtful if there is now any real, worthwhile, ethnic, political Irish constituency, apart from one or two areas perhaps.  They will beat the IRA drum from time to time.  That suits them all right, but where the economy is concerned and where there are other competing constituents concerned, Asians, Mexicans and so on in the sprawling city of New York, that is where the vote lies.  They are the people who are the citizens of the future and that is where the politicians' interests are as well.</P>
    <P>We have to be realistic about another point.  A number of times the figure of 40 million Americans of Irish descent was raised as if there are 40 million Americans out there who are simply impatient to help us in every way.  That, of course, is a myth.  Doctor Denis Clarke of Philadelphia is, perhaps, the single most distinguished authority on the history of the Irish in America, not simply alone the history of the Irish in Philadelphia.  He has written several books, the latest, called <i>Hibernia-America.</i>  He maintains &mdash; and it is not just an opinion; it is a very serious statement backed by his own research &mdash; that of this legendary 40,000,000 Americans, perhaps there are 2,000,000 Americans who in any real sense are committed to Ireland and to Irish causes, who have real cultural or <Col N="1144" /> family links with this country.  That figure of 40,000,000 Americans is largely a myth.  Of course, they surface at certain times of the year but I think we would be making a great mistake if we depended upon them to in some way put pressure on their politicians to help our young people in America.</P>
    <P>Many Americans &mdash; and I come back to the interesting Harvard debate reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 13 March which I recommend to Senators &mdash; feel they have no responsibility to this country, but they feel they have a very profound responsibility to many other countries, countries where perhaps they have performed not very creditably and where they are anxious to make amends. They are anxious to make amends to a certain part of Asia, the Boat People, Central America and so on.  They feel a political responsibility to these people.</P>
    <P>I wish Senator Mooney's motion well. Of course, I support him and if the Minister puts the message through to the Government and the Government, in turn, put pressure on the American Government, then, of course, obviously I will welcome it and I support it, but I have my doubts that this is going to be all effective.  The fact is that we have failed these young people.  In 1932 when Eamon de Valera came to power he said with all the confidence of a golden age dawning: &ldquo;our young people like our cattle will no longer be brought up for export.&rdquo;  A golden phrase, a Chathaoirligh. It perished on his lips almost as soon as it was uttered.  What we are talking about this evening is an indictment of the party who have been in power in this State for two thirds of our independent history, but wider still an indictment of our whole society and of our approach to social and economic policy.</P>

      <P>Mar dhuine as an Ghaeltacht cuirim fáilte roimh an rún seo a chuir an Seanadóir Mooney os ár gcomhair.  Tá na deacrachtaí céanna sa Ghaeltacht agus atá sa chuid eile den tír agus caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil na deacrachtaí sin níos measa mar bhí ar chuid mhaith de mhuintir na Gaeltachta <Col N="1145" /> dul thar sáile mar ní bhfuaireamar an seans sna hamanta atá caite obair a chur ar fáil go dtí gur bunaíodh Ranna éagsúla Stáit le scór bliain anuas.  Bhí ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta dul go Meiriceá agus go Sasana, níos mó go Meiriceá i dtús an chéid, mar na daoine a chuaigh go Meiriceá ag an am sin d'fhanadar ann agus níor tháinig cuid mhaith acu ar ais go dtí le fíor ghairid, daoine a d'fhan leathchéad bliain nó trí scór bliain ann.  Cuid eile chuaigh siad go Sasana agus de bharr go bhfuil cumarsáid agus taisteal níos éascaí le roinnt bliain anuas, bhí siad ábalta teacht abhaile.</P>
      <P>Tá go leor cainte déanta faoin rún seo maidir leis an cúnamh atá le fáil ó na hÉireannaigh a bhain a muintir leis an tír seo abair trí scór bliain ó shin.  Deirimse nár thug an Seanadóir Ted Kennedy ná Tipp O'Neill ná a leithéidí mórán cúnaimh do na hÉireannaigh fanacht ansin, go mór mhór na daoine a chuaigh ann a sé nó a seacht de bhlianta ó shin.</P>
      <P>Dúirt an Seanadóir Ó Murchú go mbíonn go leor de na daoine seo sásta cúnamh a thabhairt nuair a bhuailtear an druma atá ag an IRA.  Chonaic mé féin é sin ag tarlú le mo dhá shúil féin nuair a thug mé cuairt ar na Stáit Aontaithe.  Bhí mé ann ocht n-uaire le deich mbliana anuas, agus tá mé ag ceapadh gur is mó daoine as mo bhaile féin a chonaic mé ansin ar maidin Domhnaigh ag an Aifreann nó thíos ag an mBlarney Stone i Dorchester nó b'fhéidir sna tithe tabhairne timpeall an cheantair sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rud amháin ba mhaith liom a lua, cuma céard a tharlós nó céard a dhéanfar faoin dlí nua seo atá leagtha amach ag an Uachtarán Reagan, gabhann na daoine óga anall i gcónaí agus oibríonn siad go mí-dhleathach mar is dóigh liom nach bhfuil mórán rogha acu ach a leithéid a dhéanamh mar gheall ar na hamanta crua eacnamaíochta atá againn.  Tá a fhios agam in mo cheantar féin d'imigh fiú is baill go léir de chumann peile le sé bliana.  Chuaigh go leor acu anall agus bhí siad ag obair go mí-dhleathach agus ní raibh ceart ar bith acu; tá a fhios agam go ndeacaigh daoine ag obair agus níor fiú is íocadh iad ag deireadh na seachtaine. Tá a fhios againn faoi dhaoine a <Col N="1146" /> gortaíodh agus ní raibh aon phingean acu ach ag faire ar déirce ó chairde a bhí sna Stáit Aontaithe rompu leis an ospuidéal a íoc, nó cuireadh cuid acu abhaile tar éis tréimhse gearr.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom níos mó cumarsáide a fheiceáil leis na daoine sa Ghaeltacht go mór mhór thall i Meiriceá, mar tá mé ag ceapadh an chuid is mó acu atá ann gurb í an Ghaeilge an teanga labhartha atá acu.  Nuair a labhair mé anseo an chéad lá sa Seanad nó an chéad uair a labhair mé ann, d'iarr mé go mba cheart iarracht a dhéanamh go mbeadh ceangail idir an baile agus Meiriceá agus fiú Sasana.  Is féidir é seo a dhéanamh trí Raidió na Gaeltachta a oscailt amach tríd an córas satailíte sa chaoi go gcloisfeadh muintir na hÉireann thall céard a bhí ag tarlú sa bhaile agus ar a laghad go mb'fhéidir go gcoinneoidís an teanga Ghaelach a bhí acu ón gcliabhán.</P>
    <P>Rinne na hÉireannaigh go leor oibre i Meiriceá, go mór mhór ag tús an chéid. Is iad a thóg na bóithre, na monarchana agus na tithe.  Rinne siad go leor oibre nach ndéanfadh an gnáth Mheiriceánach féin.  Anois nílimid ag teastáil ó na Meiriceánaigh, go mór mhór ón Uachtarán atá ann faoi láthair.  Deireann sé nach bhfuil na daoine óga seo ag teastáil, go mb'fhearr leo daoine ag teacht isteach as áiteacha eile, as an Ais, áit a bhfuil, b'fhéidir géarleanúint ar na daoine ann. Chuamar tríd sin ag tús an chéid seo agus tá mé ag ceapadh go bhfuil na daoine óga ag dul tríd an rud céanna i Meiriceá faoi láthair mar gheall ar go mbreathnaíonn siad nach bhfaighidh siad an ceart fanacht agus obair a dhéanamh ansin.</P>
    <P>Bhí brabach maith ag na Meiriceánaigh orainn agus níor mhaith liomsa nach ndéanfaí agóid, agus agóid láidir, ón Seanad seo ar son na ndaoine óga as an tír, leis an Uachtarán féin, agus bhí mé thar a bheith sásta leis an agóid a rinne an Taoiseach agus an Tánaiste ag iarraidh go dtiocfaí ar réiteach ceart ar an gceist seo.

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I congratulate Senator Mooney in his absence on bringing this motion before the House.  In <Col N="1147" /> present circumstances it is a very important motion and I ask the Minister to bring to bear whatever pressure the Irish Government can on major American politicians to achieve legal status for all the illegal Irish immigrants.  I had the experience of being an immigrant, thankfully legal, in New York for three years. I always found it a bit hypocritical to read in the local papers that Irish politicians would put pressure on the American Government to change the illegal status of immigrants to legal status.  They were only giving lip service to the problem. Politicians should make a genuine effort on our behalf to put pressure on the American Government.</P>
      <P>I fully appreciate Senator Mooney's sentiments on the motion.  We come from the same county where we see at first hand the gradual erosion of our young population.  Therefore, I should like to emphasise the importance of lobbying senior Irish-American politicians, and putting forward a plausible case for the many illegal Irish immigrants now residing in the USA.  I appeal to the Irish Government to make our case to the higher echelons of American politicians. some of whom are very Irish orientated when it comes to elections but who, unfortunately, forget their roots after the campaign.  I have had the experience of being in America during presidential and congressional campaigns.  It is amazing how Irish people become when seeking a vote.  I always remember my first St. Patrick's Day in New York.  I came out of a subway and saw a coloured man with an Aran sweater and a hat with &ldquo;Kiss me, I'm Irish&rdquo; written on it.  If there is a first black President he will be of Irish extraction too.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Murphy made some extremely valid points.  In general politicians talk about being Irish and coming from Irish backgrounds, but the Irish community have foundered in America and are not as strong an ethnic <Col N="1148" /> group as we were.  As Senator Murphy said, it is more politically advantageous for American Governments to look towards South America, China and such countries which are in greater need at this time.  Irish illegal immigrants are a very small minority if you consider the number of Mexicans and other South American people who enter America illegally.</P>
      <P>Immigration authorities would be inclined to turn a blind eye to the Irish illegal immigrants.  The unfortunate aspect is that if the young Irish people who are working &mdash; and most of them are &mdash; have an accident, health and hospital care is extremely expensive.  During my time over there I saw young people become terminally ill and dependent solely on the goodness of Irish communities to rally around and get the money to pay for the expensive hospitalisation charges.  This is one harrowing and sorrowful aspect of being in America illegally.  I can be contradicted on this point, but I heard on a radio programme that there were on-going discussions with the diocese of New York with the Irish Government to try to create some form of fund that would help illegal Irish immigrants who were in difficulty. Seemingly they came up with suggestions but they fell on deaf ears.  I am not blaming the Government.  A fund would be a much more beneficial way to try to help our illegal people in America rather than the Government trying to put pressure on the American Government to grant legal status to all the illegal immigrants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Emigration has changed.  It now seems to be the in-thing to do.  Many people go to America for the experience, say for one or two years, and then return home. It is not like in the fifties when people emigrated and never returned.  Those immigrants have a chip on their shoulder about this country and would find it difficult to help my generation as they consider we have been raised with a golden spoon.  Also they figure that when they emigrated it was a case of having to.  We are all aware that we will never have full employment and, because we have such a young population, we will have to lose <Col N="1149" /> many of them.  Senator Murphy touched on this point, maybe perhaps cynically.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has no right to make such an assumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I said &ldquo;maybe&rdquo;.  I withdraw the word.  He said we were Europeans now.  As we passed the Single European Act with a large majority we should look to Europe should emigration trends continue into the next couple of decades.  It would be more beneficial to the economy of the country.  We should think about educating our people towards that.  If young Irish people participate in the European Community what they earn will revolve in Europe and we should be able to gain some benefit from it.  Young people should be made aware of the type of work available in the European Community, rather than in America or another English speaking country.</P>
      <P>Irish immigrants in America are inclined to take jobs young Americans would not take unless they had nothing else to do.  They work as waitresses, bar tenders, and so on.  I did the same type of work very successfully for three years. Americans tend to look down on this type of employment.  There are opportunities in that sphere as well.  We could make the point to the American Government that basically the majority of immigrants are not taking jobs from their own people.  The jobs are there.  People want the work done.  Legal emigrants are not inclined to take these jobs if at all possible. It would be extremely beneficial, both to the economy of the United States and to the illegal immigrants, if they became legal because then they would not have to worry about such things as health care.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter concerns a problem in relation to the agreed regulations <Col N="1150" /> in respect of the free ports in the designated area in the Cork region of Ringaskiddy.  The free port was first mooted in 1983.  It was agreed, after discussions with the Government of the day and the task force which was set up by the Government in 1984 that it should be considered.  That Bill came before both Houses in 1985 and was finally passed in early 1986.</P>
      <P>A problem now arises about the regulations under the Bill.  The Free Port Bill provides for the designation of an area in Ringaskiddy, of 30 acres or 60 acres or whatever is needed on the day.  I understand that discussions have taken place between groups such as the Cork Harbour Commissioners and other private bodies who have an interest in setting up the free port in Cork.  Discussions have also taken place with departmental officials regarding regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, the Bill was passed in early 1986, we are now in the middle of 1987 and still no regulations have been agreed.  When you see that, you get a little annoyed.  I am not saying all this just because we were the first to push for a free port.  I will show the amount of money which has been spent by Governments over a ten year period in the Ringaskiddy area.  For instance, there was a water scheme from the Inniscara area in Cork to Ringaskiddy, which was carried out at a cost of about £77 million.  The IDA have purchased an area of over 1,000 acres there, and infrastructural facilities such as roads and a deep-water berth have been provided.  Enormous pressure was put on the Government of the day to provide this deep-water berth, which was built at a cost of almost £11 million.  In 1974-75 facilities were provided for the berthing of ferries.  At that time B &amp; I gave a commitment that this would be one of their main ferry ports, but unfortunately, that did not materialise. It was then agreed, because of the position in Cork, particularly in 1982-83, that we would look at the Ringaskiddy deep-water berth area, which was of vital importance and the port and docks area, <Col N="1151" /> and to do everything possible to get more shipping and trans-shipping into the Cork region.</P>
    <P>In pushing for a free port the emphasis must be on what it would mean to a region like Cork and Kerry.  It is over a year and a half since the Bill was passed and no regulations are forthcoming.  I realise that discussions have taken place with Departmental officials and the people involved regarding the setting up of the free port, but the information I have is that very few positive discussions have taken place between both bodies.</P>
    <P>We endeavoured to ensure that the first free deep water port in Ireland would be recognised as being totally free.  Many long arguments took place with the last Government about the type of conditions or regulations we might have.  They did not agree at first, for instance, that all products coming into the free zone area should be VAT free; but, after long arguments, this was eventually agreed to. They did not agree on customs charges in the free port area, but this too was agreed to.  We then asked if we could get a reduction in the 50 per cent capital gains tax on service areas.  That was not agreed to.  The reply from the previous Government &mdash; and I understand it also came from the Department since the change of Government &mdash; was that no consideration could be given to a reduction from 50 per cent to 10 per cent in the capital gains tax because such a concession had been implemented since 1949 in the Shannon area.  We recognise the enormous incentives that has meant for Shannon.  A lesson has been learned from that.  During the past six weeks also discussions have taken place with the Custom House Docks Development Authority in Dublin regarding the new facilities to be provided there.</P>
    <P>I understand that the same tax concessions apply in the six free ports in the British Isles &mdash; three are working very well &mdash; in other words, the reduction to 10 per cent tax on manufacturing and service industries.  It has now been agreed that the same 10 per cent, which was not allowed in the free port in Cork, will <Col N="1152" /> be allowed to the Custom House Docks Development Authority in Dublin.  That shows to me, and to everybody involved in the Cork-Kerry region, that true recognition is not being given to the free port in Cork.  Arguments have been made, in particular by the harbour authorities, that anybody setting up a service area in the free zone would not have the same benefits as those other free ports in the British Isles.  Therefore the incentive is not there.</P>
    <P>Following many discussions the Departmental officials over many months were not prepared to change in any circumstances. The facility which was denied to us has now been provided for the Custom House Docks Development Authority in Dublin &mdash; the financial institutions to be set up there would pay only 10 per cent on their gains.  I recognise what it means to the Dublin area, but the same facility should be provided in Cork. The impression is that everything in a free port area is free of customs or VAT charges until such time as it leaves the area.  We have a situation where the 10 per cent facility prevails in Shannon and it is now to prevail in Dublin.  Could I please have an explanation why the same agreement could not be reached in regard to the free port area in Cork?  Such a facility would mean that you could say to people setting up in the free zone area: &ldquo;If you are prepared to establish a service in this area your profits would not be taxed at the same rate as they would anywhere else&rdquo;.  We are not saying such people should get the benefit if they were trading with the country itself.  For instance, if service work is going on in the designated area and if the industrialist was exporting to Ireland itself, he would have to pay his relevant taxes.  There is no gain except when he is re-exporting. In other words, manufacturers in that area get all facilities free &mdash; no customs charges, no VAT charges.  Anything coming into that area from the mainland of Ireland would be VAT and duty free. That is to the benefit of the person who would be producing there.  The same prevails in the Dublin Port and Docks area and in the Shannon area.  I am not saying <Col N="1153" /> that the Shannon area and the Dublin Port and Docks area should not have it. What I am saying is that if the same facility prevails in the Cork-Kerry region it would have enormous advantages.</P>
    <P>Semi-State bodies &mdash; for instance, the Cork Harbour Commissioners &mdash; always make the point to the public representatives of the Cork region that they are not getting enough facilities.  After a year and a half of no regulations coming forward the situation in Cork is quite serious.  We are not committed to saying that the regulations are forthcoming.  My understanding is that they are not even nearly ready.  Is there any real commitment to saying that they do recognise the free port area?  Has anybody any idea of how busy the Liverpool free port area is?  Has anybody any idea of the amount of work that has been created as a result? Perhaps I could give an example of what it would mean if the free port area was speedily developed in the Cork region.</P>
    <P>We have a once off allocation of £500,000 by the Government for the new ferry service in Cork.  If there was a free port area in Cork people coming in by ferry, whether from the Continent or Britain, could purchase in the free zoned area.  It would be the same as in Shannon, except that this would be a docks area. People who go to other countries because of the facilities available there could visit the Cork-Kerry region because of the Cork free port facility.  That cannot happen without proper conditions and proper regulations.  The process is so slow that I cannot understand it.  For instance, Departmental officials in early 1986 got a comment from the Minister of the day that we would see certain regulations would be made no later than July or August of last year.  That is ten months ago, but the situation has not changed.</P>
    <P>The people of Cork and Kerry, and especially the southern region of Cork, put great emphasis on what the free port will mean to the region.  We argue for proper infrastructure.  We argue whether particular work should or should not continue. An argument is being made as to whether extra money should be allocated for road construction to the Ringaskiddy <Col N="1154" /> region and whether extra money should be allocated for the building of tunnels at a cost of £50 million to £60 million.  I question seriously whether this should be a priority at this time when all you are looking at in the Ringaskiddy area is a bird sanctuary.  Nothing is happening there.</P>
    <P>Somebody must take responsibility for the amount of investment over the years. I see no reason why the making of the regulations cannot be speeded up.  I see no reason why this area should not get the same type of tax concessions as elsewhere. I see no reason why an explanation is not being given as to why regulations are not forthcoming.  Is there a problem with the people setting up the Ringaskiddy free port area?  Is there a problem with the Cork Harbour Commissioners and the private sector getting together for the running of the free port? I have no objection to the private sector becoming involved because this should be of great benefit.  Money invested by the private and public sectors can be of enormous advantage.</P>
    <P>With respect to the Government and previous Governments, we can become a laughing stock over this matter.  I make no apologies for saying that I was one of the first to moot this project in 1983, it was pushed by the task force set up by the Government in 1984, agreed in 1985, and yet two years later nothing has happened. That is very slow progress.  When we agreed in 1983 to consider the establishment of a free port, Britain had not even considered the idea.  But now they have six free ports on their west coast, reaping the benefit of heavy shipping in the western hemisphere.  They have now established what we outlined in 1983. Britain had not considered the idea of free ports in 1983 and yet they have already set up free ports and are making money, particularly in Liverpool.</P>
    <P>The benefits of a free port to Ireland would be enormous.  Imagine building a deep-water berth for shipping amounting to 75,000 tons.  It was never heard of before in the south-west region.  Tonnage would be redistributed to the European area at no cost to the shipper.  What I <Col N="1155" /> mean by a free port is that one could trans-ship from one area to other areas. The amount of work involved for the Cork-Kerry region would be enormous. It would also mean that people who would otherwise by-pass this country would holiday here.  If there was a free zone here area liners would stop so that people could make purchases.  But the way we are going now everybody else will get the benefit, particularly Britain, who were 12 months behind us with this idea. It went through the House of Commons sometime in late 1984 and they are already operating.  Why can our regulations not be speeded up?</P>
    <P>I fail to understand why the discussions and arguments go on between Departmental officials and people who have an interest in the free port on the type of operation it should be.  For instance, no agreement was reached for two months on whether or not there would be VAT at point of entry.  How can it be said that goods would not be allowed into a free zone unless VAT was paid at point of entry, that is provided it is going into the mainland?  In other words, if one wanted to bring 1,000 televisions into the free zone area the Government of the day, which was the last Government, had decided that VAT should be paid at point of entry.  That completely eliminates the free port concept.  If one were to bring in 1,000 television sets and take out 100 in one week, one would have to pay for the 100 leaving the free zone area.  It took two months to reach agreement with the Departmental officials on that matter. That is ridiculous.  At the end of the day they could see what it meant and they agreed.  Departmental officials can say that tax concessions have been agreed in Shannon, and understand that the same tax concessions are being agreed in the Dublin region.  I have no objection to that because it creates more work and more services for our people, and jobs are very important.  But in Cork this is very important, too.  Finally, we have 1,000 acres of IDA land which have cost the taxpayers a lot of money.  It is now a <Col N="1156" /> bird sanctuary and serves no purpose. That is totally irresponsible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to what has been said by Senator Cregan.  I wish to comment in relation to the free port at Ringaskiddy. At the outset I should like to say that, in the comparatively short time since the new Department of the Marine was set up, I have been reviewing the various ongoing activities with a view to assessing them and establishing priorities.  One of the more important priorities is the question of establishing a free port at Ringaskiddy and it is very high on our priority list.  This is an entirely new departure as far as sea ports in the State are concerned. The Senator referred to the other free ports.  This is a major departure as it is the first sea port and there will be many others throughout the country looking with interest at Ringaskiddy.  I sincerely hope it will be the success all of us would like to see.  It would open up a new prospect for many other ports in the country. I hope it is much more successful than many of the free ports in the UK which have not been the success that was expected.  That will not relieve us of our anxiety to ensure that this will be a success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I found in my short time in the Department that a great deal of preparatory work has been done and that the proposal is, in fact, very well advanced.  It is not, of course, a simple matter.  I will take this opportunity to outline exactly what is involved.  The Free Ports Act was passed in March 1986 and is an enabling measure to permit the establishment of free ports generally in the State, but with the specific purpose of facilitating the setting up of the free port at Ringaskiddy.  A number of orders and regulations have to be made before a free port can be established.  First, there is the commencement order made by me to bring the Act into operation; second, an order made by me, with the consent of the Ministers for Finance and Industry and Commerce, to establish the free port and define its boundaries; third, an order <Col N="1157" /> made by me, with the consent of the Ministers for Finance and Industry and Commerce, designating the person or persons to control and manage the free port.  There is the regulation to be made by the Minister for Finance providing for the necessary customs control in relation to the free port and regulation under the VAT Acts, referred to by the Senator, made by the Revenue Commissioners with the approval of the Minister for Finance to give effect to the concessions with regard to value-added tax for the free ports.  Finally, there is a provision enabling me, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to make regulations for the control and management of a free port.</P>
    <P>The Senator referred to delays and one would have got the impression, if we did not have the facts, that everything was ready to roll after March 1986.  I remind the Senator that the first package which was put to the Cork Harbour Commissioners was rejected in October 1986 and, indeed, we only reached final agreement with them in early 1987.  After these difficult and protracted negotiations, the Cork Harbour Commissioners, in January 1987, accepted a package of tax concessions which is to be made available at the proposed free port at Ringaskiddy. The harbour commissioners rejected the original package in October 1986.  The package accepted contained a further concession whereby VAT at the point of entry would not apply to goods coming into the free port and that VAT would become payable under the normal system only when goods were transferred from the free port to the rest of the State.</P>
    <P>Initially it had been intended that only 30 acres of land owned by the harbour commissioners would be included within the free port, and consultation had taken place on that basis.  However, at the end of January 1987 the harbour commissioners asked that all land owned by the IDA &mdash; some 1,000 acres &mdash; should be included.  The Cork Harbour Commissioners also at this time propose that they should be appointed as sole managers, whereas previously it was intended <Col N="1158" /> that a consortium which included the harbour commissioners should be managers. Many of these problems which resulted in the delay were completely outside the control of my Department or, indeed, any of the other Departments.  All these changes necessitated further consultation.</P>
    <P>I am aware that we have reached the stage when progress with the making of the necessary orders and regulations, some of which have been drafted, can be resumed.  The Senator will appreciate that the changes which I have referred to caused these delays, and we must accept that.  They were not the result of delays in any of the Departments.  The first step is to make the commencement order to bring the Act into operation so that the customs control, which I referred to, and the VAT regulations can be brought into effect.  My intention is to address the question of making the order in the very near future.  I understand that the customs control and VAT regulations could be made within a very short time after that order is made.  I will decide on the limits of the free port and the management issue as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Senator referred to the question of the 10 per cent in relation to the service industries.  As I said at the outset, this is the first free port in the country and it is the intention that there will be a concentration on manufacturing industry.  At that time the Minister for Finance could not agree to the advantage to service industries.  The Senator referred to B &amp; I and said they were not being supported. I should like to put it on record that the Government have given £500,000 this year by way of subsidy to the new Cork-Swansea ferry service.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the information is that free ports in the UK have not been the success that was expected.  However, this will not deter us from making every effort to ensure that this free port is a success and, if it is a success, it will open up a new era as far as many other ports throughout this country are concerned. Of course, we must wait and see the outcome and the success of Ringaskiddy. I hope the establishment of the free port <Col N="1159" /> at Ringaskiddy will attract industry to the area and generate traffic for the new State financed deep-water berth, that it will alleviate the very serious unemployment problem which we have in Cork and that industrialists will be attracted to set up <Col N="1160" /> industry in the Ringaskiddy area.  This would alleviate the serious problem which we have in the southern region.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 18 June 1987.</P>
