      <P>I have notice from Senator Paschal Mooney that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to clarify the position in relation to the British Nationality Act, 1981, in view of the widespread concern expressed by Irish citizens resident in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Patrick Kennedy of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The abolition of An Foras Forbartha.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Paul Bradford of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to ensure the continuation and development of Mallow General Hospital's acute facilities and to insist that the necessary level of funding is provided to it.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Brian O'Shea of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to rescind his decision to abolish the local health advisory committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="144" /> I also received notice from Senator Joe Doyle of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The urgent need for the Minister for the Environment to make financial assistance to facilitate the introduction of smoke free zones under the Air Pollution Act in view of the very serious deterioration of air quality in Dublin City.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Maurice Manning of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The urgent crisis facing Irish Lights including the loss of over 100 jobs and the close down of lighthouses.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Mooney, Kennedy, Bradford, O'Shea, Doyle and Manning as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Mooney's motion for this evening and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Kennedy, Bradford, O'Shea, Doyle and Manning may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Items Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7.  The Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill will start when the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Bill, 1987, is concluded.  We will continue with the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill to 1.30 p.m.  We will take the Science and Technology Bill at 1.30 p.m. and go back to the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill on the conclusion of the Science and Technology Bill and the other items ordered.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House when it is proposed to take the Fisheries (No. 2) Bill, 1987, what business he envisages the House taking tomorrow and when will the House rise for the Christmas recess?  Also on the Order of Business, on a different matter, four weeks ago this House came together in eloquent grief over the tragedy in Enniskillen.  Last night in Derry a 70 year old man was bombed into eternity and innocent children were <Col N="145" /> maimed.  It is appropriate that this House should express our sympathy with the families of those who were killed or maimed last night and our condemnation of this atrocity from whatever source it came.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with Senator Manning in expressing sympathy to the relatives of those involved in that atrocity in Derry last night.  This is one more time that we have to rise and express our grief to those who were stricken by the scourge that has gone on in that part of the country.  I do not know if an expression of any kind is a contribution to the situation.  It is very hard for this House, the other House, or any parliament, to contribute anything other than to implement the law as far as we can and to restrict the activities of those who are involved in this kind of action. It is a dastardly act to have committed in Ireland on the eve of Christmas.  I do not know what the answer is but I certainly would like to see the House sending their sympathy to the relatives of the dead and wounded.</P>

      <P>The Independent group would also like to be associated with the remarks that have just been made about the latest atrocity in the North.  We have become almost desensitised and anaesthesised against this type of atrocity which happens so regularly. We should, at least, say that this kind of activity is against everything that all Members of this House believe in.  It is anti-socialist; it is anti-republican; it stands for nothing; and it is against everything that we hold dear and sacred.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if the Companies (No. 2) Bill and the Insurance Bill are not being taken before Christmas, could we at least ask at this point to have a copy of the proposed Government amendments, at least as far as they have got.  We do not want to be faced with a raft of amendments to be discussed at a half a day, a day or two day's notice.  It would be useful to have them early so that we could discuss them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="146" /> On Item No. 7, I would like to have that motion ordered to be taken today.  I raise this point because I want a guarantee that it will be taken.  Is it intended to take it at 6.30 p.m. or when is it intended to take it?  I make this point because we expected it to be taken yesterday.  The Independent group want it to be taken today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to join with my colleagues in expressing sympathy for last night's further atrocity in the North and to identify with the bereaved and the wounded.  On this occasion although one life was lost it could have been a lot worse because this bomb went off without warning. We have to start asking ourselves the question: when will it ever end, or are the people who perpetrate this kind of violence listening to anybody who represents people on either side of the Border?  It is a tragedy that our country is being torn with strife of this nature. We dealt with it last night in another part of the world.  This is happening on our own doorstep and it is appropriate that we should condemn it outright.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to the Order of Business as outlined by the Leader of the House.  He indicated that Item No. 1 will be the Report and Final Stages of the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Bill. He listed the Second Stage of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill to be interrupted at 1.30 p.m. to take the Science and Technology Bill which he then indicated would be completed on all Stages.  I hope the Leader of the House is not indicating that all sections of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill will be taken today, that at least there will be a break between Second Stage and Committee Stage tomorrow morning.</P>

      <P>On the issue of what happened in Derry, everything that needs to be said has been said.  Can I ask the Leader of the House if he will privately or publicly let me know why the Adoption Bill is taking so long to come to Committee Stage?  I know there are certain constitutional overtones but they will not go away by virtue of the fact that the <Col N="147" /> Adoption Bill is indefinitely delayed.  It is not a complex or a long Bill.  It is complex because of its constitutional implications. It is not complex in itself.  I am intrigued and frustrated by the apparent sitting on this Bill by the Government for the past number of months.  We discussed it before the summer hoping that we would have amendments after summer. It is an important Bill.  It affects up to 3,000 children in the country.</P>

I would like the Leader to explain to me whether he has any idea when it will be taken and why it is being delayed, and if he has an idea, would he share it with us, or would he remind those who are responsible for this Bill that our patience is running out.</P>

      <P>I have a question for the Leader of the House.  It is the third time we have asked if he has a report for the House on the establishment of the Committee on Co-operation with Developing Countries and the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs which would deal with such matters. I have raised the question today because every day we learn from the media of famine spreading in Ethiopia, Mozambique and Angola.  In 1985 the then Committee on Co-operation with Developing Countries did an awful lot in awakening this country to the problem of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should like to be associated with the vote of sympathy to the people in the North.  We have being passing those votes of sympathy in our local authorities for many years now and it is sad that the situation seems to be getting worse instead of better.  Indeed, a humble person like me would like to make a special appeal &mdash; I know, unless they listen to appeals, they will not listen to anything else &mdash; to all the paramilitaries and all the people of violence &ldquo;for Gods sake for the days of Christmas at least do not bring any more sadness or disruption to families in this country.&rdquo;  On a brighter note I would like to congratulate Deputy Nealon on the very good books he has out.  It is very good coverage.</P>

      <P>A number of questions have been asked.  Regarding the Social Welfare Bill, at this stage it is intended that we take all Stages of that Bill today. The Whips can meet later on to discuss what length of break there can be between the Second and the following Stages.  Unfortunately, the reason we have to break off discussion on that Bill at 1.30 p.m. is that the Minister is in the other House at Question Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fisheries Bill will be in the House tomorrow.  The Dublin Transport Authority Bill and the Appropriations Bill will also be coming in tomorrow and there is a motion on finance tomorrow.  On the Appropriations Bill we will have a short number of contributions and the main body of discussion can take place in the New Year.  With regard to Senator Connor's query about the Committee on Co-operation with Developing Countries, we <Col N="149" /> will try to get that report before the House as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it was about debating a report.  There really has not been any movement to set up that committee. I will bring the request to the notice of the Government.  On the question of the Companies and Insurance Bills and amendments which are already drafted, I will go to the Government and request that we get those as soon as possible. On the Adoption Bill again we will take that when the Government send it back to us.  I will bring Senator Brendan Ryan's remarks to the attention of the Minister.</P>
      <P>Like the other Members I, too, would like to join in the expressions of sympathy to the families in Derry on the latest atrocity.  As has been said in this House, one would often wonder whether a motion such as this can carry any weight. Nevertheless I think we have to continually remind ourselves and other people that we do not agree in any way with the perpetrators of atrocities from whatever source they come.  It is particularly difficult for families.  Christmas should be a time of joy and of coming together of families.  Here we have a situation where year after year these atrocities occur and people are left in hopeless situations.  The expressions of sympathy from this House might be of use to the families but I do not think asking murderers and committers of this type of atrocity to stop will be heard by them, however I join with the other Members in our expression of sympathy.</P>

      <P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil.  In accordance with Standing Order 82, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the Question that the Bill be received for final consideration, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil and this is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad.  The only matter, therefore, that may be discussed is the amendments made by the Dáil. For the convenience of Senators I have arranged for the printing and circulation to them of those amendments.  Members are aware, they may speak only once on the question.  I had legislation like this yesterday and there was confusion.  I hope what I have just said now is understood by Senators who will participate.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senators are aware, the overall purpose of this Bill is to strengthen the administration of competition and consumer protection policy. The post of examiner of restrictive practices is being abolished and his functions are being transferred to the new Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade and the Fair Trade Commission.  A significant measure in the Bill is the inclusion for the first time within the scope of competition legislation of such areas as banking, electricity and communications, a move which is consistent with the changing trends in competition legislation internationally. In addition, the powers of the Restrictive Practices Commission are being strengthened to allow the commission <Col N="151" /> to exercise their functions on their own initiative.</P>
      <P>The Bill which was initiated in this House was subsequently amended in the Dáil and so it is now necessary to consider these amendments.  A total of four amendments have been made and I would like to explain them to Senators and ask them to support the Bill as amended.</P>
      <P>The first amendment is designed to increase the accountability of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the Oireachtas in relation to the making of restrictive practices orders.  Section 8 of the 1972 Restrictive Practices Act deals with the making of restrictive practices orders by the Minister on the basis of a report of the Fair Trade Commission. Under the existing legislation, and this will still be the case when the Bill is passed, the commission, in a report to the Minister, may recommend the making of an order and if the Minister decides to make an order, he must, as soon as possible after he has received the report, lay before each House of the Oireachtas a statement giving the reasons for his decision.  The intention of this amendment is to impose a time limit on the Minister by requiring him to make a statement to the Oireachtas if he has not made an order, as recommended by the commission, within one year of receipt of the commission's report.</P>
      <P>In general, when the Minister has published a restrictive practices report which made recommendations which the Minister was empowered to enforce, the recommendations of the commission have been pursued without undue delay. There is, however, merit in making the Minister accountable to the Dáil and Seanad in the event that he has not made an Order within a reasonable period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second amendment passed by the Dáil also relates to reports of the Fair Trade Commission.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that commission reports will be published by the Minister as soon as possible after he receives them. Under section 18 of the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, the Minister is required <Col N="152" /> to lay a copy of a report made by the Restrictive Practices Commission before the Houses of the Oireachtas but no time limit is specified.  The effect of this amendment is to impose a deadline of four months within which the Minister must lay a report before the Houses.</P>
    <P>In practice, reports are generally published within three months of their receipt from the commission.  There can, however, be practical problems, particularly in relation to printing.  When a report is received from the commission the Minister has to have the report printed and he may also have to consult with other Departments or interested parties about the commission's recommendations before he can evaluate the recommendations and assess their impact.  I feel, therefore, that a deadline of four months is reasonable.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the third amendment. This amendment relates to consumer protection legislation, the Consumer Information Act, 1978, and the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, in particular, and is designed to increase the efficiency of the operation of the legislation by speeding up the procedure for the making of orders under those Acts.  The current procedure for making orders requires that the Minister must lay a draft of the order before both the Dáil and the Seanad and a resolution approving the draft must be passed by each House before the order can take effect. The purpose of this amendment is to introduce a more rapid procedure, one which is to be found frequently in legislation, whereby the order would first be made by the Minister and would then be laid before both Houses and would have immediate effect unless annulled by resolution of either House.</P>
    <P>The requirement that both the Dáil and the Seanad positively approve orders being made under these Acts has proved to be rather cumbersome and has led to long delays in the making of orders.  The most recent such order, relating to consumer credit, was finally approved by the Oireachtas earlier this month, over thirteen months after it was first laid before both Houses.  The present amendment <Col N="153" /> will speed up the process of enacting legislation and, at the same time, will give Deputies and Senators, a chance to propose a motion to annul the provisions of an order if they feel that this is necessary.</P>
    <P>The most recent order they refer to is the APR, which we could well have done with having in operation especially coming up to Christmas time to make interest rates more transparent to consumers and to the general public.  Unfortunately it lay around both Houses &mdash; I cannot say that about the Seanad &mdash; but it had extreme difficulty in the Dáil in getting to the stage where it was passed into legislation and as such 13 months delay ensued.  This is the new procedure to make it law from the day it is signed and if any Member of each House wants to put down an annulling motion he can do so.</P>
    <P>The final amendment to the Bill relates to the inspection of bank accounts by the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade and the Fair Trade Commission. The section will require the director and the commission to apply to the High Court for an order if, in the course of the exercise of their functions, they consider it necessary to examine any individual bank accounts.</P>
    <P>This amendment is a consumer protection measure.  It arose primarily as a result of the inclusion of banks for the first time under the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, and the Consumer Information Act, 1978.  Senators may be aware that both the director and the commission have considerable powers of inspection under competition and consumer protection legislation.  This amendment will ensure the continued confidentiality of a person's bank account by providing that the director or the commission cannot examine any individual bank account without having first obtained an order of the High Court authorising them to do so.  The High Court may only grant such an order if it is satisfied that it is reasonable to do so and that the exigencies of the common good so warrant.</P>
    <P>The provision will apply not only to banks but to all financial institutions <Col N="154" /> within the meaning of the Central Banks Act, 1971.  Thus, financial institutions such as building societies, post office savings banks and the Agricultural Credit Corporation will also be covered.  This is in connection with the new power taken in the Bill to allow the examiner to examine bank charges, their validity and if they are fair and reasonable to the consumer. There was an outside possibility that confidentiality of personal bank accounts might be infringed.  This amendment is really tightening up that situation.</P>
    <P>I trust that Senators will agree that these amendments have strengthened the Bill and I recommend the Bill, as amended, to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay the Minister very long.  On behalf of the Fine Gael Party I would like to welcome the amendments to the House.  It is the third time that we have had a discussion on the Restrictive Practices Bill.  These amendment will copperfasten it more.  I particularly welcome amendment No. 3. In regard to legislation everything is so cumbersome and slow and it is farcical that something to do with interest rates should take 13 months to go through the Oireachtas.  It is a very good amendment. I welcome also amendment No. 4 which has to do with confidentiality of bank statements and bank accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is coincidental that when the APR order was discussed we also had divisions in the other House. Nevertheless we had a detailed discussion. I welcome these amendments.  It will certainly strengthen the Bill.  I particularly welcome the order dealing with putting orders into legislation without undue delay because the procedure has been cumbersome in the past and, as the Minister says, one particular order took 18 months to be finally enacted.  Finally, on the last amendment, I also welcome the fact that the confidentiality of a person's bank account will be respected.  I am very pleased to welcome these amendments.</P>

      <Col N="155" /> Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Question, &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass&rdquo; put and agreed to.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill, 1987:" RHead="Second Stage">
    <Title>Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill, 1987: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset of my speech I would like to outline briefly the main items which are provided for in this Bill. Essentially there are three main elements in the Bill, measures to counteract employer fraud and abuse; changes in contribution conditions and entitlement and trade dispute provisions.</P>
      <P>First, the Bill will extend and improve in a significant way the powers to pursue employers who themselves are abusing the system or are colluding in social welfare abuse by their employees.  We have made significant progress in tackling abuse this year and the new powers I am seeking will close loopholes in the existing legislation.  Sections 2 to 7 of the Bill contain these measures.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the Bill gives effect to measures which were announced at the time of publication of the 1988 Estimates.  These mainly involve adjustments in the conditions for payments for long term disability and in the old maternity allowance scheme.  They also include an improvement for disabled old age pensioners in exempting the mobility allowance from the means test.  These measures are contained in sections 8 to 11 of the Bill, the second part of section 16 and in section 18.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirdly, the Bill amends the existing conditions for entitlement to unemployment payments during trade disputes to provide that persons who may only be marginally involved in a trade dispute will not be disqualified for unemployment payments.  In future only persons who are actually participating in or are directly interested in the dispute will be disqualified for receiving unemployment benefit or assistance.  The Bill improves <Col N="156" /> the legislation underlying the Social Welfare Tribunal which I set up in 1981 to deal with certain cases where workers may have been, through no fault of their own, caught up in a trade dispute situation and disqualified from benefit and the employer has failed to observe the correct procedures.  The proposed amendment will give the tribunal the power, which it does not have at present, to review a decision in the light of new facts or evidence, if it considers this is warranted.  These provisions are included in sections 13 and 14.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections of the Bill contain a number of provisions designed to rationalise and improve other aspects of the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words about each of the three main aspects of the Bill. At the outset I want to say something about the very important and topical issue of social welfare fraud and abuse.</P>
    <P>The total expenditure in the social welfare area in the current year is over £2.6 billion, the equivalent of £7 million for each day of the year.  Each month, almost three million payment transactions are made.  The number of persons in receipt of unemployment payments each week is in the region of 230,000, 73,000 persons receive disability benefit payments, 238,000 persons receive old age or retirement pensions and almost 100,000 receive widow's pensions.</P>
    <P>There is a clear need for effective control measures in the social welfare area because of the massive amount of State funds that are involved.  At the same time it must equally be recognised that control measures must not be at the expense of speedy processing of claims and we must avoid any question of harassment of clients.  There are hundreds of thousands of claimants who are in real and genuine need of the services provided by the Department and who have a statutory entitlement to those services.  A balance must be kept between providing those families with a speedy, efficient, courteous and accessible service and ensuring that the service is not open to abuse.  The balance must be constantly adjusted in the light of changing needs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="157" /> The Government have decided that the intensive and active campaign against abuse of the unemployment and disability payment schemes will be maintained and increased efforts to detect abuse of other social welfare schemes will also be made. Much of the groundwork for this has already been laid through the strengthening and improvement of the investigation, control, review and audit activities across the various services of the Department including the provision of extra staff and use of sophisticated computer techniques.  Further action will be taken where necessary in the light of recommendations of the consultants who are advising the Department on the most cost-effective measures necessary to eliminate abuse of the system.</P>
    <P>I am committed to continuing this work to reduce abuse, to the greatest extent possible, and I am satisfied that this can be done without adversely affecting in any way the quality of service provided to legitimate claimants.  In fact it must be said that it is to the advantage of legitimate claimants that this be done as the elimination of fraud and abuse will serve to maximise the resources available to those genuinely in need.</P>
    <P>In this connection I was glad to be able to announce earlier this week that the alleviating payments being paid to those affected by the introduction of the new dependency arrangements in November 1986 which the Government have already extended to the end of 1987, are being further extended to the end of March next at a cost of around £5 million.  The eventual phasing out of these payments will be considered in the context of the budget.</P>
    <P>I would like at this point to give the House a brief resume of the methods I am using to combat abuse.  One of the most successful of these is the Department's external control unit.  This unit, which now has a complement of 19 staff, reviews claims to unemployment payments, usually by way of interviewing claimants.  Because of the very close liaison between this unit and other divisions of my Department, claimants are interviewed <Col N="158" /> where, in the light of specific information obtained, there is reason to believe that the person may not have a legitimate entitlement.  In this way, legitimate claimants are not affected and at the same time the activities of the unit are much more productive.  Of 8,329 claimants called for interview by this unit in the current year to review their entitlement to unemployment payments 1,255 ceased claiming, of which 915 did so voluntarily. The overall savings in 1987 arising from the activities of this unit are estimated at £2.7 million.</P>
    <P>There is also a special investigation unit within my Department assigned the specific task of the investigation of allegations of concurrent working and signing. This unit has been strengthened considerably in recent years and now consists of 42 staff.  Of 4,558 claims to unemployment payments investigated by the unit up to August of this year, 1,227 were disallowed.  The savings in 1987 arising from the overall activities of the special investigation unit are estimated at £4 million.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, there is the Department's internal audit unit.  This unit reviews on an ongoing basis the systems of internal control in the various branches of my Department so as to ensure that they are both adequate and functioning effectively. The internal audit unit has been significantly strengthened during the past year and has carried out a number of very successful examinations in different areas of the Department during that time. Where such reviews bring to light deficiencies, remedial action is taken.</P>
    <P>Another method of combating abuse of the system is through the use of computerised systems.  Through using computers it is possible not only to process claims more quickly and efficiently but also to integrate more effectively the information which is available in different parts of the system.  For example, it enables details on claims for unemployment and disability benefit to be cross checked with data on the child benefit system.</P>
    <P>During recent years there has been a massive and rapid programme of computerisation <Col N="159" /> within my Department which has given rise to significant benefits. In July this year I signed a contract for £2.6 million worth of additional computers for the Department, mainly for the employment exchanges.  At this stage the preparation and calculation of all unemployment assistance claims in the Dublin area is computerised.  This is a totally new development.</P>
    <P>Work is proceeding on unemployment benefit claims.  This will be completed by mid-1988.  At the same time computerisation is being extended to a number of centres outside Dublin, for example Cork, where unemployment assistance payments are now going on computer.  I see computerisation in the years ahead as being absolutely essential in our efforts to achieve a more efficient and cost-effective service.  In particular I am anxious to bring about a much greater degree of localisation of services so that services are delivered to the people in a more effective manner.  It is my intention to have a telecommunications network linking all the Department's local offices over the next four years.  This ongoing programme of computerisation will also facilitate the cross checking of applicants for all schemes administered by my Department.</P>
    <P>Computerisation has also brought about considerable benefits in the disability benefit scheme.  In particular the computerisation of the medical referral system has allowed greater selectivity in the referral of claimants to medical referees. In addition to the improved efficiency achieved through the computerisation of the system, the number of medical referees has been increased from 18 to 22.  Of 88,000 claimants referred to a medical referee this year, 19,000 were found to be capable of work and 3,000 ceased to claim benefit.  A further 19,000 persons failed to attend for examination and except in a small number of cases where there was good reason for their failure to attend, they were liable to a nine week disqualification and a second referral.</P>
    <P>These control measures have helped to <Col N="160" /> bring about a significant reduction in the number of people claiming disability benefit this year.  The numbers claiming each week have in fact gone down from almost 82,000 early in the year &mdash; February &mdash; to 72,500 in December, a drop of over 9,000 a week.  There has been a saving of around £8 million on disability payments this year.</P>
    <P>I would also like to mention the appointment of a firm of international consultants to examine the whole range of controls within the social welfare system.  Further measures in the campaign against abuse of the system will be taken in the light of the final report of the consultants.  The consultants have highlighted a number of policy issues which need to be addressed and have made specific recommendations relating to organisation and procedural matters. Work on a detailed plan on foot of the consultants' findings has already commenced and the services of the consultants are being availed of in this work.</P>
    <P>Finally, in this connection one of the main weapons available in this fight against abuse is prosecution of offenders. My Department will be following a vigorous programme of pursuit of fraud cases through their prosecution.  In the case of disability benefit for instance, 125 cases have already been referred to the Chief State Solicitor's Office for prosecution this year as against 37 in all of 1986.  Of the 45 cases finalised in court this year, there were 12 suspended prison sentences and 17 prison sentences in total.  In one case a sentence of 12 months was imposed and in the other case the sentences ranged from three to seven months.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House is particularly directed at fraud and abuse on the part of employers.  I am concerned to ensure that unscrupulous employers who abuse the social welfare system will be pursued through to prosecution with the same vigour as fraudulent claimants. I know that the majority of employers do not engage in such practices, but I also know that there are many who do, perhaps by facilitating fraudulent claiming of unemployment and disability benefit <Col N="161" /> payment by employees, even to the extent of providing transport for employees to the local employment exchange.  In other instances, employers refuse to co-operate with or they may even obstruct social welfare officers in carrying out their investigations, for example, by delaying the inspector's examination of records of employees and their social insurance contributions.  My Department already have powers to take prosecutions in cases of collusion or obstruction and there are existing penalties of fines up to £1,000 and/or 12 months imprisonment on summary conviction and fines up to £3,000 and/or two years imprisonment on conviction on indictment for employers who are found guilty of these offences.</P>
    <P>This Bill, as amended in Dáil Éireann, provides for fines up to £1,000 and/or up to 12 months imprisonment on summary conviction, and fines not exceeding £10,000 and/or up to three years imprisonment on conviction on indictment for employers found guilty of these offences.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem of employers who withhold or delay payment of PRSI contributions.  While the primary responsibility for the collection of contributions rests with the Revenue Commissioners, the inspectorate of my Department have an important role here also.  The investigation branch already carry out periodic surveys of employers' records so as to ensure compliance with the PRSI provisions.  In the current year to end-November underpayments by over 2,250 employers, totalling some £3.4 million have been detected and reported to the Revenue Commissioners. Recently also a joint inspection unit drawn from the Revenue and Social Welfare inspectorates was set up on a pilot basis to investigate enterprises which are known to have a high incidence of tax and social welfare fraud.  The pilot scheme is being evaluated at present to see how this type of joint action can be developed next year.  Furthermore, the ongoing programme of computerisation to which I have referred is of very significant benefit to the inspection branch in detecting instances of abuse and will be so to a <Col N="162" /> greater extent in the future.</P>
    <P>A number of areas have been identified, however, in which existing powers to pursue employers who abuse the system are inadequate and need to be strengthened.  Sections 2 to 7, inclusive, of this Bill are designed to meet these requirements.</P>
    <P>In many cases where an employee is found to be working and claiming benefit the employer and the employee collude to reduce substantially the period of over-claiming. For example, the working and claiming may have been going on for several years before it is detected but both parties may represent that the employment is only of recent origin.  In some instances, employers take on new employees on the specific understanding that the person concerned will continue to draw unemployment payments.  The employee gains or perhaps more correctly, the Exchequer loses, through the non-payment of tax and social insurance contributions while the employer benefits through payment of reduced wages and often undercuts his legitimate competitors as a result.  This has to stop. Section 2 of the Bill is designed to discourage such collusion by enabling the Minister to make regulations requiring employers to notify the Department of the commencement of employment for each new employee.</P>
    <P>As this provision is designed to counter the activities of unscrupulous employers every effort will be made in drafting the regulations to avoid placing any unnecessary burden on employers generally. For example, it is not envisaged that notification will be required in the case of employees changing employment where the employee produces the appropriate documentation provided by his previous employer.  The introduction of this requirement in the case of persons who, prior to taking up employment, were in receipt of unemployment payments will be an effective weapon in the elimination of collusion between employers and employees in fraudulently claiming unemployment payments.</P>
    <P>What I am trying to bring about is a situation where employers will satisfy <Col N="163" /> themselves when they take on additional employees that those employees are not at the same time claiming social welfare benefits.  Co-operation by employers is also necessary at the stage when employees claim benefits under the system.  The Department regularly ask employers to confirm details of periods of employment or absence from work through illness so as to verify claims to benefit or assistance.</P>
    <P>In the case of disability benefit claims for instance, random checks of this nature have proved to be extremely effective in the detection of abuse.  For example of 14,000 inquiries sent out to employers to check on persons claiming disability benefit 1,100 cases of possible abuse were revealed and overpayments of £460,000 have been detected to date. This year we have introduced a more effective system of following up these random checks by targeting particular industries.  For example, in one major recent fraud investigation where a claimant was in employment during the period in which he was claiming disability benefit, a check of other employees with the same employer established that 22 of them were also working and claiming. Following on this a check on two other employers in the same industry in the same region brought to light a further 155 cases of fraudulent claiming.  A number of successful prosecutions have already been taken and further court cases arising from these investigations are pending.</P>
    <P>Most employers co-operate with requests for information to facilitate these random checks and I wish to record my appreciation for the level of co-operation which exists.  However, some employers do not co-operate and sanctions are required against those employers who consistently fail to assist in these investigations.  Section 3 of the Bill provides for sanctions which can be applied in the case of employers who fail to assist in investigations of claims to insurance-based payments and section 4 provides for a similar measure in the case of claims for assistance.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of co-operation with <Col N="164" /> employers is in the area of inspection of employer records.  Under existing provisions, employers may be required to furnish such information and documents as may reasonably be required by a social welfare inspector for the purpose of investigation of claims.  Sometimes it happens that employers delay inspectors in their examination of the required records by claiming that they are held by accountants or solicitors, who, in turn may say that they only hold a portion of the records.  Section 5 is designed to counter evasive actions of this nature by imposing an obligation on employers to produce the required records at the employer's registered address or his principal place of business.</P>
    <P>The present legislation requires employers to keep records of various kinds in relation to their employees, in particular records of earning.  There is no provision in existing legislation, however, specifying the time at which these details should be recorded.  While most reputable employers make the necessary entries in their records at regular intervals, some employers fail to maintain any records at all, or perhaps do so long after the event.  Where this happens, it proves impossible to determine the true position in relation to such matters as the number of persons employed, the periods of employment, whether correct deductions of social insurance have been made and whether any other aspects of the social insurance scheme are being neglected or abused by the employer or any of his employees.  It also serves to prevent the detection of cases of employees who may also be concurrently signing for unemployment payments.  Failure to record the prescribed particulars on time can mean that if and when the records are eventually compiled they may not reflect the true position.  This can be done for a variety of reasons such as to thwart an inquiry, to lessen the employer's liability or to cloak irregularities either by the employer or his employees.  Section 6 is designed to overcome these problems by providing that details of earnings and the periods to which they refer must be <Col N="165" /> recorded at, or before, the time of payment of wages.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for an amendment so as to empower social welfare inspectors, for unemployment benefit purposes, to enter premises where self-employed persons are, or were, engaged in their occupations.  The existing provisions refer only to premises where records relating to persons in insurable employment are kept.  In recent years there has been a significant move towards contracting out work which up until now was performed by the employers own employees, for instance milk deliveries and the distribution of home fuels.  The powers contained in section 7 of the Bill are necessary to help counter abuses such as employees being represented as sub-contractors so as to avoid payment of social insurance provisions in respect of their employees, concurrent working and signing by sub-contractors and failure by sub-contractors to comply with the social insurance provisions in respect of their employees.  This amendment will bring the unemployment benefit provisions into line with those for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise that the additional powers which are being provided in this Bill are directed at unscrupulous employers and not at those who are running their business in an honest and legitimate way.  I value the operation of the system and I would appeal to those employers to maintain this level of co-operation in the future.  I want to appeal especially in this regard to those honest employers in industries and sectors in which abuse is known to be prevalent because only in this way will we together be able to root out abuse effectively.</P>
    <P>Before moving on to discuss the next part of the Bill, I would like to refer briefly to the level of penalties which are provided for in respect of the various offences which are involved.  We had in the other House a very full and worthwhile discussion of these measures and I accepted an amendment which was put forward in that House and which provided for the very substantial penalties which we now have, namely, on summary <Col N="166" /> conviction a fine of £1,000 or one year's imprisonment or both and on conviction on indictment a fine of up to £10,000 or three years imprisonment or both.</P>
    <P>There were very strong feelings expressed about the need to tackle fraud by employers and I think the level of penalties now provided for reflects the level of concern which exists on this point.  I might mention that these particular penalties are higher than those which apply under the existing legislation for other offences and in this regard I will be making the necessary arrangements at the first available oppurtunity to bring these other penalties into line with those now being provided for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The second main purpose for the Bill is to give effect to changes in social welfare schemes which were provided for in the Estimates.  Sections 8 and 9 of the Bill provide for changes in the contribution conditions for entitlement to certain insurance based benefits.  Section 8 provides that entitlement to extended duration of disability benefit, that is, beyond 12 months, for all new claimants from 4 January 1988 onwards, will require 260 paid contributions.  These contributions entitle the claimant to disability benefit for as long as he or she is incapable of work and is under pensionable age.  This benefit can continue for some long-term claimants for as long as 40 years.  Section 9 provides that entitlement to invalidity pension for new claimants after 4 January 1988 will also require 260 paid contributions. Under existing provisions, 208 paid contributions are required for both of these payments.</P>
    <P>These measures are designed to achieve more realistic contribution conditions for entitlement to these long-term payments by requiring that claimants have a reasonable history of paid contributions. The increased contributions for extended duration of disability benefit and invalidity pension will apply to new claimants only and the Government was conscious of the need to ensure that people who are already on long-term disability benefit would not be affected.  A number of changes in this area have been made in recent years and, in fact, the <Col N="167" /> provisions of sections 8 and 9 of the Bill were included in the 1987 budget proposals of the previous Government.</P>
    <P>A further change to the disability benefit scheme is contained in section 16 of the Bill which provides for the introduction of three &ldquo;waiting days&rdquo; from April 1988 onwards for clamants to disability benefit transferring directly from maternity allowance to disability benefit. All new claimants for disability benefit at present must serve three waiting days and this provision merely extends this requirement to cases where people transfer directly to disability benefit, having been in receipt of maternity allowance.</P>
    <P>A number of changes are being made to the old (general) scheme of maternity allowance.  There are two schemes of maternity allowance.  The old maternity allowance scheme, which was introduced under the National Insurance Act, 1911, provided for a payment to insured women for a period of twelve weeks subject to certain contribution conditions being met.  The second scheme, the maternity allowance scheme for women in employment was introduced by me as Minister for Social Welfare in April 1981.  This scheme which provides for a period of 14 weeks payment is available to women who are on maternity leave from work under the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act, 1981, and who are entitled to resume work with the same employer at the end of the period of maternity leave.  This scheme effectively superseded the old maternity scheme for women in employment.  In order to eliminate any confusion which may exist, I would emphasise that entitlements under the maternity allowance scheme for women in employment remain in full and are not affected in any way by the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that entitlement to maternity allowance under the old (general) maternity allowance scheme for new claims from 4 January 1988 will be restricted to claimants who have at least 13 paid contributions in the governing contribution year.  Under existing provisions, a claimant may qualify for the <Col N="168" /> allowance on the basis of only credited contributions in that year.  Section 10 also provides that from January next onwards, only contributions in the governing contribution year will be taken into account in determining eligibility for the allowance as is already the case with unemployment benefit and disability benefit entitlement.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the Bill provides for the abolition of entitlement to pay-related benefit in the case of all new claims for the old maternity allowance scheme which commence on or after 4 April 1988.  This will not affect the level of benefit payable under the new maternity allowance scheme.  Under that scheme, which as I have said, is now the new scheme of maternity protection for women in employment, provides benefit at the rate of 70 per cent of earnings, and effectively guarantees full replacement of net pay, with a minimum payment set at the relatively high level of £76 per week.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains a technical amendment relating to the maternity allowance scheme for women in employment. Under existing provisions the maximum amount of the allowance payable is equal to 70 per cent of the claimant's weekly earnings up to the earnings limit prescribed for pay-related benefit purposes, currently £11,000 per year. Interpretation of existing provisions has been questioned however and the purpose of section 12 is to clarify the definition of &ldquo;reckonable weekly earnings&rdquo; applied in the calculation of the allowance. I would emphasise however that this is a technical amendment which does not affect in any way entitlements under the maternity allowance scheme for women in employment.  The substantial changes in this area all relate to the old maternity allowance scheme and the fact is that the need for the old scheme has to a large extent been superseded by the introduction of the maternity allowance scheme for women in employment and I would expect that henceforth, the needs of women in this area will be met by this scheme.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the Bill provides for an <Col N="169" /> amendment to the trade dispute provisions, under which persons who have lost employment by reason of a stoppage of work, may be disqualified for receiving unemployment payments or supplementary welfare allowance.  Under existing provisions persons who do not stand to gain materially from a strike by fellow workers may be prevented from obtaining unemployment benefit or assistance and supplementary welfare allowance if they are, for example, members of the same grade or class of workers as those engaged in the dispute. Section 13 provides that persons will no longer be automatically disqualified from receiving unemployment payments or supplementary welfare allowance on such grounds.  The only circumstances in which the trade disputes disqualification will apply in future is where the person concerned is participating in or directly interested in the dispute.  I think this is a very worthwhile improvement in the system and I am sure that the House will welcome it.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Bill provides for an amendment of the powers of the Social Welfare Tribunal which I established in 1982 as a result of a number of disputes in which a large number of workers were refused unemployment payments and where the employers had acted unreasonably. I believe the establishment of this tribunal has proved of major benefit to workers in this sort of situation.  Representations have, however, been made to the effect that it can happen that, at the time the tribunal is sitting, which often occurs during the actual course of a stoppage, all the detailed facts and information surrounding the dispute may not be readily to hand.  In these circumstances it is felt that the tribunal should have power to review its decision. This amendment is designed to allow the tribunal review its decision where new evidence or new facts are brought to its attention, subsequent to the date of the original decision.  Under existing provisions the tribunal is only empowered to review an earlier decision where it is satisfied that a material change has occurred in the circumstances of the stoppage <Col N="170" /> of work or the trade dispute which caused the stoppage of work.  This amendment will bring the tribunal's powers of review generally into line with those of appeals officers.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains a number of other miscellaneous provisions designed to rationalise and improve aspects of the social welfare system.  The provisions of section 15 arise from the introduction of the new dependency arrangements in November 1986, as part of the implementation of the EC Equality Directive, and provide for an amendment of the definition of &ldquo;adult dependant&rdquo;, so as to preclude certain categories of person from qualifying as adult dependants.  The categories involved are persons who are disqualified from receiving unemployment payments in their own right, by virtue of their involvement in a trade dispute, and participants of certain full-time AnCO non-craft training courses.</P>
    <P>Under existing provisions, persons disqualified from receiving unemployment payments, by virtue of their involvement in a trade dispute, may still qualify as adult dependants.  This situation did not effectively arise prior to the introduction of the new dependency arrangements in November 1986 as up until then women could only receive increases in respect of their husbands in very exceptional circumstances. At the same time, as women qualified as dependants of their husbands regardless of whether they were in employment, an adult dependant allowance payable in respect of a woman involved in a trade dispute would have been payable prior to the commencement of the dispute.</P>
    <P>The amendment affecting participants of certain full-time AnCO non-craft training courses also arises as a consequence of the Equal Treatment Directive. As a general rule, persons in receipt of an income maintenance payment in their own right may not be regarded as dependants.  The payment of increases in respect of participants of certain AnCO courses conflicts with this provision.  As the rate of payment to participants of such courses was linked to the rate of unemployment benefit payments, it was <Col N="171" /> necessary, following implementation of the Directive, to restructure payments made to participants of these courses to reflect the revised social welfare dependency arrangements.  As a result of these changes, a family in which one spouse is in receipt of a social welfare payment, and the other is participating in a full-time, non-craft training course may, through a combination of social welfare and AnCO payments, receive the equivalent of two personal rates of payment, together with an adult dependant allowance, and one and a half times the child dependant allowance.  The effect of this amendment will be to prevent this double payment.</P>
    <P>The changes contained in section 17 of the Bill are also related to the EC Directive on equal treatment.  The existing provisions provide that, on the death of a person who is in receipt of benefit, the spouse is entitled to payment of that benefit for a period of six weeks after death.  While after death payments are regarded as a survivor's benefit and are therefore technically outside of the scope of the EC Directive on Equal Treatment, these provisions are nonetheless affected by the new dependency arrangements introduced in November 1986.  The purpose of section 17 is to apply the principle of equal treatment between men and women to the after death provisions, by providing that such payments will in future be made where at the date of death the deceased was in receipt of an increase in respect of an adult dependant, whether that dependant was a man or a woman.</P>
    <P>Finally the Bill makes provision for two minor but significant improvements in the social welfare code, one affecting claims to disability benefit and the other relating to old age pensioners.  Under existing provisions, a claimant is not entitled to disability benefit in respect of any period of paid holiday leave.  This causes a break in the claim where an insured person is on sick leave immediately before a period of paid holiday leave and, as a consequence, the claimant is obliged to serve a further three waiting days at the end of the holiday period. <Col N="172" /> Section 16 (1) (a) is designed to relieve claimants of this obligation.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides that income received by way of mobility allowance payable under the Health Act, 1970, will be disregarded in the assessment of means for the non-contributory old age pension.  This allowance which was introduced in 1979 under the Health Act, 1970, applies to severely handicapped persons over age 16 who are unable to walk and who would benefit from occasional trips away from home.  An earnings disregard of £6 per week is applied in the assessment of means for non-contributory pension.</P>
    <P>The amount of the mobility allowance when it was first introduced was £150 per year and where there were no other means the allowance did not affect the rate of pension because of the £6 per week disregard.  This is no longer the case however as the allowance has since been increased to £320 per year.  This amendment provides that money received by way of the allowance will no longer be taken into account in the assessment for old age pension.  Income from other allowances payable under the Health Acts, such as the disabled persons maintenance allowance and the infectious diseases maintenance allowance, is already disregarded.</P>
    <P>The changes I am putting forward in this Bill are designed to improve significantly in a number of respects the operation of the present social welfare system and the control mechanisms which operate.  It is extremely important that in a system as vast as this social welfare system which is responsible for the expenditure of vast amounts of taxpayers' money, the system of control should be adequate and be constantly reviewed and amended where necessary.</P>
    <P>The proposals in this Bill will bring about needed improvements in the present system and will help to achieve a more effective use of our resources.  I can assure the House that I will be taking whatever measures are necessary to develop the efficiency and effectiveness of the delivery of existing services while <Col N="173" /> at the same time ensuring that the necessary systems of control are present within the system.  It is in this spirit that I would ask the House to agree to the proposals in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am also engaged in extending social insurance to the self-employed as well as the introduction of statutory sick pay. The proposals in this Bill will bring about much needed improvements in the present system and help to achieve a more effective use of resources.  It is extremely important that while further improvements to the system are being drawn up, we constantly try to improve and develop the efficiency and effectiveness of existing services.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the extent of fraud and abuse in unemployment and sickness payments.  I intend to vigorously pursue unscrupulous employers who collude in defrauding and cheating the taxpayer, the Exchequer and their competitors. The limited resources available must be directed to those in genuine need.  I look forward to the assistance and co-operation of honest employers in eliminating these abuses.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>We recognise that there are problems as regards fraudulent abuse of the social welfare system.  Indeed, not alone this year but over the last four or five years, the cost to the State of over £7 million per day on the social welfare system is very high.  We should not suffer from any illusions and think that this Bill will bring about massive improvements. The fact is that the Bill is again directed at the people who are prepared to employ.  The question of incentive and motivation to employ people is very important.  There is a very strong emphasis on fraudulent employers and employees.  Indeed I had long discussions with the Minister and with Deputy Gemma Hussey when she was Minister about the problem of social welfare fraud.  It is important that we create an incentive and motivate the people we would like to motivate to get this country going, the people who are prepared to employ.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="174" /> I had long discussions with an official in the Department of Social Welfare about these schemes and, indeed, might I say that we implemented schemes where we allowed people who were drawing dole money to work for so many hours per week.  In case I might be giving the impression that we were turning a blind eye to it, the scheme was implemented in three or four areas first and then it was extended earlier this year to particular towns.  It admitted that there is a need for changes but the Minister's speech places a strong emphasis on people who are bringing about a fraudulent situation. I agree that we must create situations where people would not be doing this.  I know that there are areas where this is going on and I congratulate the Department and the officials involved in showing up the various such cases but let us not think that all the nettles are covered because it is anything but that.  I come from an urban area and I am very conscious of people who say that they are entitled to £60 or £70 a week but because they have a wife and two children they must do something else.  This does not necessarily mean that such a person has to do, or can do, a full-time job.  I am also very conscious of the fact, in the employment area, of a strong emphasis on getting on top of unscrupulous employers.  Is it not time that we broadened our minds and not call these people employers at all?  Why should we be asking employers all the time to ensure that their books are up to date because they are employing a person and to ensure that they pay their money on time because they have to pay out so much money every week?  Where is the incentive to employ?  Where is the motivation to employ?</P>
    <P>We were dealing with a person in the Cork region some time ago in relation to getting a little factory going in our region. We had discussions with this person who had a warmth for the Cork area.  He was prepared to employ in the region of 60 to 66 people in a plant over a period of time. We showed him around the area, we pointed to the benefits, we showed him what we were prepared to do and what <Col N="175" /> tax benefits we could give him and what land was available to him, at a very cheap price &mdash; indeed at no price at all.  We also showed him what loans were available. Ten days later we spoke to him again and his answer was &mdash; this is the point I want to make: &ldquo;I want to create work in the Cork region but 60 miles away, as the crow flies, in Wales, to employ a person and pay him £100 a week would cost in the region of £27 to £29 extra.  If I employ the same person in the Cork region, which I want to do, and pay him £100 per week&rdquo;&mdash; which is not great money but is fair money &mdash;&ldquo;it will cost me in the region of £44 a week extra.&rdquo;  Where is the incentive there?  Yet the State is saying that we need to put more emphasis on ensuring that the employer is not dishonest. Is it not true that in other countries at present when a person is being taken on as an employee &mdash; I do not want to emphasise the words, &ldquo;employee&rdquo; or &ldquo;employer&rdquo;, I want to talk about work and I am only interested in work that is not costing the State money &mdash; they are told that they are not being employed but that they are to be self-employed?  These are countries within the EC and the Minister emphasised regulations in his speech. Why are we saying that we must do everything possible not to employ people?  I speak to many employers who in no circumstances want to talk about labour or pay out money for a person they employ. Why should they?  It is an imposition to ask someone who wants to employ a person to ensure that his books are up to date and that the employee's moneys are paid.  Why not put more responsibility on the employee?  Why not put the responsibility on the person who is being employed and going to do the work?  Why should the emphasis be always put on the employer?  The penalty for breach of this provision is three years imprisonment.</P>
    <P>I am the first to say it, and I do not deny it, that I come from a very strong background of trade unionism. I am saying that I do not like the idea of not giving an incentive or a motivation to create more work.  If Senator Brendan <Col N="176" /> Ryan has an answer for that he should speak about it.</P>
    <P>The magic word of redundancy is going around this country.  From the State's point of view we are reaching the point where we will have fewer people at work every year.  That is not a good thing.  I asked the previous Minister to implement particular schemes which would mean that more people could get work, even if only on a part-time basis.  It is difficult to imagine that an employer who wants to take on people on a three, four, or six hours basis is not entitled legally to say he wants to take on a person who is unemployed.  The State says he can do that but if he employs a person who is on the dole he must make a new claim when he goes to the employment exchange the next morning.  Where is the logic in that? You cannot employ for four hours in the evening a person who is on the dole because when he goes to the unemployment exchange the next morning his claim is broken.  A person should be allowed to work 20 or 22 hours per week and he should get a certain amount of dole.  For instance, a person of 30 or 35 years who is not married would get £34 a week on the dole yet a person of 81 years who could be spending less money will get something in the region of £58 a week. If £7 million a day is being spent on social welfare it should be spent fairly.  Let us be prepared to change.  We should be prepared to say that we know of people who have not enough money and we know of people who have too much.  I know of people who are getting an invalidity pension who are much fitter than I am.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Sometimes Senator Ryan gives the impression that he is a Minister. Why is it that for so long we could not say to a person on the dole that he could <Col N="177" /> do work?  Why can we not tell a person he may take work in a restaurant in the evening or take security work?  That person may only get work for eight hours per week but at least it is some work.  I want to put the emphasis on the word &ldquo;work&rdquo;.  I am not saying he will get a great deal of money out of it.  We should not say to an employer that he may not employ a person who is on the dole if he is going to break his claim but he can employ a person who is already working. A person who finishes work at 4 o'clock and decides to do another job at 8 o'clock that night is quite entitled to do so but the person who is unemployed cannot do that.  That is the point I want to make.</P>
      <P>Employers should be encouraged to employ those out of work.  This could be achieved by putting a very strong emphasis on computerisation.  I was informed by the previous Minister that more moneys were going to be spent on computerisation in local employment exchanges.  I welcome that, but are we using the computerised system to the best advantage?  Is the Minister prepared to say that he expects to see more improvements in that area over time?  How can you say that a person on unemployment assistance should not get any money because he is doing some work?  How can you prove it without going to every gate, every store or every shop in the country to find out who is working or asking the employer how many they have employed?  This frightens the person who wants to create the job.  In another few months another inspector calls and in the end the employer says, &ldquo;I will not bother my hat: I will employ someone else&rdquo;. Instead of encouraging an employer to employ people who have no work, we are creating a disincentive with the result that the employer looks elsewhere for staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggested to the previous Minister and officials that an employee should legally be able to tell the employer he is not drawing the dole or any State benefits. The way to do that is the very same way as the credit card system, a job card system.  Why can we not computerise the system so that the person who is leaving the local employment exchange to go to <Col N="178" /> work should have his job card with him? Is that not possible?  A credit card system operates throughout the world where moneys can be handled that way: yet, we do not operate an adequate method of dealing with this matter.</P>
    <P>What I am proposing is not a novel idea but has prevailed for the past 30 or 40 years in one particular area.  Is it not true to say that in the docks a person can work one day and draw the dole the next day?  Why cannot it prevail for an ordinary employee who wants to work in a restaurant on a Saturday and Sunday? Why can he not have a job card?  Why can we not give the incentive to employers to take on a person on a Friday night and Saturday night?  At least it would employ more people.  We do not provide that incentive: yet millions of pounds are being spent on computerised systems. Every employee in the country should have a job card and when he is leaving that employment the job card should be sent back to the local unemployment exchange.  Then you could call on an employer and ask for a person's job card? If a person leaves the local exchange with his job card and says he is going to work he takes his job card with him: that covers the employer and it covers him.  That would simplify the system.</P>
    <P>The State itself should show example by saying that any person who is employed should have a job card.  Is it not possible to do that with all the money that is being spent on computerised systems? I recognise that in Irish society we do not like the idea of being numbered. I do not like the idea.  It happens in other countries.  I spoke on the telephone to a person who had to leave this country some time ago.  He told me that the stores would much prefer you to use credit cards or a particular number rather than money.</P>
    <P>In this country we are spending a fortune on employing people, and we are losing millions of pounds every year because of fraud.  We should be able to offer employers or persons who want to create work, and employ ten instead of eight, more incentives, more motivation.</P>
    <P>Let us broaden the debate and ask how <Col N="179" /> do you do that?  Why is that I cannot have Michael Murphy coming into my place on a Thursday, starting work at 7 p.m. working for two nights and getting £30 from me?  He is already getting £25 or £34 at the local exchange.  The employer should say to him when he is leaving on Friday night: &ldquo;I will give you documentation saying that you got so much from me&rdquo; and he goes back to the exchange with his job card and signs on. If you buy an item with a credit card, you get a receipt for it.</P>
    <P>It is so simple that I do not understand why we are not simplifying matters for people to create an incentive for them to employ others.  That is what I would like to do.  Some schemes were broadened earlier this year.  May I say I asked the previous Minister, Deputy Hussey, to create incentives?  I do not know how well they are doing.  I would be telling lies if I said I did.  I know in the Cork area some incentives were given but the Department of Social Welfare did not sell the idea and only put it in the public press for one day and that was it.  They did not tell employers they could employ people for so much time per week and what it would cost them.</P>
    <P>We do not tell the employers that, but we tell them they owe so much PRSI and PAYE and should not forget to pay it. The Department should make sure that the employers are covering the employees for PRSI.  When are we going to be more constructive and say to people who want to employ others: &ldquo;You can take on a person for ten hours per week instead of 40 hours per week&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>I emphasise strongly that I want to see more people getting a share of the money that is around, but that is not happening. I know people who say: &ldquo;I am earning £22,000 or £27,000.&rdquo;  In Cork about nine months ago 60 lorry drivers were working and the company decided to eliminate 16 jobs.  To eliminate 16 jobs would cost them money but they said they would be better off with 44 people.  Three weeks later one of the 44 people came to me and was very annoyed with me because he was paying so much tax, PRSI and <Col N="180" /> PAYE.  I looked at his wage receipt and it was some wage receipt for his week's work, £350 net.  That means he was earning something like £600 a week.  I asked how he earned so much.  He said: &ldquo;I was working Saturday and Sunday and that was worth £190 to me.&rdquo;  He got £190 for working Saturday and Sunday; yet he was making £350 for working the other five days.  The company found it better to give him £190 for Saturday and Sunday rather than bringing back the 16 workers they laid off before.</P>
    <P>Where is the logic?  Would it be better to give the man who is working for five days £350, and bring back the 16 workers for the other two days?  If you did that they would lose their entitlements under the social welfare schemes.  When I asked the trade union official the next morning why there is not a policy with the social partners to bring back the 16 redundant workers I was told there is no agreement to do that.  This is a semi-skilled job and you could not bring in an unskilled worker to do it.  The State would have saved a lot of money in benefits paid to those 16 workers because they were laid off.  They were getting statutory allowances and they were getting benefits.  The other man was paying tax.  He was cribbing and wanted me to make the argument for him.</P>
    <P>I am a staunch trade unionist but I believe in everybody working.  I do not believe in one man getting £600 while the other man goes to the exchange.  There is no incentive for the employer to bring back the 16 and allow them to work on Saturday and Sunday.  I want to see that but there is nothing like that in this Bill. I would like to be able to say to a young fellow of 18 or 19 years: &ldquo;I can take you on tonight and tomorrow night, but I am sorry I cannot take you on for the other five nights.&rdquo;  You cannot do that.  You must only take on a person who is already working because you do not have full employment for him.  Where is the logic in that?  Where is the motivation in this Bill for that?  Where is the incentive to an employer?  We should try to simplify the system, but the Department make it more awkward.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="181" /> There is a section in the Bill to make sure employers are up to date with payments by a certain time.  If not, they will be fined or imprisoned.  We will have fewer people employed.  This is not an easy Bill.  The greatest problem in this State at this time is unemployment.  My children and everybody's children have no jobs.  There is no incentive to create employment.  There is even a queue in the public sector for redundancy.  The State admit it is a big problem to employ people.  Even the social partners are saying there should be an agreement that there will be redundancies.  The State says there is no incentive to employ people but this Bill does not broaden the net.  Instead it enables employers to do less.  This Bill says: &ldquo;You will get three years in prison because you did not do the right thing&rdquo;.  There will be fewer people working.  That is my concern and I am sincere about it.</P>
    <P>Every day of the week I walk around my city and I see big problems.  I see the fifties back around us.  I see people hunting for rabbits, as they were doing in the early fifties.  I never thought I would see it again.  It is on in a big way.  We are doing nothing to solve it.  The Department want to spend less and to save £36 million this year.  Congratulations to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Department will have to make sure that the poor will get something but I did not see it being distributed.  Are we to tell people on £34 a week that they will get the same as the old woman of 81 who is sitting in a chair, drinking a cup of tea, with all respect to her?  I do not wish to knock her.  When will the system change so that the less well off in our society will get the same as the person next door?</P>
    <P>I know a family of five, a husband, wife and three children.  He is on £72 a week and around the corner his mother and father are on £104 a week.  He has three children to provide for.  What is the social welfare system doing about that?  If we want to spend £7 million, let us discuss how we could broaden the system? Where are the changes in the Bill?  There are no changes, only tightening.  The Department are very concerned about <Col N="182" /> fraud by employers.  They are right but we must be more concerned to ensure that we get more people working.  We may save a few million pounds by discovering fraud by some employers.  The name of the game at the end of the day is to make sure that we create incentives for employment.  This is not being done. The opposite is being done.  This is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>I am not denying for a moment there are a lot of people drawing &ldquo;the exchange&rdquo; as we call it in Cork &mdash; they call it the dole in other areas &mdash; and working at the same time.  I cannot blame them.  I know fine honest gentlemen, who three or four years ago worked in Dunlops and Fords, and who were prepared to say: &ldquo;I was doing well but now I am on £68 a week and I must get a few bob to keep Mary going&rdquo;.  They will do it, if we do not bring about a situation where we say to them: &ldquo;I recognise that you are not going to get £100 a week from an employer but you might get £40 so it would be better for the State to give you £50 and you would end up getting £90 rather than £72&rdquo;.  Is that not logical?</P>
    <P>We are not saying that to the employer. Employers are taking on people in the black economy, which is massive.  The employer says: &ldquo;I can give Michael £80 a week but I cannot give him £120&rdquo;.  That is why he is in the black economy.  If he employs a man at £100 per week it will cost him another £44 plus insurance plus, if he lays the worker off, three or four years' redundancy money.  The employer is better off not employing people legally, taking their chances in the black economy, because the employee will get another £60 or £70 a week from the local exchange anyway.  If there is a person getting £80 a week from a local employer but he needs £120 to live on, what is wrong with the State giving him the extra £40?  Is it not better than giving him £80? What is wrong with a State subsidy?</P>
    <P>The social employment scheme was implemented by the Coalition, and at that time it was the laughing stock of the Dáil and of this House, in particular among the Opposition of the day.  I do not see anything wrong with giving them <Col N="183" /> £65 or £70 a week and on the week that they are not working, they work where they like.  How can you say that to one person and not to another person?  Under the social employment schemes it is legal. They are employed by the local council for one week and get £70 a week; they can do what they like the next week and make what they like.  They can make £400 the next week and nobody says anything to them under the social employment scheme.  But that does not apply to the person who has no job at all.  They should all be treated the same.</P>
    <P>At present we say to the person who is on £34 a week and paying for a little bedsitter costing £15 per week that he must live on the rest &mdash; £19 a week.  We are spending £7 million a day on social welfare and there are some people who need it and cannot get it while others who should not be getting benefit are getting it.  Young people of 20 or 22 years of age who are walking around our streets should have a job.  It might only be three hours, three days a week, but at least he can tell his girlfriend and friends he is working.  Have we any idea what it is like for young people not to be working?  I was in Cork airport three weeks ago on Saturday and 24 families were leaving for Australia.  One can imagine what it is like around the country.</P>
    <P>When are we going to create the incentive for such people to stay here?  We educate them excellently; they are better educated than I will ever be.  How are we treating them?  The Bill before us is totally negative.  It provides for three years imprisonment for employers who defraud the State.  I am not saying that we should not get on top of these people but we must motivate employers to provide jobs.  To take on two more people at £100 a week would cost an employer £88 a week at least in PRSI and PAYE. If they are employed for 12 months the employer cannot make them redundant because they are not supposed to be sacked, even if they steal something.  I am not saying that employees should not be protected but they have a responsibility as well.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="184" /> Everybody has a responsibility.  First and foremost the Government have a responsibilty to create opportunities. They are not doing that.  They frighten the living daylights out of a person who wants to create a job.  I am very much aware of the moneys that have been saved, I congratulate the Minister but more can be done.  At the same time we must not hound the employer who does not want people walking in every three months asking if the books are up to date. The books should be simplified.  They have brought about a situation in Great Britian whereby employers are not prepared to say who they employ any more. The Minister and his officials should be aware of it, and if they are not they should check it out.  No more than 60 miles from here there are cases where an employer is not an employer any more, because it does not pay.  They have to pay much less than we pay.  I have emphasised that already.  The same person who wanted to create 66 jobs in our city, was able to say to me that energy costs were 27 per cent lower 60 miles away from here.  Turning on a one horse power motor would cost 4p an hour less.</P>
    <P>How can I create jobs in my city?  How can we create jobs in our country?  The Government are saying nothing constructive to any employer.  I want to make it easier for everybody.  The Government are readily admitting that computerisation of the system is very important. The computer is not being used to its full capacity if it is not possible to say to everybody who comes to the local employment exchange, &ldquo;Next Monday morning there are two or three days work available and take the card with you.&rdquo; That should come out of the computer and when the person goes in the next day that card goes through the computer again and it is established that they are on benefit.  If the employer who takes him on does not have the card at his place, there should be a check to see how many employees he has.  If one has seven employees there should be seven cards. That means that that employee cannot be drawing money elsewhere.  If one has eight employees one should suffer the <Col N="185" /> consequences.  I make no apologies for that.  We must show the example but we are not doing it.</P>
    <P>That is why I will be questioning every section of the Bill.  I am very conscious of the fact that our moneys are being saved, and more can be saved.  I know people who are drawing invalidity pensions, in particular, getting pensions every week and when the equality Act was implemented their money was increased from £44 to £52 because they had two children under the appropriate age and yet I had a person up the road who had to pay £15 a week to stay in a &ldquo;dive&rdquo; and he was getting £34 on which to live.  That is the change I want to see. I want to be able to say to the woman who is able to go every week and buy different clothes, &ldquo;congratulations&rdquo; because she is within the system.  As regards the other person who cannot draw his breath because he does not have enough, when will we change that?  Those are the changes I want to see.  I want to, see the £7 million a day brought down to £6 million.  If three, four or five ordinary people were given £1 million a day to look after the less well off in their city or area, it would be done for less.  Because of the way the system works people can continue to draw social welfare payments. There is no problem people are told they can continue to draw because they are not well.  A woman may be able to have a second holiday out of the invalidity pension because she is not well.  Her husband could be on £400 or £500 a week and he gets free travel because his wife is not well.  Where is the logic in that?  I know a person in my city who is on invalidity pension.  Her husband is a State employee earning £21,000 a year and he travels to Dublin free.  If the Minister says that that is logical or fair to the man who is in receipt of £34 a week, I am not prepared to stand here and take it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss Wallace Miss Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. Social welfare is so important to the wellbeing of so many people that updating of legislation is always ongoing and necessary.  Because so much is spent on social welfare in any one year &mdash; £2.6 <Col N="186" /> billion in the current year &mdash; there is an obvious need to effect savings and efficiency.  This year's savings of £36 million through measures to eliminate fraud and abuse and more effective use of resources must be welcomed.  The deserving applicants who are entitled to, and solely dependent on, their benefits do not necessarily have to be affected by savings in this area.  The Minister has proved this in the savings that have now been made by way of the detection of fraud and abuse.</P>
      <P>I would welcome additional improvements in the social welfare area.  First, there is a need for improvements in buildings where people gather to collect their social welfare.  I know of venues in Meath, and indeed throughout Ireland, where people have to line up on footpaths, often in the rain, to collect their entitlement.  Secondly, social welfare is an area very appropriate for decentralisation and the advancement in computerisation in the Department, as referred to by the Minister, should allow for further decentralisation and the benefits that accrue from this.</P>
      <P>The Bill before us today deals with measures to combat fraud.  Recent events at Arigna suggest that fraud is taking place on a large scale and in a well organised manner.  I do not object to an unfortunate social welfare recipient digging a neighbour's garden or doing some other trivial work carried out as a past time but organised fraud must be stamped out. The millions of pounds lost to the State in this way each year could be put to the benefit of deserving social welfare applicants.  In the area of the elimination of fraud I feel that the additional powers to take prosecution against employers will be helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome here the changes that were made in the Dáil <i>vis-a-vis</i> the penalties. There is no doubt in my mind that fraud is taking place and I congratulate the Minister on taking the appropriate initiative to confront this practice.  Again, from my experience as a public representative, I have come to the conclusion that the abuse in unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance is in the area <Col N="187" /> of short term casual employment, such as a farmer who may want somebody to work at hay during the summer months or a shopkeeper who may wish to employ somebody at Christmas time or during busy periods.  Perhaps this is something that the Minister can examine in the future, that is, how to ensure that employers requiring short term or casual labour have access to establishing who the local unemployed are and are able to employ them with the minimum of paperwork for short periods.  I feel that improvements in this area might be of assistance in the matter raised by Senator Cregan, the extra paperwork and difficulties involved for employers.  I would say further that employers employing large numbers of employees should keep their books in order for the efficiency of their own business and for the sake of their employees.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem of a person starting off with the advantage of an extra £100 on a Monday morning and the advantages he has in pricing jobs over and above his counterpart who is paying tax and not drawing social welfare.  The elimination of this scandalous practice of working and drawing unemployment could lead to meaningful permanent employment for many people.  Every effort should be made to eliminate this activity.  Sections 2 to 7 of this Bill are a major step forward in this area.</P>
    <P>I note that employers may be required to produce all documents, information and records as an inspector of the Department may require.  Again, this is a real step forward in further eliminating fraud. It is of no disadvantage to the employer who keeps his books up to date and it has a distinct advantage for employees in the benefits they are entitled to from having tax and PRSI paid up to date.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 and 9 provide for an increase in the qualifying requirement for benefit from four years to five years in the number of paid contributions required for disability benefit.  This section applies to people who are sick for over a year.  It should create a longer and thus a greater <Col N="188" /> attachment to the workforce for qualifying persons for long term benefits and a greater encouragement to long term employment.</P>
    <P>Section 10 establishes a recent attachment to the workforce for persons applying for maternity benefit.  I always felt that this should have been the case as maternity allowance was always understood to be in respect of a break in a person's work performance.  I welcome a tidying up of the arrangement in the Bill. Section 14 is to be welcomed as an improvement in access to having cases reviewed and resolved.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw attention also to section 18 of the Bill where it will affect only a particular section of the population. It will be warmly welcomed by those who are affected as the present position means that the value of mobility allowance, which is paid to persons who are permanently incapacitated, was greatly decreased when assessed for non-contributory old age pension.  Now, thanks to the Minister's attention to detail, the mobility allowance will not be taken into account for non-contributory old age pension.  It brings into line the other allowances which are already paid by the health board, and which are not affected, such as the disabled persons maintenance allowance.</P>
    <P>In general, I again welcome the Bill and thank the Minister for bringing forward the legislation at this time.  I have no doubt that the taxpayer in particular will welcome this Bill, particularly as it relates to confronting abuse and strengthening control measures in the social welfare area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Wallace, in her very considered contribution to the Bill, that the area of social welfare is extremely important.  It is important because it touches the lives of so many people.  According to the figures mentioned in the Minister's Second Stage speech it affects 641,000 people.  For that reason alone any Bill dealing with social welfare, improvements, tightening up or otherwise is extremely important but it is also important that in the rationalisation, <Col N="189" /> updating or consolidating of legislation &mdash; particularly in the social welfare area &mdash; we would try to ensure that those who are least in need are not assisted by the State and that those who are most in need are on the priority list for help.  Looking at this legislation, I am afraid it does not meet any of those requirements.  The Labour Party will be opposing this Bill because we feel it is inadequate, in some respects, that undue emphasis is placed in some areas and that it is a contravention of the recently produced <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which related specifically to the social welfare area.  A commitment was given that the Government would maintain levels of social welfare, although they put in the clever proviso &ldquo;within the resources available to them&rdquo;.  The Government were not honest in their negotiations in outlining to their social partners that changes would be made in the qualification and in the numbers of contributions required in future for some of these benefits.  For that reason, and for some other reasons that I will deal with briefly, we are opposing the Bill.</P>
      <P>I would like to spell out our opposition because it is appropriate where a Bill lays such emphasis on fraud that we should clarify our opposition to the Bill.  The Labour Party are included in the group who do not condone fraud in the social welfare area or in any other area.  We have always said that people who are working and paying PAYE contributions, and so on, are rarely involved in fraud in these areas simply because their contributions are deducted from their pay before they ever receive it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facilities available for working people to defraud the system are very limited.  We have seen and read of widespread abuse in the area of the self employed and other such sectors, particularly in the area of taxation.  We are opposed to the Bill, not because it tries to address the problem of fraud, but because it impinges on the acceptable norm for qualification for certain categories. For that reason we will oppose the Second Stage of the Bill and we will try to amend certain other sections on <Col N="190" /> Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Social welfare is divided into many categories.  Before I deal with the categories I will deal with the question of fraud.  It is appropriate to address that problem and to look at the figures the Minister has produced, following his efforts in this area, by computerisation and increased staff and vigilance on the ground.  It appears now that he is placing much emphasis on the employer's responsibility in this area.  I have always said that the employer can play a major role if he is aware that his employee is fraudulently drawing money from the State.  If penalties are required to address the problem, let us talk about them.  Why not have incentives for employers?</P>
    <P>This point was referred to by Senator Cregan who made a wide-ranging speech, some of which I would not agree with, but he touched on some very fundamental areas.  If we look at the problems of employers in this area of employing people or employing additional people, we see that the State put so many barriers in their way that they now confess publicly that they do not want to be bothered employing extra people because of the requirements to do all sorts of extraordinary things and they will be penalised if they do not do them.</P>
    <P>I suggest that, as an incentive to employers to create employment we should not be talking about penalties but incentives which would ensure that employees are full time workers, that their contributions are collected and transmitted to the Revenue Commissioners so that the employers will get the full tax benefit by way of allowance. The employee will get the full benefit for sickness, unemployment or redundancy. That is the way to address this problem but, apparently to cloud the other issues in the Bill, the Minister is putting much emphasis on employers and is insinuating that some of them at least are guilty of fraud.</P>
    <P>I am aware of part time employment, particularly in agricultural areas in the summer during harvesting, hay saving and otherwise, when farmers who cannot have full time employees require part <Col N="191" /> time workers to be available to them.  I am also aware that where employees were discovered to be signing and working in this capacity, the employer refused to sign the declaration that they were being recompensed for their work.  If the declaration was signed by the employer at the time, that person could have had his allowance withdrawn.  The actual word of the inspector who witnessed the employee working was not sufficient because the employer's statutory declaration of employment was required.  If that area was addressed, it would eliminate this problem of part time workers for special reasons.  Many of us understand the need for part time workers to be able to earn extra money.  This raises the whole question of whether employers should be given incentives to employ people rather than having all sorts of disincentives for people who are in receipt of unemployment benefit, who want to get additional work or another job.</P>
    <P>The social employment scheme addressed this problem in some way.  As outlined by previous speakers there is no penalty if you decide to get additional employment.  That is a totally different scheme designed by the previous Minister for Labour, Deputy Quinn, to help to create a work ethic, to bring them back into the employment sector without penalty and to give them a minimum amount of money that was an improvement on their social welfare.  There was an incentive to come off unemployment assistance and go onto social employment schemes.</P>
    <P>We must look at social welfare for what it is.  It is the responsibility of the State to ensure that people who are unable to work, and who are unable to get work, are protected and have their incomes guaranteed.  As Sister Stanislaus has said, it is a human dignity right of theirs to be assisted by the State to ensure that they survive.  That is what social welfare is for. Any other changes in Social Welfare Bills which make it more difficult or make it <Col N="192" /> impossible for them are not to be commended and I certainly would not support them.</P>
    <P>I will deal with the areas of social welfare with which I am confronted as a public representative.  In the area of unemployment assistance where we have 230,000 people, I find it almost impossible to convince the Department of Social Welfare that married women who are unemployed and available for work should qualify for unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit, to which they have contributed.  They have lost their jobs for one reason or another.  We have had to produce documentary evidence from mothers and mothers-in-law that they were available to mind children. In some cases as many as 20 to 30 letters from individuals and different employers were necessary.  Somehow or other, in spite of equality for women and Europe's directive to the contrary, the Department of Social Welfare consider that married women are not entitled to work &mdash; and that attitude is now growing &mdash; and definitely not entitled to unemployment benefit or assistance.</P>
    <P>Unemployment assistance is extremely difficult for wives to obtain because, in the assessment process, 50 per cent of their husband's income is assessed as part of theirs, even if, through some fault of his, he is not even contributing towards her maintenance.  However, if he is earning, 50 per cent of his income is counted as being that of his wife and she does not usually qualify for unemployment assistance irrespective of the equality directive. That only comes into play where both are on social welfare and are treated separately.  Now we discover that because of that there was a penalty loss.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Minister has decided to extend for a further period the anomaly that will airse following that directive, if this interim payment made by the previous Government is withdrawn, because the amount of money involved would be too much of a shock for people on very low incomes.  That is my understanding of the problems in the area of unemployment benefit and assistance, particularly for married women.  That <Col N="193" /> does not mean that the Jobsearch programme has not, as the Minister said, brought out some figures regarding people who did not appear to want to enter into the job training programme in the belief as that they understood it that it was not to be an effort to find work for them but to penalise them and take them off social welfare.  That was how they approached it.  There is the widespread opinion that in the area of social welfare recipients the Jobsearch programme is a con job and is one way of getting people off the register.  If people are genuinely not available for work I do not hold any brief for them.  Any process which is necessary to sift through that process will have our support.  Certainly we would not condone anybody who would be defrauding the State and purporting to be available for work when in fact he is not available for work.  How can we transmit that problem then into the area where we want to genuinely get work for people? This is where the manpower agencies need to have themselves redirected in what they are doing to ensure that they make every effort to take people off the unemployment register and put them into productive employment whether that be in the service industry or otherwise.</P>
    <P>Apart from the social employment scheme I would suggest that the manpower offices have rarely produced jobs for anybody.  They have done interviews for some State bodies and apart from that I do not know of any scheme they have designed in their own right or of any case in which they have channelled people to employers who needed them.</P>
    <P>I have discussed the problem of disability benefit in this House on numerous occasions.  We went through a phase at one stage when almost every applicant was being taken off this benefit on the understanding that if they were sick enough they would appeal and be put back on benefit.  I had cases which eventually the Ombudsman had to fix because of certain regulations which allowed a medical inspector, by law, to give an opinion; once his opinion was given, whether the opinion was right or wrong, regard had to be taken of it.  It was very <Col N="194" /> difficult to get a change in that opinion without producing medical evidence of the strongest possible nature involving going back into hospital documentation, X-rays and everything else, to convince medical referees that people had certain entitlements to disability benefit.  My argument at that time was and still is that where medical checks are carried out on people drawing disability benefit, proper medical facilities should be available.  If the Department of Social Welfare cannot provide them, hospitals or clinics in the area should make those facilities available for doctors from the social welfare to properly test and examine people by X-ray or otherwise.  They should have access to records and have available to them the use of equipment in hospitals to be able to do the job properly rather than just checking pulse or listening to heartbeat.</P>
    <P>Apart from frightening the life out of people about their entitlements to disability or invalidity pension, we must have regard for people who are genuinely sick and unable to work.  These people would dearly like to get a doctor's clean bill of health and to be able to work.  The best news they could get would be that they were ready and fit for work and it would be lovely if they had a job to go back to but most of these people have no jobs to go back to.  If work was available very few of these problems would arise. I hope that the Minister, in trying to ensure that disability benefit recipients are correctly examined, would use the facilities which the health boards cannot afford to use any more as a result of cutbacks in their area.  Facilities might be lying idle.  For instance, the hospital in the town of Tipperary which has been closed would be available for any sort of test the Minister might wish to have carried out.  I suggest that use should be made of that facility, perhaps with the Department of Health being paid something for the use of it.</P>
    <P>There is a problem also in the area of unemployment assistance particularly for young people who are living at home and who find it extremely difficult to qualify in the means test.  I do not know of any <Col N="195" /> national guidelines set down by the Department stating what value, if any, should be put on the fact that adult boys and girls &mdash; of 18 years and upwards &mdash; who are living at home can walk in the door and sleep in a bed in that house. They are expected to make a contribution if they can but if they do not have work they are a burden on their parents.  Yet in the process of assessment for unemployment assistance, they find it extremely difficult to qualify.</P>
    <P>The Minister should lay down some kind of national guidelines because there is a wide ranging discrepancy in this area. It almost means that the parents have to be subjected to a means test to qualify their child for the benefit.  The child would not be applying for the benefit if he was able to get work.  We have a catch-22 situation where parents are almost advocating their children to leave home, to get a flat or to emigrate.  That is the problem we begin to create when we make regulations that make it extremely difficult for people to qualify for help.</P>
    <P>The same applies to small holders' assistance schmes.  Many people do not have sympathy for small farmers but after two dreadful years small farmers who had any kind of borrowings or who suffered livestock losses are at the lowest poverty level one could imagine.  In the process of investigation by the Department of Social Welfare and of means testing, it is usually the previous year's income that is taken into account because they are the only figures that are available.  This is the year that small farmers are dying of hunger.  There is an urgent need to address those areas of the social welfare code.  The sooner the national contribution scheme is brought into being for everybody the sooner we will do away with the anomaly of the widespread disowning of one's property, of property being handed on to somebody else for the purpose of qualification for social welfare without contributing anything to the State.  All their wealth and property are transmitted, except for the house, and then they qualify for assistance.  When those kind of people are contributing and <Col N="196" /> getting something in their own right it will be fine for them to transfer, their property to the younger generation.  I am delighted that the Departments of Social Welfare and Agriculture as well as other agencies have been stimulating the transfer of land and not penalising people in that respect in so far as the areas of income tax or social welfare are concerned. They should be assisted by way of a contribution scheme and then everybody would qualify when they reach the age at which pension is paid.  People cannot understand why, when they reach pension age, they do not automatically qualify for a pension.</P>
    <P>The free fuel scheme was extended this year to long term recipients of unemployment assistance. That change was made on foot of a case in the European Community which left us with no option because these people were deemed to be in a category to which the scheme needed to be extended.  For unemployment assistance recipients it is absolutely specific that they must be living alone.  A person living with another who is also in a qualfying category experiences extreme difficulty in convincing either the Department of Social Welfare or the health board that both should qualify for benefit.  I would like confirmation from the Minister about the regulation which prescribes the long term unemployed to live along.  An old age pensioner who is living alone will get benefit but if an unemployed member of the family is in the house they will not get benefit.  One of the categories should get it.</P>
    <P>The system of payment of disability benefit by the employer in the first number of weeks when the person is ill and looks for benefit from the Department is a backdoor method of taxing disability benefit payments.  When the employer pays it it is considered to be wages.  As I understand it, it is not wages because it has not been worked for.  It is a payment because a person is unable to work because he or she is sick.</P>
    <P>The additional contributions proposed for the qualification for disability benefit <Col N="197" /> and other benefits are a retrograde step. What happens when this Bill becomes law?  What happens to somebody who gets sick, having only four years contributions? Those people are not available for work, they cannot qualify for unemployment benefit because they are sick and they do not have sufficient contributions to qualify for payment.  Will they now have to go to the supplementary welfare officer and start begging for the last semblance of income from the State? It is degrading enough to stand in the pouring rain on the footpath to queue but it is even more degrading because the system is now geared against people who, because of the lack of contributions, cannot get benefit because they did not have five years stamps.  I am against increasing the requirements of contributions. It is retrograde and it is an unfair penalty in an area where we would need to have compassion because people are genuinely unable to work.</P>
    <P>There are measures in this Bill that are retrograde.  They are not progressive. The Minister would have had our assistance in dealing with fraud and everybody would agree that something should be done in some areas but the real problems in the Bill for genuine beneficiaries have been clouded by emphasising fraud only. The most fundamental thing about this Bill is that it further penalises people in an area where I thought the Government with all their promises would have looked after the poor, the old and the sick in a better way than anybody else had ever done before.  This Bill is a contradiction of that avowed aspiration and I cannot support it in its present form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  We know that fraud in the social welfare system is at a very high level.  Senator Wallace spoke about the organised fraud which is rampant.  In the Border areas people are going hither and thither on both sides of the Border availing of the best on both sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is demoralising for people on social welfare.  I do not know if any of the Senators have had experience of drawing <Col N="198" /> the dole?  I had for a very short while. The first job I got was as a temporary postman.  I had to pack it up because I was not registered as unemployed and to do that I had to sign the dole.  It was demoralising, even in those days.  It was more difficult to defraud the system in those days and perhaps we might go back to that system again?  The dole form then had six squares and if you worked a day you put on an &ldquo;X&rdquo; and if you were not working you put on a &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  You got paid only for the days you were not working. It was very important to ensure that you put an &ldquo;X&rdquo; for the day you were working because you made sure you got a stamp on your card.  If you had 26 stamps you got unemployment benefit for the winter months and it was an incentive to every person in rural Ireland to get work and get 26 stamps.  Therefore, he ensured that the employer put on the stamps.</P>
    <P>I agree with a lot of what Senator Cregan said about incentives.  Our system at present is loaded against the employer. I was an employer but I sold the business. When I started employing people 20 years ago I had only to worry about the bank manager and ensure that when the inspector from the employment exchange called I had the cards stamped.  If I did not have them stamped he said he would come back the next day and I should get them done.  It was a nice personal relationship.  He called once a year, you went to the post office, bought the stamps, and got the cards up-to-date. That was a simple system which produced good results.  It created jobs and it encouraged employment.</P>
    <P>While I agree that there is need for control units and investigation units, I wonder does it cost a lot to do all this? Why does the system lend itself to abuse? We should consider that aspect.  Even if a stamp cost £40 a week, an employer would prefer to put a stamp on a card than have to pay a bookkeeper to come in to do his PAYE and PRSI returns.  It is a mammoth task, particularly for many employers who started in the days when the bank manager did your books and the social welfare officer kept your cards. They were two simple systems but they <Col N="199" /> were very efficient and we had far less abuse.</P>
    <P>When people have to go to the Garda station or to the social welfare officer it is demoralising.  We have a new office in Sligo.  It is working better but in the old office it was shocking to see men who worked for many years standing in a queue.  Many people operating in those offices were far from social in their attitude. I would like to see a change in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am partially in agreement with all the emphasis on the employer.  I do not agree with the reference that was made to the self-employed.  The self-employed people employ others.  On the one hand we want people to create jobs and when people create jobs &mdash; many of those were PAYE workers who had either to join the dole queue or make use of their capabilities and the ability to create jobs for themselves and for others &mdash; it is very hard to hear them being continually sniped at as if they were some kind of criminals, some kind of an inferior people and not people who are doing their best to create jobs for others and take people off the dole queue.</P>
    <P>I get very annoyed with people who make those sniping remarks at the self-employed. The self-employed are a very sound type of people who have made decisions not to go on the dole queue but to take off their coats and work hard. Many of them are working very long hours to try to make a go of their businesses because it is a challenge when they get involved.</P>
    <P>I believe that is one of the good things that will come out of the present redundancy schemes.  There are many young people who are PAYE workers, who have for many years had some pet hobby they would like to develop, and have a lot of experience they would like to use for the benefit of others.  They could not afford to take the risk of going into this but, if they can get their voluntary redundancy, I believe they will use their abilities. If a man retires at 65 or 67 he is past the stage of getting too involved but if he retires at 55 to 60 years of age, with a <Col N="200" /> guaranteed lump sum or pension, he is the type we can expect to help to reduce our dole queue.  I am convinced of this and it will be interesting to see if it happens.</P>
    <P>There are many farmers who would employ people for three or four months of the year, but not on a weekly basis.  I know many people who have given up work they used to do, such as going to the bog, doing tillage and so on.  They do not want to employ-people as it creates too many problems.  If a man gets £60 or £70 a week unemployment benefit and you employ him and give him £60 a week more, that is £120 a week, it costs you another £40 a week to pay all his overheads and, at the end of two or three days, he is out of the system.  After you have your few weeks work done, the hay saved, the turf cut, the crops in, you must let him go until harvest time again and he is out of the system.  When he did a nixer he was never out of the system.  He could work and get paid for the days he worked.  If that system was brought in with really tough penalties for anybody who violated the rules, it would solve many problems.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about the black economy which is rampant.  I am in two minds about this thing.  First, you have the man who is qualified to draw unemployment assistance and all he does is draw it, go down to the pub and waste it.  Then the St. Vincent de Paul Society or the county council have to give him something to help to keep his wife and family alive.</P>

      <P>I am getting annoyed with this continual sniping by people of that calibre.  I could take it from people of lesser calibre.  I was on the point about people who succumb to taking a bit of work on the side to keep their home together.  This is a difficult decision.  I often fight with my conscience about this. When you see one who qualifies and squanders and the other who qualifies and increases, it is difficult to make a decision because you know that people on £60 or £70 a week are finding it impossible to support their wives and families. We know it is impossible and that you would need to be earning over £100 a week today to be able to live in a modest way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social employment scheme could be extended.  It was amazing that it was criticised.  We welcomed it and we feel that it has done a lot of good work.  There have been many amenity schemes, many rural and environmental schemes carried out with this money.  When people are working it creates an entirely different environment.  In the fifties when I was <Col N="202" /> trying to collect a few bob in rates from people who were unemployed, their houses were run down, the farm was run down and they had no courage to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>As soon as they got some job and a few bob they were able to pay their rates. They started to paint and decorate their houses and you were working with a different stream of people.  People who were working talked about the value they got and what they were doing with their homes.  It creates a completely different environment when people work and they do up their homes.  The spin-off creates more and more jobs.  When people are on social welfare they go down to the comer, to the post office, the pub, or the club and they play pool.  It is an aimless, idle life, whereas, when they are working and activated, they are going in another direction.  We should try to develop the social employment scheme.  I often wonder if it would cost that much more to give them the money which we pay in social welfare as a supplement towards work.  We must get back to the work ethic.</P>
    <P>When we talk about social welfare or about employment we are talking about two very emotional subjects because we will always be told about all the hard cases.  I sometimes wonder are we doing enough for many people who are on social welfare with regard to how they spend that money.  A lot of social welfare is spent today in the wrong manner.  It is given as a supplement to make a better home life.  We must all admit that a considerable amount of it is making home life difficult because it is being spent on drink, drugs and so on which is not in any way conducive to a happy home or a good family.</P>
    <P>We should have a control unit to help people because there are two things in this country that need very careful handling, namely, brains and money.  Brilliant men do not always make brilliant operators and people who get large legacies are often, after a short while, back to where they started.  We are not getting value out from our social welfare system and the people are not getting value from <Col N="203" /> it.  When we have so many moneylenders operating in housing estates and so on, is it not time that we had a system to educate those people on how to make the best use of their money?  Most people living in a housing estate are generally on the same level of income, whether they are employed or unemployed.  Eighty per cent of the homes are done up nicely and they make a success of them, but 15 or 20 per cent, or maybe less, fail to make a go of it.  There is no reason why they should have failed other than they were not capable of making the same go of it as the other 80 per cent.  There should be more services available to these people to educate them on how to use their money more wisely and more efficiently.</P>
    <P>There is huge fraud in the sick pay section.  What is wrong with doctors? Why are they saying that people are sick if they are not sick or are our doctors capable of differentiating between a man who is sick and a man who is not sick?  I suggested one time in relation to absenteeism in jobs that after a person has been on two or three certificates that person should be sent to an investigation unit in a hospital to see if the problem could be solved.  From the figures that the Minister has given us it is obvious that many people who were not sick have been certified as sick.  Are our medical men able to do this job?  If they are not, is there any system whereby we can send people to hospitals or somewhere else where they can be checked out?  Why does a doctor give a certificate to a man saying he is sick if he is not sick or is he able to know the difference?</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill because there is colossal abuse of the social welfare system and I also welcome the control units and the investigation units.  I would also like to see some system to facilitate rural employment which I believe could play a big part in reducing the unemployment figures.  There should also be some system for casual employment, that rather than having a person going through the same complicated system of registering, getting a number and so on, <Col N="204" /> that casual employment could be introduced by means of some other simple system such as stamping a card because there are a lot of casual workers.</P>
    <P>Many employers employ people on a casual basis because if a machine breaks down and there are four or five men idle they will get the first man who can help them.  This may be somebody who is on the dole.  Those people break the law but if they did not their business might suffer. Would the Minister, if not in this Bill at some time, consider how we could encourage people to spend more wisely and also how we could cater for casual employment rather than having to go through the same system as the factory with 30 or 40 people employed which has a computerised system.</P>
    <P>We all know that snowflakes are very small but it is the amount of snowflakes that fall that creates the drift that stops everything.  The same applies to employment. The small numbers add up.  In my village there are up to 80 people employed in five or six small units.  If we were to wait for one big unit to employ that number of people those people would not be employed in north Sligo. We must try to facilitate the smaller units and the casual employers and those who will only employ part-time workers.  I welcome the Bill.</P>

    <Title>Science and Technology Bill, 1987: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="205" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Dr. McCarthy) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Dr. McCarthy)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Dr. McCarthy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to combine, in one body, the functions which have up to now been carried out by two organisations, the National Board for Science and Technology and the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  It is intended that the new body will be called &ldquo;Eolas &mdash; the Irish Science and Technology Agency&rdquo; and that it will come into being on 1 January 1988.</P>
      <P>The Government consider that this Bill is of major importance.  It reflects not only the Government's determination to make the best use of scarce resources and to deploy public funds more effectively but also, and most important, the Government view that a strong and well-developed scientific and technical base, integrated with industry, is essential, if Ireland is to prosper in today's keenly competitive high-technology world.  The bringing together of the IIRS and the NBST is an essential step towards providing that base.  It will result in a unified support mechanism for science and technology development in industry and services and in the higher education sector.</P>
      <P>The close relationship between science and technology, and between the two elements together and economic and social development is an accepted fact. The countries which are most advanced in science and technology are the countries which are the wealthiest and have the highest living standards.  It is only logical, therefore, to aspire to take a leading place in this high technology world. To do so, we must have proper national policies and we must have the most effective mechanisms in place for carrying through these policies.  We are now well placed to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government policy for science and technology can now be described as having the following broad objectives: co-ordinated management of programmes <Col N="206" /> and planning; raising the overall level and quality of science and technology; intensifying the application of modern technologies in indigenous industry; and increasing industrial innovation.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House aims at creating the proper and most effective framework in which these elements can be pursued and worthwhile results can be achieved.  The two organisations being combined are the major State support services under the aegis of the Department of Industry and Commerce for scientific and technological development.</P>
    <P>The role and the functions up to now assigned to the IIRS can be summarised as follows: supporting industry through process improvements, testing, analysis and the dissemination of technical information; specifying standards and marks for commodities and processes, and encouraging and monitoring standards; promotion and utilisation of national resources through research and development and assisting the development and exploitation of inventions which are in the public interest.</P>
    <P>By contrast, the NBST have been concerned with technology development policies, strategies and assessments at a national level.  In particular, they have been involved in developing and co-ordinating national programmes for science and technology and in fostering the emergence of a science and technology infrastructure attuned to industrial and economic needs.</P>
    <P>The new agency, Eolas, will combine both these sets of functions and will have as its prime objective the development and expansion of industry in particular, and of economic and social development in general through science and technology. It will set out to achieve this by undertaking the following precise actions: promoting national investment in science and technology; providing and administering grants for science and technology projects; optimising EC funding for science and technology; co-ordinating science and technology funding between development agencies, third-level institutions <Col N="207" /> and industry; providing a national technical information service; providing technical, consulting and testing services; monitoring industrial R &amp; D projects; and operating the national quality and standards programme.  It will undertake these actions under the general direction of the Office of Science and Technology.</P>
    <P>Eolas will be a vital element of our growing technological infrastructure and will exercise a much-needed directional and co-ordinating role for State-support services in this area.  A co-ordinated science and technology input is crucial for a successful industrial development policy and should be closely integrated into that policy.  The direct input, by entrepreneurs through in-house research and development, and the indirect input, through the State science and technology infrastructure, are major elements of industrial strategy.  They are just as important as management competence and financial resources.  This fact will be reflected in this Government's approach to industrial development and industrial planning.  This approach is being facilitated by bringing together, under one roof, responsibility for advising the Government on science and technology policy together with responsibility for providing support services for the technical development of Irish manufacturing.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to the new science and technology development programme which was established by the Government in 1987.  This programme followed the Government's commitment in their policy document on science and technology.  An allocation of £3.1 million was made in the Department of Industry and Commerce Vote in 1987 to initiate immediate and indeed long overdue action in a number of key areas including: biotechnology; advanced manufacturing technology; microelectronics; a re-equipment programme for the IIRS; a technology innovation programme; and a teaching companies programme.</P>
    <P>The common theme running through all the actions funded in this programme <Col N="208" /> is the transfer of new scientific and technical knowledge to Irish industry to enable it to compete and develop new jobs.  These programmes, which will be continued and extended in 1988, are now up and running.  Many of them are under the management of the National Board for Science and Technology or are being carried out with the full co-operation of both the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and the National Board for Science and Technology.  The new agency, Eolas will be responsible for the management and execution of these programmes.</P>
    <P>In legislative terms, the Bill is relatively simple.  The mechanism being proposed to effect the merger is as follows. Section 3 of the Bill provides that the name of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards will be changed to Eolas &mdash; the Irish Science and Technology Agency.  Section 6 provides for the repeal of the National Board for Science and Technology Act, 1977, and for the repeal of certain redundant provisions of the Industrial Research and Standards Act of 1961.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill provides for the dissolution of the National Board for Science and Technology and assigns the functions of that board to the new agency, in addition to the functions assigned to it by the IRS Act of 1961.  The functions are listed in sections 8, 9 and 10.  They are the same as the functions which were specified in sections 4, 5 and 6 of the NBST Act of 1977.  The Government consider that the resultant functions which will now be assigned to the new agency are suitably worded to enable the Agency to fulfil the role expected of it.</P>
    <P>I recognise that it could be argued that there are certain similarities between the functions listed in the 1977 Act and those in the 1961 Act.  This was unavoidable since the stimulation, co-ordination, funding and advisory functions of the NBST were exercisable in respect of areas and activities of national interest where, necessarily, an operational body like IIRS would have operational programmes. But any such similarities in the combined functions will not result in any <Col N="209" /> practical difficulties, given that one agency will be responsible.</P>
    <P>Section 8 (b) provides that the Minister may by order assign additional functions to the agency.  This power is considered necessary in the event that it may be decided in the future that some further functions might appropriately be performed by the agency.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Bill provides for the amendment of section 43 (5) of the IRS Act which deals with expenditure by the agency on the development and exploitation of inventions.  The limitation on expenditure, £5,000, is considered no longer appropriate, given the passage of time, and the amendment will give the Minister the power, by order, to set a more suitable limitation.</P>
    <P>I do not propose at this stage to go into the detail of the other provisions of the Bill which could, I think, be regarded as relatively standard provisions.  I would, perhaps, draw attention to section 27 which provides for the transfer of the staff of the National Board for Science and Technology to the new agency on terms and conditions no less favourable than those they currently enjoy.  It would, I think, be appropriate, at this point, to express the Government's appreciation of the work carried out over the years by both the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and the National Board for Science and Technology.  Both organisations &mdash; their respective staffs and board members &mdash; have served this country well.  They have performed valuable work right across the scientific spectrum and have laid the basis for the tasks which now, I hope, will be successfully undertaken by the new agency.</P>
    <P>The creation of Eolas &mdash; the amalgamation of the IIRS and the NBST &mdash; and the close co-ordination of its activities with those of the other developmental agencies and the third level institutions will result in a real synergy. The ambition must be to utilise the application of science and technology to create worthwhile new opportunities for industrial activity and long-lasting employment. I stress that the academic world has a vitally important and practical role <Col N="210" /> to play in realising this ambition.  I am confident that the new agency will provide the proper framework for successful implementation of Government policy on science and technology.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. The amalgamation of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and the National Board for Science and Technology has many positive aspects.  The Minister and the Government have stated that by the amalgamation of the IIRS and the NBST they want to establish a strong and vibrant science and technological base in the country.  That is a very commendable idea but what I find very ideological about the Government policy is that they have decided to cut the grant aid for the combined agencies by a total of £1.49 million for 1988 alone.  That is a farcical step in the sense that you want to have a strong and vibrant science and technological base and, at the same time, you are willing to cut the amount of money available by such a huge sum. Surely, if the Government believe in their fine words and aspirations about science and technology there was a case for utilising the savings and putting the money into many of the hard pressed areas in this service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an area with enormous potential and of vital importance for the future wellbeing of the country in the creation of industrial wealth and jobs.  It is very difficult to argue for a new departure when the first thing the Government decide to do is to cut the existing budget and none of the savings are being put directly back into that area.  There has been a serious run-down in the provision of resources especially with regard to scientific equipment for the IIRS.  We must keep our facilities and our equipment up to date in a fast changing area. We now find that the combined agencies have considerably less money than they had last year despite a low inflation rate and other factors.  I believe that the lack of funding could have a detrimental effect <Col N="211" /> on the new agency.</P>
    <P>I welcome the general structure of the Bill but if we do not have a strong science and technological base the arguments we are now presenting here will relate more readily to other countries with such a base.  The new agency will have a major role to play.  The new board and chief executive will be very important in portraying Ireland's image abroad as a serious, developed economy and nation. It has real potential for providing a planning and co-ordinated focus for science and technology in Ireland.  It is important also that we must be able to transfer the research work of the universities and institutions to industry.</P>
    <P>It is very important that these things should happen.  We must accept we cannot compete with huge economies as regards the kind of investment we put into science and technology.  I know we cannot compete with the large countries of the world.  We have given a lot of money over the years and we have been very productive in that area and I think it is a backward step to have such a lack of funding for the new agency.</P>
    <P>The initial success or otherwise of this whole operation will depend on getting the right person for the job of chief executive of the new agency, whether coming from within the existing operation or being recruited from outside.  The chief executive will need to be a person who can command the confidence and respect of all branches of science and technology. Bringing together the IIRS and the NBST, the various universities and institutions and the various downstream activities will be a major task.  This will be a key factor in the initial period.  I would like some clarification as to the role and power of the Minister for Finance in this appointment.  The Minister of State has said that section 50 provides for the appointment of a chief executive of the board with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>My reading of the section is that the board of the agency shall appoint a person to be the chief executive of the agency under contract of service on such <Col N="212" /> terms and conditions as may be agreed by the board with the approval of the Minister and Minister for Finance.  That would indicate that what has to be approved by the Minister and the Minister for Finance is not the appointment but the terms of contract agreed by the board.  I would like clarification on this because if the appointment is not under a term of contract I cannot see any role for the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I would also like to hear the Minister on a matter which I think is very important in the science and technology industry, the keeping of our good and bright graduates at home.  I know the Minister and the Department are very well aware of the fact that many of the very bright graduates in this area are being snapped up by companies in Britain, Europe and America and are being lured out of the country before they have done their final examinations. That is a very sad situation but it is something that has to be looked at. A plan is necessary to encourage our good graduates to stay at home.  It is a very essential element in being productive in this area.</P>
    <P>There is only one other point I would like to make and perhaps it shows my ignorance of our native language.  The new word for the agency is Eolas and the Irish Science and Technology Agency is the English term.  I am not sure what the word &ldquo;eolas&rdquo; means but I believe there could be confusion as it would not be associated basically with science and technology.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the explanatory memorandum states, the purpose of the Bill is to combine the functions of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and the National Board for Science and Technology, to dissolve the National Board for Science and Technology and to change the name of the institute to Eolas, the Irish Science and Technology Agency.  The Government recognise the competitiveness of Irish firms in both the industrial and services sectors and their capacity for growth will be largely determined by their ability to keep abreast of technological change and <Col N="213" /> to apply it effectively.  Failure to understand this fact and to respond positively will result in a further widening between standards of living here and in other EC countries.  We recognise that the implications for our economy arising from new technology are such that it should have a central part in all economic policy formulation.</P>
      <P>By bringing this Bill before the House the Government recognise the need to concentrate our resources on those areas which have the greatest potential for industrial job creation.  The objective as set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is the creation of approximately 20,000 gross extra jobs on average each year over the next ten years.  The Government also have plans for a radical reorganisation and simplification of the industrial promotion agencies to provide a combined approach to the growth of the indigenous manufacturing sector. The initial measures to be taken as set out in this Bill are the amalgamation of the IIRS and the NBST for the promotion and integrated development of all industry. The roles of these agencies complement each other in so far as the statutory responsibility for advising the Government through the ministry of Industry and Commerce on policy for technology on science rests with the National Board for Science and Technology.  The NBST have defined their overriding objective as developing a cost effective national effort in science and technology, emphasising their application to industrial and economic development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NBST at present operate a number of their own programmes in this regard. They also provide technical representation to the European Community, the Space Agency and the OECD.  The principal functions of the IIRS are to assist on the use of science and technology in industry.  Their main task was defined in 1984 as the seeking out of companies and sectors where product and process improvements will lead to significant growth in output and better product quality.  Their main activities are industrial research, provision of consultancy <Col N="214" /> services, technical information and advice to industry.  I believe that the combined efforts of this new agency will better assist in the development of the technical capabilities of indigenous manufacturing companies, an area which badly needs support particularly in the field of new technology and development.</P>
    <P>There are various reports which have been commissioned in recent years which include the Telesis report, the NESC report and the White Paper on Industrial Policy.  These reports clearly indicate that Irish industry comprises of two distinct sectors.  On the one hand, we have a modern, foreign-owned sector providing approximately 80,000 jobs which are heavily involved in chemicals, electronics, pharmaceuticals.  The USA are by far the largest single source of investment in this area.  On the other hand, we have an indigenous sector which is heavily involved in traditional product areas and which has essentially failed to lift its horizons beyond a small home market.  Profitability is low and sufficient funds for reinvestment are not being generated. All available material on the technological capabilities of indigenous manufacturing firms points towards deficiencies on a scale barely compatible with a developed economy.</P>
    <P>In 1985 the Sectoral Development Committee published a report entitled &ldquo;The Technological Capacity of Indigenous Irish Industry&rdquo; and this, I am sorry to say, paints a pessimistic scenario.  The report concludes that:</P>
    <P>(1)  Even in growth areas such as electronics, plastics, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, and mechanical and electrical engineering, the indigenous component mainly comprises small firms producing low value added products with a medium to low technological capacity.  Growth is confined to companies of overseas origin and there is no sign of improvement in favour of the indigenous firms.</P>
    <P>(2)  Traditional sectors such as clothing, textiles, printing and packaging are dominated by indigenous manufacturers <Col N="215" /> and these sectors are in decline.  The technological capacities of these firms are low to medium and the indications are that their decline will continue.</P>
    <P>(3)  The innovative capacity of indigenous firms is low with a consequential negative outlook for future expansion.</P>
    <P>(4)  There are major technological gaps particularly in those technologies with the greatest rate of change such as engineering technologies resulting from electronic developments, e.g. the computer-aided design and manufacture.</P>
    <P>(5)  There are major skill deficiencies in our indigenous firms particularly with regard to the newer technologies but also in design, quality assurance and knowledge of materials and</P>
    <P>(6)  the lack of skills in the technological and technical areas is mirrored by similar deficiencies in market intelligence and information system, poor marketing performance, lack of equity capital and lack of strategic planning.  The principal aspects of the new approach to science and technology are encouraging.  They include: &mdash; a new national programme in Biotechnology &mdash; a new national programme in advanced manufacturing technology &mdash; a new trading companies programme &mdash; a new pilot programme in the south-east region on the application of science and technology to regional development.  The National Board for Science and Technology is making major contributions to the Biotechnology programme which is giving a new dimension in the developing area of higher education/industry co-operation.</P>
    <P>I believe that the amalgamation of these two prestigious agencies working in harmony will greatly enhance the environment for industrial exploitation of biotechnology in Ireland.  These operations involving biotechnology will be <Col N="216" /> supported by the centres of excellence, through the involvement with the centres of Irish subsidiaries of major pharmaceutical companies which will lead to greater research and development by such companies, through the creation of an even more favourable climate for attracting new overseas development and through the stimulation of Irish enterprises.</P>
    <P>Biotechnology is an important new area of high technology.  It may be defined as the application of biology to industry.  As biotechnology is such a wide field covering, as it does, all the life sciences there is considerable room for development and growth.  In the past ten years Ireland's research programme in a variety of biotech sciences has developed and has commercially exploitable units in many areas.  A number of companies have been established in recent years which include Bicon, Nortech, Flemming and other companies.  It is interesting to note that Nortech was established following extensive research carried out in UCG.  In the food industry companies involved in biotechnology development include Cadbury, Kerry Co-Op and Guinness's.  These companies clearly demonstrate the commercial viability and financial potential in this area.</P>
    <P>However, the overall picture with regard to biotechnology in Irish industry is less reassuring.  In 1984 a survey carried out by the National Board of Science and Technology which investigated 160 companies in the food and drinks industry reported that: the level of expertise in the Irish food industry is low and needs urgent attention; the food industry will have to consider the employment of biotechnology-related graduates; the commitment of some companies to invest in biotechnology is strong if a suitable niche can be identified; the number of companies that see biotechnology is the main factor in expansion and increasing profitability is sizeable; unlike countries such as the UK there has been little entrepreneurial activity to date in biotechnology. However, some initiative has been taken in so far as the Institute for <Col N="217" /> Industrial Research and Standards already has a biotechnology unit at University College, Galway.  This unit currently provides a very valuable service to small industry in this area.</P>
    <P>In 1984 the Industrial Development Authority and the National Board for Science and Technology submitted a joint plan to the Government for an Irish biotechnology initiative.  I am pleased to see that the national biotechnology programme was established in June of this year.  The programme has a number of objectives: (1) to encourage the research activities in Ireland by home based and overseas companies in order to develop the biotechnology industry in this country; (2) to establish a significant reputation for Irish biotechnology research and thus help attract overseas companies to locate in Ireland.  These objectives will be achieved by establishing, equipping and staffing centres of biotechnology research expertise in the universities which is a step in the right direction. We have got probably the best educated youth in Europe and I believe we should be making better use of this great natural resource as an aid to industry.</P>
    <P>These centres are being developed around research topics in which there is existing Irish expertise and which are relevant to Irish industry.  I hope to see the programme expanded and developed in the coming years.</P>
    <P>There has been a more recent development in the field of plant biotechnology which is presently receiving particular attention due to its connotations as a food provider for the developing world.  It is reasonable to assume that this developing field could create a substantial number of jobs within the next decade provided the institutional and infrastructural facilities are made available.  I believe the amalgamation of these two agencies is a step in that direction.</P>
    <P>Traditionally constraints of food production derive from traditional methods of cultivation and production.  Biotechnology is pushing back the horizons of plant production and facilitating the rapid multiplication and hence the production of a wide variety of disease-free food <Col N="218" /> plants.  These plants are particularly suitable for growth in countries with scarce natural resources such as Ethiopia, Sudan and other sub-Saharan countries.</P>
    <P>It is my earnest wish that this new board of science and technology will act swiftly in association with the EC, the United Nations, the World Bank and other world agencies to develop this new science of biotechnology, particularly in the propagation of food plants and to apply it in Third World countries to ensure that the Ethiopian disaster will never be repeated.</P>
    <P>There is an Irish company operating in Saudi Arabia which a few years ago grew no plants apart from the few traditional things like date palms.  This company has revolutionised the dairy industry in Saudi Arabia.  It is interesting to note that Saudi Arabia now has a surplus of wheat.  There is no reason why this expertise could not be extended to the African countries. This exercise has proved that all that is needed is the know-how, the technical expertise which is there and has been established and proved and the necessary finance.  Once again I appeal to the Government to take the initiative in this area and to pursue actively agricultural development in these African countries.</P>
    <P>We recognise we must develop technological expertise if we are to progress. There is substantial EC support available. The EC has three funds from which considerable support could be expected for the national developments which it is proposed to undertake.  There is the Regional Fund which can provide considerable assistance for infrastructural measures on the capital side which includes buildings and equipment where they are required.  The Government are actively pursuing the application of this fund to desirable capital developments in the field of science and technology.  There is the Social Fund which provides considerable assistance towards training costs and work experience for young graduates and technicians.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say that Ireland's take up of the Social Fund in the science and technology sector is minimal at present which is partly because we have taken so <Col N="219" /> few initiatives in this respect.  I am sure the Government will now make a determined effort to ensure that such initiatives are taken with the aim of channelling the funds towards re-equipment and additional staffing of the scientific laboratories, particularly in our third level colleges.  Thirdly, there is EC funding in the research budget of the Community in which Ireland has already established a good record due to the excellent work of the NBST staff.  They are concerned with promoting the take up of these funds in industry and the higher education sector.</P>
    <P>However, the research budget only funds operational activities and does not contribute to the establishment of the cost of equipment and facilities.  Because of the scarcity of investment in this area our take-up from this budget is currently less than it should be.  I hope that the situation will be corrected by an increased national commitment on the capital side towards a national, scientific and technological infrastructure and through a better co-ordinated take-up from the Regional Fund.</P>
    <P>I welcome this amalgamation of the two agencies but I would like reassurance from the Minister that the valuable services provided by the IIRS at present will not be diminished.  This service is particularly valuable to small manufacturing firms; it includes technological acquisition, product development, application development, materials selection and sourcing and manufacturing design. The IIRS also run a very valuable information desk service and they have a considerable data bank of which small and indeed large companies avail themselves. I hope there will not be a diminution of this service to industry.</P>
    <P>There was something else the IIRS mooted some time ago.  It is important and it is in regard to the dumping of products from developing countries, products that carry no quality or standard marks.  The IIRS in the past favoured the idea that there should be product testing at point of import to ensure that products meet with Irish and EC standards.  At Christmas time particularly we see the <Col N="220" /> import and the sale of dangerous toys for young children.  I would like the new agency to look into that area because the market has been flooded with inferior products from countries outside the EC.</P>
    <P>Finally I would say there is a need to get new technology into our indigenous industrial sector.  We can get this by technology transfer from companies in America, Japan and other more developed countries.  I would like this agency to pursue that area.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a leading part to play in the emerging world of high technology.  We are ideally placed to play our part and to become a high income country with high productivity but to achieve this ambition we must do more to help the people who are actively working in the area of technological research and development.  The policy measures outlined in the Bill will give real support and leadership to the makers and doers of our scientific and technological community.  I believe the amalgamation of the IIRS and the NBST will go a long way in giving these people the means to generate growth and progress for the future development of our country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other speakers in expressing a warm welcome for this Bill and compliment the Minister on the initiative he has taken.  Coming from a rural area where we stand to gain so much from the new technological development, I think it is exciting news.  The provisions of the Bill create a lot of interest and excitement in rural Ireland and especially in a remote county like Donegal.  The new emphasis on technical development is necessary and is very welcome. This country largely missed the industrial revolution that took place after the war.  European countries went ahead and are competing fiercely with each other in engineering business.  The production of cars and other engineering goods has now reached a very high stage of development in all European countries and in the UK.  We were largely left out of that revolution.  We were dependent to a great extent on agriculture.  This was fine in the past but we have now reached <Col N="221" /> a stage at which the new technology is being used in agriculture and if we were not involved we would be left completely out.  We recognise that we have been light years behind in technological development. In fact we are so far behind that one of the biggest problems will be to encourage our young people to get involved.  Many people of my age may be afraid of new technology and may need a lot of encouragement to use it.  That is one of the difficulties we will face in this country.  I believe that while we have a big number of young people here at second and third level who will benefit tremendously from the new technology we will need a major effort to involve all of our young people and everybody else.</P>
      <P>I stand up to support this Bill mainly because I was very fortunate.  I was one of a number of people up in Donegal who had the pleasure of welcoming the Minister to our county to introduce the first star programme where the new technology made it possible for people in Donegal to communicate live and visually with Dublin, Brussels and Copenhagen on a live link.  I am pleased to say that that is a permanent link assisted by the Minister.  We in Donegal recognise the foresight and the assistance he gave us in bringing us out of the dark ages because in fact it is not too long since we had to use the turn handle telephone up there.  The modern technology brings us out of the peripheral area into the technological world in which we have not so far participated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is of particular interest to us in rural Ireland.  We recognise the effort and the work the Minister has put into this and we support him totally.  We would encourage him and we recognise the value of what he is doing for rural Ireland.  Much more value and much more interest will accrue in rural Ireland than in the city.  In our third level institution, our regional technical college in Letterkenny, the Minister will agree that we have shown foresight and have been abreast of new developments.  We are participating in the new star programme which is being provided for under the <Col N="222" /> new measures.</P>
    <P>This is a welcome development.  We would have some reservations.  When the new technology is introduced on a wide basis the only bodies that could handle it in rural areas would probably be regional colleges.  We see that if you absorb senior people in regional colleges in modern technology you might create a problem. At present in our regional college we have a community development programme, we have the information technology programme and we have incubator units.  We hope that the provisions now being introduced in this Bill will make it possible to co-ordinate business innovation centres in rural Ireland and that that will remove the remoteness whereby business innovation centres can participate on a European basis and that small industries will find it possible to communicate and to co-ordinate with major centres in Europe and the whole of the technology area will be available on a co-ordinated basis.</P>
    <P>I believe it is necessary to have a lot of training at the introduction of the new technology.  Introducing the Bill and providing the funds will not go far enough. A lot of training and guidance on how to use and to take full advantage of all the new technology that is available will have to be given.  I trust that the Minister will set up within his own Department people who are prepared and have the time to give guidance and assistance to rural areas that want to participate and want to be involved.  This is one opportunity that cannot be left to the city dwellers and those who are located in the capital. This is a new measure of technology and it must not only benefit the big centres of population.  Great care should be taken by the Government to make sure that those who want to participate and those who should participate in the rural areas will have an equal opportunity.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that my county was one of the first to be involved in the new technology that has been made possible with the new initiative taken by the Department.  I support the Bill and welcome it.  The people of Donegal are excited and very interested in supporting <Col N="223" /> the Bill, too, and look forward to participating in the many new technological developments that will now be possible as a result of this Bill.  Rural Ireland will be brought into focus and for the first time will be allowed to participate on an equal footing with the bigger centres of population.  The Bill is very welcome and there is a great interest in it in the country. I just hope that great care will be taken and great guidance will be given on how best to approach the involvement of our young people in this new technological age.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that there is an overwhelming argument in favour of the decision the Government have taken in principle to amalgamate the National Board for Science and Technology and the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  That being said, it is regrettable that either in reality or in perception this is a cost cutting exercise. I could not find any reference in the Minister's script to redundancies but I recollect that at the time when this decision was taken there was a suggestion of redundancies resulting from this, voluntary redundancies albeit but nevertheless redundancies.  Far from redundancies in this area this country needs an extensive and increasing investment in technological research and the related areas referred to in the Minister's script which are the objectives we all share.  Looking at the objectives the Minister described or attributed to Government policy for science and technology, one of them is of considerable importance and that is intensifying the application of modern technologies in indigenous industry.  I remember reading a recent publication of the Department of Finance on the prospects for the economy. They produce a graphical comparison between the performance of what were called high tech industries and the remaining industries.  The performance of the high tech industries was one of rapid and considerable growth.  Notwithstanding even the general recessionary conditions within this country high <Col N="224" /> technological industry was expanding and expanding rapidly, the remainder was not.  The tragedy is, of course, that the vast majority of high tech industry is not indigenous and the vast majority of indigenous industry is not high tech. There are startling and impressive exceptions but by and large that is the case.  It is becoming clear to me at least, though the Doheny Nesbitt school of economics would not subscribe to the view, that the view this country has failed economically because of taxation policies or other policies is to say the least imprecise and in fact is probably totally wrong.  The failure has been a failure of indigenous industry to respond to new conditions.  It has been a failure of indigenous industry to understand the world it was moving into, to respond to free trade, the insistence of indigenous industry on seeing free trade as a threat and not as a possible opportunity and a general collapse in that area which could not be compensated for even by the spectacular performance of high tech industries.  It is a fact that we should address that for instance the enormous growth in exporting industries which represent half of our GNP still fails to produce more than about a one to one and a half per cent growth overall in our gross national product which suggests that that part of our gross national product which is attributable to non-exportable production of goods and services is actually contracting at an alarming rate at the order of 4 or 5 per cent per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You cannot talk about two sectors of our economy, one which is the high technological area which seems to survive in spite of the admittedly high levels of personal taxation, in spite of the high levels of interest rates in this country and a number of other things and still manages to boom and at the same time look at the failure of indigenous industries based on the home market to expand and blame it all on something that applies to them all like taxation or interest rates. There is obviously a more fundamental flaw and that, in my view, is related to the third objective which the Government have set themselves, that is, the failure to apply modern techniques in <Col N="225" /> indigenous industries and increase industrial innovation.  There was an OECD report on innovation in Irish industry. Notwithstanding the attempts of certain interest groups in the industrial area to suggest that all the OECD said was that we should reduce capital gains tax, the OECD did a very detailed study of the lack of an innovation culture in this country and identified a number of things, among them research, a lack of an innovation culture in our education system and suggested that, if we were going to create an innovation culture in our industrial and manufacturing sector, we needed an innovation culture to run through our education system from the very beginning.</P>
    <P>The first prerequisite for innovation is creativity and imagination.  To have creativity and imagination fostered in our young people requires a form of educational provision which is different from what we currently provide.  It requires small classes with a capacity for teachers to supervise children in an imaginative way.  I think I am receiving what I would describe as a non-verbal warning from the Cathaoirleach.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was attempting to identify the connection between science and technology and education.  The Minister's speech makes considerable reference to the academic area.  I do not think you can create an innovation culture simply by pouring money into third level education, notwithstanding my own interest in that area.  An innovation culture is based on the capacity of citizens to do a number of things.  The first is to think creatively.  The second is to have the skills at their disposal to translate that sort of creative thinking into modern saleable products; and the third is to have the resources to follow through those ideas from conception to production.  All of those things are inter-related and, simply providing money to more and more university academics to do more and more research will not necessarily <Col N="226" /> create an innovation culture.  It is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for an innovation culture.</P>
      <P>We also need a much different approach to what science and technology are about in terms of second level education and we need the beginnings of an innovation culture in terms of encouraging imagination amongst school children. They all relate to each other.  The only reference I was going to make to primary education was to point out that the more an education system becomes simply a process of handing out information to be regurgitated by students at whatever level it is done, the less it will be a system which encourages innovation. What we need most fundamentally in this country is a capacity to think originally and to think creatively in the areas where manufacturing industry is most likely to grow.</P>
      <P>I welcome what is being done by this Government.  My only argument with the Government is not about the policy objectives they set themselves, on the future they identify for this country, but the fundamental contradiction between the policy objectives they have set and some of the policy decisions they have taken.  I agree fully and support the policy objectives they have set themselves.  I do not believe it is possible to reconcile the view of a high-tech country with a high level of technological and scientific sophistication with the closure of An Foras Forbartha.  There is a fundamental contradiction between the two policy decisions.  One is a playing down of the role of scientific research, of the assembly of information, of the protection of the environment and things like that which are an inherent part of developing a real high-tech environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea that there is a trade off between high technology industry, whether it be in the biotechnology, chemicals or electronics area and the price that must be paid by our environment is pure and utter nonsense.  Any suggestion that we have to sacrifice those things that are most precious to ourselves in the environment in order to create industrial employment is rubbish.  It is <Col N="227" /> simply a story that is foisted upon us by people in manufacturing industry who are either unwilling or unable to operate efficiently.  Industrial efficiency is the most important single objective that we need to develop, not just relatively efficient manufacturing industry but the most effective and efficient manufacturing industry in Europe and the most effective and efficient indigenous manufacturing industry in Europe.  That is why we have to look at ourselves.  I do not dispute the value of attracting in international multinationals companies in the areas where they have been involved, but we should stop believing that they are the only ones who can provide the industrial development.  It is important that we get beyond seeing science and technology as a service to attract in multinational investment.  Investment in science and technology ought to be as much a concerted attempt to encourage the development of large indigenous high technology industries as it is an attempt to attract in existing industries from outside.  What we need are high technology industries which are rooted firmly in this country's natural resources and its location relative to important markets.</P>
    <P>One thing that is still lacking in the area of science and technology policy is the question of who will take the risk for all the well educated young people who are coming out of universities, national institutes, regional technical colleges, many of them with ideas but without capital.  One of the weakest points in our strategy is that we are prepared to invest huge sums of money in capital, in labour, training and educational schemes but not much in ideas.  We do not have a particularly high proportion of our natural product devoted to research and development. It is extremely low.  A policy decision has to be made here over a number of years to push up the proportion of our gross national product that is being devoted to research and development. The small countries of Europe that have been successful in competing in the international environment, and have been successful in developing themselves <Col N="228" /> into high tech, high wage economies, have all programmes of research and development that are light years ahead of ours.  This is not a criticism of the present Government but it is a criticism of all Governments we have had.  There is no point in making a token gesture towards research and development. Research and development of their nature are both expensive and risky.  The figure I give my students is that if one in 100 ideas comes to production you ought to be reasonably happy.  Therefore if we are to encourage on a large scale people to start up indigenous high technological industries we will have to accept the possibility of failure on a large scale. There is no way of picking winners at that level.</P>
    <P>I believe in the industrial development policy in general whereby the State can pick winners.  I do not believe you can pick winners at the level of fundamental research or at the level of applied research.  You have to accept that many ideas may never come to fruition or, if they come to fruition, it may be in 30 or 40 years time.  It is interesting that the person who in the thirties or forties &mdash; I cannot remember the decade &mdash; did an enormous amount of study on silicon concluded that silicon was probably never going to have any commercial use.  The truth is that silicon later on became the fundamental building block of the whole micro-chip semi-conductor industry which is the bedrock of modern information technology.  The man who did that research concluded it was an interesting subject but it was not going to be of great commercial benefit.  We are going to have to accept that.  The media attitude that sees every industry that closes down as a slap in the face for the IDA and a failure is wrong as far as that goes.  It cannot be allowed equally to conclude that because we spend huge sums of money on research and not much comes out of it in a one, two or five year time scale that our research programmes are failing.  That sort of attitude is the direct antithesis of what we require in this country if we are going to move from what we are, a semi-Third World country <Col N="229" /> into a real European country like all the other small nations of Europe, producing high quality products from high technological industries with a workforce that is highly paid.  That is the objective we all have.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that this is not in any way a romantic idealistic vision.  The truth is that it is a small nation in Europe outside the EC which has the most modern industrial base in the world. It is a country which has the highest number of robots per thousand workers in the world and that is Sweden.  It has a vastly more automated manufacturing base than either Japan or the United States.  It has succeeded in doing that not because it sat back and waited for multinationals to invest but because it succeeded in developing many of the world's best known high technology firms in a whole range of areas.</P>
    <P>It is important that we should not believe we have to go with a supplicant begging bowl, that we are of an inferior mentality, looking for other people to show us how.  Anything that somebody else can show us how to do has already been done.  What we need to do in this country is to develop new ideas, to develop products that have never been sold before, to develop technologies that have never been used before and they should be based, not necessarily exclusively, but largely on our indigenous resources.</P>
    <P>I take issue with the Government on the general thrust of economic policy on this point.  What is needed is the leap from a dependent economy to an independent economy based on our own ideas.  It will not be cheap and cannot be done on the cheap, and, therefore, involves large scale investment.  It involves large scale investment at all levels of education.  It is wrong to assume that it can be done simply by investing in third level education. I do not want to stray too far but the sort of qualities of imagination, curiosity and innovation that we need so much will be developed in primary schools as much as in third level institutions. <Col N="230" /> If we do want to do that, then we cannot do it on the cheap.</P>
    <P>A commitment should be given to a gradual phased increase in the proportion of gross national product invested in research and development.  There is no point in simply saying that it will be done by creating incentives for manufacturing industry.  One of our difficulties is that most of our manufacturing industries pay either no or very low levels of corporation profits tax and, therefore, tax breaks on research and development are not particularly attractive, particularly to multinationals. We have to do it ourselves.</P>
    <P>A recent edition of <i>The Economist</i> states that most research and development in any country is funded by the State; it is a question of whether it is funded directly or indirectly.  Therefore, if we are going to increase the proportion of our gross national product which is being spent on research, the State is the only source those funds can come from. They can only come from the State through taxation and, therefore, we cannot pretend we can simultaneously cut back on public expenditure, particularly in this area, and at the same time create a climate of innovation in the areas of science and technology.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I welcome the Bill, with one exception, I do not believe this is the time for reducing the numbers employed in any area of science and technology. We are hopelessly under-resourced in this area in terms of people and the resources available to them to develop new ideas.  I do not believe we can succeed in the objectives the Government have quite rightly set it if, at the same time, a climate of continuous and increasingly severe cutbacks dominates this area of activity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeEogan" hpid="Professor Eogan Professor Eogan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Eogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill with considerable enthusiasm.  I was very pleased to have heard the Minister say earlier that we certainly need a strong and well-developed scientific and technological base in this country.  Therefore, the development of science and technology and the maintenance of standards are essential so as to allow wider developments <Col N="231" /> to take place and to bring about improvements in industry and in other fields from which we shall all benefit.</P>
      <P>Unlike some other countries I am afraid our investment in scientific research is rather low.  Firms, industrial firms and other firms, also place a low value on research.  Of course, this inhibits development.  A scientific and technological base is essential not only to enable us to cope with major shifts in attitudes but, more importantly, to lead the way forward and bring about innovation. We need a major change in opinions and attitudes and I hope that the establishment of Eolas will help us to bring this about.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, the new board will by and large be an adviser to the Government but will also administer some of the Government's policies in relation to science and technology.  It will also have other functions one of which will involve the authorisation of standards which, of course, is a very importrant aspect of the work of the board.</P>
      <P>I have been particularly interested in this wide range of additional functions of the agency.  I would generally agree with all of these and indeed I am particularly interested to see that one of these additional functions is to prepare a national programme for science and technology. It is also very important that the new agency should engage in international activities in science and technology and become involved in conferences and in various other external research programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hardly necessary to say, therefore, how essential it is that the State opens up scientific development.  To do this, a sound infrastructure is essential.  We must attempt to identify strategic research areas and these must not be solely short term projects perceived by current industrial needs.  A correct balance must be achieved and maintained between long and short term projects. The aim then should be an open policy in which research proposals can be considered on their intrinsic merit and not <Col N="232" /> just confined to deals in which one might anticipate quick results.</P>
    <P>One certainly gets the impression that from the point of view of industry there is an attitude in some quarters that long term research can be detrimental to short term achievements because of the fact that scientific personnel might be tied up and, therefore, the companies would not have the results within a short space of time.  In considering this new agency and considering the new board, we must take into account &mdash; and I hope the board will also do this &mdash; that such attitudes might be shortsighted because basic research, in other words, discovery, is very fundamental to allow us to develop along the lines which this new agency is being set up to do.  We should not allow our emphasis to shift too much towards one side or another.  Indeed, there is often a tendency to allow the emphasis to shift just that much towards the applied sciences and to neglect the basic or fundamental research.  Furtherore, it is of course essential to build up a body of experts and it is vital that we have people who are involved in investigation at the most up-to-date and advanced level.  We must, therefore, develop a broad background as well as a specific one.  We need people who are engaged in solving problems, be they in industry or otherwise, as one can never tell what is going to be important. It would be rather shortsighted to assume that we knew it all at the moment and that all we have to do is apply our knowledge.</P>
    <P>In this connection, the thrust of some of the activities in the past of the National Board for Science and Technology has been to focus to some extent on the interaction between universities and industry. Indeed, one gets the impression that if we shake a magic wand and extend the university activity into industrial research, industry will flourish.  This can be too idealistic.  It need not be an instant formula for success in an Irish context.  It may work in some places abroad but what happens, say, in the University of California need not be relevant to Ireland. America and other countries are in a different industrial environment and <Col N="233" /> their structures need not transfer particularly well.</P>
    <P>I hope that the new agency will be given as much responsibility as possible to look after its own affairs.  It should have as much autonomy as is feasible. Certainly if the hands of the board are unnecessarily tied this could seriously inhibit its functioning as a vigorous and lively body, a body that should become the leader in attitudes and be at the forefront of new thinking.  This agency must be concerned not only with scientific facts but with the development of all other scientific aids at the highest intellectual level.  Therefore, I find section 12 slightly out of place.  It refers to the fact that the agency, with the approval of the Minister, can institute and conduct research into and studies on such problems relating to science and technology as it considers appropriate and may publish or disseminate the results of any such investigation as it considers appropriate.  I would be concerned that there might be an inhibiting factor here or that an inhibiting factor could creep in.  All research involves a certain amount of risk and a certain amount of travelling new ground and I would hope that this in no way would be restricted.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I hope that a great deal will flow from the establishment of this new agency.  I trust also that the establishment of the new agency will help to increase the profile of science and technology within the thinking of the Government and, indeed, of the people in general.  This is essential for all of us because we can all benefit from it. Countries that have developed a high level of scientific and technological infrastructure have achieved a great deal materially and, of course, Finland is a case in point.</P>
    <P>I hope, therefore that we are embarking on a new and fruitful era for scientific attainment in Ireland and in doing this I wish the Minister well in his work in this field.  I also trust that the new board will go about its work with commitment and that that will also apply to the staff which, <Col N="234" /> of course, have certainly shown dedication in the past in the various bodies with which they were associated.</P>
    <P>I hope that my final remark is not out of place but I do not think that we should consider that scientific and technological development started today or yesterday in response to what, perhaps, some other people have been doing, notably the Japanese.  We have a very old and respectable tradition of technological development.  I know what happened in ancient times may not in any way be relevant to today but it is a fact that, for instance, during the Bronze Age Ireland was one of the four major industrial producing centres at that time and I would hope that with the passing of this new Act we will be moving again towards much greater industrial and scientific development and that this in turn, is something which will aid and benefit all of us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss Wallace Miss Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other speakers in welcoming the Science and Technology Bill, 1987.  It is indeed good to see these two agencies, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and the National Board for Science and Technology being brought together formally. The functions of the new body are well defined in section 8 of the Bill which is by far the longest section.  I would be concerned though that no reference is made to fee earnings by the new body, whether it should earn fees or must earn fees or how much it should earn.  Section 8 (1) (b) states: &ldquo;to advise the Government or the Minister on the Agency's initiative...&rdquo; This in effect allows the agency to contribute and to assist the Government without having to be asked. Section 8 (1) (c) to 8 (1) (i) elaborate on the way in which the single body of professional people are to advise, provide and co-ordinate the advancement of science and technology for the good of the State both economically and socially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 8 (3) (b) is most important, that is to prepare and review periodically a national programme for science and technology.  It is essential that this periodic up-date takes place.  Section 8 (3) <Col N="235" /> (c) to 8 (3) (h) detail the particular functions of the new institution, only some of which have an income directly associated with them but, indeed, all of which will cost money.  I would like to see emphasis being placed on income from these functions such as in the existing policy of the IIRS of pushing towards higher income targets each year.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment, as indeed the Minister did in his opening remarks, the very good work carried out by the board and the staff of both the IIRS and the NBST.  The excellent work carried out by these two bodies should now be more dynamic in Eolas.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill clearly establishes an annual science budget and this is to be welcomed as is the review in section 10 of the programmes provided for in that science budget.  This is essential and should ensure that action rather than lip service is paid to science and technology.</P>
    <P>Section 25 of the Bill covers the confidentiality of information obtained.  This is very important.  It is good to see that it is stressed again in the new legislation. I suggest, however, that at a future date the fee of £500 on summary conviction should be looked at.  It seems very low particularly because of the specialised nature of this work.  Indeed, it could be considered profitable to breach confidentiality at times.  Perhaps at a future date a larger figure could be included to represent a greater deterrent.</P>
    <P>Overall, I welcome the Bill which demonstrates the continued work of this Government to utilise the State finances in an effective, economic way and, most important, particularly in the areas of a science budget, reviews of the effectiveness of the budget and a national programme for science and technology.  The legislation shows an important commitment to science and technology.  I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Dr. McCarthy)</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <Col N="236" /> I sincerely thank Senators for their valuable contributions to the debate on this important legislation.  I hope I will be able to cover satisfactorily most of the points raised.  Senator Reynolds was concerned about the name of the new agency, Eolas, or the Irish Science and Technology Agency.  Eolas, we decided would be appropriate.  Since we still have a great arid dear love for our language, Eolas representing the Irish for &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; is appropriate.  That name was chosen after a lot of consideration had been given to it.</P>
      <P>Senator Reynolds was also concerned, as was Senator Brendan Ryan, about the fact that there is a drop back in the amount of grant-aid.  The 1988 Estimates provide for grant-aid of £9.777 million to the agency.  This compares with a grant-aid in 1987 of £7.927 million to the IIRS and a grant-aid of £3.349 million to the National Board for Science and Technology, a combined total of £11.276 million. The saving involved, therefore, is £1.499 million.  This saving will be achieved through a reduction in staff numbers, a reduction in overhead and administration costs, and an increase in own resources generated by the new organisation.  The Government have also provided for funds for the continuation of the science and technology development programme in 1988 at least at the same level as in 1987 which was £3.1 million.</P>
      <P>It is proper to refer at this stage to what we actually have succeeded in doing since 10 March with the £3.1 million which was allocated to us in the Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce. We established a biotechnology programme in June.  The programme has as its objectives to encourage research activity in Ireland by both home based and overseas companies in order to develop the biotechnology industry in Ireland and to establish a significant reputation for Irish buyer technology research and thus help attract overseas companies to locate in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These objectives will be achieved by establishing, equipping and staffing centres of biotechnology research expertise in the universities.  These centres are <Col N="237" /> being developed around research topics in which there is existing Irish expertise and which are of relevance to Irish industry. Three such centres were nominated by me in 1987 in University College, Galway, University College, Cork, and NIHE in Dublin.  I propose to expand that programme in 1988 to encompass other university activities.</P>
    <P>An advanced manufacturing technology programme has also been established under the fund to help industry to cope with the rapid advances in manufacturing technology.  Four advanced manufacturing technology applied research units have been established in colleges of higher education since the Government took office.  These were in Trinity College Dublin, University College Dublin, NIHE Limerick and University College, Galway.  The programme aims to direct the high calibre engineering skills in these centres towards meeting the needs of industry.</P>
    <P>Specifically the research units will provide research and development support to industry involved in both the use and provision of advanced manufacturing technology.  Each of the four units is involved in complementary aspects of advanced manufacturing technology. Other programmes which are being developed &mdash; which have either commenced or are being developed at the moment &mdash; include the teaching companies programme to which I will refer later.  That subsidises the placement of highly qualified graduates in science and engineering fields in Irish industries.  The south eastern region pilot programme in technology development seeks to co-ordinate the representatives of all the State technology and development agencies and higher education research institutes in the south east region with a view to developing an integrated technology based plan for the development of the region.</P>
    <P>As I am sure Senator Reynolds now appreciates, in the process of the amalgamation of the two agencies, the IIRS and the NBST, it is natural that there would be a reduction in costs because we no longer have to rent accommodation <Col N="238" /> premises.  There will, obviously, be a reduction in staff by way of voluntary redundancies because we cannot have duplication.  It is not a cost cutting exercise. It is a streamlining exercise whereby we will have one single agency doing in a singular fashion, under the direction of my Department and the Government, what was done by the two agencies heretofore.</P>
    <P>Senator Reynolds was also concerned about how the chief executive and the agency might be appointed.  He referred to section 15 of the Bill.  The appointment of the chief executive will be a matter for the board of the agency.  Section 15 of the Bill provides for the appointment of the chief executive by the board under a contract of service on terms and conditions agreed by the Minister and the Minister for Finance.  The appointment will be made by the board, not by the Minister.  I can assure the Senator if he has any worries or fears, that that is the way it will be.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulroy raised a number of questions.  He was concerned that the services of the IIRS should not be diminished particularly for the smaller firms. I can assure Senator Mulroy that there is no intention to reduce the services which are provided by the IIRS to Irish industry. I consider this to be one of the most important activities in which the new agency will be involved.  The need for indigenous industry to upgrade its technological capacity is a need of which I am very aware.  The new agency has a vital role to play in bringing about the necessary upgrading.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulroy also made the point that there are two distinct sectors in Irish industry, the modern foreign owned sector and the indigenous sector with low profitability.  He also gave some examples of high tech emerging companies.</P>
    <P>One of the main functions of my office will be to upgrade the scientific and technological capacity of indigenous Irish industry.  As I said earlier, the programmes on biotechnology, manufacturing technology and microelectronics are all aimed at including the technological capacity of Irish firms.  The <Col N="239" /> teaching companies programme which I referred to earlier is specifically designed to place the most highly skilled graduates in small but promising Irish industries. Senator Mulroy also referred to the IIRS biotechnology unit in Galway which he believes provides good service to Irish industry and he also referred to plant biotechnology.  For the information of the Senator, the IIRS unit in Galway is being integrated into the national biotechnology programme and in relation to plant biotechnology this is now being examined as an area of real potential for the future.  Ulcombe Company in Roscommon is working in this field and hope to supply Third World countries.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulroy was also concerned about EC funds.  He referred to our opportunities under the European Social Fund and the Regional Fund and suggested that our take-up under the European Social Fund has been minimal.  I am aware of all the opportunities available under the various EC funding schemes. To the best of my knowledge the take-up by Ireland of the Social Fund is widely used in the training of young people in the regional technical colleges, for example. As regards the Regional Fund, I intend to avail of Regional Fund moneys for science and technology related regional development which includes infrastructural developments.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan made a point in his speech that this country largely missed out in the earlier industrial revolution. We must ensure that this will not happen on this occasion.  I would agree with the Senator &mdash; even though it is probably not advisable to say so &mdash; that it was a good thing to have missed out.  If you look at it this way, having missed out to some extent in earlier industrial development, we do not have at this stage the same restructuring problems or the mothballing of the ageing industrial giants which are problems some other countries have.  I agree with Senator McGowan that we must not miss out in this technological era, this new era of change.  If we do I believe we will become a Third <Col N="240" /> World country from the economic viewpoint.</P>
    <P>We must select and identify appropriate areas for development and develop spin-off industries to maximise the opportunities, building on our inherent strengths and resources.  That is an objective which we intend to pursue through the agency on one hand and through my office on the other hand to ensure that we will be able to identify our areas of strength and to introduce new technologies and new programmes of research and development.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan also mentioned the importance of the involvement of rural areas in science and technology programmes. Without wishing to suggest that he was involving himself in a classical rural-Dublin divide, may I say, as far as I am concerned, we are committed to ensuring that science and technology and research and development are introduced right throughout this country from the cities to the most isolated rural areas. One of the examples he gave was when I was in Letterkenny two weeks ago where we had a live video conference taking in Letterkenny, Dublin, Brussels and Copenhagen.  That clearly exemplified the fact that we can now make the world so much smaller by the use of new technologies and that is what we intend to do. I believe that if we commit ourselves to it, all parts of Ireland including the most isolated parts as well as the cities can and must benefit.</P>
    <P>I want to ensure that there will be regional development in science and technology.  That is why I designated the south-eastern region as a pilot area for science and technological development. In case anyone might be under any misapprehension or illusion as to why the south-eastern region was chosen as a pilot area may I say it was chosen because we had carried out a recent technological audit of the entire country to ensure the south-eastern region was the most appropriate to be chosen as a pilot area.  That is why we decided to start at the worst area first.  If they can really do a good job it will be easier to develop the other areas as we go along.  I am sure Senator <Col N="241" /> McGowan is also aware that proposals are under examination under the international fund for Ireland, the Anglo-Irish fund, to establish a programme for science and technology development in the north-west region, which I am sure will be of enormous interest to him.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan made a number of points which I will endeavour to deal with.  He said that in merging the two agencies reducing staff in science and technology was not a good way to go about it.  May I say specifically that the purpose of merging the two agencies is not to create redundancies or to reduce staff.  Its purpose is to ensure that we have one single agency that will work in an absolutely singular direction under my office so that science and technology and research and development are improved throughout the country.  If there is duplication &mdash; which there is, there is no point in us pretending to deceive ourselves &mdash; between personnel in the two agencies as they at present exist, obviously there will be redundancies.  At this stage I cannot say exactly how many redundancies there will be but they will be on a voluntary basis, and on the terms and conditions applying to the public sector in general. The only reason there will be redundancies &mdash; and voluntary ones &mdash; is that there is duplication at present. We hope that will be eliminated in the future.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan also compared the failure of low-tech indigenous industry with successful highly profitable, high-tech companies.  He made the suggestion that taxation alone is not the reason many of our indigenous low-tech firms have failed.  I agree completely with him.  This is what the Government are dealing with. It is the reason I was appointed as the first Minister of State with responsibility for science and technology to ensure that we convince indigenous Irish firms that they must introduce new technology into their firms, that they must get involved in research and development.  That is why we introduced the teaching company schemes so that we could place graduates in those firms.  It is clear that the products that are good and profitable today will <Col N="242" /> not necessarily be the products that will make money tomorrow, next year or the year after.  Take for example the pharmaceutical industry, if no research and development had been done by pharmaceutical companies we would probably be still stuck with penicillin as the only antibiotic and I am sure millions of people all over the world would continue to die; we would not have any modern antibiotics that we have now.  If we had not technological research and development in the motor industry we would still be travelling in antique cars, as Senator Daly agreed, at 10 m.p.h. unlike the magnificent types of cars which Senator Daly sells.  If we were cycling we would not be going at the high speeds of the Stephen Roches and the Sean Kellys; we would be going around on three wheel bicycles. We must be prepared to respond to change in the new and developing world. Science and technology and research and development are the life blood of the new approach which we must have towards industry.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan referred to the OECD study which was carried out two years ago and pointed to the lack of an innovation culture in this country.  I would agree with this.  I want to encourage an innovation culture, placing young graduates in firms is one step towards this.  Other methods are in place to encourage young people to think originally.  For example we have the young scientist of the year competition, the national innovation awards which I presented only last Monday and which were put in place following the OECD report mentioned by the Senator. I hope to promote an innovation culture in every way I can.  I assure the Senator and the House that that is the absolute intention of the Government and that is why we have this particular thrust and drive in this direction.</P>
    <P>Senator Eogan referred to the development of a national programme in science and technology.  This is provided for in section 8.  I would like to reply to the Senator briefly on this programme and to say that it is my intention to ask Eolas to develop a strategic national research programme.  As a small country we <Col N="243" /> simply cannot afford to undertake all methods of research in all areas and disciplines. We will therefore have to make some choices.  I will have to direct our resources towards those areas of opportunity which are appropriate to this country and its development.  Senator Eogan was concerned about section 12 of the Bill.  This was a power which the NBST had and the wording is taken unchanged from the National Board for Science and Technology Act, 1977.  This actually is a gap filling function to be exercised only with the approval of the Minister to ensure that it will operate only as a function of last resort and that an over-ambititous agency will not lightly embark on work which might be carried out by other institutions.  I hope that that allays any worries the Senator might have about that.</P>
    <P>Senator Wallace was anxious that we would ensure that there was a real and continuing emphasis on the pre-earning aspects and in particular that there would not be any losses as a result of the establishment of the new agency.  In this regard I would like to say that this income-orientated aspect, as she is aware, already exists.  The international activities are referred to in section 8 (3) (g).  Ireland has mainly through the good efforts of my Department and the National Board for Science and Technology been most successful in winning research for us from EC research programmes.  The effort will be maintained to continue this good work.  Only a couple of months ago we finalised the research and development framework programme for the next five years which unfortunately had been held up from the beginning of the year because of the intransigence of a Government in another country.  Senators can work that our for themselves.  We have done quite well and will do well over the next five years.  We will get a grant agency benefit of approximately £30 million which we hope will benefit Irish industry and Irish development.</P>
    <P>I consider this legislation to be very important.  I see the establishment of Eolas as a major step in creating the <Col N="244" /> vibrant science and technology base which will spawn off new industry and new jobs and will assist existing industry not only to survive but to develop and prosper.  The Government recognise the urgent need for indigenous industry to intensify its use of the modern technologies and to upgrade the quality of its products.  There is also an urgent need for the innovative skills of our people to be nurtured and allowed the opportunity to develop productively.  The new agency will be spearheading the drive in both these important areas.  I conclude by thanking the Senators for their support for the Bill.  I hope this agency will be very successful.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 8 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very long section embodying the main thrust of the provisions of the Bill.  There are a number of points I would like to ask the Minister about.  This section is almost like a collection of very worthy goods and substantial aspirations that everything everybody wanted to do and to know about technology is included in this section.  There are a few specific points. Subsection (10) (b) states:</P>
      <P>to prepare and review periodically a national programme for science and technology in consultation with relevant institutions,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The word &ldquo;periodically&rdquo; occurs later on in the same section as well.  Would it be more useful and more helpful if there was simply a period of three years or every five years put on that to prepare and <Col N="245" /> review a national programme?  One of the great failures in this country has been the absence of a national programme and this Government have tried to put such a realistic programme into place.  My worry is that if the programme was to be reviewed and changed on an arbitrary basis the word &ldquo;periodic&rdquo; is not sufficiently precise.  It could lead to either very frequent changes where the programme is zig-zagging in various ways with no real coherence, or it could mean that there is no great pressure on the new board to do any fundamental rethinking. Between now and Report Stage the Minister might think about whether it would be worth putting a specific time period on this section.</P>
    <P>On section 8 (3) (g) line 20, I wonder about the need to involve the Department of Foreign Affairs in all of this.  My feeling is that the fewer agencies involved the better.  If the new board is competent, it should be competent to judge what is or is not appropriate within its own charter without having to consult with the Department of Foreign Affairs.  That will add an extra layer of bureaucracy.  I would like to know if the Department of Foreign Affairs under this section can actually say no to a proposal or whether they merely give their advice.</P>
    <P>I raise this in another context.  Over the past number of years quite a number of people from all parties in both Houses have sought to develop friendly relations with the Republic of China at Taiwan. We have done this for a number of reasons.  I was one of these people and there are many others in both Houses who have been to that country as guests of the Government of Taiwan.  Part of our brief as we saw it there was to try to attract investment from that country. They have this great balance of payments, great surplus, and they are interested in developing high tech industries in this country.</P>
    <P>We, on an all-party basis sought to invite them here.  On every occasion when a trip was organised, the Department of Foreign Affairs said: &ldquo;no, it is not appropriate for you to go there, it is not proper, you should not do that, it is <Col N="246" /> not playing the game, there is some sort of rule within the European Community which rules out Taiwan ever since relations were established with mainland China.  Every other country in the European Community has a relationship with Taiwan, every other country is trying to attract investment from that country to their own country, every one of them is breaking this so called agreement yet our Department of Foreign Affairs, in an extremely priggish way, have lectured Members of both Houses about what they should or should not do.  I wonder, in an area like this what is the point of having the Department of Foreign Affairs there if they do not have a veto.  If the agency is sufficiently well established and sufficiently knowledgable it surely is able to make its own judgment in this matter.  There are a few other aspects of this section I would like to come back to but perhaps, I could raise those two for a start.</P>

      <P>Senator Manning is a bit concerned about the words &ldquo;review periodically&rdquo; in section 8 (3) (b).  He says it is a bit vague. We felt it appropriate not to specify a particular deadline type of date for reviewing these things.  I can assure the Senator that it is my intention in relation to the review of all major national programmes in science and technology to provide for an ongoing assessment and review by a specialist subcommittee of the board.</P>
      <P>I have already established in one area such a committee on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis in respect of the national biotechnology programme.  These committees will operate somewhat along the lines of the programme management and review committees for the EC research programmes. That should be satisfactory because it will be ongoing.  It would be better to have that rather than to say we will have a look at it every three years and see how it is working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>My main worry would be that at some stage if the agency was <Col N="247" /> not doing terribly well, the word &ldquo;periodically&rdquo; could allow it to slide out of actually doing the review.  Something stronger might be possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The agency will have to report on a continuing basis to the office of science and technology and to the Minister.  I cannot see that there is any real loophole whereby the agency could be doing an ineffective job and get away with it.  We will be able to scrutinise that carefully enough.</P>
      <P>As regards Senator Manning's point in relation to the Department of Foreign Affairs and whether there was any need to involve the Department and whether they say no.  In practice, the position is that the Department of Foreign Affairs are advised by the Department of Industry and Commerce in the case of any major international activity.  To date I have not had examples of any vetoes being imposed in my area of responsibility. In the case of certain international agreements, it is the practice to collaborate with the Department of Foreign Affairs.  For example, our ambassador in Brussels has power to be a signatory to certain international agreements in science and technology between the EC and third countries.</P>
      <P>As regards the problem which the Senator seems to have in regard to Taiwan and the Department of Foreign Affairs, all I can say is that perhaps the Senator might take the matter up with the Department of Foreign Affairs when the particular vote is being discussed.  It would be quite inappropriate of me to get involved in that area.</P>

      <P>Section 8 is very broad and basically is the nucleus of the whole Bill.  Many of the subsections are very broad.  Subsection (6) gives additional functions to the Minister.  I was wondering, after all the functions that are <Col N="248" /> stated previously, what other functions basically would the Minister have involvement with.  Section 9 (3) states that details of the financial allocations finally approved for the financial year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one other aspect of section 8 I want to mention.  I find section 12 is not basically necessary because the Minister has already made reference to its provisions in section 8 (1) (f) and section 8 (3) (e) and (f).  I refer to the reference &ldquo;to promote, research, to engage in such activities related to science and technology as may be approved by the Minister and to disseminate and promote the dissemination of literature and information relating to science and technology&rdquo;.  Section 12 covers basically the same thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 8 (6), which Senator Reynolds is concerned about, empowers the Minister, after consultation, to assign additional functions to the agency.  I consider this to be a useful and appropriate provision because in the future, as a result of the process of rationalisation or for other reasons, it may be appropriate to assign new functions to the agency, and it is necessary to have the power to do so.  For example, if the Government decided on the basis of the advice of the agency to revise the functions of an existing institution or to dissolve an existing institution, they might well decide to pass certain of the functions over to Eolas.  In this situation the power provided in this subsection would be essential.</P>
      <P>As regards Senator Reynolds' point about section 8 (1), the various objectives set out there may seem broad but we have tried to ensure that they are as comprehensive as possible to encompass any eventuality that might arise.  They are actually taken directly from the 1977 National Board for Science and Technology Act.  It is actually a duplication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="249" />
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (5) states that the agency shall not engage in or promote any activity of a primarily military relevance without the prior approval of the Government.  I wonder what we actually mean by &ldquo;primarily military relevance&rdquo; and will the agency in practice be required to draw up a check list of what is or is not a military type activity? With regard to research which will be geared for some type of military activity, will there then be different degrees and gradations within that?  If, for example, research has been carried out on some aspects, say within the agency of this Bill, something which may well affect the use of satellites &mdash; I know the Minister has a special interest in star wars &mdash; that can be used both in peaceful terms and for military terms how will that decision be made?  Will there be a special set of criteria so that the Government of the day do not find themselves accused of supporting an agency which is involved in military type research or activity.</P>
      <P>Could I suggest to the Minister that, when this section is sorted out, the Government whose approval is required here should be as open as possible in this matter.  We are a great nation for conspiracy theories &mdash; people who will get a piece of information who will then say that this agency, on Government approval, is engaged in research on satellites which are being used for NATO systems and therefore, a secret deal has been done.</P>
      <P>We have all come across this sort of conspiracy theory where, from a very small starting point, we can suddenly find ourselves not just involved in NATO but probably starting the Third World War. I suggest that, if this clause has to be invoked, the Government and the agency should be as open as possible from the very beginning so that the conspiracy theorists are cut off before they can cut loose with their fantasies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the problem which Senator Manning has put on section 8 (5), it is self explanatory.  I am sure Senator Manning is aware of the fact that this again is an exact duplication of <Col N="250" /> what is in the 1977 National Board for Science and Technology Act.  That subsection arose as a result of an Opposition amendment at the time which was accepted by the Minister of the day. Obviously it is to ensure that this agency will not get involved in scientific research and development which would involve us in any association with an organisation such as NATO.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this question earlier about the word &ldquo;periodically&rdquo; I raise it more seriously at this point because when the effectiveness of programmes is to be monitored, those who are involved in the programmes, who are in receipt of funds, should know that they will have to account for what they are doing on a regular basis.  I presume the agency will be setting up boards of assessors, and so forth, to review programmes I do not expect the Bill to be changed at this Stage but, where specific programmes are to be reviewed, there is a very strong case to be made for having this over a fixed period of time so that the people involved know when they have to be accountable and that they will be working within that more definite framework.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The point Senator Manning makes is very fair.  I can put on the record of this House that I intend to have sub-committees of the agency reviewing all programmes and ensuring that public moneys are being used in a useful and cost effective way, that there is true and proper accountability and that the science budget for each year is open for full and complete discussion as to how it is being utilised in both Houses.  When we have an agency with sub-committees <Col N="251" /> reviewing it and that agency is under the aegis of the Office for Science and Technology with the Minister of the day keeping constant observations on its workings and how the budget is being utilised and it is clearly put before both Houses and open to discussion by Members of both Houses that will ensure proper accountability and proper efficiency.</P>

      <P>I mentioned this on Second Stage and I am still not quite happy.  The section states that the board of the agency shall appoint a person to be chief executive of the agency under a contract of service on such terms and conditions as may be agreed to by the board with the approval of the Minister and the Minister for Finance.  Basically it is the Minister's appointment.  I know the board have to agree to it, but if the <Col N="252" /> Minister did not agree to the appointment would the individual be appointed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is self-explanatory. The board of the agency will appoint the chief executive of the agency.  The Minister and the Minister for Finance have to agree to the terms of contract of service and the terms and conditions. They would have to be subject to the approval of the Minister and the Minister for Finance.  There is no question of the Minister appointing the chief executive. I can assure the Senator of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>This in fact is standard in every Bill of this sort.  I simply want to say what I said on a few occasions in the past that I disagree with it very, very strongly.  It is unnecessary and a positive discrimination against politicians. Members of either House should not be barred from being members of a board of this sort.  I can see many benefits. Obviously very few Ministers would ever appoint anybody from their own party because of the danger of being misrepresented. Frequently there are people in both Houses of the Oireachtas who have a special expertise and skill and interaction between specialised State <Col N="253" /> boards and the Houses of the Oireachtas is an important one.</P>
      <P>Governments can be trusted to behave in a responsible way in this manner and to only appoint people who are fully qualified to boards of this sort.  This is positive discrimination against politicians. It could lead to a situation that a person who was a member of a board, who had political aspirations and a genuine contribution to make, would be debarred.  He or she would feel debarred from coming into politics because of the certainty of losing his or her place on a board.  In that case there is a loss to politics because of people of potential saying that they will not come in for that reason.</P>
      <P>The political dimension and political experience on a board of that sort can often be extremely useful indeed.  The former Senator FitzGerald is on the board of the Governors of University College along with me.  I note there that with all of the high powered academics, the contribution of the politicians on that board often has a level of common sense and a level of wider experience which is greatly welcomed if the board are making up their mind on any matter.  I know the Minister cannot change the position.  I will not even ask him for his particular views on it.  I am simply saying I do not like it.</P>

If he wishes a change in relation to items such as these, which are standard, he should have a chat with his friends in Fine Gael and with some of his numerous friends in the Fianna Fáil and Labour Parties to see if they might bring about a change.</P>

What is a non appropriate gift in this way, will there be guidelines?  I am trying to look for examples.  If for instance, in the case of medical biotechnology a gift which was aimed at, say, research into abortion clearly would not be an appropriate gift.  Will the guidelines be fairly clear?  I do not see this sort of thing arising very often.  My question is really whether there have been in the past fixed guidelines for this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to appear to be nit picking on this.  It really is a question which arises over a whole range of State activity covering the whole area of official secrets and what are and are not official secrets.  No person who is or has been a member of the board shall disclose any information classified by the agency as confidential.  Does that mean that the agency has a system in operation where information is classified on a highly confidential, highly secret basis?  Could a person find himself in a situation where talking to a few people who are in the same area of activity, a few scientists talking together, somebody working for the board, could find that in Doheny &amp; Nesbitts, for example, on a Friday evening he or she might very well disclose some sort of information which is then picked up and that person could then find himself suddenly either liable to a £500 fine or likely to be fired from his job?</P>
      <P>It is a problem which happens much more than in the cases to which this agency will relate.  It is right across all State information and we do not have the same paranoia as our friends across the water in regard to State secrets.  Maybe we have fewer of them or maybe the definition of an Irish secret is where you tell one person at a time.  Whatever it is my main question really is whether the agency have a system of classification so that a person will not inadvertently walk into a situation where he may find that he is in breach of this section.</P>

      <P>As Senator Manning is aware this is a standard provision taken from the 1977 NBST Act.  Confidentiality is important in relation to the work of the agency particularly in contract work where patents or inventions may be involved.  Common sense would dictate to anyone working with the agency that where you have an employee of the agency doing contract research work for industry obviously that is an area of very <Col N="256" /> special confidentiality.  A breach of that would obviously give enormous advantage to competitors in the industrial market.  Common sense would dictate to an employee where that person would be in actual breach of confidentiality.</P>

      <P>Just two quick observations on that.  Under the 1977 Act were prosecutions ever brought under the corresponding section?  I wonder about the £500 fine.  If a person is prosecuted and found guilty in addition to the £500 fine I presume that dismissal is automatic or is that the case?  The £500 fine seems to be a rather low limit if in fact the disclosure of information could well have a monetary value in many multiples of the £500.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Any Bill relating to social welfare needs to be seen in the context of poverty in this country.  I thought one of the most astonishing and distressing poverty-related statistics published in recent times was the information from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul that they would need an increase of approximately 40 per cent in their income for next year to provide service at the level they were accustomed to providing in the last 12 months.  That is evidence from a dispassionate and unchallengeable source about what is happening in our society.  The St. Vincent de Paul Society is beginning to find that some of its conferences are running out of money because poverty is becoming so extensive, particularly in the larger urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increasing evidence of deepseated and endemic poverty particularly amongst large families on long-term unemployment assistance, suggests that <Col N="258" /> the commitment made by the Government to maintain the standards of living of people on social welfare is not only not being met but is a mockery of the truth. What we are seeing is the sacrificing of the poor in our society in order to meet a set of what are not absolute economic objectives but are ideological imperatives imposed on this Government by what I described in an earlier debate as the Doheny-Nesbitt school of economics which is based far more on people's experiences outside this country &mdash; I am talking about the economists in this case &mdash; than on the experience of the people of this country.</P>
    <P>I note too that in Cork the Simon Community, with whom I have some association, had to stop giving away food at the door of the night shelter because what had been one or two families a week became ten or 15 families a day and the very limited resources of the Simon Community could not sustain that sort of thing.</P>
    <P>The St. Vincent de Paul Society said that children are going to school hungry. I have a number of friends who are national teachers and they said that it took them about six months to figure out why it was that some of the children in their classes were less than fully alert and involved.  Then they realised it was hunger which was the problem and that the children were either having no breakfast or virtually none because there was no money in their homes to provide food. In the context of deterministic economic models of how this country must operate, this sort of human story cannot be allowed to be put on the back burner because the economists do not want to face them.  I will talk about some more of them later on when I talk of some of the things that some of my colleagues spoke about.  In the context of poverty in our society and its remedy, we should not allow ourselves to be persuaded that there is some sort of immutable ceiling of expenditure beyond which we cannot go without some sort of unquestionable consequence resulting from it.</P>
    <P>It needs to be said here, in the light of <Col N="259" /> the fact that we spent the last two or three hours on the Science and Technology Bill, that the economic models which have decided that we can only afford a certain level of social welfare are no more than the products of human imaginations. They are not scientific rules in which a particular sequence of events can produce an always predictable consequence. They are the assumptions of human beings about the way people live. Consequently, in terms of any analysis of social welfare expenditure it is not good enough to say that we cannot afford to pay any more.  To make that assumption begs the question of a number of other more fundamental assumptions about taxation, about public opinion, about the perceptions of people in our society and the needs of the poor.  Therefore, as I said at the beginning, in the context of a society where poverty is now endemic and increasing, a presumption that we cannot extend and increase levels of social welfare payments is both arguable in principle and also challengeable in so far as it is an extension of a particular economic ideology and one that I find both intellectually unacceptable and humanly revolting.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat distressed that from what I heard of the debate &mdash; and if I am making a mistake I am happy to be corrected &mdash; but I did not hear a single speaker in the House, including the Minister, refer even once to the Commission on Social Welfare.  I may have missed it and I am open to correction and the Minister is free to correct me.  Just to put it on the record, there was a Commission on Social Welfare and it did produce a report.  I am not in a position to dramatically wave the report because the copy I got from the Library is one of the early copies that were leaked in a most peculiar way in June 1986.  Therefore, it is not something that I want to wave around.</P>
    <P>Whatever the arguments about the pace of change on the issue of the report of the Commission on Social Welfare and its conclusions, whatever the argument about the recommendations themselves or whether they are realistic, or correct <Col N="260" /> or proper, we should not allow the report of the Commission simply to slip off the political agenda.  As long as I am in this House and Social Welfare Bills come through this House, I hope I will be allowed to attempt to restore it to where it should be which is at the centre of all of our debate on the social welfare system.  It is a most comprehensive document. Like everybody, I could find aspects of it that I would disagree with but since it has not been referred to and since this Bill is about improving the social welfare system, I feel it imperative that somebody should refer at least in passing to the fundamental principles recommended or identified by that commission for reform of the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>In my view the report is quite well written in the sense that it is relatively easy to identify the guiding principles which they say should motivate the social welfare system.  They identify four guiding principles that ought to characterise a good social welfare system.  The four are: adequacy, comprehensiveness, consistency and simplicity.  Without delaying the House too long, on the question of adequacy there is one firm conclusion through the entirely of that report which I have not yet heard challenged by anybody and that is that the levels of payment are fundamentally inadequate.  I do not believe any economist &mdash; whether he be from the far Right or the far Left, and there are very few on the far Left and far too many, in my view, on the far Right &mdash; has challenged that fundamental assumption.</P>
    <P>Let us remember who the members were.  Apart from the obvious trade unionists and other people there was Eugene McCarthy from the Federated Union of Employers and Frank Masterson who is now a member of the Progressive Democrats and was a candidate in the last election who represented the Irish Farmers Association. So, a consensus did emerge among people with very different political and economic ideologies or philosophies, depending on how you want to describe them, that the levels of social welfare <Col N="261" /> payments in our society are of themselves inadequate to meet any sort of a minimalist definition of what is an adequate standard of living.  What we actually are saying is that we recognise that people on social welfare are poor and apparently, given the oblivion to which this report is now being consigned, we propose to perpetuate that poverty in the interests of some ideology or other which is only beginning to emerge in the present new Right economic consensus.</P>
    <P>Let us again have it on the record that the commission recommended a payment of between £55 and £60 a week as a basic level for a single adult.  Just to keep the record straight because there has been considerable talk in recent times about levels of payment and one would have the impression that people were living in a glorious world of high living on social welfare, I repeat the basic rate of unemployment assistance for a single person is £35.40 a week.  We are talking about levels of payment which are 60 per cent of what the social welfare commission regard as the appropriate level.</P>
    <P>That, of course, is the most fundamental reform that is needed in our social welfare system.  There is far too much woolly-headed fuzziness about welfare which says that poverty is not all about money, it is about environment and a whole lot of things.  Of course it is true it is about a lot of things other than money but it is also true that without a proper money income you can do all you like but people will still stay poor.  I want to put that on the record.</P>
    <P>Even more inadequate are the rates of payment for child dependants.  I think that in a society that has made such a fuss out of its commitment to the family &mdash; though the evidence in terms of legislation and expenditure is not there to support that fuss &mdash; and in a society which touts its Christianity as something that is supposed to distinguish it from what are described as the pagan states of Europe, it is extraordinary that we have the most inadequate levels of child support payments in the developed world.  The recommendation of the Commission on Social Welfare that the levels of child <Col N="262" /> benefit that should be available to a family on social welfare should be sufficient to guarantee an adequate standard of living for the children is one that we have not even begun to address.</P>
    <P>The OECD proposal on the taxation of social welfare would be a far more reasonable consideration if levels of welfare were at what could be described as adequate levels of payment.  In other words, if people on social welfare were approaching the sort of levels of income that we would regard as the minimum acceptable in a civilised society, then one could say that the question of taxation could begin to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The other three criteria the commission used were comprehensiveness, consistency and simplicity.  They identified major gaps in the coverage of our society, particularly in terms of social insurance.  Some steps have been made in that direction under the national <i>Programme for Economic Recovery</i> and I welcome them.  I am very glad that PRSI has been extended.  My own view is that everybody in our society ought to pay the same rate of social insurance on their incomes irrespective of whether they are in the public service, in the private sector or self-employed.  I also think that their incomes ought to be assessable in a way which ensures that my income for taxation purposes is similar to that of a farmer, or indeed &mdash; at the risk of incurring Senator Farrell's wrath yet again &mdash; a self-employed person.  I do not think anybody in our society believes that all sectors in our society are evenly or fairly or adequately taxed.  We may have made some progress there.</P>
    <P>I could not find the reference to consistency but I know the commission somewhere identified a vast number of different levels of payment of child benefit. The commission were not able to find any single reason to justify the vast range of payments made for adult social welfare recipients, why it should be one level, for instance, on supplementary welfare of £34 per week; on urban unemployment assistance, £35.10; on non-urban unemployment assistance, £34; on the widows' non-contributory pension, £46.20 for a beneficiary under 66 years of age.  There <Col N="263" /> is a whole panoply of different rates of payment.</P>
    <P>I would still like to hear from some Minister or some Government what is the rationale behind that huge set of variations in rates of payment.  Nobody has yet been able to explain them.  Senator Cregan mentioned that it was possible, for instance, that an old age pensioner could have less demands for expenditure than a single, unemployed person and, indeed, that argument could be made.  If there is a philosophical basis to these variations let us hear it; if there is not, let us at least hear a set of policy objectives set before us even if the timescale is ten years for eliminating all these inconsistencies and all this confusion.</P>
    <P>Finally, the commission chose to evaluate the social welfare systems in terms of its simplicity.  The one thing that I can say, that the Minister, I am sure, can say, and that every Member of this House who has to do clinics can say &mdash; something that I do not and am fortunate not to have to do; although I suppose it would be a useful and worthwhile learning experience &mdash; is that the social welfare system is not simple.  It is, in fact, quite the opposite of simple; it is daunting in its complexity.  I do not accept any more that that is entirely accidental because there are policy decisions being stated and implemented which all seem to push us in one direction, that is, to make social welfare less accessible and more difficult for people (a) to know what they are entitled to and (b) to gain access to it.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in any discussion on any Bill to deal with or change the social welfare system, the commission's report ought to be stitched into the record. While I do not propose to take the remainder of the night to read the whole of the report of the Commission on Social Welfare into the record, although I may yet be compelled to do it if nobody else is prepared to talk about it, some of what I would regard &mdash; and it is a selective list &mdash; as the more important recommendations of the commission ought to be put on the record.</P>
    <P>It is important that the provisions <Col N="264" /> under which people lose social welfare entitlements because of benefit in kind resulting from board and lodgings should be dealt with and disposed of.  In the summary of the commission's report they recommend that the means assessment for adults over 25 years should not include any assessment of general household living standards; for example, benefit and privilege should be excluded from the means test.  It is a minimal requirement that the dignity of an adult over 25 years of age should not be taken away from him or her by endeavouring to pretend that he or she is a dependant of the people with whom they happen to share a home.  That is clearly a pressure on people to leave the home they live in, to move into independent accommodation and, in my view, quite likely to move one step closer to homelessness.  Nobody can argue that on present rates of social welfare assistance or social welfare benefit anybody could adequately pay for private rented accommodation and we do not have a lot of public accommodation available to single people.  That problem should be addressed and should be addressed quickly.  I would like to hear people address the realities of Irish economics instead of telling us we simply cannot afford to pay because I do not believe that.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to read all the recommendations on the issue of the payment structure onto the record of the House. Suffice it to say that in the summary alone there are 15 recommendations on the payment structure, not all of which, incidentally, are enormously costly.  Many of them have to do with reorganisation as much as with the scale of payments. There are other areas where the commission makes recommendations which would not necessarily cost anything but could, if they were implemented, transform the experience of people who are compelled to depend on the social welfare system.  In particular, the simplification or the standardisation of the whole area of social assistance would make a considerable contribution.</P>
    <P>In our society, given the values we espouse, the most promising, the most <Col N="265" /> challenging and the most important recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare are on the whole issue of child income support.  I am not by any means academically qualified in the area of studies on poverty, but there seems to be an increasing international consensus that the single most effective income support to ameliorate poverty is in the area of child income support, of child benefit at the maximum possible level paid directly to whichever spouse is responsible for bringing up the children.  We cannot justify in our society measures that are being threatened, not just to not increase that but to actually cut back on the level of child benefit.  There is an increasing hypocrisy in Irish politics between the touting of our values as a family-orientated society and the continuous grinding down of families by inadequate payments and humiliating processes of evaluation.</P>
    <P>There is much in this report on the treatment of the unemployed.  I think it will not be too long before we will require people who are unemployed to wear a white star on their coats to segregate them from the rest of society.  Our society seems to be, and seems to be encouraged to be a society which is more and more making it obligatory on unemployed people to prove that they are entitled to something and to justify it in an increasingly rigorous way in the interests of dealing with what we are told is widespread abuse &mdash; and I will return to that later on.  The process of treating unemployed people as it is presently organised &mdash; I have to say this &mdash; seems to be deliberately degrading and deliberately intended to keep them under control.  As Michael Smurfit said in Galway &ldquo;the level of social assistance we must have is the one which prevents the risk of social disorder&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is what we are at: it is an instrument of control.  The way people are treated in a labour exchange is indicative of that control philosophy.  People are regulated and controlled.  The fact that people in our society, with 250,000 unemployed, have to humiliate themselves by knocking on the doors of employers they know have no jobs and have had no jobs, <Col N="266" /> for two years just to prove that they are actually looking for work, is a systematic exercise in human degradation and should be ended.</P>
    <P>That is not a justification for any abuse; it is a justification of the right of any citizen in our society to have his or her dignity not just preserved but advanced. The fact that one is dependent on welfare excuses no reduction in one's rights or dignity.  The whole process of the labour exchange is degrading and humiliating. The new &mdash; what I would call &mdash; Woods rangers, who are being set up to hound, analyse, programme, query and challenge the unemployed is a further burden on the backs of people who are already humiliated by the process of signing on and what has to go with it.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming the officials of the Department of Social Welfare who work in labour exchanges.  They must have the most appalling job that anybody in our society now has, given the numbers of people involved, the complexity of the system, the pressures on them to prevent this &ldquo;large scale abuse&rdquo;.  I am always fascinated that the greater the constraints on Government expenditure, the greater the level of abuse that suddenly becomes apparent.  Abuse is one of the great excuses for frightening people off welfare. If in the process people who have no reason to be frightened are lost, it is just too bad because it reduces the expenditure.</P>
    <P>The commission have much to say on the delivery process.  On the issue of the delivery of social welfare payments there is ample room for radical reform without much in the line of increased expenditure. Is it too much to expect that claimants, as in recommendation 55 of the summary, should be given a choice of having their payments made by means of electronic fund transfer to a named account at a bank, post office or other financial institution?  Is it too much to expect that that should be done comprehensively, not on a small pilot scheme but universally?  Is it too much to expect that the premises should as far as possible be upgraded and that standards of amenity <Col N="267" /> and privacy should be on a par with those in other service premises?</P>
    <P>Is it too much to expect that anybody who is going to be asked intimate questions about family circumstances should be guaranteed privacy?  I do not think it is too much to expect but given the present dominant right-wing ideology we will not make much progress on it because the economists would not approve.  They have convinced our society that most of the unemployed are chancers and dossers who will rip off the system if they are not firmly tied down and controlled.</P>
    <P>With regard to the appeals system, the commission are excessively gentle.  They make certain recommendations.  They would not cost a lot of money and they would, in my view, remedy what is a substantial defect in the area of social welfare appeals.  We had, after some huffing and puffing, an interesting debate in the dying days of the last Seanad on the whole issue of social welfare appeals.</P>
    <P>I found it extraordinarily interesting how extensive was the consensus in this House that there was something wrong with the social welfare appeals system.  I introduced a Bill on the subject and every Member of this House who spoke on it agreed that the appeals system needed root and branch reform.  They did not necessarily, and understandably, agree with the proposals I had made but they did believe there was a need for a fundamental restructuring and reorganising of the appeals system.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has announced that something like this will be coming but one can only comment with a certain degree of scepticism that the reforms which involve reductions or withdrawals or impositions or coercions or investigations seem to be able to be introduced quickly.  Those that might involve improving the lot of social welfare recipients, those that might involve enhancing their dignity, seem to require an awful lot more consideration and seem to take an awful lot more time to be implemented.</P>
    <P>On the issue of the commission, I would remind the House again of the <Col N="268" /> priority recommendations of the commission. The first was that the basic payments should be increased.  No amount of talk and no amount of posturing can get away from the fact that that is what the commission identified as the first priority of reform in the social welfare system &mdash; a fundamental and dramatic increase in the levels of basic payments. The second one and I quote:</P>
    <P>Our recommendation for improved child income support should be included in the first steps towards the reformed social welfare system.</P>
    <P>The third is the broadening of the social insurance base.  On that immediate action has been taken, but it is dishonest to pretend that an extension of the social insurance base exclusively to raise more revenue, which is done without the implementation of the other priority recommendations is anything other than a sham.  The four priorities should be implemented together.</P>
    <P>The fourth is the delivery of the service and they recommend the accelerated development of computerisation.  I am pleased that we seem to be making considerable progress in that regard.  One hopes that the day when people in Cork are told they cannot be given information because their file is in Dublin is rapidly coming to an end and that the administrative procedures and the legislative base on which social welfare is operated will be consistent with the possibilities that exist with computerisation.  It would be most regrettable if we could not make full use of computerisation simply because of old-fashioned regulations or old-fashioned procedures.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, things that have happened in social welfare in recent times which do not augur well for the implementation of the report of the Commission on Social Welfare.  The rather extraordinary shift in thinking that has masqueraded as a reform of the fuel scheme is one that needs to be commented on.  The extraordinary phrase used by the Minister's press officer &mdash; in this case I am attributing responsibility to the Minister, I do not want to get <Col N="269" /> involved in criticising officials &mdash; when she said they had managed to reduce the heating season forced me into a rather ironic reply.  I accept that we are in a remarkably mild December week but I do not accept that the Department of Social Welfare had anything to do with it.</P>
    <P>The idea that you can reduce the heating season and not leave people cold for part of the year when they would otherwise have had heating is nothing other than a redistribution of misery between the poor.  You reduce the misery of some by increasing the misery of others: that is not what I call redistribution in our society.  It is not what I would identify as the sort of redistribution we should be dealing with.  May I say that I have very good legal advice to suggest that this scheme will also be disposed of by the Supreme Court and may I also say that I have been informed that the Supreme Court have shown an increased willingness to award damages to people who are the victims of improper use of social welfare legislation.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister ought to be careful that he does not walk the whole of the Department of Social Welfare into something far bigger than he intends.  I have no doubt but that these regulations will be challenged in the courts.  I have no doubt that they will be disposed of by the courts in the way that previous attempts to restrict access to free fuel were disposed of.  I found, in particular, the reference in the circular to the exclusion of persons of no fixed abode living in shelters or hostels a particularly mean-minded bit of penny pinching at the expense of some of the most vulnerable in our society.</P>
    <P>Going on the issue of what the commission recommended and what we are actually seeing and watching the fundamental contradictions that are beginning to develop, we have a number of decisions by the Government which fly in the face of everything the commission wished for.  The penny pinching, meanminded way in which the budget of the Combat Poverty Agency has been cut back, cut back and cut back.  Those who <Col N="270" /> might encourage poor people to speak for themselves, those who might encourage them to demand proper delivery of services, those who might encourage them to know and to fight back and to answer back have been so hamstrung that they will not be able to engage in any extra work next year.  Even the miserable £40,000 that was taken from them towards the end of this year is a disgrace and the Minister ought to be ashamed of himself for that sort of a concerted attack on what is one of the most worth while initiatives in the area of combating poverty this society has seen.  It is a disgrace and he ought to be ashamed of himself. In my view a man with any concern for the poor would have resigned rather than allow himself to do something like that. He cannot claim any justification or any right to speak as a defender of the poor when he allows that sort of concerted assault on the poor and those who defend them to be carried out in his name.</P>

      <P>You are always right. On this occasion I defer to your obvious correctness and I will refrain from such attacks and keep them to myself.  There are, of course, other areas in which one can only attribute &mdash; I presume I can criticise the Government?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>You would not give me a bit of advance warning, a Chathaoirligh, so that I would know when I was going to come to a sudden halt?  Without going too much further on the issue of the commission, two other areas have <Col N="271" /> guaranteed that the complexity of the present social welfare system will become an even greater inhibition or inhibitor on claimants.</P>
      <P>First of all there was the abolition of the National Social Service Board and that guarantee of independent information. I emphasise the independence as much as the information.  Knowledge is power and if you do not have independent access to the knowledge underlying a social welfare system, you will not be in a position to make use of that system.  Secondly, there is the hamstringing of the Ombudsman which has forced the Ombudsman to make, for the first time in the history of the office, a special report to the Oireachtas which, to my knowledge, has not yet been debated in either House explaining why he will not be able to carry out his functions because of the restrictions on his office.  It seems again to be part of a strategy to ensure a reduced accountability, reduced capacity of people to fight back and, in consequence, reduced uptake of welfare payments.</P>
      <P>May I say that I could not conclude on the whole issue of welfare generally, before I begin to talk about the Bill and some of the Minister's remarks, without saying that the obnoxious Jobsearch scheme has proven to be precisely what everybody thought it would be and, if the Minister does not believe me, he should talk to those in the unemployment centres in Cork and Waterford and Galway about their experience of the Jobsearch scheme.  It is a systematic harassment of people.  I will not go on any longer on it but the Minister quotes figures for people leaving the register.  It is time that people leaving the register include people who died and were taken off the register?  Is that part of his statistics of people leaving the register?  It does, perhaps, suggest a slight distortion of the figures.  Does the fact that people emigrate and therefore leave the register, count?  In other words, how many people left the register in a normal month before Jobsearch and how many have left the register in a normal month since Jobsearch in all categories?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="272" /> That is the only thing that is important, the numbers who leave, and of the numbers who leave how many of those were fiddling?  There are difficulties for people on short term training courses who would be quite prepared, for instance, to pay a child minder if they got a job because the job pays £60, £70, £90, or £120 a week and who are then asked to go on an AnCO training scheme for six months on £35 a week.  Because they have to pay a child minder they go off the scheme.  That is not of benefit.  That is squeezing people out because they happen to have children and it is discriminatory on that basis and that is not something that anybody should boast about.  Those people are not abusing the system.  They are available for work.  They will find child minders if they get a job but the idea that you must be able to pay for child minding on £34 a week or else be taken off the register is a downright disgrace and constitutes nothing less than an assault on people who happen to be unemployed.</P>
    <P>On the issue of abuse and the fact that this Bill has got away with masquerading as an anti-abuse measure when, in fact, the major abuse is the abuse of social welfare recipients contained in the sections beginning in section 8 and continuing almost to the end, that is the biggest single abuse we are talking about, not the abuse of welfare by recipients or their employers but the abuse of people on disability benefit, on maternity allowance etc. are contained in this, the astronomically long number of contributions people are being required to make.  That is the real abuse, the abuse of the poor by this Government in the interests of financial rectitude.  The earlier sections are nothing more than a very sophisticated deception which have lead the media into a position where they have ignored the assaults on the poor contained in the tailend of this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is a quite disgraceful performance by the media that the Minister was allowed on RTE last Sunday to go on at length about the most welcome proposals at the beginning of the Bill to deal with rogue employers but was not even asked a question about the assault on pregnant women <Col N="273" /> contained in the proposals on maternity allowance and the other proposals contained in the Bill.  I do not think the Minister should be allowed to get away with it and, since we will happily have a full Committee Stage in this House, unlike the guillotined Committee Stage in the other House, we will perhaps at least find out a little bit more about the rationale behind some of these offensive proposals.</P>
    <P>On the issue of abuse of State services, since people are getting so excited about social welfare abuse, one small statistic ought to be put on the record of this House just to show that there are other areas of abuse which need considerably greater attention but because those involved are more influential, or more powerful, or better politically organised, do not get attention.  There is a report in this morning's <i>Irish Times</i> referring to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General who says he has discovered there are 400,000 more ewes for which headage payments are being claimed than the Central Statistics Office has counted in the country.  There is a difference of 400,000 in the number of ewes for which headage payments are being paid and the numbers that the Central Statistics Office has claimed.</P>
    <P>We have about 400,000 mythical sheep floating around the country for which people are getting paid £11 per year.  That works out at almost £5 million a year from the budget of the Department of Agriculture and Food.  I suggest there will not be armies of inspectors touring the country trying to trap that down because the IFA are a very effective and vocal lobby which can protect their members when they are involved in that sort of abuse.  Perhaps there are 400,000 sheep hidden away that the Central Statistics Office never found.  It is meant to be slightly flippant but it does attempt to suggest that there are certain areas of abuse to which a blind eye will be turned and there are other areas of abuse where no such blind eye will be turned.</P>
    <P>I have to ask the economists outside this House, the Government and, indeed, the members of the previous <Col N="274" /> Government as well, what did the poor and the unemployed do to you to deserve the assault that is being made on them? There is no evidence to suggest abuse on the scale that is now being floated about. I do not know because nobody will say what the estimates of the figures are. Some people say it is estimated at 5 per cent; some people say it is estimated at 10 per cent; and some people say it is estimated at 2 per cent.  While he is prepared to assert in his script that he is deeply concerned about abuse the Minister will not put a figure on it, will not tell us.  I do not know how you can ever solve a problem if you do not know how big the problem is.  I find it extraordinary that we are solving a problem that we have never defined.  To the extent that I have any professional qualification and, after Senator Farrell's remarks I am not sure what my qualifications are&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think you asked for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very moderate. Considering the appalling assault he made on the decency of unemployed people I think I was very restrained.  I simply pointed out to him that the St. Vincent de Paul Society were more charitable than he was about these things. I did not think that was particularly offensive but, nevertheless, to the extent that I am professionally qualified my professional qualification is as an engineer. To the extent that I work I endeavour to teach, or to train, or to educate &mdash; you can choose which word yo wish &mdash; young engineers to work and in terms of what they do, a large part of their work is dealing with the solving of problems in real life.  The first thing they have to do is to define the problem, to define the scale of the problem.  Once they have the problem defined and the scale of the problem analysed, they begin to propose solutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we have in the area of social welfare abuse is an undefined problem which goes up and down depending on the extent to which right wing views have infiltrated the thinking of a particular <Col N="275" /> politician or economist but which nobody has ever quantified and nobody will quantify. Why cannot we have one independent, properly funded study of the extent of social welfare abuse based on information which will be published, based on studies which will be published. If somebody can produce documentary evidence on the scale of social welfare abuse I will quite happily support measures to deal with it proportionate to the scale of the abuse.  If the level of social welfare abuse is of the order of 1 per cent, the scale of the response in terms of what is done to average ordinary people on the dole is obviously quite different from what would need to be done if the scale was of the order of 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>If 1 per cent is a sort of level of abuse you would have to tolerate to ensure that people were not excessively abused 25 per cent obviously suggests grand scale abuse.  Therefore, the obvious first thing to do, and it is self evidently so, is to define the scale of the problem and nobody will do it.  Either the Minister knows or has a good idea of the level of welfare abuse and the areas in which there is endemic abuse, or else he is simply jumping onto the bandwagon which is so fashionable in this country and charging off into the wild blue yonder in a crusade against an abuse he has never quantified.  For all I know he may be charging off in the wrong direction, if he does not know how big the problem is.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, I am perfectly happy to support the porposals in this Bill.  I would say that most people ought to be astonished that it has taken so long to introduce some of these proposals into our social welfare legislation.  The idea that employers could obstruct inspectors of the Department of Social Welfare in some of these areas with apparent impunity and the idea that they could get away with all these sort of things is very wrong.  It seems to be a dreadful reflection of the philospohical base of our whole social welfare system that all of the measures of enforcement, all of the powers were all to do with recipients and apparently very little to do with those <Col N="276" /> who would have employed those recipients and obviously would have been in cahoots with them.  I agree with the Minister on this.  Where there is abuse of social welfare the largest areas are where there is collaboration between employer and employee.  I am satisfied about that from contacts in the trade union movement and people like that and they are satisfied, too.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to see the Minister make reference to public sector people who got involved in this.  It was a permanent complaint of people in the building industry that State building contracts were often given to employers who were involved in fiddling, in cahoots with their employees social welfare while those who did not involve in those practices and had to tender higher prices as a result lost out.  I am very glad these penalties are being introduced.  I will await with interest the first evidence that an employer ends up in jail because of the provisions of this Bill.  I was interested to see there are people serving prison sentences for social welfare abuse.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's script there were some interesting figures.  I referred already to what I described as Woods's rangers, who are the people who seem to be riding around the countryside swooping on unfortunate recipients of social welfare just to prove to the economists who are now our masters that we are doing our best to eliminate social welfare abuse.  Having heard the Minister talk about the external control unit, then about the special investigation unit and the internal audit unit I really would hate to be on social welfare because you would probably just get away from one when the next one catches up on you.  I want to quote from the Minister's speech.  He is talking about the external control unit and says:</P>
    <P>Because of the very close liaison between this unit and other divisions of my Department, claimants are interviewed where, in the light of specific information obtained, there is reason to believe that the person may not have a legitimate entitlement.  In this way, <Col N="277" /> legitimate claimants are not affected and at the same time the activities of the unit are much more productive.</P>
    <P>It sounds like a grand idea.  Where there is good reason to believe people are fiddling, this unit descends on them and does a very thorough check as it should do if peope are fiddling social welfare. The Minister continues:</P>
    <P>Of 8,329 claimants called for interview by this unit in the current year to review their entitlement to unemployment payments 1,255 ceased claiming.  The overall savings arriving from the activities of this unit are estimated at £2.7 million.</P>
    <P>It sounds like a great boast.  Let us remember that for the 1,200 who ceased claiming there were 7,000 innocent people who had to go through whatever procedures this particular unit puts them through and who presumably did not cease signing on and who were found to be entitled to the benefits they were getting.  I cannot reconcile that sort of 6 to 1 ratio of innocent to guilty with the assertion by the Minister that legitimate claimants are not affected by these activities. If you are talking about a 6 to 1 innocence to guilt ratio there are an awful lot of innocent people who are being put through the hoops by this external control unit.  It seems to be a less than happy figure to use to justify their activities.  An awful lot of innocent people are being put through unfair and unnecessary inquiries on the basis of what is called &ldquo;specific information obtained&rdquo;.  Either they are being had on a grand scale about specific information or else this is not nearly as refined an instrument as the Minister would have us believe.</P>
    <P>Secondly, on the question of the special investigation unit, the Minister says:</P>
    <P>Of 4,558 claims to unemployment payments investigated by the unit up to August of this year, 1,227 were disallowed.</P>
    <P>He says that this special investigation unit was assigned the specific task of the investigation <Col N="278" /> of allegations of concurrent working and signing.  Again in this case there were 4,558 claims and 1,227 were disallowed but let us remember that 3,200 were allowed.  It was a two and a half to one ratio of innocence to guilt.  If we are going to harass the unemployed on the basis of what we are told is specific information obtained we ought to be entitled to expect a somewhat better performance than that.  What you are talking about is systematic harassment of large numbers of people in the interest of satisfying a number of rather hysterical critics of the social welfare system, one of whom is a constituency colleague of Senator Mulroy who makes a particular speciality of insulting and offending the unemployed &mdash; not Senator Mulroy, his constituency colleague from another party.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to this mysterious consultant's report on welfare abuse, bits of which I am told have been leaked, other bits of which have been denied etc.  Has anybody contemplated the irony of an international firm of consultants, whom I shall not name because I am not supposed to, who among other things offer financial advice and tax advice and specialise in advising some of their clientele on how to avoid paying taxes &mdash; that is one of the major areas of activity of all international accountancy firms, advising on how to minimise tax or avoid paying tax &mdash; being employed suddenly to investigate the poorest in our society.  Has anybody contemplated the appalling irony of that, that the specialists in tax evasion become the specialists in social welfare abuse? What sort of an ideological and philosophical perspective will they bring to bear on that?  I find their activities extremely sinister, the fact that they are secretive, that their report apparently will never be published, that they are basing their conclusions, whatever they are, on information that nobody will ever challenge and that they are doing investigations that none of us will ever be able to query or quibble with.</P>
    <P>It is a most appalling policy decision introduced by the previous Minister and sadly carried on by this Minister that that sort of a group on the basis of the sort of <Col N="279" /> policy options they advocate, who would be anti-welfare in principle, will be used now as a source of advice to the Government on the levels of social welfare abuse.  I would appeal again to the Minister to publish the report, at least in summary if he cannot publish it in its entirety &mdash; some of it we were told would be based on confidential information &mdash; so that we can make a judgment as to the quality of the advice, the quality of the judgments and above all the quality of the information and the basis on which the recommendations are being made, the recommendations which will become presumably the basis for action.  The Minister made considerable reference to that consultancy firm in his speech.</P>
    <P>On the issue of the proposals to ensure that employers do not collaborate or conspire with their employees to defraud the social welfare system one or two speakers have talked about the disincentive to employ, as the consequences of these regulations and their part of the deregulation school of economics which is also fashionable in this country, the idea that if you got this burden of State regulation off the backs of these wonderful entrepreneurs employment would blossom all over the place and that we would all be much better off if we could get this nasty Government off our backs.  This is the sort of classic stuff <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> and many of the other organs give us every week and to which RTE contribute too, in their own way.</P>
    <P>It is a load of rubbish to suggest that levels of regulation determine levels of employment or that somehow we would be better off if these regulations did not exist.  The most regulated society in Europe is Sweden, and it also has the highest level of employment, the lowest level of unemployment, the best economic growth record amongst the European members of the OECD and any other index you wish to choose; they have done better than virtually any other country in Europe and they have done it with a well regulated, efficiently run economy. <Col N="280" /> There is no reason to believe that regulations of themselves are either a disincentive or their absence is an incentive to employment.  It is a much more complex issue than that.</P>
    <P>May I say that many of those here who were talking about the disincentives to employers to employ people seem to have a very different perspective of what is an acceptable income for everybody else as distinct from the income that they would regard as acceptable for themselves.  I include myself in this.  I heard a number of people talk about £100 a week take home wages as a reasonable expectation for people in employment.  Let me refer to SW 19, rates of payment: I will refer to short term unemployment assistance because that is the one I calculated: a person with four children would be in receipt of £94 per week social welfare payments.  If £94 a week is provenly an inadequate level of social welfare payment, I find it astonishing that Senators would suggest that £100 is a reasonable take home wage for someone in employment and that there are all these benevolent and benign employers queuing up to pay people £100 a week, only the State will not let them.</P>
    <P>The problem is that that is an appallingly low level of wages and we should forget the idea that £100 a week is a reasonable level of take home wages.  It is woefully and pitifully inadequate and the sort of poor law, low wages mentality will keep us with the countries that have a low wage mentality, that is the countries of the Third World, the Koreas and the Taiwans with their record of exploitation, long hours, poor wages and poor health. I do not think that we should allow ourselves to be led into that.  I do not think that any employer should be allowed to employ people if he or she is not prepared to act responsibly towards them and pay them adequately.  Given that we are competing with countries with levels of wages that are two or three times ours, there is no reason to believe that we have to pay people these sorts of wages.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not pay any attention to those who would whinge about <Col N="281" /> the apparent disincentive value of these things.  I will pursue the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will be concluding, I need not delay the House.  There are a number of proposals in the Bill on the very specific items and we can discuss them at length.  What we are talking about here in terms of abuse ought not to be allowed to be carried out of perspective. One of my colleagues here &mdash; I think it was Senator Cregan &mdash; asked the very fundamental and important question: if there is large scale abuse of disability benefit why has there never been a single doctor taken off the register by the medical council for obviously improper certification?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the issue of disability benefit, I almost missed this point but it needs to be said, that there is an extraordinarily widespread campaign of assault on recipients of disability benefit going on at present.  I would believe there was widespread abuse of disability benefit if I saw a few doctors having their right to practise withdrawn.  It is a very serious offence for a medical practitioner to sign a medical certificate saying that a person is unfit to work when that person is clearly fit to work.  That is not a minor matter. It is a serious abuse of his position by any medical practitioner which I am satisfied the medical council would take a very dim view of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous Minister confirmed that the Department of Social Welfare have never reported a single medical practitioner to the medical council.  That may have changed, I do not know, but the previous Minister, Deputy G. Hussev <Col N="282" /> informed myself and Senator Ferris in this House some years ago that not a single doctor has ever been reported to the medical council.  If the level of abuse of disability benefit is of the scale that we are being told it is &mdash; and I do not believe that &mdash; then the truth is that there are doctors involved, not just in an occasional minor fiddle but in large scale collusion to certify people as unfit for work.  I find that quite astonishing.  My conclusion is that it is not nearly as extensive.</P>
    <P>The figures that have been quoted and the Minister also quoted them on the number of people on disability benefits being called in for examination by medical referees are like all statistics, are capable of a large number of interpretations. It is much easier for a medical referee to suggest that somebody is fit to go back to work.  I would welcome clarification from the Minister on this.  I do not know if a medical referee would be in a position to be sued for negligence if that person turned out not to be fit to go back to work and went back because of the insistence of a medical referee, whereas I do know that if a general practitioner were to certify somebody as fit for work and that person was not so fit and then suffered because of that, then the general practitioner would definitely be actionable and would perhaps have a claim before the medical defence union for substantial damages.  That makes it easier for medical referees to be perhaps harsher in their assessments of fitness for work.  I know of cases where somebody who works in the building industry and cannot go back to work there is told by the medical referee that he is fit to work as long as he works at something else other than building.</P>
    <P>The fact that medical referees rarely if ever communicate directly with the general practitioner of the person in receipt of disability benefit does not say much for proper professional standards in the whole area of medical referees.  I understand the average period of claim for disability benefit is less than two weeks and it is usually seven or eight weeks before somebody is called to attend before a medical referee.  This suggests <Col N="283" /> that a large number of the people who do not turn up, do not turn up quite simply because they are back at work.  It does not represent a large level of abusers being caught, it represents a large number of people who do not bother turning up because they are back at work and do not expect to have to make another claim; therefore the nine weeks disqualification that results from not turning up does not trouble them.  There are a whole lot of things that should be gone through.</P>
    <P>If, at the end of all that there is a residue of abuse in which medical practitioners are signing medical certificates saying that people are sick when they are not, then there are two things to be done, the people who are not sick should be dealt with and those doctors who collude with them to sign certs which are untrue should be penalised.  I will not believe we are really talking about disability benefit abuse being dealt with until I see some doctors being dealt with with the same severity as we are now proposing to deal with employers and as we have consistently dealt with employees.</P>
    <P>The Minister, referring to prosecutions in the course of his script, said:</P>
    <P>Of the 45 cases finalised in court this year, there were 12 suspended prison sentences and 17 prison sentences in total.  In one case a sentence of 12 months was imposed and in the other cases the sentences ranged from three to seven months.</P>
    <P>Therefore, 17 people were sentenced to prison this year for social welfare abuse.  I do not know whether they deserve to be in prison, but I know, to the best of my knowledge, there is nobody in jail in this country for tax abuse and I find that quite an extraordinary statement of our society's priorities.  A person goes to jail for fiddling social welfare but you do not go to jail for fiddling either your own taxes or your employee's taxes.</P>
    <P>I will believe we have an equitable society aimed at eliminating all forms of abuse when I find that there are the same numbers of people in jail for tax evasion <Col N="284" /> and tax abuse as there are in jail for social welfare abuse and social welfare misuse. Until I see those sort of statistics I can only conclude what I know to be the case, that this alleged attempt to eliminate endemic abuse is nothing more than a campaign of intimidation to frighten people off the register, to frighten people off disability, to reduce the level of expenditure.  It is an endeavour to force people out of the marginalised poverty of welfare onto the absolute poverty of no income.  It is a disgrace to our society that we should further humiliate and penalise those who have suffered enough both from the system and the levels of payment. Whatever my views on some of the penalties for employers, I will be opposing this Bill at this Stage and on Committee and Final Stages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on the progress he has made and the great efficiency he has managed to achieve in the Department of Social Welfare since he took over this very difficult portfolio.  It impresses me that if you make a telephone call to the Department and quote a PRSI number, due to computerisation in the Dublin area, it is possible to get an immediate response.  You will get a detailed record of the person you are inquiring about.  I see a need to extend computerisation to other areas throughout the country where there are high levels of unemployment such as my own town of Drogheda.  I will come back to that later on.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of the Bill is designed to discourage collusion between employers and employees in case of suspected fraud by enabling the Minister to require employers to notify him of the commencement of employment of each employee.  I listened with interest today to some of the contributions by Senators which were wide and varied.  One speaker made a strong reference to the fact that we should give more consideration to the employer and make it easier for him to employ people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="285" /> There is a part time jobs scheme in operation in some parts of the country, where a married man can sign off at the employment exchange and work for up to 18 hours a week getting £40 on social welfare and working for an employer, and a single man would receive £25.  If an employer employs somebody on a part time basis, will it be necessary for the employer to notify the Department?</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to the contribution made by Senator Brendan Ryan who spoke at some length about various aspects.  He said &mdash; and I agree &mdash; that the levels of social welfare payments are not adequate to meet the needs of people who are existing on them.  However, in making that statement you have to look at the other side of the coin and realise that levels of payment must be related to ability to meet these costs.  The Minister said we are paying out something like £2.6 billion per year on social welfare.  I should like that figure to be £5 billion provided we could afford it but we have a national debt in excess of £25 billion which must be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>There is a very fine balance between people on social welfare and the take-home pay of the average worker.  There does not seem to be very much of a differential.  Some Senators mentioned a take-home pay of £100 as being reasonable. I would not consider that reasonable and PRSI contributions and PAYE payments are much too high.  The country needs a more equitable tax system.  I listened with interest to Senator Ryan &mdash; a very able speaker &mdash; and while he said a lot about what was wrong with the system he did not make any suggestions as to how it could be improved.</P>
    <P>The big problem for employers and employees is that the employer is endeavouring to be competitive to win orders on a competitive market.  I travel to far distant lands and to areas in the Middle East and bring back orders but the problem is that there is no incentive for the employee to be productive.  A commitment is made that the order will be fulfilled within a certain agreed time but when you tell the employees that you want them to work a certain amount of <Col N="286" /> overtime, including Saturday and Sunday, and that their jobs are guaranteed for the next six months provided they meet their commitments the reaction is, it is not worth their while because the tax and PRSI payments are too high.</P>
    <P>I know the levels of taxation must be reduced and I am pleased that the Government are committed to that.  It is one of their aims in the coming session. There is a necessity, as detailed in this Bill, to tackle the area of rogue employers and collusion between employers and employees to stamp out fraud.  Many people are working in the black economy, which the Minister highlighted in his address, and they are putting legitimate firms out of business.  It is a very fine balance and this Bill will go some way to make the legitimate employer more competitive by stamping out the black economy.  Why is there a black economy?  It is because the taxation system is inequitable and it must be addressed.</P>
    <P>There are certain areas where it is very hard to police where cash is paid.  It could be somebody doing a job on your car, a decorating job in your house or &mdash; dare I say it &mdash; in relation to medical attention or other types of professional advice.  Is there a case for the Government to issue a serialised receipt book whereby any person requiring such a service &mdash; the service industry represents a very large part of our economy &mdash; should get a receipt?  That would have to be linked with some incentive on the part of the person who is paying for the service. Should we bring in legislation in that regard?  If the Minister for Finance made some allowance in the tax free allowances for services which are paid for, this would ensure that a person who pays for a service would insist on a receipt and it would ensure also that there would be a record which the officials in the relevant Department could check.  This is an area that might be worth considering.</P>
    <P>Around this time last year there was a lot of controversy regarding the EC Directive on equality because many people on social welfare would lose up to £40 per week.  A regulation was brought <Col N="287" /> in by the Coalition Government to extend these payments to 17 November.  The Minister was able to make savings in this area and I am pleased that he was able to extend these payments to the end of December and earlier this week he promised to bring in a regulation to extend them to the end of March.  If these payments have to be eliminated I ask the Minister to do it on a gradual basis because there is genuine hardship in this area.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to local issues and to draw the Minister's attention to the high unemployment levels in Drogheda. There is a workforce in Drogheda and the surrounding areas of approximately 12,000 people and 3,860 of those people are unemployed.  If there is a suggestion or a plan for decentralisation of this computerised social welfare system Drogheda should be given priority in this area.  Unfortunately added to that the employment exchange which was built many years ago to cater for 1,500 people is now endeavouring to cope with 3,800 people.  The Office of Public Works recognised that work had to be done on that exchange and an extension added to it.  This work was undertaken in September with a promise that it would be completed by December.  To my knowledge this work does not seem to be on schedule.  At present the employment exchange is operating from an old factory. I do not think I can pull any punches in relation to this but it is nothing short of a disgrace the way the people of Drogheda have to queue up in a very undignified way in all types of weather week in week out, for hours on end, to collect what they are entitled to.  I earnestly request the Minister to look into this and to liaise with the Office of Public Works to bring about the early completion of the works on the permanent building and also to carry out a survey to ensure that when that building is completed people will not have to queue in the rain and snow to collect their social welfare payments.  I hope the Minister will take time off from his busy schedule and come to Drogheda early <Col N="288" /> next year to see the building at first hand. This cannot continue.  I am not sure if this is the situation throughout the country but it is something we cannot and should not accept.</P>
    <P>Section 18 of the Bill provides that moneys received by way of mobility allowance payable under the Health Acts shall be disregarded in the assessment of means for non-contributory old age pension.  I welcome this provision because it was unfair that this money was taken into account in the means test.  The sum of £320 was included in the means test and I am glad that the Minister has recognised that this needed to be corrected.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to close off the defects and loopholes in the system and this is necessary.  Some of the other Senators criticised the various people investigating the different cases.  One senator said that 4,558 people were investigated and 1,127 disallowed while 3,200 subjected to systematic harassement.  I was disappointed that the Senator who made this statement did not make some constructive statement on how these people could be investigated. I do not accept that people are being harassed and I do not think anybody in this day and age would accept that.  If Senators make adverse comments they should at least offer a constructive alternative.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and thank him for extending these alleviation payments. I look forward to hearing his reply to the debate and maybe he could give the situation in Drogheda some consideration. I am happy to support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party welcome the provisions of this Bill which provide for fines and jail sentences for employers who are found to be involved in what unfortunately in some instances seems to be organised rackets to defraud the Department of Social Welfare.  The Minister quite rightly said that those who defraud the Department of Social Welfare are defrauding all of us because the Department use State money.  The Labour Party hold that the levels of social <Col N="289" /> welfare payments are not adequate but we would in no way condone abuse.</P>
      <P>Many Senators referred to disability benefit and certification for disability benefit.  If an employer is found to be employing someone who is in receipt of disability benefit it raises a question regarding certification.  We hear criticisms about over-prescribing for medical cards and so on in the health area.  This Bill should include penalties for doctors who fail in their duty and in terms of their ethics and certify as incapable of working a person who obviously is capable of working.  The Labour Party will oppose later sections of this Bill.</P>
      <P>In 1987 the number of contributions required to qualify for disability benefit was raised from 156 to 208.  We consider this to be very harsh but to raise that again to 260 contributions is exceedingly harsh.  In the main this will hit young people very badly.</P>
      <P>One matter I would like to bring to the Minister's attention is where a person avails of injury benefit because of an injury sustained at work.  This benefit is paid without any restrictive contribution conditions but it is paid for six months only.  A person who could have been very seriously injured during working hours by an accident at work or by an industrially induced disease would at the end of six months no longer have any claim to disability benefit or, in the long-term, to invalidity pension and the various other concessions that are related to it.  The necessity to have five years contributions in order to qualify for disability benefit is a very harsh condition in cases where the people applying for disability benefit has just received six months injury benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to maternity allowance, I would like to have seen a measure in the Bill which was recommended earlier this year by the Commission of the European Communities and that is that maternity benefit should be paid to all women irrespective of their type of employment.  The most relevant category would be those on part time employment.  Unfortunately, many women are forced by economic circumstances to become involved in very menial employment, for example, cleaning <Col N="290" /> work and the like, and they do not have the required 18 hours work a week in order to qualify for this benefit.  The income which they bring home can be absolutely vital to any kind of a decent lifestyle for the family.  Pregnancy, birth and the period thereafter are very stressful times for any family's budget.  I ask the Minister to consider extending maternity benefit to all those who pay social welfare contributions.  People who work less than 18 hours a week do not pay a class A contribution.  In terms of equity, this is a glaring inequality in the system and I ask the Minister to consider it.</P>
    <P>Points have been made about low paid work.  All low paid workers are not working in the private sector.  For instance, local authority employees take home in the region of £118 a week.  I am not suggesting that the levels of social welfare are near adequate; in fact, I am saying something different.  There is the problem that the low paid in society are far too low paid.  The local authority workers will benefit this year to the tune of 2.5 per cent under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>Another point in regard to disability benefit which I would like to bring to the Minister's attention is where people can claim disability benefit for five, six, seven or eight years and at no stage are they put on to invalidity pension.  In many of these cases the people regularly go before medical referees and are found to be capable of work.  For instance, in terms of the free fuel scheme they are looked upon as short term social welfare recipients. I heard of a case recently where a person was on disability benefit for seven years.</P>
    <P>I do not envy the Minister in his work because the whole social welfare scheme is too complex.  There is also overlapping in the health area.  Recently I came across an anomaly regarding the national free fuel scheme where a deserted wife had a daughter living at home who was in receipt of unemployment assistance and they did not qualify under the free fuel scheme.  Subsequently the daughter became ill and had to avail of supplementary <Col N="291" /> welfare allowance which is paid at the same rate as unemployment assistance and in that case they qualified for free fuel.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's progress in the matter of computerisation and in terms of the pilot schemes to date regarding regionalisation.  Like Senator Mulroy, I would like to refer briefly to my own area and to ask the Minister if he intends extending regionalisation to Waterford and, if so, at what stage he intends doing so.</P>
    <P>Referring back to disability benefit, one matter which is brought to my notice quite frequently is that it takes about a fortnight from the time of the submission of the first certificate until a claimant is paid.  This can often mean that an applicant for disability benefit will have to apply to the health board for supplementary welfare allowance.  When that allowance is paid it further delays the payment of disability benefit by the Department because the health board must claim, and be paid, the money due to them before the client gets his disability benefit payment.  There should be a more efficient service for people applying for disability benefit.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on cost efficiency and streamlining in terms of the programme of regionalisation about which we hear many rumours.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Labour Party will be putting down amendments to sections 8 and 9 and I referred earlier to our reasons for this.  The Labour Party believe that the 156 contributions which are required in terms of eligibility for disability benefit and for invalidity pension are quite adequate.  The proposal to increase this figure to 260 contributions means that a person will have to work for five years before he will be eligible for this benefit and in the present climate not many young people can get five years' work in their early years.  We will be opposing sections 10 and 16.</P>
    <P>In general I welcome some of the provisions of the Bill.  Obviously it is difficult to please everybody across the board. The Labour Party will have to oppose <Col N="292" /> any changes in a system of payments that we already consider inadequate and a system in which we feel the contribution conditions are already more than adequate.  It is to be very much welcomed that employers and employees who are taking part in organised rackets to defraud the system will be heavily fined and jailed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NicholasOConnor" hpid="Nicolás Ó Conchubhair Nicolás Ó Conchubhair">
      <NameTxt>Nicolás Ó Conchubhair</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I congratulate the Minister on the provisions he has brought before us today regarding fraud and abuse of the social welfare system.  He has saved the taxpayers millions of pounds by the clamp down on fraud in the past few months and has brought to light what has been happening with regard to the system.  He and his staff should be congratulated for the efficient manner in which they have carried out this work.  I come from a Gaeltacht area and many strange things have happened there in recent times according to local reports.  I brought one of those matters to the Minister's attention.  In my ignorance, I do not know the ruling on it.  A young man was repairing his house and according to him an official from the Department called to ask him what he was doing.  The man told him that he was repairing his house and the official told him that he could not repair his own house, if he was on social welfare.  That sort of thing is like a red rag to a bull.  If officials go that far, they are killing any initiative a man might have to keep his lot in order.  In my area, 80 per cent of the people are unemployed.  Up to 5,000 or 6,000 people have gone to America or to England in the past five or six years.  I would like a short response to that.</P>
      <P>Another complaint is that in this Gaeltacht area, it appears that some of the officials from the Department cannot, according to local people, converse properly in Irish with the people.  Either that or they have a different dialect.  In a poor area people are quite nervous when a welfare officer calls.  The people should be helped rather than being frightened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very hard for a single man to live on £36 a week.  I know a man receiving £36 a week but because he had two cattle <Col N="293" /> that amount was cut by £10.  That is sad. That man was not abusing the system, he was only keeping two cows for his own use, in order to have a few gallons of milk per week.</P>
    <P>I welcome the clamp down on abuses, but those specific items in my area are worrying me and I would like the Minister's response to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions. I particularly thank Senator O'Shea for his very measured and worthwhile contribution.  I appreciate his feelings about these matters.  He certainly presented them in a very calm and rational way.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Connor raised a number of fairly isolated incidents relating to the Gaeltacht.  The Senator is right about how nervous people become when the departmental official calls.  So far as I know, the case he instanced was not as he outlined.  A person is entitled to work on his own house as long as he is available for work.  If a job comes up, one cannot refuse the job because of working on one's house.  Obviously there would be conflict there.  Leaving that aside, one can work on one's own house.  In connection with that, if a departmental officer stops somewhere to ask the way to a place, the word goes around straight away that an investigation is in progress.  In fact the officer might only be trying to find the way back out of the area.  There is a certain nervousness about officers going in there, and I appreciate the point made by the Senator.  That is one of the things causing some of the difficulties.  When we followed up cases which got banner headlines in the newspapers in the Gaeltacht there was no substance in them, yet there can be misunderstandings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have noted and agreed with what the Senator said about the single rate.  We will have to see what we can do about it in the context of the budget.  Everybody will want a little increment; and it is a question of what we can do in addition to that.  It will be very little, because the current rate of inflation is relevantly small, and the percentages we are talking about these days are relatively small in so <Col N="294" /> far as global percentages are concerned.</P>
    <P>Various speakers mentioned the Jobsearch scheme.  The latest results from the Jobsearch scheme came in for the week ended 11 December.  They show that to date we interviewed 138,370 people.  Senators will remember that the target for the year was 150,000 people. The number of people placed directly in jobs from the initial Jobsearch interviews is 4,159.  More people were placed in jobs following courses or following the Jobsearch course, or in the middle of the Jobsearch course or in the middle of the other courses.  They are not counted in that.  These figures relate to the ones who went directly to jobs.  A total of 29,506 people were placed on social employment and training schemes and programmes. In a survey they did the planning unit of the Department found that 79 per cent of almost 30,000 people who were on long term unemployment had never had an offer of a scheme or programme before.  What was going on?  They just were not offered schemes or programmes before.  That is the reality.  Senator Ryan has not been talking realistically in his contribution here.  I know that people objected to the Jobsearch programme from the beginning and many still object to it.  From experience we know that it has been very positive and helpful to many people.  We intend to develop the positive side of it.  Out of 138,000 claims, 1,841 were disallowed by the Department, and 11,639 people left the register voluntarily. The total who left the register was 13,480 people.  That was an indirect consequence of the Jobsearch programme. The savings to date are £17.56 million, an increase over the previous week of £1.24 million.  The estimated savings on the buget at the beginning of the year was £11.5 million.  When the Estimates went through the Dáil just recently, the revised Estimates were given as £18 million.  It is now clear that the savings figure will be close to £20 million by the end of December.  They are the actual savings.  I notice that the Senator is nodding his head saying, no, it is not accurate.  We have to account for beginning <Col N="295" /> of year and end of year.  We have to do things during the year to try to reach a balance in the course of the year.  We have to see what can we do that will give us that balance.  Do we find more taxation?  Do we do something about abuses?  How do we get money for the people that Senator Ryan and others are talking about?  That is the kind of thing one has to consider in the budget.  In the course of those arrangements, this is the outcome for this year at this point.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulroy raised the question of computerisation.  Computerisation has been and will be very helpful in delivering much more efficiently many of the services we talked about.  I noted the points he raised generally and the fact that he would like to see more computerisation in Drogheda.  The Senator mentioned the question of the part time job allowance scheme.  Under the scheme the person employed is supposed to hand in regular statements from the employer of the hours worked.  We will be looking for that scheme again for next year because I believe there is much more potential for providing positive and constructive opportunities for people.  We will be examining the scheme at the beginning of next year to see if we can make more use of it and improve it.</P>
    <P>The question of Drogheda was raised and the officials tell me there is a particular problem there.  I accept the invitation to go there early in the New Year. There has been a problem, according to my officials, in that people keep insisting on coming along at opening time as distinct from the different times during the day which are set for them.  That is what my officials tell me and this adds considerably to the problem the Senator mentioned about queuing.  However, I have noted what was said and I will certainly be happy to go along, see what is taking place there and give every assistance in having that sorted out as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan's contribution covered a very wide area and he talked at considerable length about the various aspects <Col N="296" /> of the commission's report.  We will be using the commission's report as a framework against which to work.  I cannot say I accept every finding of the commission because that would not be the case. However, we are using it as our framework. How fast we can progress along the lines indicated and how many of the targets can be achieved remain to be seen.  As I think the Senator recognised, we have taken a number of major steps. Extending PRSI to the self-employed is a very big step.  You do not say it one day and then talk about something else the next day.  That is what happens in the Dáil and Seanad.  People ask what are we doing next.  Nobody has ever undertaken that before.  It has major political and administrative implications.  If we are to make a success of it, my officials and I must concentrate our efforts and our work to make sure that happens.</P>
    <P>We are also undertaking the statutory pay scheme which is another major administrative task.  In addition, we are doing various other things in so far as we can in the time available.  I assure the Senator that major steps are being taken. Senator Ryan talked about things like adequacy, comprehensiveness, simplicity and whatever.</P>
    <P>I would have to reject in general the statement that the way people are treated in Social Welfare is degrading and humiliating. I could not accept that at all.  Independent surveys of the staff in Social Welfare show that they have been particularly helpful and careful and that they are under enormous pressure.  Having said that, I accept that it is particularly humiliating to have to go to look for the dole and to be means tested and whatever else.  I accept that side of it and where there are any aberrations on the side of Social Welfare we will certainly pursue those.  If the Senator is aware of any particular case, then I will be very happy to pursue it.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan also raised the question of electronic fund transfers to bank accounts.  On the one hand the Senator was telling me that people are not in the big league, that they do not have bank accounts and these sort of arrangements. <Col N="297" /> On the other hand he is talking about transferring by automatic electronic transfers.  We know all about electronic transfer.  We are very much up to date with it and we have some of the most sophisticated equipment.  There are other questions to be met here.  How many clients want it?  That is the first question. To date not many of the clients involved want that kind of service but presumably that will change in time.  We are putting into place the machinery which will meet those requirements and will make it possible for us to deliver services in that way. There are many aspects to be considered. This forms part of our current considerations in relation to the whole administration of schemes.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan criticised the extension of the fuel scheme.  Of course there were other options in relation to the Supreme Court decisions.  There are options like giving fewer people money and getting down to a very grass roots situation.  We did not do that.  We tried to preserve what we could, then at somewhat extra cost we extended it to 30,000 people on long term unemployment assistance. There is the question of practicality. What is practical at present?  People tell me that we should not be giving these benefits to certain people, that they should not be going to some of the people who get benefit under the urban schemes.</P>
    <P>I have taken on this year a very major administrative undertaking in introducing one national scheme.  I introduced the first national scheme and now I am trying to integrate the two into one scheme.  It is only by such means that we will get a scheme based on real need where the resources will be directed towards the people in greatest need.  In the short term in any changes we make, we want to preserve the benefits for existing claimants as far as we can.  When we go to do that we find that the authorities involved do not even know the claimants. That is my problem as Minister.  When I try to find out who exactly is getting this benefit at present so that we can preserve it for them, they do not know.  They know in some cases but not in others.  I have to sit back and let it roll on for a time as it <Col N="298" /> is until we can take note of all those people and then carry on with our rationalisation on the broader scale.  These are the practical problems we face.  If we want to preserve people's position and try not to hurt people in the process we have to appear to be slower or more comprehensive in what we are doing.  It certainly is a different task in practice from the ones that are so often talked about in theory.</P>
    <P>I will not pay any attention to the personal attack on me in relation to the Combat Poverty Agency.  The bulk of the money to combat poverty has been given out to voluntary groups this year.  It did not go into research.  The fact that it went into voluntary groups means in effect duplicating the work our voluntary grant scheme is there for.  I do not mind that this year.  It is fine because they are not geared up to do the work, as yet.  They are doing a certain amount but they will be in a position to do more next year. That is where the bulk of that money went this year.  It amounts to £1 million in total.  There are research projects under way and they will be increasing.  They will be able next year to target their own resources towards the priority areas as they would see them.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned Jobsearch, which was raised also by Senator Ryan.  Of course everybody uses consultancy. Everybody uses engineers.  We use engineers for the poor, for all sorts of people. Consultants are not only for the rich.  We want consultants, management consultants and engineers and other people to work for the poor as well as the rich. It is a bit ridiculous to suggest that we should not have consultants who do basic consultancy work to look at systems and schemes we have in operation.  When we go to instal computer systems we have to get people who are specialised.  These are people who are advising banks and industries and they are in the world market in that area.  Therefore, they are the kind of people we naturally turn to for advice in relation to mechanical systems. We are doing very well in that area.</P>
    <P>In relation to the level of abuse, the consultants advised on a survey which <Col N="299" /> was done in the Dublin area.  In the case of unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit and disability benefit, the level of abuse was found to be approximately 2 per cent with a further 7 per cent of suspect cases.  That was basically what they came out with.  That is reasonable enough in relation to my experience of the different areas.</P>
    <P>Senators must remember that these refer to claims being abused at some time in the period of claim, not necessarily for the whole year.  One must be careful in comparing these figures for the whole year.  One must be careful in comparing these figures against global figures because it does not quite mean the same thing as taking a percentage of the total. It is dependent on the length of time it took to process the claim.  Another interesting point in that period is the external control unit which was mentioned. It is a relatively small unit.  These are Irish people who work and serve the poor day in day out.  Their fulltime profession is serving these people; that is the business they are in.  They feel that the extent of abuse is greater in the rural areas.  I do not know whether that is true but that is their belief.  What we have learned in more recent times seems to bear out that belief.  That is all I will say about it at present.  There is no more substantive information on it.  Nor do I really need a lot more information on it.  We want to ensure the systems are working properly.  We do not want to dwell too much on that.  We want to ensure that we have good control systems and get on with the job.</P>
    <P>The question of prosecutions was raised by several Senators.  The House may be interested to know that in 1986 there were six prosecutions of employers and that in 1987 to date there were 24 such cases.  That is before these new powers become operative.  It is from our experience in that area that we have found there are loopholes we want to plug.  In a number of those cases fines were imposed.  Therefore, the House will be aware that there are prosecutions of employers.  I would hope that employers <Col N="300" /> will now get into line, that we will not have as many to chase next year.  But certainly we are determined to root out this collusion, this defrauding of taxpayers, this cheating on the part of individuals and their competitors because, at the end of the day, we must ensure that the available resources go to those who really need them.  The resources are scarce and we must ensure they go to the people who genuinely need them.</P>
    <P>On the question of the external control unit and the special investigation unit, the Senator should have continued to read the commission's report.  The Senator described these units as my rangers. They are in existence and are being used efficiently at present, using the head and the computer which achieves results. The commission expressed concern at the existence and the perception of fraud in the social welfare system.  They found that people were somewhat ambivalent about fraud and abuse.  They were concerned about its existence.  They recognised its existence.  They said that while they welcomed recent developments, such as the establishment of the special investigation unit, there was scope for further improvement.  They continued to express the view that the primary purpose should be to ensure that, as far as possible the administrative systems are such that the scope for fraud is eliminated.  They went on to recommend a number of further measures in that direction.  The Commission on Social Welfare also talked about the desirability of more random checks, interviews of clients and so on.  We are doing that sort of thing at present.</P>
    <P>Early in the New Year I hope to make available a summary of the consultants' report.  It refers in detail to our existing security systems; that formed a large part of their investigations.  That report deals with internal as well as external possibilities. Nevertheless the broad summary of conclusions will be made available.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Shea talked about penalties for doctors.  Indeed, in some recent cases, those questions have been raised.  Where cases of abuse by claimants come to light <Col N="301" /> it may well be that the relevant doctors who provided the medical certificates may have been instrumental inadvertently in that abuse in that they issued certificates without applying the necessary degree of care.  Where cases of abuse come to light I will be looking particularly closely at the role of the doctors who certified the illnesses.  I would appeal to doctors to apply the correct rules and procedure in all cases.  Doctors' contracts with my Department incorporate a provision for a fine to be imposed where a doctor is found to be guilty of incorrect or careless practice.  Where cases come to light, the doctors are cautioned.  If that does not achieve the desired result they are fined.  Ultimately, it may be necessary to refer the matter to the Irish Medical Council.  Where there are cases of carelessness in that regard I would have no hesitation in taking the actions required of me in that respect.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Shea also raised the question of wider cover for women in part-time work.  I appreciate the point he made here.  The problem is the constraints on available resources.  I have noted what the Senator had to say.</P>
    <P>On the question of disability benefit and people being eligible for such for years, I should say that whole area is one we will have to examine.  In September last I attended the United Nations Conference of Ministers for Social Welfare. It was very revealing to me.  I met quite a few counterparts over a few days in Vienna.  It afforded us an opportunity to observe what was happening and the sorts of things they were doing.  I found that my counterparts in other countries very often approached the matter in a different way from our traditional approach. We will have to examine that whole area and ascertain what is the best way to handle it in the future.  As the Senator was saying people can be an awfully long time on disability benefit and yet not qualify for invalidity benefit.  Obviously that poses questions as to whether they should have gone back to work, in the first instance, or &mdash; if they are going to continue that way &mdash; should they not <Col N="302" /> be in receipt of some form of invalidity benefit.</P>
    <P>Regarding regionalisation and computerisation I should say that the Department are working on a target of a localised computer service for every town in the country.  The kind of impression Senators may have gleaned somewhere is that there may be what might be described as crossroads in that computer terminals framework.  In that sense one could regard those terminal points as regional points.  They have not been determined nationally as yet.  We are experimenting to some extent with some developments but those regional points will be determined fairly soon, so that we will have a localised service nationwide. Senators can be quite certain that, for example, Waterford will have the localised service.</P>
    <P>Disability benefit was mentioned.  On the subject of computerisation I should inform Senators we began in September last keying in disability certificates locally in Cork which is going particularly well. That reduces delays in payment and postage costs, and so on.  Most of all it reduces the volume of telephone inquiries.  The Department had had an enormous telephone bill.  I accelerated this new process, being conscious of the cost of telephone bills and so on in order to effect savings. That process is working very well there. Probably it will provide a model on which we can proceed further around the country. Of course that would involve the regions taking their own decisions about disability claims in that sense.  That is the direction in which we are going.  That is our aim.  We want to get those decisions delegated to local level as far as possible. However one still has to ensure the overall security of the system.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan mentioned the importance of incentives for employers.  He talked about the job cards system and so on.  I appreciate the point he made.  It is possible to have a break in one's unemployment assistance, come back and still continue to be eligible as long as that break is not longer than 20 weeks in the case of unemployment assistance and 13 <Col N="303" /> weeks in the case of unemployment benefit. The detailed operation of this system in the shorter term is something I will be examining.  Other Senators also spoke of it applying particularly to rural areas. That would be very important.  All I can say at this stage is that it certainly is something we will look at.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan also felt we should be letting people know more about the part time job schemes and other schemes we have and that our publicity in that respect was not up to scratch.  When we revise those schemes early in the New Year we will bear that in mind and make sure they are delivered through to people on the ground, both at the local branch level as far as our own Department is concerned and also to employers.  Senator Cregan was quite right when he said that using the computers may make it possible to adjust means on a new basis and to be much more flexible.  We have just completed the computerisation of the employment exchanges in Dublin to deal with unemployment assistance.  We are now working on Cork in regard to unemployment assistance and we plan also throughout the country to deal with unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit.  Over the next couple of years we will have a totally new system throughout the whole country which will make it much more flexible and will offer other opportunities and possibilities to us.</P>
    <P>Senator Wallace talked about the need for improvement in buildings.  I entirely agree.  Senator Wallace also saw problems with queuing.  I do not know if I will have to visit Navan as well but I will take the Senator's word for that.  Senator Wallace also stressed the need for decentralisation. Some of the buildings are very fine.  The building in Sligo is really a beauty; it has very nice accommodation, is well furnished and is a lovely place. That is what we want.</P>

      <P>It just happened that way. We want to have those kinds of facilities. I will certainly be pressing to get the <Col N="304" /> programme there advanced as much as possible.  Senator Ferris talked about the Jobsearch programme and the need for Manpower agencies to be redirected towards getting people to work.  I would agree with the Senator on that.  The coordination that occurred under the Jobsearch programme was quite an advance in that respect.</P>
      <P>In regard to disability benefit for the sick and those who are unable to work, it is interesting that out of 88,000 people called to medical referees only 1,800 were medically certified as unfit to attend; in other words, they were in bed or were not able to go for an interview with the medical referee.  A good deal of the sickness involved is sickness that is on and off.  In relation to people who are sick and unable to work and their long-term care, this raises the question of disability allowance as distinct from disability benefit. That is something that will have to be looked at in future.</P>
      <P>Senator Ferris raised some questions about the free fuel scheme.  The only thing I could say about that is that the extension did not actually create this situation, it was there already and it is one we can look at in future.  It is just that the extension tended to accentuate it in that one ended up with two people qualifying in the one house.  It was not the extension which caused the problem there; that problem was already there. We will look at it in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Farrell had some very relevant things to say.  It is very important, no matter how sophisticated we become, that we keep in mind some of the old systems.  The whole matter of the Jobsearch programme tied in with Manpower, AnCO and social welfare.  They had been separate for a long time and the Jobsearch programme brought them back together.  It redirected those resources towards the long-term unemployed. In the old system the employment exchange was an employment exchange and when a person went there there was somebody to offer him a job if there was one available.  Likewise, some of the other systems which the Senator <Col N="305" /> talked about are certainly worth looking at.</P>
    <P>The Senator mentioned particularly casual rural employment.  This is an area where there is a good deal of difficulty and, consequently, there is a good deal of abuse or unwarranted claims or overlapping or whatever you might like to call it.  Perhaps if there was a simple system to deal with those situations then it might be a good deal more effective.  That is something that we can look at.  The Senator felt that would facilitate rural employment.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell also said we should educate people on how to get the most out of their money.  This is one of the things that the Society of St. Vincent de Paul are particularly interested in: they carry out home management courses and courses of various kinds like that to help people to manage, to handle problems and be able to face difficulties.  The voluntary grant scheme has been used in part to assist in some of that work and it is certainly something that I would like to see assisted further in the coming year because I believe it is real, practical and down to earth.  As Senator Ryan said, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul are not represented on the Combat Poverty Agency and I cannot really understand why.  He quite rightly said they are the people who do a great deal of the work on the ground.  I have had discussions with the society recently and I will be giving attention to their very practical suggestions.  I hope I have covered most of the points that were raised.</P>

      <P>Like every Member of the House, I am in favour of what is proposed in section 2 but for clarification, could the Minister explain what the present position is?  At present people seem to have obligations under PRSI to make deductions and to make returns and must give some formal notification of commencement of employment.  I find it difficult to believe that as of now there is no legal obligation on an employer to notify the Minister whether a person has been taken into his employment.  I presume there must be rules under the taxation law whereby the Revenue must be notified where a person is being taken into employment.  Are the penalties different?  I find it a little bit astonishing that we are now for the first time talking about making it obligatory for an employer to notify the State that he has taken a person into his employment given the extensive obligations which an employer has.</P>

      <P>There is a requirement to notify the Revenue Commissioners.  The regulations which will be produced under this <Col N="307" /> section which will relate to need rather than being bureaucratic regulations will create a requirement to notify the Department of Social Welfare.  One may ask why the one will not do the two things but there are many reasons why it will not.  It is not an effective system for our purposes and that is why we have to seek this arrangement at this time.  In the longer term there may be different systems, approaches or co-ordinations but in the circumstances as they exist we need to know.  We believe this will be effective and, consequently it is necessary.</P>

      <P>The Minister has confirmed what I suspected.  Is it not possible for the computer of the Revenue Commissioners to automatically generate a letter to the Department of Social Welfare saying that employer X has taken on employee Y with a PRSI number Z.  It is not usual for me to be a champion of employers.  Is it a fact that the computer system of the Revenue Commissioners and the computer system of the Department of Social Welfare cannot, to use a layman's phrase, talk to each other?  Is there no possibility of doing that?  It seems that the two areas are different sides of the same coin and it seems rather peculiar that parallel notifications have to be made by two groups who have the same interests.  I do not want to give the Minister the option of not answering me, but what are the practical reasons why on notification the Revenue Commissioners do not in turn automatically notify the Department of Social Welfare, even if it would result in the Revenue Commissioners changing the format of the notification so that it meets the requirements of the Department of Social Welfare? There is a possibility that what we are doing here is the simplest way for the bureaucracy rather than the simplest way for the employer.  That is hardly the way in which to organise a system efficiently, in other words, in terms of getting the desired return at the minimum cost to all concerned.</P>

      <P>One of the important elements is the fact that information for that purpose is not computerised in the Revenue as yet.  Tax returns are computerised. It is all very well talking about systems talking to each other but before you can do that you have to have the systems first and they have to be developed for that purpose.  These are the things I was referring to.  I would not like to enter the subject too much to tell the truth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, what I find astonishing as a lay person is that these things were never there before.  What precisely is the change involved?  Is it the case that until now employers did not have to provide that information?  I find it astonishing that until now the whole thing seems to have been weighed in one direction, which was in the direction of the employee.  Is it true that until now there was no legal obligation on an employer to provide the sort of information referred to in this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That essentially is the position. The vast majority of employers co-operate with us and we do not have a problem in that respect.  There are employers who will not co-operate or furnish the information.  Let me give an example.  Recently, in the collieries in the northern part of the country 177 cases came to light.  They came to light following on initial inquiry by the Department. A person applied for disability benefit and an inquiry was sent out to the employer to find out whether this person was working.  The employer responded in the normal way and co-operated with the Department and as a result we discovered that the individual was working while at the same time drawing benefit.  In carrying out such inquiries around the country we find a reasonable number of people <Col N="309" /> will not co-operate in that way and that makes the work of the Department and the inspectors more difficult.</P>
      <P>That was a method we adopted this year.  We then sent the unit to look into the area more generally and they came up with the 177 cases to which I referred. These powers are very simple ones and you would imagine that employers would co-operate.  These powers are being sought by the Department of Social Welfare inspectors and officers so that they can do their job efficiently and will not be blocked in doing so.  If an employer is in collusion with his employees in regard to any of these benefits he will not want to send in the returns.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am 100 per cent in favour of these.  In relation to the inquiries made by the Department can the Minister give us any idea of the proportion of employers who either decline or do not supply the information sought? Is the figure 5 per cent, 10 per cent or what?  This is an important area and, as the Minister said, one would think that employers would co-operate.  Is this a new phenomenon or is it something which the Department have experienced over a number of years?  This is not a criticism of the Minister &mdash; there has been enough of that &mdash; but if it is not a new phenomenon the question arises as to why it took so long?  I would like the Minister to tell us, and I presume the Minister has this information, what proportion of employers in his experience and that of his Department do not tend to rely on such inquiries?  It may be an indicator of the scale of abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>By and large a substantial majority of employers co-operate.  It is difficult to give the figures because we only started to carry out this kind of inquiry recently.  They have been carried out in the past but not to the extent they have been carried out this year.  When we widened the extent we found far more cases where we did not get co-operation but in general the large majority of employers do co-operate.  The minority is still very sizeable and, for instance, <Col N="310" /> there are particular sectors where we may have more difficulty in getting the answers we want.  There are loopholes and if we want to do our job effectively and efficiently it would help to close them off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spoke about a majority.  A majority is 51 per cent.  Therefore, I presume he is not talking about 49 per cent of employers. Admittedly, like a lot of other areas, the employers presumably make these inquiries where they suspect that something untoward is afoot.  Are we talking about 10 per cent or 20 per cent?  As I have said frequently in this House I am not opposed to dealing with abuse in social welfare but I believe that we should attempt to quantify the problem before we deal with it.  If we knew the number of employers who refuse to answer queries from the Department of Social Welfare it would be an interesting indicator of the possible scale of abuse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>These inquiries are done at random, they are not the selected ones. Some of the other work is done, as the Senator says, by selecting particular areas.  These would be random checks on disability benefit.  We may find that percentage, even if it is only 5 per cent &mdash; it may not be that people do not wish to co-operate &mdash; do not bother to reply. They may not see it as being necessary although it is a very useful cross-check and we have found that in a number of cases it can be revealing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain why he proposes to extend the number of contributions?  Is it to save money?  Is it because it is believed that this will reduce abuse, are there anomalies or <Col N="311" /> what is the precise reason?  I believe it is simply to save money but other reasons are being used to justify that.  I would like the Minister to explain why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>To some extent this refers back to the discussions we had earlier about disability benefit, invalidity benefit, disability allowance and the cost of maintaining those schemes.  We maintain a scheme that would be much more costly than a similar scheme in most other countries in relation to disability.  After one year other countries would go on to a disability allowance or an invalidity benefit. In other words, a person would get an invalidity benefit or would go on to an allowance.  However, we could have people on the scheme for 40 years. Senator O'Shea mentioned seven years. We could have people on it for seven, ten, 15 or 20 years.  A lady on one of the radio programmes recently said she had been to the medical referee and when the interviewer asked her how long she had been on the disability benefit she said she was 16 years on &ldquo;the sick&rdquo;.  Other countries do not have a system like that. They either have one that is means tested so that when people have a problem they get disability allowance or a decision is reached about invalidity.  That decision is taken a bit sooner.  A person may be regarded as invalidity, percentage invalidity, or something like that.  Our scheme is a very expensive scheme to maintain and that is one of our problems.  It is a very substantial benefit to people because they can have so many years on a disability benefit without ever being in the category which could be regarded as invalidity.  We are being asked why for such a substantial benefit there should be a substantial accumulation of contributions, five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time we have got to recognise that the fund from which these are paid will in 1987 be in deficit to the tune of £401 million.  We have to look at what has to be preserved and maintained and at the most effective and efficient way to do that.  I have managed to maintain every scheme and maintained the various <Col N="312" /> rates of payment but we have to look hard at some of the practices and schemes.  I accept that we will have to look at the relationship between a disability allowance and an invalidity allowance and how invalidity should be regarded but I cannot do that overnight.  Any one of those requires a sizeable study.  I am not talking about bringing people from outside to do that study.  It is a question of management time and commitment and being sure we know what we are talking about in relation to what is happening within the scheme and what will happen if we change the scheme.  They are the reasons for the changes proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This may reveal a large deficit in my knowledge.  I share the view expressed by the Minister in his reply on Second Stage that we should all use our heads as much as possible but in this case the information does not seem to be in my head.  What happens to somebody who is sick and is not eligible under these provisions; where do they go?  As far as I know we do not have a disability allowance.  Senator O'Shea suggests the disabled persons maintenance allowance. Are we going to be transferring people from one area to another and still costing the State money or what will happen to people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 1.2 million workers and the number of people affected will be approximately 2,000.  It will mean that a person would not go on to long term benefit until he or she had the contributions.  If that person is outside that and was really ill the DPMA is available. There is also the supplementary welfare allowance.  Some of the people the Senator is referring to who might fall short at the moment, could be on a supplementary welfare allowance.  That raises the question of whether they should be on supplementary welfare allowance or should they not be on a disability allowance which is looked at separately.  I accept that it needs to be looked at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="313" />
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the information I have disability benefit is £42.30 per week for a person who has 48 contributions or over.  The supplementary welfare allowance is £34 a week.  It appears that what the Minister is saying is that more people are going to have to live on less when they are sick.  That may sound too succinct but it seems to me to be the essence of it.  The 2,000 figure is a little bit disingenuous because that is the number of people who are currently affected by it, but it is going to affect all future contributors as well.  Does this mean that if people get sick they will &mdash; I do not have the figure from the Department of Health or from health boards in relation to DPMA &mdash; be on supplementary welfare which appears to be £8 a week less for a single person? That is a substantial drop in income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>None of the current beneficiaries will be affected.  That is the first thing.  Secondly, it is for extended duration over 12 months.  If you are in the public service, or in any employment, you get six months full pay and then six months reduced pay.  That is the end of it and you have to make some other arrangements.  We have a scheme which goes on for maybe 40 years to cover a person who is just sick, not invalided; therefore the benefit involved in that is costly.  If we are to maintain that kind of benefit, then the contribution conditions are of that order.</P>
      <P>People will not currently be affected. Only the new people coming on will be affected.  The estimated figure of new people who could be looking for long-term disability benefit does not necessarily mean they will be in very bad health condition but would be short those contributions in the first year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to rehash what I said on Second Stage.  I will be opposing this section on the principle that it is reducing the ability of people to avail of disability benefit.  One area I would like to highlight again is the position of some person who just comes into the <Col N="314" /> workforce, has not been five years in the workforce and becomes the recipient of injury benefit through either an accident at work or an industrially induced disease. If that person is not old enough to have had the opportunity to put together the contributions it seems very harsh that after six months he will be excluded from disability benefit and subsequently from any possibility of invalidity benefit.</P>
      <P>My experience is that DPMA would be difficult enough to get under the health board scheme and supplementary welfare allowance is usually what is paid to people who would qualify for disability benefit if they have the requisite contributions. Another point that must be taken on board here is that, for instance, DPMA and supplementary welfare allowance are not paid to someone in hospital.  While I am opposed to the whole section, I ask the Minister especially to apply himself to what I believe is a very grave injustice there to younger people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator mentioned the question of an accident at work.  First, the occupational injury benefit is not affected.  If, after you finish that, you are still ill, then you would come under the unemployability supplement which is £42.30 and higher for an older age group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure it is not deliberate, we are all here far too late to be falling out with one another and it is nearly Christmas so we could not possibly fall out.  I will try not to, anyway. However, it is a little disingenuous to talk about the public service.  Those of us who have the privilege of being in that appallingly titled category of &ldquo;officers&rdquo; as distinct from those in the equally appallingly titled category of &ldquo;servants&rdquo; have access to early retirement on the grounds of ill-health and disability.  One would assume that somebody who was ill for in excess of 12 months would begin to come into that category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of that scheme are quite generous.  They compare with the provisions of the Government's voluntary redundancy scheme.  Therefore, anybody in the public service who has the title <Col N="315" /> of officer would have a very generous cushion if he or she were to be ill for a period substantially in excess of the 12 months provided for in most benefits. Incidentally, there is not much evidence that that scheme was abused.  When I had opportunity as a member of the board of the regional college in Cork to see the returns for staff absences there was no substantial evidence of any large scale absenteeism.</P>
    <P>We seem to be getting to the nub of this, that essentially it is a money-saving device.  The Minister has a point about disability benefit going on and on for years, but the truth is that everybody on disability benefit is getting a medical certificate every week from a registered medical practitioner saying that this person is unfit for work.  The real problem is that either people are getting those certificates who are fit for work and should not be getting them, or there are people who are unfit for work and who are going to be simply told what whatever income they get will not be under disability benefit because the contribution period is five years.</P>
    <P>There are interesting implications in this.  If people are not eligible for disability benefit it is, presumably, less likely that they will take time off work for minor ailments.  This would be very much approved of by the certain public house school of economics I have talked about two or three times already and who have had enough free advertising from me. The other part is that that will not necessarily contribute to industrial efficiency. A somewhat unwell industrial workforce will not necessarily be an efficient workforce. One advantage of disability benefit, and the introduction particularly of pay-related disability benefit, was that it allowed people to stay away from work when they were not well.  That is not an unreasonable expectation.  It is not just a social welfare benefit, it is also a benefit to industrial efficiency.  Of course, it needs to be controlled and regulated. Other civilised countries recognise such provisions as civilised and necessary and capable of being controlled, and we <Col N="316" /> should do so.  Like Senator O'Shea, I think we are rolling back an area of humane provisions in the interests of financial cutbacks.  I will be opposing the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator mentioned other civilised countries.  I said at the outset that basically they do not go longer than 12 months.  That is what we are faced with at this stage.  If we want to keep going longer than 12 months on disability the contribution conditions will have to be somewhat greater.  That is what we are faced with in terms of choices.</P>
      <P>I have accepted that there is a need to look at the whole question of the different systems we operate.  That raises particularly the question of disability assistance and we will have to look at that for the future.  This is not common elsewhere, in fact.  It is a major benefit in terms of getting it; therefore, a cost goes with such a major benefit.  We reckon the cost is represented by the contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate all benefits have a cost going with them.  I have not yet cleared up for myself where you are going to save.  Is the Minister suggesting that because of this fewer people will become sick or claim benefit or people will claim a lower rate of benefit?  If they are going to claim or if they are not going to claim a lower rate of benefit then no saving to the State will be involved.  What precisely will the outcome of this be?  Will it mean less expenditure on this area or on the area of people who are sick and cannot work?  What will it ultimately mean?  We are saying that it costs something. Let me say that most civilised countries have a guaranteed minimum income through their welfare system.  By civilised countries, I do not identify very many.  I recognise the countries of northern Europe and Holland and that would be it.  I do not regard either the UK under its present régime or the US as civilised countries and I want to hear no more about them really.  I am talking about countries which guarantee their citizens&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No, but we did talk about civilised countries, and lest the Minister and I would not understand each other clearly, I wanted to let him know what I meant.  Part of the problem is that disability benefit has become a long term payment when, in fact, the philosophical assumption was that it was a short term payment, a guarantee for people who were ill for a short period that they would not suffer substantial hardship.  It became something different.  Because it became something different does not mean that we take it away and do not provide in its place.  If the Minister was telling us he had provided an alternative framework to deal with this issue, and was now doing that, we could see some point to it.  On its own, without the alternatives he so rightly identified as possibilities, it is simply a cutback at the expense of people who are sick.</P>

      <P>There is an alternative, although the Senator does not consider it to be adequate.  In relation to disability benefit a number of things could happen. The first is that the person might go back to work.  We do not assume that everybody who is claiming constantly will not be capable of going back to work.  That is an open question but some people could be in that position.  Some people will not qualify because they will not have enough contributions.  Those people would go on to a means tested arrangement instead.</P>

The reason I was somewhat sceptical about the Minister's explanations about the justification of section 8 was that I knew section 9 guarantees that people would not be entitled to invalidity pension, which is the sensible, logical alternative to long term payments of disability benefit and that they were being prevented from getting this as well.  Will the Minister not agree that effectively these two sections guarantee that people who get sick and cannot work will be worse off?  Will he accept that that is a considerable betrayal of the traditional philosophy of the Fianna Fáil Party, which was to defend the weak, the vulnerable and the sick and whom they have now sold out to the bankers?

      <P>Invalidity is an extension of long term disability benefit.  It is also a very major long term benefit which can last for 20, 30 or 40 years and, consequently, it is on that similar basis that the contribution conditions of five years accumulated contributions will in future be required for that benefit.  Most of the arguments we have had on the other section apply and there is not much point in going back over the same ground.</P>

      <P>Do the Members opposite appreciate what they are voting for here?  The truth is that somebody could now be permanently incapable of work in the judgment of his own GP, perhaps a medical consultant and most assuredly a medical referee of the Department of Social Welfare but unless he or she has five years PRSI contributions &mdash; five years is a long time, it is one eighth of the average working life &mdash; he or she will not be entitled to an invalidity pension.  It is quite uncertain as to what they would be entitled to.  It might be DPMA or supplementary welfare, they could be consigned to the squalor of supplementary welfare simply because they are sick and do not have this exorbitantly high number of contributions.  It is a disgrace that people who are sick should be picked on as the victims of the cutbacks that the right wing ideology that Fianna Fáil have now taken on demands.  Other areas are left untouched while the sick are penalised by Fianna Fáil.  As I said earlier, and I will not make it a personal attack but a collective attack, they should be ashamed of themselves and they should be ashamed of what they used to come from and what they used to stand for.</P>

      <P>The Senator seems to have missed the point that as far as invalidity <Col N="320" /> is concerned, by definition one would in most circumstances be eligible for DPMA.  There is a difference in that case from the disability benefit because in the case the Senator suggested, the person would qualify for invalidity and consequently would be very likely to qualify for DPMA.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is also true that DPMA is means tested so the disability benefit would be payable to somebody perhaps who had a spouse working. The same applies to invalidity pension but not to disabled person's maintenance allowance.  However the Minister dresses it up, he and the Government are penalising the sick, who will be even worse off, in order to save money.  As I said before, they ought to be ashamed of themselves.</P>

      <P>There is no penalty on anyone at this stage.  Everyone who has the benefit keeps it.  It is a question of eligibility for benefits in the future.  As I said to the Senator earlier, most countries do not go beyond 12 months on disability benefit.  To qualify for an invalidity pension, a person has to meet a fairly stringent criterion.  I accept that a small number of people here will have to be means tested but they will almost certainly qualify on invalidity grounds.</P>

      <P>There is not much more I can add to this.  I have made it quite clear that it is a major benefit while not available as easily in other countries. There is a problem, obviously, in relation to resources here.  I tried to convey to Senator Ryan earlier that the fund from which this money comes is already in deficit this year to an amount of £401 million.  Therefore, one has to look at the benefits which come from that fund.  This is a reasonable proposal.  There is, for the exceptional case a provision under the DPMA but in any event it means that one will have to have more contributions to get long term benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister cannot get away with this without having his exaggerations underlined.  The reason the fund is in deficit is that our employers, contrary to their permanent whingeing, have the lowest levels of social insurance contributions in Europe, substantially less than virtually every other country, with the exception of Portugal and Greece.  Even Spain is somewhat in excess of ours.  When you have the lowest employers' PRSI contributions, one of the lowest levels of corporate and capital taxation, virtually no taxation in agriculture and a number of extraordinarily generous exemptions from tax for both the corporate and the private sector, funds like this will be in deficit.  They are in deficit because the parties opposite and in front of me have no will or guts for the taxation system that would enable these things to be funded.  It may make it a political necessity for them but it does not make it justifiable in terms of the sufferings it will inflict.  As regards the schemes of other countries, let it be said again that most of the civilised countries of Europe, those who provide decent welfare, provide a guaranteed income for people related to their take home pay.  I do not care whether that is done under disability, social welfare or unemployment benefit, if people have a guaranteed income on the basis of their previous employment, then I am quite happy to support a fundamental root and branch reorganisation.  As long as the <Col N="322" /> levels of benefit are so appallingly low, no cutbacks are justified in social welfare because they impose hardship on those who can least afford them.  That is why I oppose the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>As an employer I do not want to get into total conflict with the Senator.  Employers are not whingeing, they are barely able to keep their heads above water and in quite a number of cases have gone under.  They are running legitimate businesses, trying to give employment and trying to support their families.  They are trying to help this country and are not whingeing.  They do the best they can under the circumstances. Just because we are not the best off country in the world does not mean that employers should have to bear a bigger burden than they bear at present.</P>
      <P>The Minister and we in this party would love to give extra benefits to the people who deserve them but unless extra resources are provided from the employers and the workers this cannot be done.  I make no bones about the fact that I am an employer who is struggling to keep his head over water and I have been doing so for a number of years.  I am fed up listening to people in this House giving out about employers as though we were leeches.  The people who employ workers in this country are trying to support employment and are not leeches.  I do not agree with what Senator Ryan says here continually.  If he wants to change society let him get the voters out and let him get rid of the poor people like us who are trying to employ people.  If he did that he would have a society in which he would not want to live.</P>

      <P>It seems that this provision will penalise unemployed women in particular.  Would the Minister explain what the position of unemployed women is going to be under this scheme?  Even though the Department of Social Welfare's guide to the social welfare services has deficiencies it is excellently produced. In producing documents like this the Minister is really giving hostages to fortune because it makes life much easier for people like me.  The document refers to the maternity allowance general scheme.  One presumes that that refers to the old scheme.  As that scheme stood a woman who qualified for that allowance would have to have 39 weeks PRSI paid during her entire employment history. Under this section that is being changed to 39 weeks PRSI contributed or credited, of which 13 weeks should be paid during the previous 12 months.  That will exclude from maternity benefit any woman who is unemployed for any length of time but who had a previous work record.  This is a non-means tested benefit and it is obviously a far more humane way of dealing with the income maintenance of a pregnant woman rather than insisting that she should sign on at a labour exchange virtually up to the moment her baby is born or else look for <Col N="324" /> supplementary welfare.  This will penalise unemployed women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a scheme for women at work and it was introduced as such in 1911.  In 1981 I as Minister for Social Welfare brought in a vastly improved scheme which provided for 14 weeks maternity benefit and 70 per cent of reckonable earnings and a basic rate of £76.  This is an excellent scheme.  At the time it was introduced we should have abolished the old scheme but we did not abolish it because we did not want people to fall between two stools.  The area of contributions and benefits is very complicated. That is why we decided to continue with the old scheme for some time and it has been in operation since.</P>
      <P>We are now saying that in order to benefit under this scheme a woman must have 13 paid contributions in the governing contribution year, which can be as far back as 21 months, from the April of the previous year.  In other words taking the year 1987 the governing year is from April 1985 to April 1986.  This scheme is being retained though the other one supersedes it.  It is being modified somewhat. This is one of the changes and pay related benefit is another.  We are merely requiring some relatively recent attachment to the workforce.  That is basically the intention of the measure and that is why the 13 paid contributions are required in the governing contribution year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What schemes are designed for when they are set up and what they actually become are not necessarily the same thing.  Perhaps the Minister will explain how many people it is expected will lose eligibility for maternity allowance under the provisions of section 10.  Perhaps he will explain what the average pay related benefit paid to people under this scheme was in the period for which he has figures.  That will give us some idea of how much on average people are going to lose.  Is it not true that this scheme applies not just to people in the workforce but also, as stated in his guide book, &ldquo;if you are not <Col N="325" /> working at present or if you do not intend to return to work after the end of your maternity leave.&rdquo;  Effectively what the Minister is doing is penalising those women who, when they become pregnant and have a baby, chose not to go back to work.  Given the rhetoric in this country about the family and constitutional commitments that nothing shall be done which will force a woman to work outside the home and so on, it seems a little peculiar that we are actually introducing a change in our social welfare code which will particularly penalise those women who, as stated in the Minister's guide book, do not intend to return to work after the end of their maternity leave. It is a most regressive and regrettable scheme and one that says nothing for any overlap between the values that we make rhetorical obeisance to and the ones we actually practice in reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The number claiming this benefit in any one year is about 15,000. This is because periods overlap from one year to another.  The number estimated to be affected by this charge will be up to 3,300.  The amount of money involved is estimated at up to £2.5 million.  The Senator mentioned the matter of, by definition, not returning to work and then talks about being unemployed.  In these circumstances the vast majority of women concerned have no intention of returning to work and are on the credit system for some years to keep the benefit alive, as it were.  The condition of the 13 paid contributions in the governing contribution year maintains a reasonable attachment to the workforce.  As I have said earlier, it can mean that even for 21 months after leaving work one still gets benefit, having left with no intention of returning to work.</P>

      <P>At present disability benefit is not payable in respect of any period of holiday leave.  Section 16 (b) provides for the introduction of three waiting days from 4 April 1988 onwards for all claimants <Col N="327" /> of disability benefit transferring from maternity allowance.  This change is justifiable because over 50 per cent of those who receive maternity allowance claim disability benefit immediately afterwards. The normal procedure is that when one goes on to disability benefit one serves a three day waiting period.  If one is seeking disability benefit, one will obviously, in the normal way, apply for it and the three waiting days will apply there also, as they do with anyone else who goes on to disability benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Effectively they do without. It is not really an admirable way of sustaining women during the immediate period after having a baby.  It does not conform to some of the values that many of the members opposite me touted around the country during a recent referendum. It does not say much for our attitudes.  If there is an abuse of any of these benefits then the abuse should be dealt with.</P>
      <P>The reason 50 per cent of women go on to disability benefit after their maternity leave is completed is because they are not able, and are not well enough, to go back to work.  It is an unfashionable view now to think that people actually get sick and cannot work. Most people now seem to believe that people are not sick, and just do not want to work, and that they get all these benefits by fiddling.  I believe that people who have been on maternity allowance go onto disability benefit simply because they are not physically capable of going back to work and because their local GP, who knows them best, believes that that is the case and signs a medical certificate to that effect.  It is mean-minded penny pinching to leave a gap of three days for somebody on a relatively small income, simply to bring them into conformity with other schemes that have different objectives. It is totally unnecessary.  Perhaps the Minister will explain, yet again, how much precisely, will be saved by this provision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no waiting period <Col N="328" /> for the maternity allowance.  As far as that is concerned one gets 14 weeks maternity leave and allowance.  If one is then applying for disability benefit, just like anyone else applying for disability benefit, one would serve the three waiting days.  The Senator may know better than I why such a large proportion of women go straight on to disability benefit after maternity leave and indeed stay on disability benefit for quite some time subsequently. The savings in a year would be of the order of £500,000.</P>

      <P>This section is, unfortunately, rather complicated.  I will have to consider an amendment on Report Stage.  The section has two parts; one a positive and worthwhile provision about holidays and the other an offensive provision. I do not like this idea, that because something happens therefore we must suspect abuse.  It is astonishing that the Minister for Social Welfare gives the impression that he has not endeavoured to find out why women who were on maternity allowance go on to disability benefit.  I would have thought in a proper managerial system, if an anomaly was thrown up one would endeavour to find out the reason before one endeavoured to deal with it.  I said this on a number of occasions about the whole area of welfare and welfare abuse.  If there is abuse, then we should find out about it and if there is not abuse then we should not penalise people because we imagine there is abuse.  If the percentage of women going on to disability benefit is particularly high, then we should find out the reason, and if it is because they are sick, then we should look at extending the period of maternity allowance because obviously people need a longer period to recover from the trauma.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion I am perfectly certain that if our Cabinet was made up of 15 women and one man, instead of 15 men and one woman, a number of the provisions in this Bill about maternity <Col N="329" /> allowance would never have been introduced. Our legislation reflects the enormously dominant male view of all these issues.  If we had a government of women, a lot of these provisions would not have even been considered because they attack women in particular.</P>

      <P>The Senator is grasping at straws and going from the sublime to the ridiculous.  First of all, it was a man in a male Cabinet who introduced the scheme.  I introduced the very much improved maternity scheme in 1981 with the base of £76 a week, which was often above the income of women in more menial jobs.  I do not accept the Senator's comments.  We have introduced an excellent scheme.  It is a scheme for women at work.  What about the woman who comes back to work and is out again after two or three days or a week?  She will have three waiting days, the same as everybody else, for disability benefit.  Three waiting days apply to disability benefit in almost all circumstances.  All that is happening here is that an anomaly in relation to the waiting days is being removed.  The impact of that will be very small on a number of people concerned because they will have 70 per cent of their earnings or a minimum of £76 per week for that period of 14 weeks.  If it transpires then that they go on disability benefit, they may be on benefit that lasts for a long time and we are back to the question of the resources of the fund.  The Deputy is obviously not happy with that situation and I do not think I can do anything more for him at this stage.  It is a similar provision to that which applies in every other circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the more regrettable parts of this Bill is that it contains the first provision to abolish pay-related benefit for one category of recipients. We have had reductions in pay-related benefit over a period of time.  Given that this Bill represents the thrust of the campaign by the right wing economic cabal that dictates policy in this country at present and represents the first victory for them in their campaign which has gone on for five or six years against the whole concept of pay-related benefit, I do not believe we have reached the end of this.  I forecast that we will have more Bills from this Government, or from the so-called alternative Government who agree with them in everything, which will lead us along the same line and we will go back to a poor law version of social welfare of which this Bill represents simply the tip of the iceberg.  I still oppose this Bill.</P>

      <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should give serious consideration to the position of athletes chosen to represent their country at international level who are in receipt of State benefit &mdash; specifically unemployment assistance.

      <P>I thank Senators for their wideranging contributions, particularly on Second Stage, and I have noted what has been said.  We will certainly bear those comments in mind because we would expect to bring in another Bill early in the New Year in relation to a number of measures.  We will bear those points in mind in our future considerations.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out to Senator Ryan that this represents no victory for any economists.  The pay-related benefit on the old scheme is being superseded by a far better scheme of maternity benefit. Consequently the Senator would be quite wrong to assume that there was any victory by any economists.  We will certainly do our bit to protect those who are in need and direct the resources towards them.  That would be my principal objective and I will resist any attempts to undermine the necessary benefits, although I obviously have to look at rationalisation and streamlining.  I believe this Bill will help me to maintain the position of those who are in genuine need.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator Pascal Mooney that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today he proposes to raise the following matter: the need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to clarify the position in relation to the British Nationality Act, 1981, in view of the widespread <Col N="332" /> concern expressed by Irish citizens resident in the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for his presence, particularly considering the Christmas season.  I am sure he is anxious, like the rest of us, to get away.  I deeply appreciate his presence here.  I do not intend to keep the House very long.</P>
      <P>In replying I hope he will allay the very real fears of some of our citizens currently residing in the United Kingdom in relation to the consequences of the British Nationality Act, 1981.  The excellent work of the London Embassy in recent months has gone some way towards reducing the initial alarm apparent in the Irish community following the number of scare stories generated by that nebulous organisation &mdash; the rumour machine &mdash; as the 31 December deadline approaches.</P>
      <P>No one issue has mobilised the Irish community in Britain in recent years to the extent that this has.  Our embassy in London was so inundated with inquiries that one of the early initiatives taken by the newly appointed Ambassador, His Excellency Andrew O'Rourke, following his appointment during the summer, was to arrange for an information sheet to be made available while the embassy's already stretched resources were further stretched by having embassy officials attend specifically convened meetings to discuss the implementation of the British Nationality Act, 1981, as its provisions apply to Irish people residing in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>The tremendous efforts of the Irish organisations in Britain, in conveying information to the Irish community, should be recorded and appreciated.  One meeting organised by the Irish Centre in Camden Town attracted an attendance in excess of 300 people, such was the interest generated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have outlined the background to this issue in order to impress on the Government and the Minister the very real concern and, in some cases, fear of a section of the Irish community in Britain about the provisions of the Act that, in some way, their rights and privileges currently <Col N="333" /> enjoyed in the United Kingdom would be eroded as a result of the passage of the legislation.  That is their main fear. What is this fear?  It centres mainly around the question of State benefits and residency qualifications.  If an Irish citizen does not register for British citizenship before 31 December specific concerns raised at the series of meetings &mdash; to which I referred earlier &mdash; include the position of an Irish citizen who moves back to Ireland who could be prevented from seeking Department of Health and Social Security benefits if he or she chooses to return to the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>In the case of Irish citizens with families, some of whom are Irish citizens &mdash; having been born here and other members of the same family born in the United Kingdom &mdash; raises the question, for example: will the Irish born be deprived of such State benefits as may accrue, by right, to a citizen of the United Kingdom while the same benefits will not accrue to the other members of the family because they were born in Ireland?</P>
    <P>There is also the position of psychiatric patients who are Irish citizens and who could find themselves released from State institutions and placed in community care.  Due to lack of funds in some local authority areas community services have not been sufficiently developed to absorb such people.  Consequently, these unfortunate people could find themselves homeless and not eligible for State benefits on account of their nationality.  Will such Irish citizens be liable to deportation? These legitimate concerns expressed, admittedly by the elderly Irish domiciled in the United Kingdom rather than the more recent, younger generation of emigrants, comes at a time when British Government policy seems to be directed at dismantling the welfare system to the point where British citizens only will ultimately be eligible for whatever limited form of State benefits system will emerge from this reform of the entire system.  The recent action of the Camden Council in London, in refusing housing accommodation to nine Irish citizens whom they deem to be eligible for housing <Col N="334" /> in Ireland, has raised the temperature among Irish organisations in the United Kingdom.  They argue &mdash; not without reason &mdash; that the future thrust of British Government policy is to exclude as many as possible from the State benefit system in keeping with the Prime Minister's penchant in recent years for a return to Victorian values.</P>
    <P>I am not arguing for a special case for Irish citizens but rather that the rights enjoyed by British citizens in Ireland will continue to be reciprocated and that Irish citizens in the United Kingdom will not be victimised as a result of their not registering for British nationality before the end of this month.  In the short to medium term I do not believe they will be in any way discriminated against.  I believe they have no need to register before 31 December.  I should be grateful if the Minister could address the fears of those of our citizens who have lived and worked in the United Kingdom, who have paid their taxes and generally made a worthwhile contribution to post-war reconstruction in Great Britain, at a time when they were desperately in need of such skilled labour which this country could provide.  Indeed, sadly for us, this country is still supplying people of that calibre in huge numbers.  Law-abiding citizens who, in the twilight of their lives, should be permitted to live without even a perceived threat hanging over their status, who, because of the difficulties obtaining, afforded them little choice but to take the emigrant ship &mdash; and who have maintained their Irish citizenship and that deep affection for their mother country, should not be discriminated against.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Government will allay these fears, as outlined, and will continue to see it as the duty of any Irish Government to monitor, on a continuous basis, the status and conditions of our citizens abroad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary) Sean Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Senator Mooney for the opportunity of reiterating in this House when I have already said on a number of occasions in England recently.  I agree <Col N="335" /> with him that it is an urgent matter, one causing much anxiety on the part of our citizens in England.</P>
      <P>The Government are aware that there has been widespread concern among sections of the Irish Community in Britain about what they see as the possible implications of the British Nationality Act, 1981.</P>
      <P>The policy of successive Irish Governments has always been to develop the closest possible links with the Irish community and, in particular, with Irish organisations in Britain.  In pursuit of this policy, the Tánaiste travelled, in May last, to the annual conference in Jersey of the Federation of Irish Societies.  This enabled him to meet with the federation and to listen to their views and concerns. He also met the federation on their visit to Dublin in September.  I myself also made three recent visits to Irish community groups, two in London and one in Manchester.  We are, therefore, engaged in an on-going dialogue with the responsible and representative leaders of the Irish community in Britain.  It is as a result of this dialogue, and through the active work of the Embassy in London &mdash; a matter which has been referred to by Senator Mooney &mdash; that we have become aware of the current concern about the British Nationality Act, 1981.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I should first explain to the House the implications of the Act.  Under the Act, the option is open to Irish citizens who have been living in Britain since before 1 January 1973, to register as British citizens if they fulfil the following requirements: (a) they are over 18 years of age; (b) pay £60 sterling; (c) show evidence that they have lived in Britain for the required period; and (d) complete the necessary formalities which include a declaration of allegiance.  Applications for registration under the Act must take place before 31 December, 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, of course, no question of an obligation on Irish citizens to register. However, if Irish people do decide to register they will not lose their Irish citizenship. They will retain their right to an Irish passport and to the other benefits <Col N="336" /> of Irish citizenship.  Registration, in effect would mean that the person concerned would be a dual citizen of Britain and Ireland.</P>
    <P>However, to deal with Senator Mooney's points I might emphasise one basic point.  The rights and duties which Irish citizens currently enjoy in Britain and the reciprocal rights of British people here will not be affected by the expiry of the 31 December 1987 deadline.  Therefore if Irish people decide not to register their current status will be unchanged. Moreover, the option to apply for naturalisation will continue to be open to anyone who has been resident in Britain for the required 5-year period.  I might add that this is unrelated to the 31 December deadline contained in the British Nationality Act, 1981.</P>
    <P>The basic rights of Irish people in Britain today may be summarised as: first, the right to take up residence; second, the right to take up employment; third, the right to travel freely between Britain and Ireland, fourth the right to receive social security, health care and retirement pensions.</P>
    <P>All these rights are based on Acts of the British Parliament, other than the British Nationality Act 1981, including the Ireland Act, 1949, the Representation of the People Act, 1949, and the Immigration Act, 1971.  These rights are unaffected by the British Nationality Act.  These have in part also been strengthened by our common membership of the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>No Irish Government would, of course, be able to give an open-ended and binding commitment that the British Parliament will not alter the above Acts at a future time.  It is fair, however, to say that such a course of action is extremely unlikely in the foreseeable future.  In fact, in the context of our joint membership of the European Community, the trend is for greater freedom of movement rather than for the imposition of new restrictions.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I appreciate and understand the apprehension of some members of the Irish Community.  The <Col N="337" /> Government, therefore, have begun a vigorous information campaign on the issue.  The Embassy, for instance, has taken out advertisements in Irish newspapers in Britain explaining the implications of the Act.  We have followed this up with additional advertising in other relevant publications such as the Catholic Herald and the Scottish Catholic Observer.  In addition, staff from the Irish Embassy in London have been attending and speaking at the information meetings on the Act.  I would like to join him in thanking the Embassy staff for their tremendous efforts in this work.  These meetings have been attracting very large numbers.</P>
    <P>The Government will actively continue the above information campaign.  In doing so, we also pay tribute to the good work being done by the Federation of Irish Societies and by the Irish in Britain Representation Group.  I can assure all responsible Irish organisations in Britain that they can count on the assistance of the Irish Embassy in their endeavours to explain the Act to their members.</P>
    <P>The Government hope that, as a result of the co-ordination drive by the Embassy and by Irish organisations, any fears and <Col N="338" /> concerns that still exist can be quickly allayed.  If, however, any Irish people have continuing doubts about the Act they should contact the Embassy in London who will be more than happy to help.  The Embassy has been in active contact with the British Home Office on the issue and will as a result, be able to respond fully to any questions.  I might add that the Embassy is already dealing with in the region of 150 telephone inquiries a day about the Nationality Act.</P>
    <P>I hope that I have answered the questions which have arisen here tonight.  I welcome this debate.  In particular, the issues which affect the Irish community in Britain are a matter of concern for all of us.  I would, therefore, like to pay tribute to Senator Mooney for his concern and commitment on that and indeed other issues which affect our people overseas. I hope that I have succeeded in clarifying the situation and in allaying those fears and worries that still exist.  I will be happy to help any Senator who may have special inquiries to make.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 18 December 1987.</P>
