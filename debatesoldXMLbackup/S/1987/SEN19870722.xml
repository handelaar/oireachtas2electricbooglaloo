      <P>Ba mhaith liom go gcuirfeadh an Seanad a chomhbhrón in iúl ar bhás Dhonncha Eoin Uí Shúilleabháin ó Droichead na Bandain a cailleadh i gCorcaigh inné agus a bhí in a Bhall den Teach seo ó 1965 go 1969.  Fear uasal, lách croíúil a bhí ann agus ar nós iar-Seanadóir eile atá imithe ar shlí na fírinne go gairid, is é sin Gus Healy, d'oibrigh sé go díograiseach ar son an phobail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the House would like to express its sympathy on the death yesterday of Dinny Eoin O'Sullivan who had a distinguished career in politics and who was a Member of the Seanad from 1965 to 1969.  He was a gentle, public spirited man with particular commitment to educational issues.  Among the numerous public bodies on which he served was the governing body of University College, Cork, and I recall in particular his activity there until quite recently, despite his deteriorating health.  The lives of people like Gus Healy, another former Member of this House who died recently, and Dinny Eoin O'Sullivan were a celebration of the best in Irish politics in their dedication to and rapport with the people whom they served.  Dinny Eoin <Col N="2646" /> went far beyond the requirements of political expediency in, for example, continuing to equip himself all his life educationally in order to understand society better and its processes.  Cynicism about politics may be occasionally well based but cynicism is entirely confounded by the lives and the service of people like Dinny Eoin O'Sullivan.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with Senator Murphy in passing a vote of sympathy in this House with the relatives of the late Denis Eoin O'Sullivan.  He played a major part in the public life of this country.  I would equally like to ask the House to pass a motion of sympathy to the relatives of Gus Healy.  Gus Healy served this House and, indeed, the other House extremely well.  He served his country, his party and in particular the people of Cork.  I first came across Gus Healy in a sporting sphere when he was chairman of the water safety section of the Red Cross in Cork.  In that capacity he was instrumental in saving many lives. When he entered public life he devoted himself tirelessly to his duties.  Indeed, at times it seemed that he put his public duties before his health.  He will be a big loss to the citizens of Cork of which he was Lord Mayor and to the citizens of Ireland in general.  As Senator Murphy said, people like these should not be forgotten. I ask the House to pass a motion of sympathy.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael group I would like to say that we mourn the passing of Denis Eoin O'Sullivan, a former Member of this House and a Member of Dáil Éireann for many years.  He served the public with dignity and integrity and always demonstrated a kindly, generous, tolerant spirit.  We are the poorer for his passing.  We also wish to be associated with the vote of sympathy with the relatives of the late Gus Healy.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party group I want to be associated with the votes of sympathy with both families of the deceased former Members of this <Col N="2647" /> House, the late Dinny Eoin O'Sullivan and Gus Healy.  I had the honour to know Gus Healy in public life.  Unfortunately, I did not have the honour to know Mr. O'Sullivan.  Gus Healy was a person with whom many of us were very friendly during his term in this House, in the other House and as first citizen of Cork.  We all aspired to count him among our friends, and it was a sad moment when we recorded his passing recently.  It is appropriate that the House should extend its sympathy and respect to the relatives of both men.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I call on the Leader of the House today to announce the Order of Business I want to make an announcement to the House for the information of Members regarding the progress report from the Office of Public Works on the Seanad Chamber which was considered by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges this morning.  I know Senators will be kept pretty up to date on the current position by Members on the committee.  Nevertheless, I feel that, as Cathaoirleach, I should keep Members of this House informed as much as possible on the up to date position as the work progresses.  Accordingly I have a statement to make which summarises the rather long and technical report which was laid on my desk and was before the committee this morning.</P>
      <P>Regarding the status of the work, tenders were invited on 10 July 1987 from selected contractors for the works necessary to restore the Seanad area of Leinster House to normal use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A duration of two and a half years is being allowed to restore the Seanad area to normal working.  This is a maximum <Col N="2648" /> period and every effort will be made to complete the work in a shorter time.  I should add that the committee's and my own concern is to get our Chamber back as soon as possible and we will try to ensure that the work is completed in a shorter time if at all possible.  The Department of Finance have conveyed financial approval in respect of the proposed works subject to an overall cost limit.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Seanad Chamber ceiling, I will quote directly from the report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Damage has been caused to the ceiling by distortion of the supporting framework due to the structural failure of the arch spanning the bow and the failure of the timber beam which carried the cornice across the opening.  A substantial area of plasterwork in the ceiling adjacent to the bow had disintegrated because the bond between the plastering undercoats and the key to the timber laths had broken.  This defective area was removed.  Elsewhere there is evidence that the bond between the various plaster elements including the key to the timber laths has failed.  In keeping with the Commissioners past record of saving important examples of plasterwork every effort will be made to retain as much of the original Seanad Chamber ceiling as is possible.  Expert advice has been sought on how this might be achieved. In making a final decision the Commissioners principal concern will be the structural adequacy of the restored ceiling so that the business of the House can be conducted in a secure and safe environment without the need for further works in the foreseeable future.  As a precautionary measure moulds have been made of the decorative features so that the entire ceiling can be reproduced if necessary.</P>
    <P>I should add that there are outstanding examples of Office of Public Works work in this regard.  The Royal Hospital in Kilmainham and the Rotunda in the National Gallery which required work very similar to the work required for the <Col N="2649" /> Seanad ceiling.  It is proposed that future progress reports should be on a quarterly basis for the benefit of all Members of this House.</P>
    <P>From the statement I have just read Members will note that the progress report is concerned with the restoration of the Seanad Chamber.  I would like to add that I have arranged for improvements to be made in the temporary Chamber during our very short summer recess, which I hope will make our stay there a little more comfortable than it has been for the past two years.  The committee approved of these arrangements and of the plans drawn up in that regard by the Office of Public Works.  In the main, more comfortable seating is being provided with additional seats of up to 54 instead of the present 46.</P>
    <P>I would like to add a personal note, if I may.  Since becoming Cathaoirleach, I have been very impressed at the way in which the Seanad has got on with its task. Any reasonable person would expect the level and workload of a House of Parliament to suffer in view of the drawback presented by our temporary accommodation, but this is not so.  The momentum created in the record breaking last Seanad as regards sittings is being equalled and certainly surpassed in the number of Government Bills introduced in this House in little over two and a half months since this Seanad session began.  The number of Government Bills introduced augurs well for this Seanad.</P>
    <P>To date 18 Bills have been passed, seven Bills have been introduced in the Seanad of which two have been passed and for the third year in a row we are taking a very short summer recess.  It is important to repeat that.  It is becoming obvious to me that the Seanad is getting a better press of late, and, indeed, RTE have also done us proud.  People in the street have said to me that they are happy to read and hear about this House.</P>
    <P>I know it may be out of place for a Cathaoirleach to put these facts on record, as I have no wish to steal the thunder of the Leader of the House, Senator Mick Lanigan.  Nevertheless, I feel I have to show my appreciation to <Col N="2650" /> my Seanad colleagues for the tremendous amount of hard work they have done in a very trying and taxing environment.  As I said on the first day of this Seanad session, I am always available for sensible discussion re the working of the House and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges have taken a serious look at the review of Standing Orders.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have notice from Senator Brian O'Shea that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to expand the recent decentralisation programme to include other areas than those designated in order to redress regional imbalances.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Nuala Fennell of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to account for the grave situation created in St. James' Hospital, due to the health cuts.  The closure of half the beds in this hospital will have serious consequences for the old and the sick throughout the community.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Michael Ferris of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Labour to ensure that funding under the Youth Employment Agency for the green certificate in farming be continued.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Katharine Bulbulia of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The legitimate concern of permanent pensionable staff of voluntary hospitals in relation to statutory redundancy and pension rights as a consequence of Government health cuts which threaten the survival of many such hospitals.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator John Connor of the following matters:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>1.  The need for the Minister for <Col N="2651" /> Agriculture and Food to facilitate grant payments to farmers who undertook emergency farm building due to the inclement weather in 1985 and 1986 under the farm improvement scheme.</P>
    <P>2.  The need for the Minister for Education to provide funds to erect a new primary school at Frenchpark, County Roscommon.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Phil Hogan of the following matters.</P>
    <P>1.  The present position regarding the proposed Castlecomer community school.  County Kilkenny, and when work will commence.</P>
    <P>2.  The present position regarding the new model primary school, Castlecomer Road, County Kilkenny, and when work will commence.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Katharine Bulbulia of another matter:</P>
    <P>The severe underfunding of the Council of Status of Women which represents 250,000 women and 55 affiliated organisations.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Eamon de Buitléar of the following matter.</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to ensure in the interest of economic rectitude and environmental protection, that all future grant aided drainage work or arterial drainage should be subject to cost benefit analysis.</P>
    <P>I regard all matters as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Brian O'Shea's motion and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Fennell, Ferris, Bulbulia, Connor, Hogan and de Buitléar may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>
    <P>At this point I would like to remind Senators that they will have to repeat the process of giving notices of motions on the Adjournment.  We are continually receiving notices of such motions but <Col N="2652" /> when they are not taken the notice should be repeated if the Members concerned do not wish the motions to lapse.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not having a discussion on it.  I wanted every person in the House to know the present position. I have asked for a quarterly report. This will mean that every Member will be informed of the work in the Chamber as the work progresses.  I prefer always to be told about something in which I am interested as opposed to reading about it somewhere.  That is why I, as Cathaoirleach, decided to make the statement, and to tell every Member of the Seanad how we are progressing.  I would prefer if we did not open a discussion on the matter now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope what I have to say will make you feel better also.  You went to great lengths, and I congratulate you on this, in giving the information to the Seanad because such information does not always filter down to every Senator even though we have representatives, with no disrespect to them, on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  You also went to great lengths to ensure that the public do not get the impression that the Seanad is crumbling, even if its Chamber is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if the Leader of the House would give some consideration to an Adjournment debate.  There are also a number of items I think we should review.  After all, we are sitting much longer hours this year than the Seanad ever sat before.  Last year we sat, I think, a record time, until 9 July.  This year we will sit at least 14 days longer.  I expect we will be sitting tomorrow judging by the amount of business I see on the Order Paper.  We have initiated in this House seven Bills, as you have just said, and we have passed 18 Bills.  The initiation of so many Bills in this House is a departure <Col N="2653" /> from the normal procedure of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>While I accept that the Constitution provides for the initiation of Bills in the Seanad, are we departing from the spirit of the constitution in initiating seven Bills in one short term?  In other words, the major debate on those Bills is now taking place in the Upper House rather than in the Lower House which has been the practice since the Constitution was enacted.  I do not want to give the impression that I am taking from the work of the Seanad, but we are departing from what has been normal procedure over the years.  This should be considered. We should know the Government's intention for the remainder of the life of this Seanad, whether it be six months or four years.  We should know if we will continue in this vein and look at our constitutional position.  We should have a two hour Adjournment debate and I am sure most Senators would be willing to come here again tomorrow to clear the air on this point.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Leader of the House will answer you in his own lovely style but I am amazed at you, Senator McMahon, because while you complimented the statement, you then criticised the amount of legislation. As regards our entitlement under the Constitution, I am certain that the Attorney General would not allow us to take Bills if they were unconstitutional.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <P>Mr. Lanigan: It is intended to take items Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 today.  There will be no break during the day and we intend to sit late.  The only guarantee I can give <Col N="2654" /> is that we will break at 6.30 p.m. to take the motion, Item No. 3.</P>
    <P>On the point made by Senator McMahon, I have a funny feeling that he must not have read the Constitution.  If he had, he would not query the fact that we have had a record number of Bills initiated here in the opening session of this Seanad.  I assure the Senator that in the next few months there will be a further large number of Bills and I compliment the Taoiseach on his initiative in introducing so many Bills in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The Seanad has come under a tremendous amount of pressure from various sources over the past number of years. We are now being given an opportunity to redress in the public mind any problems there were in regard to this House being anything other than a talking shop.  The people who speak about the House being a talking shop have never looked into the origins of the word &ldquo;parliament&rdquo; because basically the word &ldquo;parliament&rdquo; means a talking shop and that is as it should be. Many Bills will be initiated here during the lifetime of this Seanad and I can guarantee that there will be time given to everybody.  Indeed, I have given time to everyone up to now to address themselves to the Bills on hand.</P>
    <P>With regard to the condition of the Seanad Chamber, if anyone needs to have a detailed look at the proposals of the Office of Public Works, the report given by them to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges could be given to individual members if they so require.  If anyone is worried about progress or plans it will not be too late to have a debate on the matter early in the next session.  I guarantee that we will allow a debate at that stage.</P>

      <P>May I ask a couple of questions?  I accept the Order of Business which has been given for today but is the Leader of the House in a position to indicate anything about the order for tomorrow and to tell us what dates he has in mind for the recess and for the resumption?  May I also ask if it is intended to complete the Abbatoirs Bill and the Adoption (No. 2) Bill this side <Col N="2655" /> of the recess or merely to complete their Second Stages?</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, I should like to compliment you on the statement you have made, to support the second part of your statement and to thank the Government for introducing legislation in this House.  The party who were quick to criticise this House will have had less of an impact on legislation over the whole term of this Dáil than we have had in the first part of it.  I should like to ask the Leader of the House the dates he has planned for the recess in order that we can plan ahead.  I should also like to raise the question of the Private Members' motion which is to be taken at 6.30 p.m.  Judging from the number of speakers offering on this motion there will not be enough time to facilitate them.  As you said in your opening statement people are saying that the Seanad is being heard from and read about.  The motion we are continuing today is of great relevance.  Therefore, would the Leader of the House consider extending the time available for that motion?  This would be in everybody's interest and in the interest of the House particularly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection either to the Order of Business as outlined by the Leader of the House or to his using this House to the fullest extent, as he has been doing since this Seanad was elected. In the previous four and a half to five years we had been trying to do the same thing.  It is generally appreciated by everybody that as one House of the Legislature, the Seanad can give the kind of detailed examination to Bills that is required.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Leader of the House and the Government for using this House to ensure that legislation is properly discussed. I am not being derogatory about the other House but I am aware of the level of discussion and debate that can arise here.  However, I am sure that legislation &mdash; the more the better &mdash; benefits from being initiated in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2656" /> The amount of legislation initiated here and the length of discussion that takes place on Bills is a matter for Members of the House.  I am not aware of any effort by the Leader of the House to curtail any Member in contributing to legislation at any of its stages.  In the past when a Bill appeared on the Order Paper as being ordered for Second Stage that reference normally gave some little time to people to prepare for the debate as a date for the debate was usually set.  I presume that the Second Stage of the Abattoirs Bill will be ordered for this afternoon so that people who intend to contribute to it will be prepared.</P>
    <P>If we intend to deal with Second Stage of the Abattoirs Bill, it is obvious, from the interest evoked, that we will need to sit late tonight and tomorrow and, possibly, next week.  Will we also finish Second Stage of the Adoption Bill?  I am aware that some people would like to contribute to that Bill.  Is it intended before the recess to complete the Second Stages of these two Bills?  If so, does the Leader of the House intend to extend the Private Members' motion after 8 o'clock as suggested by Senator J. O'Toole?  Will the House resume after that motion is completed to continue the Abattoirs Bill?</P>

      <P>I was delighted this morning when I heard you say that the Office of Public Works had appointed a contractor to restore the Seanad Chamber. We should all be very proud of the Seanad and the Dáil Chambers.  Anyone who has visited the Houses of Parliament in other countries will appreciate that ours are much better than those abroad. I notice that a period of two and a half years was mentioned in your statement for the contractor to finish the job.  This is a long time to have the job completed.</P>

I had a little experience of this when the bar was being renovated. I succeeded in getting it done a little more quickly after negotiations.  You might use your good offices to ask the Office of Public Works to encourage the contractor to have it finished more quickly.</P>

      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's proposal that the time for item No. 3 be extended in view of the likelihood of many more speakers offering. One possibility of extending it, if it is not feasible to take it this evening or tomorrow, is to make sure that it appears on the Order Paper when we meet next when its relevance will not have disappeared. In fact, since the education year will have begun, it will be even more relevant.</P>

      <P>Apropos your statement, will it be clearly given to the media and the various groups who are quite concerned about the old Chamber because there has been a fair bit of questioning and concern about it.  We accept your statement and are pleased to have it, but I hope various vested groups will be made aware of it.</P>
      <P>On a matter of information, is there any possibility that there will be a development on the lengthy debate we had on the role, status and electoral process for this House?  If I recall rightly, Senator Robinson made a proposal that there should be a committee of Senators to go over the points proposed in the debate and, perhaps, we could make proposals. I do not know where such a committee would originate.  Would it be from you, or have you given any further thought to it?</P>

I strongly request that there should be some extension of the time made available because I attempted to speak and it was not possible for me to do so.  I see myself in some sense as representing a constituency by which I have been briefed at the very highest level.  I speak of the University of Dublin which did not merit one single word of mention in the Minister's speech, something I found quite astonishing.  There are specific problems relating to the development of the University of Dublin, but no mention has been made of them and I strongly request the opportunity to have this matter debated in public.  It appears that if I do not take it up, nobody else in this House will.</P>

      <P>The Leader of the House did not deal with the point I made, that is, my request for a few hours for an Adjournment debate.  With regard to some of the remarks that have been passed, I never regarded the Seanad as a talking shop.  I regarded it as doing a very important job as a House of the Oireachtas.  We are doing a more important job today than we have been doing down the years.  I do not think anybody can deny that a Bill initiated in the Dáil, unfortunately, gets a greater deal of public debate.  We have been fighting for the attention of the media and we have been getting more in recent times but nothing like what we should be getting, and, certainly nothing like the attention Bills initiated in this House should be getting.  The media are giving the Seanad greater coverage now when the Dáil is not sitting, but when the Dáil is sitting, how much attention will we get for Bills initiated in the Seanad?  We are doing a far better job on Bills initiated in this House now than we did in the past when they were first publicly debated in the Dáil and then in the Seanad.  I am glad <Col N="2659" /> to have an opportunity to at least air those views and that is why I am asking the Leader of the House to allow even a couple of hours for an Adjournment debate so that we could review what we have been doing during this session.  I believe this would be healthy for ourselves, for the country and for democracy.</P>

      <P>I was severely discomfited by those remarks.  As you know, a Chathaoirligh, because you were involved, the Seanad has dealt with major legislation and the debates on the Status of Children Bill and the Clinical Trials Bill in the last Seanad in my view justify the existence of the House on their own. Therefore, I want to thank the Government for continuing that position.  It is also somewhat of a tradition that we sometimes comment on the Order of Business on events that happened outside this House, but when an event occurs which is noted throughout the world, as happened recently, I would like the House to note it.  A man celebrated his 69th birthday last Saturday, and it was also the 25th successive birthday he spent in prison.  When that man is visited in prison by world leaders and statesman, <Col N="2660" /> and when he celebrates, as I said, his 25th successive birthday in prison, we should send the greetings of this House to him. I suggest, therefore, that the greetings of Seanad Éireann should be sent to Nelson Mandela on the occasion of his 69th birthday.</P>

      <P>I refer to motion No. 26. The Labour Party group have not been afforded any Private Members' Time during this session of the Seanad.  This is the motion we would have been putting had we been afforded Private Members' Time.  This motion is non-contentious. It deals with an anomaly in the local government Acts which, when they were drafted, did not foresee that Local Authority outdoor staff would be on short time.  I ask the House's indulgence and ask the Leader of the House to give the Labour Party the opportunity to formally move and second this non-contentious motion.  This is of grave concern to 230 outdoor staff members of Waterford County Council who will lose some pension rights and part of their lump sum because they must work 250 days in the year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would like him to know that this matter has arisen since I first spoke on the Order of Business.  Also, if it is possible, I would certainly support the suggestion of Senator Brendan Ryan to send birthday greetings to the imprisoned <Col N="2661" /> South African freedom fighter, Nelson Mandela, in Paulsmore Prison.</P>

I would like to support emphatically the plea by the independent Senators here that the time for the discussion on that very important motion on education cuts would be extended, as has been done in the case of the discussion on the role of the Seanad.  These education cuts, as has been said, are of major concern to students, teachers and various interests throughout the country.  I would like to put it to the House and to the Leader that there is a wide spectrum of expertise and opinions in this House.  It would be appropriate that the Minister for Education and the Government would be aware of these opinions.  As the Leader of the House has already indicated, he is anxious to facilitate the participation of all Senators who wish to contribute in these debates.  I would appeal, therefore, to him to facilitate Senators who wish to speak on this very important motion.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to allow an open-ended discussion on anybody's motion, whether it be Fine Gael, Independents or Labour.  Having said that, since there is a number of speakers who wish to contribute, I would ask the Members who wish to speak to curtail the length of their speeches and to cut their time possibly from 15 minutes to 7 minutes.  That would allow more than double the number of speakers in; it <Col N="2662" /> would give everybody an opportunity. Even Senator Norris would be able to make a number of relevant points on Trinity College in a seven-minute speech. Anybody who could not make his or her point in seven minutes should not be making the point at all.  I would suggest that the Whips meet and that we would allow a short extension of time but that there will be a curtailment of time for each speaker.  If the Whips could meet immediately after this, the matter can be discussed between now and 6.30 p.m.</P>
      <P>To get back to the points made by Senator Bulbulia, it is intended that we take the Second Stage only of the Abattoirs Bill and the Adoption Bill.  Quite a number of people around the country have a major interest in the Abattoirs Bill because it has repercussions not only for the people involved but also at local authority and health board levels.  There will be plenty of time for discussions before we take Committee Stage of that Bill.  The Adoption Bill, again is a Bill in which many people have an interest and it is better teased out on Committee Stage. Again, we will allow time to elapse before Committee Stage and concluding Stages of that Bill are taken.</P>
      <P>Regarding the recess, it is intended that we come back early in September.  I am not giving any guarantee as to whether it will be 9 September or 16 September but for anybody who wishes to make plans between now and then, the situation is that we will not come back earlier than 9 September or later than 16 September.</P>
      <P>Senator Ferris referred to the procedure for ordering and taking Second Stage.  Possibly I should have ordered Second Stage last week and taken it this week but it was on the Order Paper and people knew it was coming up.  I will ensure in future that there will be a time lapse, even if it is only a day between the ordering and the taking of the Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fennell mentioned the groups who have a vested interest in the Chamber. The Members of this House, the Committee on Procedures and Privileges and the Office of Public Works have a <Col N="2663" /> more vested interest in seeing that the job is done properly than some of the people who have indicated their interest. Their points have been taken by both the Office of Public Works and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and they will be kept informed.  The only body who have a right to reply are An Taisce. They must be replied to, but that does not mean that the others who also have an interest will not be given the up-to-date information.</P>
    <P>When mention was made at the begining of this session of the role of the Seanad, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges met immediately and a sub-committee of that committee has been formed.  As the Cathaoirleach has said the members have met already four times and are discussing a number of matters which will make the role of the Seanad seemingly more relevant, and I stress the word &ldquo;seemingly&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Senator McMahon said that possibly democracy is not seen to be done because the reporting of the Seanad debates is not given the same inportance as the debates are given, on their initiation, in the other House.  It is not this House which is hindering democracy in this area; rather is it the media who are not reporting the debates which take place here.  I will not say anything further on that except that democracy has not been served by the media in their inattention to the Seanad which is a very important part of the legislature, and the media should pay as much attention to it as they do to the other House, particularly when Bills are being initiated here.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan mentioned Senator, or Mr. Nelson Mandela &mdash; possibly he would be a Senator if he were allowed to go into the upper House of this country.</P>

      <P>Senator Brian O'Shea raised a question regarding item No. 26.  I have not refused to take motions from the Labour group. Indeed, Senator Ferris would have to agree that at a meeting of the Committtee on Procedure and Privileges I agreed that the Labour Party, even though they do not constitute a group in terms of their numbers, be given the facility of introducing motions, but they will do so in rotation.  Regarding the motion that Senator O'Shea has put down, he will have an opportunity to bring that motion forward very early in the next session and I think that should be acceptable.</P>
      <P>Senator McEllistrim again raised the matter of the Chamber and referred to the employment of contractors.  From what I know the contracts will be placed by people who will want to come in here, do the necessary job on that Chamber and get out.  From the list of people who have expressed an interest in tendering, I have absolutely no doubt that the job will be done correctly, and that the Chamber will be as all interested groups wish to see it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be associated with the tributes paid to a former colleague of mine as a Member of the Seanad from 1965 to 1969, the late Senator Dinny Eoin O'Sullivan.  I was a Member of this House during that period and I would like to be associated with the tributes paid to him by the House and also with the sympathy expressed for his family.  I hope Senators will understand that I do not want to indicate any discourtesy to the House if I am not able at this point to hear the preliminary statements of the leaders of the parties on this legislation.  I had arranged a programme today so that I would be able to hear their statements but I mistakenly assumed that I might be starting this speech earlier.  I <Col N="2666" /> have made alternative arrangements but I will be back in the House later on.</P>
      <P>The fundamental aim of this Bill is to meet the need for a comprehensive and uniform set of national quality standards for slaughtering of meat for the home market.  Changed trading practices and increased consumer awareness in recent years have shown also that many of the existing controls in this area need to be updated.  The Bill also provides for a new system of controls on meat disposals for non-human use.</P>
      <P>A significant aspect of the Bill is that for the first time it gives my Department a pivotal role in the control and regulation of the domestic meat trade.  Hitherto this trade was regulated by a large number of virtually autonomous local sanitary authorities operating through some full time but in the main part time veterinary officials and in certain respects by the regional health boards through their environmental health officers.</P>
      <P>For many years concern has been expressed about conditions at abattoirs providing meat for the home market.  The main criticism has been that these abattoirs operate under much lower standards than the export plants.  A survey of abattoirs and knackeries conducted in 1982 by my Department indicated that there were 854 local abattoirs in operation. While high standards prevailed in many, some premises were found to be old and insanitary, difficult to keep clean and far short of the standards considered necessary for any food premises.  Together, these premises handle an annual slaughtering throughput of 230,000 cattle, 790,000 sheep and 320,000 pigs, representing the vast bulk of this country's home meat requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local abattoirs are supervised by veterinary inspectors employed by the sanitary authorities and/or environmental health officers from the health boards. The lack of proper and uniform standards is partly due to this diffusion of control and also to the fact that outside the major centres of population the veterinary inspectors are for the most part employed on a part time basis only.  Of 160 veterinary inspectors employed in the local <Col N="2667" /> authority veterinary service only 24 are full time employees and these full time officers are concentrated in only nine local authority areas.</P>
    <P>By contrast, there are some 70 factories engaged in the export trade, including licensed bacon plants, which are comparatively modern and well equipped. They operate under the full time supervision of officers from my Department with over 250 personnel, including 64 veterinary inspectors, so engaged. This corps of full time officers is backed up by some 400 private veterinary practitioners who are employed at the plants on a part time basis.  The cost of this supervision is met by the imposition of a fee on each animal slaughtered.  These export factories have to comply with stringent national, EC and third country requirements in regard to premises and equipment, slaughtering standards and hygiene, and most of the Bill's provisions will not, of course, apply to them.  While this Bill and the regulations to be made thereunder will not attempt to convert local abattoirs into export meat plants, many of the provisions, particularly in the area of hygiene, will mirror the controls applicable on the export side.</P>
    <P>As regards knackeries it must be acknowledged that a valuable and practical service is rendered to the farming community by the majority of these premises.  However, I am not satisfied that the activities of all correspond with the best interests of both public and animal health and this is the reason for tightening up the controls applicable to the knackeries as provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Existing legislation, some of it dating from the mid 19th century, places responsibility for the control of local abattoirs and knackeries on 87 sanitary authorities.  This legislative maze is further complicated by the separate, existence of 11 local improvement Acts each of which contains provisions relating to abattoirs within the area of the sanitary authority concerned.  It could be said that the present unsatisfactory position regarding local slaughtering premises is at least partly due to both the number <Col N="2668" /> and the antiquated nature of the laws themselves just as much as it is to the discretionary powers they give to sanitary authorities to administer them.  Some authorities have not adopted meat inspection by-laws and only some 70 per cent of abattoirs are licensed.  Add to that the predominantly part time veterinary control exercised over these premises and it is easy to understand the variations in standards and practices as applied from county to county.  Moreover, the penalties for breaches of the existing legislation are so small as to render prosecutions largely ineffective.</P>
    <P>These divergent standards are also manifested in the trading area and nowhere more so than in the pigmeat sector.  The House is aware that the pigmeat industry has been going through difficult times.  Increased competition on the home and export markets has presented the licensed bacon plants with serious problems.  Rationalisation within the industry has already taken place and, indeed, more must follow if the industry is to secure and develop its position in the economy.  In this connection, earlier this month I announced a major programme for the development of the industry to enable it to exploit export market opportunities.  Currently only 25 per cent of pigs slaughtered are exported. The bulk of the kill therefore is chasing a market in which significant inroads have been made by local pork butchers in the last five years.  Pig slaughterings by pork butchers have increased by 70 per cent during this period.  The licensed bacon plants are thus being placed at a competitive disadvantage <i>vis-a-vis</i> their unlicensed competitors owing to the cost of observing stringent hygiene standards and meeting veterinary inspection fees. Unless competitive equality can be restored to the home market I can see prices paid to pig producers suffering in the long term.  Through the extension of veterinary controls, including fees, to all local slaughterings this Bill should also provide useful assistance to the pigmeat industry as a whole.</P>
    <P>The butchers' trade itself has been undergoing change.  The growth of <Col N="2669" /> wholesaling and the development of slaughtering facilities by wholesaling establishments have cut the number of private abattoirs by about 350 since the early seventies.  Slaughtering for their own businesses would appear to have become unattractive for many small butchers particularly at a time when labour and other costs were continually increasing. Consumer preferences and concerns have also pushed the trade into change. The battle is on at present to arrest an unwelcome decline in home consumption of meat and I am glad to say that it appears to be succeeding.  Other challenges to be met include meat substitutes, the prospect of increased imports of fresh meat and meat products and new EC controls on domestic meat supplies. Clearly, the trade needs to be flexible and adaptive now more than ever.  To their credit, the majority in the trade recognise the need for fresh ground rules on the preparation of meat and also the need to root out the cowboy operators who can give the trade a bad name.  Most of our abattoirs are owned by family butchers, many of whom have been in the trade for generations.  Their name and good reputation underpin the quality of their meat and in meeting fresh challenges, this Bill will greatly assist them in making the transition from the old to the new while securing an enhanced reputation for the meat they produce.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes two major divisions of responsibility aimed at improving standards namely: licensing of premises by my Department and veterinary control of premises, including supervision of all slaughterings, to be vested in the 27 county councils and the 5 county borough corporations.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, because licensing of premises is lax in many areas and given the Bill's objective of establishing a national domestic standard on a par with export standards, there is a need for a central licensing body, at least in the short term.  My Department, who for long has been closely involved with the export meat plants, have the necessary expertise to do this job.  I am providing, <Col N="2670" /> however, that the licensing function may be returned to local authorities if it is found desirable or necessary to do so at a future stage.  Under the new arrangements, every abattoir and knackery will have to be licensed annually and a licence fee in the range of £10 to £100 will be payable.  Proprietors will be allowed time to bring their premises up to standard where this is called for and appeals to the Circuit Court are being provided for in the event of refusal or revocation of a licence.  Licensing will commence soon after the Bill's enactment.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided that enforcement of the new veterinary controls should continue to be exercised at local level.  Each of the major local authorities will be required to employ sufficient veterinary inspectors to ensure effective implementation of the controls. Each authority, or where warranted a combination of not more than two authorities, must employ at least one full time officer.  It is envisaged that the existing experienced local authority veterinary staff structure will form the nucleus for the necessary staffing to implement the Bill's provisions.  All slaughterings will be subject to veterinary examination by way of ante and post-mortem inspection and all meat found fit for human consumption will be stamped with a health mark. There will also be regular inspections of knackeries.  Veterinary inspection fees will be introduced on slaughterings at local abattoirs at the same levels as those applicable at the export plants.  The revenue which will accrue to the local authorities from these fees is expected to be sufficient to cover staffing and other costs.  Application of these new controls will have to be deferred to allow time for the recruitment of full-time veterinary inspectors.  I would hope, however, that the Bill's provisions will be fully operational within six months of enactment.</P>
    <P>At present, full supervision of slaughterings, including the charging of inspection fees, is conducted by a very small minority of local authorities, notably in Dublin and Cork where all meat for human consumption carries a health mark.  It is not good enough that full <Col N="2671" /> slaughtering controls should be confined to a handful of areas.  As I mentioned earlier, this Bill will provide a national standard and one which can be readily identified by consumers.  It will provide an assurance to the Irish housewife that meat being sold on the home market has been prepared under hygienic conditions, is fresh, wholesome and in every way fit for human consumption.  In this way also it should provide a major fillip to the trade in its efforts to increase consumption of red meat.</P>
    <P>Section 2 contains definitions of the terms used in the Bill.  While poultry is excluded from the definition of animal I am satisfied that slaughterings at non-export poultry plants are adequately covered under the food hygiene regulations. Similarly, deer and rabbits are excluded from the definition, as commercial slaughterings of such species are, in the main, aimed at export markets and as such are already subject to controls. Should the situation arise where such species are slaughtered in significant numbers for the home market at our local abattoirs they can be brought within the scope of the Bill under subsection (3) of this section.  However, to cater for poultry slaughterings, leading up to Christmas time especially, and also for the occasional deer found in local abattoirs, provision is being made under section 39 (3) for such slaughterings to be subjected to veterinary examination. Requests were made on grounds of illegal slaughtering to have farmer slaughtering made subject to the Bill's provisions but I feel that &ldquo;abattoir&rdquo; as defined is sufficiently tight to prevent any abuses. Farmer slaughtering is both traditional and in casualty cases necessary in Irish farming.  Sufficient controls will exist through the proposed full time local authority veterinary inspectorate structure coupled with stamping of meat and trade vigilance to counter any abuse of this facility.  However, should abuse occur I can, by order under section 2 (3) (c), redefine abattoir to include farm slaughterings.</P>
    <P>The repeals referred to in section 3 <Col N="2672" /> have been divided into three parts to permit each part to be brought into operation at different times.  Part I of the First Schedule will come into effect in the first phase, i.e., licensing of premises by my Department; Part II will come into effect when the regulations for veterinary inspection are operational and Part III will be brought into effect when my colleague, the Minister for Health, makes an amendment to the food hygiene regulations to update those regulations in relation to the transport of food, including meat.</P>
    <P>Section 4 excludes licensed bacon and export meat plants from the Bill's provisions as they are already closely regulated by my Department.  Similarly, on the knackery front and as provided for in section 2 (1), the Bill will not apply to any premises where animal waste undergoes processing such as rendering plants, meat and bone meal plants, etc.  Such plants will be the subject of a separate set of processed animal protein controls which I will be making under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966.  These controls will, complement the knackery provisions under this Bill.  The Acts referred to in section 5 contain provisions in relation to markets, slaughterhouses and offensive trades generally including power by local authorities to make by-laws in relation to same.  As full repeal of these provisions would not be appropriate the application of certain sections of the Acts in question is restricted under this section.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 to 10 deal with abattoir licences and make it unlawful for a person to use any premises as an abattoir unless he holds a licence issued by my Department. A licence will be valid for 12 months from the date of issue.  An annual licence fee at the following rates will be payable: for abattoirs with annual slaughterings of fewer than 500 animals, £10; between 500-1,000 animals, £50 and in excess of 1,000 animals, £100.  I estimate that roughly speaking 40 per cent of premises will attract the £10 fee, 40 per cent the £50 fee and 20 per cent, the £100 fee.  Where a licence is refused the fee paid will be refunded.  The fees may be altered by way of regulations should the <Col N="2673" /> cost of licensing tend to outstrip the revenue received.  Section 11 sets down the conditions which must be satisfied before an abattoir licence will be granted or renewed.  I am also providing in this section that the licence may limit the class and number of animals which may be slaughtered and that a distinctive number or letter may be assigned to every licensed premises.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for the keeping of a central record of licences issued.  This central record will be useful for control and reference purposes and also in the event of a dispute or prosecution.  Equally, it is intended that premises operating under a permit as opposed to a licence, and as provided for in section 17, would be included in such record.  Section 13 provides that a licence will not be transferable but, on the death of a licence holder, the licence will continue in effect for the benefit of the personal representative of the deceased for two months or longer as circumstances may dictate.  Sections 14 and 15 set out the grounds for licence refusal or revocation including information to the applicant or licence holder on appeal procedures.  As the licensing authority, it would be wrong of me to sit in judgment in an appeal situation.  Accordingly, section 16 allows for appeals to the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>Arising from the 1982 survey of premises, which I mentioned earlier, it would seem likely that quite a number of premises will require modifications, in varying degree, to achieve the required standard. To meet this situation, I am providing, under section 17, for a permit system, somewhat like a provisional licence, for a transitional period of five years.  A permit will be issued for a specified duration and will be renewable, if necessary, to allow proprietors time to bring their premises up to standard.  It will have the same validity as a licence for all purposes, including fees under this Bill.  I propose to have the permit indicate the improvements required, be they structural or in relation to equipment or otherwise.  No permit will be granted for a premises which is quite clearly incapable of being brought up to standard.  Having regard <Col N="2674" /> to the increased number of inspections which will be necessary in the case of a premises operating under permit and in an effort to speed up the works required, it is proposed to charge the appropriate fee each time the permit is renewed.  This permit system will only apply to abattoirs currently in existence which are capable of being brought up to standard.</P>
    <P>From a public health point of view, section 18 is important.  It empowers an authorised officer, specifically authorised to do so under section 54 (2), to direct in writing the closure of any premises, or part thereof, or the cessation of slaughterings where there is grave and immediate danger to public health arising from either activities on the premises or the manner in which such slaughterings are being conducted.  Such power will be of a suspensory nature in that the written direction may specify what needs to be put right before the premises may be reopened or slaughterings may be resumed.  The section also provides for recourse to the District Court for persons who feel aggrieved by such action.</P>
    <P>All sanitary authorities have power derived from section 105 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act 1878 to provide public abattoirs.  At present the county boroughs of Galway and Limerick and the urban district councils of Ennis, Kilrush, Longford and Tralee own public abattoirs but only that at Galway is being operated by the county borough.  The rest are either leased or closed.  I am repealing existing powers on the provision of such abattoirs and, while I feel that in present circumstances there is unlikely to be any need for new public abattoirs, I consider it prudent to retain this option for any county council or county borough corporation who might wish to provide such a facility in the future subject, of course, to the licensing arrangements in this Bill. This is being done under section 19.  The control of operations within slaughtering premises will be set out by me in regulations to be made under section 20. These regulations will embrace such matters as lairaging and the times at which slaughter may take place, meat preparation and processing, the hygiene of <Col N="2675" /> staff, premises and equipment and the storage and disposal of animal wastes.  As to the times of slaughtering, these will be fixed by the local authorities in consultation with the local trade.  The primary consideration will be, however, that they must be at times which facilitate the veterinary inspection of all slaughtered animals.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill contains similar provisions in relation to knackeries.  Two sections in this Part of the Bill, however, warrant particular mention.  In view of the activities of a number of rogue operators on the meat supply scene, section 22 places an absolute prohibition on the sale for human consumption of any meat which has originated in a knackery.  From both the public health and animal health points of view, section 23 is important. Knackeries owe their existence to the very causes affecting the health of our national herd.  They operate on the periphery of our agricultural scene without adequate controls on their activities.  As I mentioned earlier, they perform a very necessary service to local farmers and butchers in collecting and disposing of dead animals and animal wastes.  For hunt and greyhound kennels involved in the business it is a very practical and economic undertaking.  The sad fact is, however, that some knackers are less than scrupulous in their activities and others just careless when it comes to animal health or environmental matters. This section will bring these premises under strict control.  It will enable me to make regulations controlling sales from these premises such as minced meat at greyhound tracks, supplies to cats' and dogs' homes, etc.  Advertising for dead or casualty animals will be regulated and the maintenance of specified records of animals handled in such premises will be obligatory.  I hope that in this way also we will be able to get a better picture of animal losses and the causes of these losses.</P>
    <P>Section 35 requires each local authority to employ sufficient veterinary inspectors, at least one of whom must be full <Col N="2676" /> time, to enforce the Bill's veterinary control provisions.  Apart from supervision of the domestic meat trade the local authority veterinary service has a range of other functions.  These include supervision of dairies and the liquid milk trade, organisation of the sheep dipping programme and attending to sheep scab outbreaks and other scheduled animal diseases.  As the Minister responsible for the local authority veterinary service I am only too well aware that, in the absence of a full time presence, attention to all such duties cannot but be less than satisfactory. As I mentioned earlier, veterinary control and inspection of meat and milk for the home market in over two thirds of the country is done solely on a part time basis.  The provisions of section 35 will redress this situation through the establishment of a corps of permanent official veterinarians throughout the country.  Subsection (4) of this section will allow any two local authorities, subject to my consent, to pool together for the purpose of making the full time veterinary appointments required.  This facility is being provided to cater for a small number of local authority areas where it makes more sense, either logistically or on financial grounds, to combine for the purpose of providing a full time veterinary service.</P>
    <P>Section 36 requires each local authority to provide for the allocation of a veterinary inspector to each abattoir at the designated slaughtering times and periodically at knackeries to enforce the Bill's provisions.  Administratively, it should make for far better management to have the local authority veterinary service functioning under the 32 major local authorities as opposed to the present situation where 87 sanitary authorities are involved.  Accordingly, sections 37 and 38 provide for the transfer of the existing veterinary staff and the functions and records relating thereto, from sanitary authorities to their corresponding county councils or county borough corporations. Section 39 allows me to make veterinary examination regulations towards establishing the fitness of meat for human consumption.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2677" /> This Bill will provide a guarantee that the meat leaving our abattoirs is in all respects fit for human consumption.  It is important, therefore, that consumers can readily recognise that the meat they are buying has undergone and passed veterinary inspection.  The application of a health mark to such meat will provide this assurance.  Equally important, having regard to meat wholesaling particularly, will be the control and tracing facility inherent in such marking.  The health marking arrangements are set out in sections 40 to 42.  Under section 40 I will be making regulations prescribing the type of mark, and how and by whom it is to be applied.  Section 41 details the conditions which must be complied with before a health mark may be applied to meat while section 42 will make it an offence to sell, supply or have possession of meat which does not bear an approved health mark.  Section 43 will allow the section 39 provisions on veterinary examination to apply in the case of meat undergoing inspection at meat export plants. This is particularly important in the context of new controls regarding antibiotic and hormonal residues in meat which if present will mean that such meat may not be passed as fit for human consumption here at home or in export markets.</P>
    <P>Sections 44 to 46 deal with the payment of veterinary inspection fees which will be payable on each animal slaughtered at the following rates per head: cattle £3.25, pigs £0.75 and sheep £0.55.  These fees are the same as those applicable in the export meat plants and will be payable by the licence holder to the local authority. Provision is also being made to allow for the fees to be altered, or to vary the classes of animals in respect of which the fees are payable, by way of regulations having prior Dáil and Seanad approval.</P>
    <P>The opportunity is being taken in this Bill to update a number of relevant provisions in other legislation as set out in Part VI.  The Slaughter of Animals Act, 1935, governs the humane treatment of animals being slaughtered and the licensing of slaughtermen.  It is operated by the sanitary authorities and its provisions are equally applicable to the meat export <Col N="2678" /> plants.  Section 47 amends this Act by providing for the transfer of its administration to the major local authorities in tandem with a similar transfer under this Bill.  It also provides for an increase to £500 in the fines under the Act which range from only £5 to £50 at present.  The meat export plants and the licensed bacon plants are regulated under the provision of the Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Acts 1930 to 1978, and the Pigs and Bacon Acts, 1935 to 1961, respectively. Amendments are being made to these Acts under sections 48 and 50 to bring the fees and fines into line with those proposed for abattoirs under this Bill. Section 49 amends the Milk and Dairies Acts, 1935 and 1956 by transferring responsibility for milk and dairies from sanitary authorities to the major local authorities in line with the transfer of responsibility for abattoirs.  Under the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Act, 1979, one of the levies payable is in respect of each bovine slaughtered in the State.  Section 51 amends the provisions in that Act relating to animals slaughtered at local abattoirs by providing that an abattoir will mean one licensed or permitted under this Bill.  Under section 52 a similar amendment is being made to the CBF Act, 1979.</P>
    <P>Section 53 provides for the appointment of authorised officers both from my Department and by the local authorities. I envisage that the officers to be appointed by me will, in the main, be veterinary inspectors drawn from the meat export plants whose involvement would be confined to the annual licensing of premises.  The authorised officers to be appointed by the local authorities would again, in the main, be their veterinary corps.  These officers will be concerned with slaughtering inspections, detection of unlicensed premises and overall implementation of the Bill's provisions in their particular area.  Section 54 confers powers of entry on and inspection of abattoirs and knackeries, or vehicles and containers used in connection therewith, and seizure of meat by authorised officers and by members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The existing penalties for failure to <Col N="2679" /> licence an abattoir or for violation of slaughtering by-laws are no more than £5 under the Towns Improvement Clauses Act, 1847.  This has given rise to situations whereby it was quite profitable for a slaughterer to continue in breach of the rules and face only this minimal penalty.  Section 56 increases the penalties considerably.  The new penalties will have maximum fines of £1,000 or six months imprisonment or both on summary conviction and £10,000 or three years imprisonment or both on indictment. The level of these penalties should present a real deterrent to any would-be offenders.  As public health is the primary consideration I make no excuses for raising them to those levels.  Should it be found necessary to do so at some future stage, I am also making provision to enable these fines to be increased by way of regulations which again would be subject to prior Dáil and Seanad approval. Sections 57 and 58 deal with prosecutions. Either a local authority or myself will be empowered to prosecute offences but I envisage that in most instances prosecutions will be brought by the local authority.</P>
    <P>Under section 59 licence holders will be required to keep records of animals slaughtered.  Section 60 will allow me to monitor the application of the Bill's provisions in each area through returns to be made by the local authorities.  These returns will be important also from a statistical point of view in that they will give an accurate picture of slaughterings for the home trade.  They will also help to identify, to a greater extent, diseases affecting stock and to indicate whether they are cyclical or localised disease outbreaks. Section 61 will enable me to make regulations prescribing the requirements in relation to the construction, lay-out, siting, water supply and equipment of abattoirs and knackeries.  It also provides that these requirements may be modified in relation to existing premises.  These standards will be reasonable and realistic and should be attainable by the majority of butchers.  The emphasis will be on hygiene which is a basic requirement in <Col N="2680" /> any food premises.  Local authority by-laws relating to abattoirs and knackeries and the inspection of meat will no longer be necessary as regulations to be made under this Bill will lay down the standards to be observed.  Section 62, therefore, has the effect of cancelling any such by-laws once the corresponding provisions of the Bill come into operation.  Similarly, any by-laws relating to meat transport will be superseded by amended food hygiene regulations in relation to the transport of food.</P>
    <P>Section 66 provides that all licence fees received by me will be paid into the Exchequer.  Such fees are expected to amount to some £40,000 annually and should be sufficient to cover the cost of licensing.  As I mentioned earlier, the veterinary inspection fees will accrue to the local authorities.  These are estimated to yield some £1.4 million annually and will be used by the local authorities to fund the employment of the staff necessary to implement the Bill's provisions. As regulations to be made under this Bill will, in the future, set out the standards to be met in abattoirs and knackeries, section 67 excludes the provisions of the food hygiene regulations from applying to such premises.  The food hygiene regulations will, however, continue to apply to the transport and retail sides of the meat trade.</P>
    <P>These are the salient features of the Bill which I commend to the House and in so doing I would like to thank my predecessor in office and all the bodies who have contributed to its preparation.</P>
    <P>The House will recognise, too, that while this legislation deals essentially with meat being prepared for the home market, it is in line with that we have been endeavouring to convey at every level &mdash; that in a country where this essential element of our primary product, be it meat, dairy, or whatever, is of such vital importance to our economy in terms of home consumption and export consumption, it is essential that in every respect nothing but the highest standards will be accepted.  We want this country to be known in every respect as a country where the food we produce will meet the <Col N="2681" /> highest standards anywhere in the world. I also want to put it on record that, while a lot of this legislation deals with regulations and control, which will obviously be implemented by my Department and by those responsible, the best guarantee we will have that we have reached those standards is an awareness by the people themselves.  Anything less than the best is unacceptable.  I am very confident that this House, in which I am privileged to introduce this Bill, and the people generally will take the same view.  We have reached the point now where success will be guaranteed not just by a regulation from Government or the Civil Service but by the people themselves demanding nothing but the best.  I am please to introduce this Bill in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is thoroughly praiseworthy legislation which is long overdue and my party welcome it.  Most of the preparatory work was carried out by the previous Government.  It is strange that in a country a large part of whose economy is devoted to the food sector we have had very little legislation dealing with food hygiene at abattoirs.  We have had, as the Minister stated, the Slaughter of Animals Act, 1935, which dealt mainly with the conduct in relation to the actual slaughter of the animal in the slaughterhouse and had little to say about hygiene in the premises where the slaughtering was carried out.  We have adopted over the years other legislation in the food hygiene area.  We have also adopted certain hygiene regulations imposed upon us by the EC.  But, all in all, they made up a rather disjointed programme of supervision at abattoirs.  For that reason, if I may repeat it again, the changes proposed in this Bill are welcomed by my party.  They are praiseworthy in most respects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, television publicity has been given to illicit slaughtering of animals along the Border.  These slaughterings were carried out in conditions where no health regulations applied.  It was also alleged that the meat coming from these operations was sold very often in the shops or reputable meat businesses or <Col N="2682" /> was sold door to door in our cities, particularly to low income families.  While we do not know how many of these allegations are true, obviously quite a number of them are.  The fact that some of them are true makes it all the more obligatory and all the more urgent that this legislation is passed urgently.</P>
    <P>It is particularly welcome that following the enactment of this law all animal carcases destined for the domestic meat market will carry a health stamp. That is one of the major changes that will take place.  This, should eliminate for once and for all the possibility of meat from shady sources being sold in the shops of reputable butchers, or being sold door to door.  I hope also that it will eliminate the possibility of meat from TB reactor animals coming onto the domestic market.</P>
    <P>We are told that meat from TB reactor animals &mdash; I mean no lesion animals &mdash; is perfectly safe for human consumption, but many people object to its use as prime red meat.  If the consumer and the farmers object &mdash; I share their objection on aesthetic grounds &mdash; they have good reason to do so because the price given for a reactor animal is substantially less than the price given for a healthy one. There has been a suspicion for a long time that there is profiteering in this sector of the trade and that the meat of non-lesion but reactor animals finds its way onto the counters of reputable meat businesses and is sold to consumers as prime meat and fetching the price of prime meat.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the point in a general kind of way about veterinary fees and the licensing fee for each abattoir. Two things are involved here, first that each abattoir has to have a licence varying from £10 to £100 depending on its throughput and that a veterinary fee will have to be paid in respect of each animal slaughtered.  This is very much in line with the practice carried on at our export meat plants.  The Minister stated that the yield from veterinary fees will come to something like £1.4 million in the current year and that this should be sufficient to finance the operations of the new inspectorate and all the new activities which are <Col N="2683" /> aimed to come into force under this Bill. I disagree with this; £600,000 of the £1.4 million is earmarked to pay the salaries of possibly 26 to 30 new veterinary inspectors.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that each county council, and there are 27, and each county borough council of which there are five, in some instances or in some special cases a combination of two &mdash; this will only happen in relatively few cases &mdash; will appoint a full time veterinary inspector to oversee and implement the new controls. Allowing that £600,000 of a total of £1.4 million is spent on the salaries of the inspectors, £800,000, 80 per cent of £1 million is left to pay for all the other controls and staffing that will come into force under the Bill.</P>
    <P>At present throughout the country there are about 160 part time veterinary officers enforcing the local authority by-laws in relation to the inspection of abattoirs. It is obvious that every one of them will be re-employed under the provisions of this Bill.  I submit that we need many more veterinarians to carry out adequately all the new duties laid down. There is simply no way that the amount of money put aside &mdash; £0.6 of £1 million &mdash; can fund these activites.  At present in the <i>ad hoc</i> way in which the veterinary surgeons carry out the controls under the by-laws laid down by the local authorities it is costing £400,000 and it is impossible for an additional £200,000 to fund the additional activities.  It is essential that there be ante and and post mortem inspections of animals.  At present animals before they are slaughtered must be seen by a veterinarian who must be satisfied that no animal shows any signs of disease, stress or distress.  The veterinarian may also be present at the slaughter of the animal but at the post mortem stage he will have to carry out a detailed examination of the carcase to determine that the animal is fully fit to be turned out to the retail trade and sold to the consumer.  The health mark must be applied at that stage.</P>
    <P>The amount of time under the new arrangements will increase at least six or <Col N="2684" /> sevenfold as opposed to the amount of time veterinarians had to devote to their duties under the old regulations.  It is quite obvious that additional money will have to be found but our party object to it coming from the fees charged to farmers.</P>
    <P>In the case of a bovine animal supplied to a butcher's abbatoir, an obligatory fee of £3.25 will be collected, as has been the case in the export meat plants for a number of years.  We object to the fact that under section 44 of the Bill the Minister may vary these fees from time to time as necessary.  We say he may only vary these fees in line with changes in the consumer price index or in the rate of inflation.  We object to him changing these regulations to pay for the greatly increased cost of carrying out these new controls which have not been properly researched.  The amount of money mentioned in the explanatory memorandum to pay for these new controls is totally inadequate.  In addition to the costs and what has to be found in total out of the amount of money from the fees, each veterinary inspector will be entitled to employ sufficient back-up staff, secretarial, etc., to service his activities which must all be found from the sum of £800,000.</P>
    <P>The people most affected in a direct way by this Bill are the ordinary high street butchers.  The Irish Master Butchers' Association inform me that there are about 850 private abattoirs throughout the country, most of which are attached to the ordinary high street butcher's shop, usually part of the family enterprise.  People in the trade are extremely worried because it is not stated &mdash; this being purely an enabling Bill &mdash; what will constitute an abattoir when all the regulations are made under this Bill. The people in the trade are anxious to know and justifiably wonder why the physical proportions or dimensions of an abattoir are not stated.  They wonder why it is not stated specifically now what equipment will have to be installed in an abattoir.  They wonder why it is not stated where these abattoirs must be located. <Col N="2685" /> Will many of them be found in their existing locations to be unsuitable and, consequently, have to be closed?</P>
    <P>I am calling on the Minister to intimate to the House, to the trade and the country exactly how his Department are thinking in relation to the points I raised.  There are thousands of people, perhaps, involved in the domestic meat trade who are very worried about their future.  One sees all these things while fully approving of what the Bill sets out to do to improve the standards, but we must be cognisant of people's livelihood and we must not impose upon the people in the trade, requirements which they cannot economically bear.</P>
    <P>If we do that, the Minister will have to give some financial inducement to these people to cushion them against these changes.  I realise we are living in times of great financial stringency and that a lot of grant-aid for housing, etc., has been abolished recently, but this is a major change, a major adjustment for many people in the trade and some financial inducement &mdash; I will not say whether it should be a grant or some kind of interest subsidy &mdash; should be given to people who can be very adversely affected in an economic and financial way by these measures. Alternately, the Department should be looking into the area of encouraging the establishment of central abattoirs for regions.  That can be brought into operation by offering financial inducements or encouragement.  At present the only meat plants that qualify for grant aid from the IDA, or any other source, are the very major ones involved in the export trade.  In County Roscommon, in the town of Ballaghadereen, there is a meat plant which has been established for generations.  The owner wishes to modernise the plant and service the local meat trade, i.e., slaughtering animals for local butchers located over a wide area but despite the proposed expenditure of £750,000 to £1 million, the proprietor cannot qualify for one penny of grant-aid or any other financial inducement to carry out work that is very necessary and very worthy.  I ask the Minister to look at those two aspects &mdash; how <Col N="2686" /> we can cushion the people who will be adversely affected, the ordinary small butcher, and encourage private central abattoirs to service the meat trade.</P>
    <P>If I may go back to the amount of money provided for financing this Bill, and the fact that under section 67 we find that Part V of the Health Act of 1947, as amended, and the Food Hygiene Regulations of 1950, as amended, shall not apply to premises licensed under this Act, unless there is a substantial increase in the amount of money allocated to veterinary inspection, there is simply no way we could have adequate inspections carried out, I find it regrettable that the services of the environmental health inspectors have been eliminated under this Bill. These officers had a role in the supervision of hygiene at slaughterhouses and abattoirs.  Their continued role would be to ensure that there is comprehensive supervision in this area and at no additional cost to the State.  The environmental health officers are very happy to carry on this work.  They feel they are competent in the areas of water supply, chilling and so on, and because their special training can be superior to the veterinarians.  Again, I ask the Minister to reconsider section 67 which eliminates the role of the environmental health inspectors.</P>
    <P>In 1986 £5.3 million in veterinary fees was collected in meat export plants but that was 80 per cent less then what was needed to pay for the veterinary controls and the veterinary inspections at our meat plants.  The Minister did not advert to that in his opening speech, but it is a fact.  That means about 25 per cent of the costs of full veterinary supervision at our export meat plants had to be met by the Exchequer.  That applied to meat plants where there was a large throughput at a very rapid rate with ultimate economies of scale, but to kill an animal in an export meat plant costs the same as in a private abattoir.  Therefore, the money collected by way of veterinary fees at our meat plants was adequate to finance this service. In the small private abattoirs situated throughout the country, there can to no such economy of scale, although <Col N="2687" /> the economic cost of supervising each animal will be much greater than in an export meat plant.  For that good reason and to keep costs down I again plead for the inclusion of the environmental health officers as part of the supervision service because they will be sharing the workload with the veterinary inspectors.</P>
    <P>I know it is not part of this Bill, but I will refer to it in passing because I have been consulted by a number of people about the ritual slaughtering of animals in our meat plants.  This has become a very widespread practice in recent years. We now sell a very high proportion of our beef to Islamic countries and a significant proportion of our beef to Israel.  We have ritual slaughterings under the Islamic rite and the Kosher rite.  Many people make the point that there is something cruel about this form of slaughtering.  As we know, all animals are first rendered unconscious or stunned before evisceration, but when these ritual slaughterings are carried out &mdash; which are a necessary requisite if we are to sell our meat to these countries &mdash; no such stunning or rendering the animal unconscious takes place.  I ask the Minister to look into the possibility of having ritual slaughterings carried out after the animal has been stunned or rendered unconscious.  I am fully aware of the economic consequences of our export trade to these countries, which now amounts to millions of pounds.  Among the EC countries, Ireland is one of the largest users of the export funds which allow us to collect an export rebate, or export compensation, for exporting meat to third countries. This is naturally a great economic boom and boost to this country.  Nevertheless, because these points have been made by quite a number of interests, I feel I should make them in the House and I am fully conscious of all the difficulties involved. That is all I want to say at this stage.  We will be teasing it out in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Let me say again to the House that my party welcome this long overdue Bill. Nevertheless, we have raised some queries in relation to the costing of it and who <Col N="2688" /> is to pay.  We reject the proposal that farmers should be sent the bill for the additional costing.  We also raised the question as to the implications for small sized family butchers, in particular.  We do not want to see any of these driven out of business, although there are many instances of inadequate standards and so on.  I welcome the five year transition period.  The Minister has made the point also that the sales of red meat are stagnant or are falling and that holds an implication for the people in the trade.  The result is that many people in the trade would not be able to withstand a new set of regulations that would create for them new overhead costs that they would not under any circumstances be able to bear. We plead with the Minister, when making his regulations under this Bill, to be very careful and very cognisant of these facts.</P>
    <P>I would also plead with him that in his winding up speech he tells us a little more in relation to the physical size of abattoirs and the kind of equipment that will be expected to be there.  Will all of them need chilling equipment?  We would like to know the kind of waste disposal and, above all, the locations.  It would not be too much, because of all the people who are affected by this legislation, to ask the Minister to be forthcoming on these questions before the Bill is fully enacted. If the first we know about them is when the orders under these regulations are laid before the House, we will have very little influence over them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Minister for his generosity in accepting the fact that his predecessor <Col N="2689" /> and other bodies contributed to the preparation of this Bill.  As a member of the Animal Health Council I was privileged to have worked with some of the interdepartmental groups who helped to prepare the Bill.  I appreciate the fact that the Minister was aware that outside bodies had an input into this legislation but I left all my notes on that procedure outside this Chamber because my duty today is as a legislator.</P>
    <P>Of the people who have consulted with us since the Bill has been published, I was particularly pleased at the response of the Irish Domestic Meat Traders' Association, an association who represents the 1,000 or so small butchers throughout Ireland.  I have had lengthy discussions about this legislation with one of their vice-presidents over the last number of days.  I welcome the spirit in which they have approached the legislation and have accepted the need for it. They appreciate how the Minister and his Department, and indeed the local authorities, will go about the preservation of the food that comes through abattoirs and the table for human consumption.</P>
    <P>There has been a feeling for some time that something needed to be done in this area.  The small butchers are more aware of the concern of the consumer than many of us would have thought.  It is obvious from their representations to me that they welcome this legislation, first in that it will reassure the public of the concern of small butchers about presenting in a hygienic way meat which will be free of disease and which will be a wholesome food, whether fresh, prepared or chilled meat, slaughtered properly and presented and sold properly.  The Minister will agree that the number of animals which are still diseased despite our eradication schemes is very high.</P>
    <P>We are unable to export or are precluded from exporting these animals which have been shown to be diseased, but it is obvious, once the diseased part is removed from the carcases, that the remainder is considered to be edible. There is always a worry in the consumers' minds of where this meat is going to or coming from.  It is obvious that it is not <Col N="2690" /> coming from the small butchers because most of our small butchers are responsible for the purchase of their own animals or for the rearing and killing of those animals they offer for sale subsequently as meat.  The customer must be reassured that that process is now subject to scrutiny by the Department and to regulations. In the past, it was unlikely that animals suffering from either tuberculosis or brucellosis would have come into the hands of the consumer through the small butchers.  These have in the past, as is known, kept full records and have refunded to the Department the disease levies, although they have been unable at the source of purchase to reduce the cost of the animal by the levy, unlike large factories, in particular, which have a facility under which, when the animals are brought in, the customer is immediately docked the necessary levies under the two disease eradication schemes and under other schemes.  There is a whole range of levies.  Senator Connor has referred to these.</P>
    <P>The small butcher had been unable in the past to recoup himself for what was then his responsibility, the surrender of these levies.  I hope that this Bill will tidy up that procedure.  I will talk, on the various sections, briefly on the suggestion the butchers have made about the transmission of these fees which they will keep from the owners of the animals in future. In the past, larger factories had, of course, been grant assisted and grant aided by IDA and other agencies of Government to help them to achieve standards which were required for export purposes.  They also benefited from these grants in the production of meat to larger supermarkets and to other outlets.  There was a tremendous advantage to factories <i>vis-á-vis</i> butchers, in terms of numbers and of the grant assistance.</P>
    <P>There was concern being expressed initially that somehow this legislation was going to close down every small butcher in the country.  They have made submissions welcoming the legislation, but they want points of clarification in the course of the legislation going through the Seanad.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2691" /> I would also like to put on the record that although the country has achieved disease free status on brucellosis there are still outbreaks of the disease throughout the country.  Recently I had occasion to make representations to the Department about the payment of depopulation grants because of brucellosis, a disease that everybody presumed had been totally eliminated but there are still the isolated groups of brucellosis infected herds in the country.  Of course, it would be a concern that animals from that source might get on to the chain for delivery to the consumer.  It is necessary that we would have proper veterinary control and inspection to ensure that they do not.  The same, of course, applies to tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is a disease to which animals react under a test.  They may not necessarily have lesions confirmed in the factory. But we must not disregard the fact that almost two million people in the world will die this year from TB.</P>
    <P>During the last century Mr. Koch isolated the bacilli of brucelli and much work has been done in the meantime particularly in relation to a cure for humans. Unfortunately the same cure is not forthcoming in animals and they are subjected to compulsory slaughtering.  We have to ensure that the meat of slaughtered animals is inspected so that consumers can be assured that there is no risk from contamination by bacilli.  In this regard I was pleased to see that there is a section in the Bill which controls the private slaughtering of animals by farmers for consumption by their families.  I am worried that due to looseness in the section there might not be proper control of the disposal of that slaughtered livestock.  The farmer might give some of it to his neighbours not for money but as part of an old custom whereby people killed their pigs, filled the puddings and distributed the griskins.  Some Members of this House will remember those days.  It was a laudable thing to do at that time but with the possibility of infection of salmonella <Col N="2692" /> nowadays it is important that some control is effected on animals that are killed privately.</P>
    <P>The six Acts being amended are listed on page three of the Bill.  I would have preferred if this legislation had consolidated the Acts because one has now to refer back to some of the Acts because although they have been amended they will still be in operation.  It would have been a cleaner job if the Acts were consolidated into one Act.  It might have been legislatively difficult to do this.  No doubt the Minister will respond to that small criticism of amending acts instead of consolidating them.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill gives a description of &ldquo;animal&rdquo;.  The Minister outlined the other animals which are outside the definition of &ldquo;animal.&rdquo;  Cattle are defined as bovine, sheep as bovine, pigs as porcine and horses as equine.  These descriptions will not include deer, rabbits and other wildlife which are now being disposed of in butchers' shops because there is a demand for them.  Will these animals be dealt with under other fresh meat Acts or did the Minister decide not to describe other animals which are being killed and disposed of for human consumption but which are not specifically included in the definition of &ldquo;animal&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>In the same section the word &ldquo;offal&rdquo; is described as &ldquo;all parts of a slaughtered animal, other than the carcase&rdquo;.  The definition of &ldquo;viscera&rdquo; is &ldquo;offal from the thoracic, abdominal and pelvic cavities (including the trachea and oesophagus)&rdquo;. This might sound like very technical jargon to the consumer but we would want to be able to convince them that somehow we are not producing haggis, which is a Scottish delicacy, and that the kidneys, the pancreas and the sweetbreads, which are part of the carcase, can be removed and sold separately, as there is a demand for them.  We need to explain to people what we mean when we talk in veterinary terms about the &ldquo;viscera&rdquo; or &ldquo;offal&rdquo; of an &ldquo;animal&rdquo; because many of these are taken out and not used for human consumption.  Of course, the kidneys and the pancreas are; they are a delicacy and there is a demand for them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2693" /> A question was asked in relation to the Pig and Bacon Acts, 1935 to 1961 and whether premises licensed under the Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Acts were excluded.  The Minister answered my query when he said that these premises are already governed and do not necessarily need to be included in this legislation.  Section 5 relates to the non-application of certain provisions to abattoirs and knackeries and the Minister mentioned places in Counties Clare, Cork and elsewhere.  Does this section exclude all public abattoirs because in spite of what has been said by Senator Connor, there are reservations in the trade about how public abattoirs have functioned and how successful they have been in achieving the standards of hygiene we as legislators want and to which consumers are entitled to under the food hygiene Acts.  The state of public abattoirs depends on how butchers leave them for the next customer using them.  The experience of public abattoirs in rural areas has not been a good one.  I would prefer to see an abattoir that is subject to regulation being under the jurisdiction of a butcher so that he could ensure that proper standards are maintained. Because he is subject to inspection by the Department or the local authority there is an incentive to keep his abattoir up to the required standard, whereas if it is a public abattoir the same incentive may not be there.  None of us would condone the situation which has arisen in certain areas.  I hope this Bill will help to regulate existing public abattoirs and bring them into line and also ensure that the existing killing facilities of small butchers come up to the required standard.</P>
    <P>Section 10 (6) says: &ldquo;The Minister may, by regulations vary the amount of the appropriate fee&rdquo; This was commented on by Senator Connor.  The Minister said that any regulations to increase fees would be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval by way of an order so that we would have an opportunity to debate the pros and cons of any increases he might want to make. In that section there is no reference to <Col N="2694" /> the fact that the Minister would return to the House of the Oireachtas for our approval.  I hope I am wrong in believing that it is not included and that there is some other subsection which requires the Minister to do that.  I take it that the Slaughter of Animals Act, 1935, will still be in operation although it is being amended by this Bill.</P>
    <P>A point raised by Senator Connor and which has been raised with me is that guidelines will have to be set down in relation to the standards of slaughtering facilities in butchers' shops.  The amount of carcase that is allowed per square foot of premises and the minimum requirements to be met will have to be standardised. There will have to be consultation also with the people concerned to allow them the facilities to achieve that standard. These will have to be uniform throughout the country; otherwise there will be discrimination against some people who at present have a very high standard but which may not be as high as that set down in the Bill.  It will be obligatory on the Minister to set down guidelines which we can debate at local authority level where I presume, these will also have to be approved under the Planning Act, if we require people to extend their premises.  Also the actual location of some of their premises will have to be approved.  At present some butchers do not have facilities on the high street for preparing animals for slaughter and after slaughter for storage, so that, there is often miles between the slaughtering location and the location of sale.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about butchers transporting animals from their private abattoirs for long distances to the counter where the products are sold.  People often worry, especially in warm weather about the transportation of animals ready to cut up for human consumption.  Where possible facilities should be available as close as possible to the selling location so that there will be less likelihood of disease or contamination of food in the transportation between the slaughter house and sale counter.</P>
    <P>When we talk about EC regulations, Ireland can be proud of the standards it <Col N="2695" /> has already achieved in this area.  Our standards are much higher than the standards that have been achieved in other parts of the Community.  People are aware that on the Continent beef, deer and lambs are transported in public view in open vehicles directly into butcher's shops.  I hope the EC tidy up their act in this area, because people in the Community are entitled to expect uniform standards to apply.  Many of the standards we have already set are an example to some of our colleagues in the Community.</P>
    <P>The process of an appeal by a butcher or a factory against the Minister's refusal to grant a licence is set down in section 16.  If there is a refusal to grant a licence or a revocation of an existing licence, a person can appeal to the Circuit Court. That is the worst way to set about this. There will have to be regulations setting out the minimum requirements.  Small family butchers will want to comply with those regulations but they will also want to ensure that they do not have to deal with an unreasonable inspectorate.  That sometimes unfortunately happens even in a democracy.  People imbued with enthusiasm for new legislation could make it almost impossible for somebody to comply with the commas and dots in all legislation.  I hope it will be unnecessary for somebody to go into court to appeal under this legislation.  Under common law, a person is entitled to have recourse to the courts in any case, but I hope the Minister and his officials can set up a procedure of appeal outside of court procedure.  The Minister might not think it appropriate for him to be involved in the appeal procedure but the trade and the Department should set up an appeals procedure at which consultation could take place, similar to what takes place in any planning application or appeal before it goes into court, and during which people could make their views known and try to achieve a consensus.  The Minister should look at that possible area of appeal in this section and take it outside of the Circuit Court where it may have to be dealt with finally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2696" /> The question of public health inspectors was raised by Senator Connor.  Public health inspectors have given a very useful service in the whole area of hygiene related to food being delivered to the consumer.  In section 18 of the Bill it is not clear whether an authorised officer is to be a veterinarian, or a public health inspector working towards a veterinarian. I also have reservations about counties not being in a position to employ a veterinary surgeon of their own, because of the question of inspection times for killing.  If we were to depend in a county on one veterinary surgeon to be available to all the butchers at the time of killing, obviously this legislation would be inoperable.  The veterinary profession would be unable to meet the demand. Will the Minister specify who an authorised officer is, so that butchers will not be inhibited from killing animals at the normal killing times?</P>
    <P>There is general debate among the professionals, from a public health view point, about when meat, particularly minced meat, is edible and how long it should be left hanging.  Minced meat has to have a certain time for hanging and be bled for long enough to be appropriately put through a mincer.  A mincer generates a certain amount of heat which along with a certain ripening of the meat immediately starts off a process of increasing bacteria.  By the time it goes on sale, if it is stored for two days by the housewife, it is then questionable.  In the whole area of public health guidelines, who will decide if the meat is ready for mincing, in particular, because in that area the meat goes through a heat process with the cutting blades.  It is only a minor question but it is one which might lead to a person's licence being revoked if some inspector felt that the meat had reached a certain degree of ripening after which mincing would be a health hazard.  Revocation of a licence is expensive; it costs £1,000 and then there is the appeals process. Out of concern for the consumer but just because somebody did not have guidelines, a small butcher could be put out of business.  That is a possibility unless we define the standards and the research <Col N="2697" /> facilities that will be available to people. If the butcher says that a joint is edible and the inspector says that it is not is there some other resource, like a research station, available to butchers so that other independent, arbitrary views can be taken on the quality of meat?  This whole area has been the subject of quite a lot of debate and discussion amongst experts.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the times specified for slaughterings.  I take it that these times are the normal times of slaughtering and that there will be dialogue between the local authority and the butchers about the killing date, to allow the inspector to be present.  Section 20(c) refers to slaughtering times.  I want an assurance that these times will be arranged by consultation and by agreement. One may have a nine to five inspector, but one certainly may not have a nine to five butcher.  Some butchers will want to kill on a Saturday but a veterinary surgeon may not want to work on a Saturday. Any such problem could arise depending on the demand at butcher level for an additional killing date to comply with the demand that might occur in a particular area.</P>
    <P>I hope there will be consultation because I know butchers who kill in the evening time.  They are busy all day in the shop and want to kill in the evening time.  They require and request veterinary inspection at that time but, because it is outside the normal veterinary surgeon's office hours of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. they would not be allowed to kill.  They have not got access to the veterinary inspection which they require.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a further section of the Bill which deals with the marking of meat on which the Minister laid quite a lot of emphasis &mdash; the health mark which will be applied to carcases.  The Minister has not yet spelled out in the legislation who will apply the mark, how the mark will be applied, where it will be applied and what substance will be used for the mark itself.  I mention this because there are also penalities for selling meat which does not have the mark applied.  A mark can be applied to the whole carcase. <Col N="2698" /> Individual steaks cannot be dye stamped with the dye which is being used at the moment because they would be ruined. It is a blue inedible dye which stains the meat and because of its marking qualities it remains on.</P>
    <P>When and on what part of the animal will the carcase mark be put and who will apply it?  The Minister will make regulations about this.  When can the dye actually be removed from the meat?  Many butchers would be unable to sell a piece of meat with a blue dye stamp because the consumer might presume something had gone wrong with the meat.  I am not sure what amount of meat will still require to be marked.  Inspectors call in to inspect it, not at the killing process but at the selling process.  Somebody might arrive and find a piece of meat with no mark on it although the carcase may have had a mark.  Perhaps the Minister might say if the butcher will be allowed to remove it when cutting up the meat for distribution to the customer.  I do not want people to suddenly find themselves guilty of an offence under section 40 (2) (d).  If the dye stamp is forged that is different.  We can understand that some people will make an effort to forge anything nowadays and I have no objection to fines if that happens.  If in the actual cutting up process a mark is removed we would need to have clarification so that there would be no doubt in anybody's mind that the mark was there legitimately, and when it could be removed for the purpose of sale.  I hope it will never be done with the intention to deceive.</P>
    <P>Section 42 (3) (b) deals with the slaughtering of animals for consumption by the residents on a farm.  The wording is a little loose.  We must make sure that meat killed in this way for human consumption is also subject to inspection in the interests of public health.  We must ensure also that if a person gives away the meat or sells it, there will be some control.  The paragraph refers to &ldquo;meat from an animal slaughtered in a place situate on a farm which is used for the occasional slaughter of animals kept on such farm and which meat is intended for consumption only by the residents on <Col N="2699" /> such farm.&rdquo;  Section 42 (3) (c) refers to &ldquo;meat which the person in whose possession it was found can establish was acquired by him in good faith and he did not know that it required to be marked with a health mark.&rdquo;  That could happen between neighbours.  We need to be very careful.</P>
    <P>I queried the provisions in section 43 which request control over whether meat was fit for human consumption.  Will the final decision be made by the veterinary inspector, or will the facilities of the research stations be available.  Perhaps the Minister might address his attention to section 43 (i) in his reply as well.  The table in section 44 (2) of the Bill lays down figures per head of cattle, sheep or pigs as a levy or a fee.  What is the acceptable age at which calves become cattle?  Are they cattle at six months or at 12 months?  I want to protect the butcher who carries out a limited amount of slaughtering of animals for veal which could be milk fed calves and not considered to be cattle because they have not been subjected to TB tests, or recording, or ear tagging.  Quite a few butchers kill a lot of calves.  Are they subjected to this levy as well?  The question of the collection of fees has been raised and I will deal with it briefly.</P>
    <P>Section 45 (3) of the Bill which deals with the payment of fees states that:</P>
    <P>The holder of the licence in respect of the abattoir concerned shall, within the period of 28 days after the last day of a month, send to the local authority the total amount of the fees that became payable during that month.</P>
    <P>Anybody who collects money from anybody at any level will realise that the vast majority of people will either forget or be unable to comply with that date line. I am a great believer in collecting money from people who owe it.  That is the problem in this country.  Many people do not collect money that is owed to the State. We finish up by having to cut back on the services.  I agree that the fee should be collected and there is a satisfactory system in operation at present whereby <Col N="2700" /> fees are collected once a month by the local TB office in the area.  I suggest that we use the same system for collecting fees rather than leaving it to the butcher to send the fee to the county council within 28 days.  He may forget it, or be away on holidays, or be doing something else.  I am worried about that number of days because, if that happens, the person is guilty of an offence and has to go through the whole process of fines and so on. Every butcher will want to pay this fee and it will be in his own interest to pay it.  I suggest that the present system of collection is the one that should be used.</P>
    <P>Section 48 refers to a fairly high fee of £500.  Under the Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Act, 1930, that £500 is required, apart from the licensing fees mentioned elsewhere.  Is that because these groups of people are required to achieve a higher standard for export purposes than is required for home consumption? That figure appears high.  I wonder why £500 is required under that Act as other levels of fees were required under a different Act.</P>
    <P>In section 59 butchers are required to keep records.  Under the disease eradication programme.  I agree that butchers should have complete records of where they buy the animal, who is the owner of the animal and the tag number of the animal.  The blue card should be surrendered to the Department or the local district veterinary officer which proves that the animal has finished its day, so to speak, and that the records are kept. Perhaps the Minister would outline what records are now required to be kept. Apart from other requirements the Minister might include, does he require records in connection with the TB scheme?  If so, that is very welcome.  I hope that the local authority regulations will be uniform throughout the country in regard to requirements.  Otherwise, different counties will be treated differently under the legislation.  That point was made also by Senator Connor.  We want that clarified.  People will want to know if uniform regulations apply to every butcher in Ireland, collecting the same fees, paying the same licence fees, <Col N="2701" /> collecting the same disease levies etc.  I want to make sure that all butchers will be treated in the same way under this Bill.</P>
    <P>In fairness to Senator Hussey who is waiting to speak, I will leave further comment until we are dealing with the sections in detail on Committee Stage.  I welcome the Bill.  It will be good for the trade and for butchers who already achieve a very high standard.  It will be reassuring for the consumer to know that the Government and local authorities are taking an interest in the presentation of meat and meat products, that high standards apply because of investigation at killing and sale points.  Though we in south Tipperary implement the existing by-laws which cover the sanitary operation of slaughterhouses and ensure that cruelty to animals does not take place, we welcome the Bill which gives legislative teeth to what we have been trying to do in this area.  At the end of the day. when this House has passed the Bill, I hope we will have proved to people in the export business and to consumers of our meat exports, whom we are trying to convince, that we produce the cleanest and best meat products in the world.  We must reassure all those concerned that the standards we achieve in the actual processing of that meat &mdash; at killing, at counter level and in exporting &mdash; cannot be surpassed.  If we achieve that kind of standard for our food products, especially meat, it will have been a worthwhile day for the country as a whole.  We will have unproved our status and our image abroad, and we will have convinced our home consumer that there are people who are concerned about the standards which apply to food.  Because of the welcome the Bill has received from those in the butcher trade particularly, I am confident that butchers are only too willing to try to achieve standards which they had been trying to set over a number of years in consultation with the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the House recommended this morning that we confine our speeches to about seven minutes <Col N="2702" /> on a certain motion, and so give an opportunity to other Members to contribute to the debate.  Certainly, on this Bill I will more or less comply with his suggestion because I understand there is a number of people who wish to contribute and also because, at the end of a session, nobody is interested in long speeches.</P>
      <P>Anybody who viewed the recent television programme which highlighted the activities of certain operators in the meat business will be delighted with this legislation because it will curtail their illegal activities.  Everybody purchasing meat will be delighted with that.  This comprehensive measure we are discussing here today will establish an up-to-date framework of control and supervision of meat plants catering for the domestic markets.  Of course there will be points of contention in relation to this Bill but I am satisfied that those can be teased out on Committee Stage.  I understand there has been consultation between officials of the Department of Agriculture, the meat trade, local authorities and the professional bodies and that there has been a fair measure of agreement between them on the necessity for this legislation.</P>
      <P>This Bill is long overdue and I welcome it.  Meat, particularly meat destined for the home market, has been under attack in recent years.  By reason of what is being said by vegetarian lobbies, of veterinary scaremongering and of what is reported in the media, consumers are confused and are being led to believe that the consumption of meat is unhealthy.  This could not be further from the truth.  Meat, especially red meat, is the genesis of a balanced diet which is very relevant to today's lifestyle.  It is important, therefore, to re-establish and consolidate in consumers' minds the intangible value of meat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total banning of the use of hormones for growth promotion since 1 January last and the restrictions on the use of antibiotics for therapeutic purposes will help to counteract the bad image of meat that was being portrayed.  This Bill, I am glad to say, will provide the further assurance that the meat we buy at home has been processed under strict hygenic <Col N="2703" /> conditions and is of a quality second to none.</P>
    <P>Part of the problem on the home meat market has been the lack of a uniform system of controls on the slaughtering of animals and preparation of meat.  Up to now it was left to individual sanitary authorities to adopt their own system of controls on the slaughtering of animals and preparation of meat.  They adopted their own by-laws on the licensing of abattoirs and on meat inspection.  Some sanitary authorities did so as far back as the last century, others have only done so recently, and still others have not done so at all.  Their enforcement of the by-laws has been found wanting on occasion, owing to the predominant system of part time employment of veterinarians by the sanitary authorities.</P>
    <P>The growth of meat wholesaling has also brought its own problems into this area.  Frequently, animals are slaughtered in one part of the country and their meat ends up in a city or towns miles away.  How can the official responsible for meat inspection at the point of sale be expected to satisfy himself as to the bona fides of the meat in question, when we have no uniform national standard? Ninety nine times out of 100 this meat is perfectly wholesome and has been prepared with professionalism and high regard to hygiene.  The 1 per cent, however, raises suspicion and taints the rest.  I welcome, therefore, the national standards on meat preparation which this Bill will provide.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the creation of the corps of full time veterinarians throughout local authorities who will ensure that this standard is adhered to in every corner of the land, and I would ask the councils and county managers to recruit these full time veterinary personnel quickly.  There is nothing to stop local authorities now from going ahead and securing these appointments. Nine local authorities have done so years ago and it would make for good sense for the other authorities to start the ball rolling now so that we could have an early starting-off date for implementation of the controls.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2704" /> I am confident that the trade will cooperate in every way with making the Bill's controls a success.  It is as much in their interests as everyone else's that these measures should work and, moreover, be seen to be working.</P>
    <P>While we have often concentrated on the export side, we should not overlook that the domestic trade has been making a valuable contribution to Irish agriculture by providing a ready market for some 250,000 head of cattle annually.  In addition they buy from our farms 800,000 sheep and over 300,000 pigs each year. These are sizeable numbers by anybody's reckoning and represent a very worthwhile market outlet for Irish farmers.</P>
    <P>The butchers' trade, of course, has had its own problems to contend with. Increased competition from wholesaling and supermarket outlets has left its mark on a large number of small butchers' shops.  It is a tough business with long hours between buying, slaughtering and retailing.  The personalised attention they can give their customers will be always welcome as a valued part of Irish life. The last thing the trade wants is an image problem created by a few cowbody operators in the business of selling meat. These cowboys should have a good read of this Bill, particularly the penalties section.  The message for them should be clear &mdash; stop this or else.  I know the Minister will be consulting with the trade and all other interested parties on the requirements and standards to be set out in the regulations to be made under this Bill.  Indeed, such consultations would help towards a greater understanding and effective implementation of the regulations on the ground.  I am satisfied that there are certain worries among people in the trade as regards the type of abattoir they are expected to set up, what constitutes an abattoir and so on.  Under the system of appeal the only recourse a person who loses his licence has is to the Circuit Court.  This might seem pretty hard and the trade might be worried about it at this time, but I am sure that in the remaining Stages of the Bill and in the discussions that will take place between the trade and the Minister all <Col N="2705" /> those points can be ironed out satisfactorily for everybody involved.</P>
    <P>The important thing is that this Bill will provide an assurance to the Irish housewife that meat being sold on the home market has been prepared under hygienic conditions and is fresh, wholesome and in every way fit for human consumption.  If that is so we are doing a good day's work for the meat business which is a very important part of our national economy at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food recently announced a programme for the development of the pigmeat industry. The central feature of that programme is the rationalisation of the slaughtering-processing segment of the industry.  That programme involves total investment of £104 million by 1992 and has an ambitious job creation target close to 1,500 new jobs in the production and processing segments of the industry.  The pig output in that programme is targeted to increase to £3 million annually by 1992.</P>
    <P>In all, we have here a programme set out by the Minister and the Government to help the meat industry.  Our primary concern is to help the export business and, indeed, give the home market the same benefits as the export market has enjoyed for a number of years.  The regulations we are imposing now under this legislation have been there all along for the export market.  As I said, if it helps to provide the Irish housewife with meat that has been properly prepared under hygienic conditions and is fresh and wholesome, we all should welcome this Bill wholeheartedly.</P>

      <P>I have been waiting here to express my welcome for this Bill, but I am already over a quarter of an hour late for the meeting of the Committee on Womens' Rights of which I am a member, so my contribution will be very brief indeed.  I welcome the Bill.  I am <Col N="2706" /> glad that it has been introduced in this Seanad like so many other Bills and I am sure that my colleagues join with me in that, even Senator McMahon who expressed some reservations this morning about the constitutional aspect.</P>
      <P>I will confine my contribution to one matter already mentioned by two Members, Senators Connor and Ferris, with regard to the environmental health officer.  Regarding the regulation of standards in slaughterhouses and abattoirs, at present the environmental health officer employed by the health board has had a very important role, as has also the veterinary inspector employed by the county council or the corporation.  In my professional capacity I have had reason on many occasions and during a long number of years to meet health officers who have always been very forthcoming and very helpful.  Everybody will agree with me that they did a very good job in the upgrading of slaughterhouses and butchers' premises.  It now looks as if there is no role for the environmental health officer.  I am not sure if that is so; I hope it is not.  It might be more appropriate to say they will have a diminished role.  What assurances can the Minister give that the health boards will retain their present function in relation to the transport of meat and the retail sales of meat?  It is important that he should give assurances of that nature. The environmental health officers deserve reassurance.  I hope the Minister, when replying on Second Stage, will deal with this aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Butcher shops are registered by the health boards under the Health Act, 1947, and the Food Hygiene Regulations 1950 to 1971.  It is generally conceded that the food regulations were not designed for slaughterhouses or, indeed, for butchers' shops.  The duties of the environmental health officers are being eroded in this Bill.  The veterinary inspectors are employed mostly on a part time basis, as the Minister and previous speakers have said, except in a few instances where full time inspectors are employed. The veterinary inspector's duty is related specifically to the standard of meat. <Col N="2707" /> There are other considerations regarding the residue, the offal, the equipment, the refrigeration and the structural and operational hygiene.  This was a very big part of the work of the environmental health officers.  They dealt with such things as fly infestation, rodent infestation, disposal of blood, smell, nuisances and things of that nature.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a very good one.  I have not heard any real criticism of it, particularly from those in the trade.  The Bill is needed at present.  The licensing idea is very good.  It is a vital aspect of the Bill.  It is a great weapon.  I suppose the intention is to make standards so high that the small slaughterhouses will, in time, go out of business and I would regret that because they have played an important part in this area.  I presume the charges will be reduced by reason of this Bill. That is an aspect which, perhaps, we can go into in greater detail on Committee Stage.  If those who slaughter cattle in private slaughterhouses could have the job done at a lower cost in a central abattoir, it would be a considerable advance.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food is responsible for this Bill.  Would it not be more appropriate that the Minister for Health should be responsible for it? Perhaps the Minister might refer to this when replying on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>The examination of the meat is important but the after care is equally important for those who purchase the meat. This has been referred to by other Senators.  There is no provision for the environmental health officers or the health boards who played such an important role in this area heretofore.  We should give some thought to this.  The role of the environmental health officers has improved over the years.  They now receive better education.  Degree courses are available to them in the universities, whereas in the early stages they received diplomas only.  This does not mean they were not as well qualified.  Health education is now made available to butchers. In my own county of Meath there are courses for butchers, hoteliers and others <Col N="2708" /> engaged in that area.  Oral and written examinations are held and certificates and diplomas are awarded.  This is a good thing.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health, I understand, made some orders recently to close down a number of slaughterhouses due largely to the efforts made by the environmental health officers.  It is good that the law is now being standardised.  Some Members have already referred to the by-laws which were introduced in some counties, including Cavan, but in my own county of Meath, a neighbouring county, they were not introduced.  While it was possible to an extent to reach a high standard with regard to existing legislation, the penalties were much too low.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor referred to the physical side of the abattoir and said he hoped that the Minister, when replying to Second Stage, would deal with this matter.  It should be possible for the Minister, within very broad parameters, to do so.  It would be a mistake to feel that in this House we could deal to any great extent with the physical side of the matter.  There are comprehensive and expensive textbooks available.  My experience in the past has been that the officers in the Department of Agriculture and Food have been very helpful in this regard.  There are very useful guidelines available in the Department.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is timely and necessary.  It will make a very worthwhile contribution in this area.  I hope some of the matters raised by me and by other Members will be teased out on the later Stages of the Bill.  I hope the Minister, when replying, will deal in some detail with the role of the environmental health officers and how he envisages that role will continue when this Bill becomes law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Most if not all of us welcome a Bill of this nature.  I do not share the views expressed by Senator Hussey that adequate consultation has taken place.  I would like to refer briefly to our discussion earlier today when I sought to have the Government's views adequately explained with regard to the <Col N="2709" /> introduction of Bills in this House rather than in the Dáil.  I hope the press will give more attention to this Bill than they have given to the other six initiated in the Seanad this term.  This is an example of what I was trying to get the Seanad to understand this morning, that less attention apparently has been given to Bills initiated in the Seanad than to similar Bills initiated in the Dáil.  We fail to get an adequate feedback in many instances before the Dáil deals with a Bill, in this case in the second instance.</P>
      <P>If a Bill is introduced in the Dáil it gets a fair public airing and we get a reaction from interested sections of the community. That adds to the democratic process and assists in getting the views of many people.  While I appreciate all the views in this House and indeed in the other House and that a cross section of the general population is represented here, I still maintain that many points could be picked up from specialised bodies outside and enshrined in the various Bills enacted in the Oireachtas.  I do not share Senator Hussey's view that adequate consultation has taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was not fortunate enought to have seen the recent programme on RTE but I heard about it.  I have been involved in the meat trade down the years, having served most of my years as a victualler I knew what was happening then and I have a fair idea of what is happening at present.  This Bill is long overdue.  It is a great pity that a very high percentage of meat consumed by our population could be regarded as unfit for human consumption. I do not make that statement lightly.  The vast majority of victuallers operate to pretty strict hygiene standards and the vast majority of meat served and consumed is as high in quality from a hygiene point of view &mdash; or indeed in any other respects &mdash; as in any other country in the world.  Notwithstanding that, a very high percentage of it is unfit for human consumption.  I am glad to see some attempt being made to regularise the situation so that our own people as well as tourists may partake of some of the best food we have in the knowledge <Col N="2710" /> that it has been handled in a proper manner.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that the Bill in one respect goes far enough because much of the meat to which I referred a moment ago as unfit for human consumption is not always contaminated in the slaughterhouse. Meat is delivered to other premises, shops or supermarkets for further processing and very often contamination takes place at this stage.  It is a pity the Bill does not deal with that matter.  I know the Minister will say there are other Acts&mdash;some of them were referred to here today&mdash;to deal with those situations but one cannot be sure, until that gap is filled, that the meat consumed is of the highest standard.  It is possible to get unmarked meat in retail outlets and indeed in some supermarkets and one cannot say where it has come from. There is no brand mark on it and no indication as to where it was processed. Beefburgers or meat burgers of any description are in the high percentage of meat which is unfit for human consumption. Sausages are sold throughout the country and there is no label, good, bad or indifferent on them, no indication as to where they were manufactured.</P>
    <P>There is no way of tracing back except through the retail outlet and the retailer will be slow to give an indication to a consumer with a complaint as to where the products in question come from.  The Minister and his colleague in the Department of Health should tighten up the gap that exists there.  In other words, the Department of Agriculture should ensure that the home consumer and those who visit our country are consuming meat of the highest standard.  It is only when that gap is filled that most of us will feel &mdash; in so far as it is reasonably and humanly possible &mdash; that the meat is of the highest possible standard.</P>
    <P>There should have been more consultation with interested bodies, victuallers and the farmers for that matter because they have an interest in it, and with the local authorities.  While the bones of the Bill were outlined by the Minister this morning, when you get <Col N="2711" /> down to detail there may be some difficulties to which the Minister did not refer.  I am referring to inspections which will have to be arranged because it will be inconvenient for many victuallers and it has been made more difficult for them to arrange to have their killings at a time suitable for an inspector.  Most public servants work between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. and most victuallers have a 12 hour day or even more.  Many family businesses will be very much affected by this Bill and the Minister should come some way in meeting them.  The unfortunate part of it is that the victualler who has been operating down the years in an adequate, proper and hygienic manner will suffer because the person who has been operating otherwise has little regard for regulations and will continue to flout them. You will not change a person's attitude simply by bringing in a measure.  It is up to those responsible to ensure that the regulations are carried through and that cowboy operators are caught and penalised.</P>
    <P>They must also ensure that they do not operate under a different name in another locality.  It is up to the local authorities to ensure that there is adequate staff to do the job.  This is a point I am particularly worried about.  There is provision in the Bill for more than one local authority to operate with the same staff.  That could make it even more difficult to ensure that the regulations are carried through and that these illegal operators are apprehended.  Presumably the staff would work a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. day but a great deal of the illegal slaughtering takes place after those hours, as does much of the legitimate business. There is a real difficulty here because the local authorities will be restricted in the number of staff they can employ, depending on the return from the killings and the licences.  The local authority may not have sufficient staff to adequately carry through the provisions of the Bill.  It would be a great pity if these provisions were to fall short for want of adequate staffing.</P>
    <P>There should be provision for overtime <Col N="2712" /> working &mdash; I have no doubt it will be necessary &mdash; otherwise we will be encouraging people to slaughter without inspection. Those who would otherwise continue to operate within the law might be forced to operate outside the law simply because an inspector was not available after 5 p.m.  In the case of most family butchers, killing is undertaken in the evenings.  It will create a lot of difficulty where an inspector has to cover a county or two if the butcher has to arrange his killings to fit in with that man's or woman's time.  Most butchers serve in their shops in the mornings and the killings are done either in the afternoon &mdash; during the working hours before 5 p.m. &mdash; or after tea.  This could mean that the inspector would be expected to be in many parts of the country at the same time and that would be impossible. It is not normal for butchers to kill after Wednesday, in fact most of them now seldom kill after Tuesday.  This means most killings are done on Monday and Tuesday.  This is adding even greater difficulty to the working of the Bill because the inspector would be expected to be in different towns at the same time.</P>
    <P>This Bill may call for a far greater number of staff than is envisaged by the Minister and provision should be made to enable local authorities to employ sufficient staff to ensure that the provisions of the Bill are properly carried through, because there is nothing as bad as having a Bill enacted and not putting it into operation.  I receive many complaints about the control of dogs.  Everybody was crying out for legislation in this area but now that the Control of Dogs Act is on the Statute Book, everybody is wondering what difference it makes because it is not being enforced.  There is nothing as bad as having legislation enacted and, through inability or insufficient provisions being unable to ensure that it is carried through.</P>
    <P>There should be a uniform specification for the country.  The regulations should apply equally to Dublin, Donegal, Galway and Kerry.  I noticed that in his speech this morning the Minister referred to a section which gives him power to <Col N="2713" /> alter the regulations where there is an existing slaughtering outlet but he did not give the reasons for taking this power unto himself.  I think that is a dangerous section.  I believe the vast majority of victuallers would like to see the regulations operated uniformly from north to south irrespective of whether it be a city or country area.  I ask the Minister to assure the trade that this power will only be used in very exceptional circumstances, although I cannot think of any reason the Minister should use it.</P>
    <P>Of course, there will be many victuallers who create a fuss at having to bring their premises up to a certain standard, and the Minister may have great sympathy for these family businesses that have been operating for quite a number of years, but there is another way out.  The Minister can grant aid those who raise the standards in their slaughterhouses.  This would not create a precedent because, as I understand it, the export slaughtering outlets have been grant aided, some of them by the EC.  In requiring the trade to bring their slaughtering yards and slaughterhouses to a higher standard, I would like to see the Minister make provision in the Bill for grant aiding such operations because there are many small family businesses killing two cattle and six sheep weekly in their own slaughtering yard and selling through their own retail outlet.  It could be a hardship on those families to have to bring their slaughtering yards to a standard required by the Minister.  If you were to ask me what is that standard, I could not tell you because I do not think the Minister has spelled out what the standard would be. It could be different from one end of the country to the other, depending on the local inspector.</P>
    <P>There should be uniformity of specification for the raising of standards of slaughteryards and there should be grantaid, because the alternative is to run the small man out of business.  All of us will agree that for far too long we have been running the small man out of business and going for the big national or international operation, not only in the meat trade but <Col N="2714" /> in other trades as well.  This was detrimental to the general operation of the country and we should be making an effort to keep the small person in business rather than putting obstacles in his way.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope the Minister will give consideration to grant-aiding the slaughterhouses that are now being required to come up to a higher standard.  Many of them had the highest standard of hygiene. Most of them, while not operating improperly, nevertheless will be required to give a higher standard and I seriously believe they should be grant-aided.  It would be sad if this measure were to put out of business any small business person who has been operating to a high standard down the years.</P>
    <P>I hope also that it will not eliminate &mdash; and I am sticking my neck out here because I am sure there are many who will disagree with me &mdash; the killing of an animal on a family farm for that family's use.  This is a tradition which is centuries old.  If a person is farming and cares for animals and rears them for the market, either home or export, that person is entitled to eat his own produce and it should not need to leave his farm.  There are very many people who will kill a lamb or a goat and fowl which may not be covered here, but they kill them for their own consumption on their own farms.  It would be a pity if that were done away with because no man more than the person who has cared for and killed the animal is going to ensure care, even after killing, for the highest possible hygenic standard.  I would hope it will not eliminate the killing of one or two animals per year on the farm for their own consumption. I know there is a danger but it is no doubt a danger of which inspectors will be aware, that many will claim when caught killing an animal that it is for their own consumption while it could be for a retail outlet somewhere.</P>
    <P>This brings me back to the burgers I spoke about earlier that were unmarked and their source untraceable.  None of us wants to see that kind of operation.  The farmer or the producer is entitled to consume his own produce and it should not have to go into a slaughteryard to be <Col N="2715" /> slaughtered for that purpose.  There are many reasons for that.  One which I have given is that it has been a tradition for many centuries.  Indeed, the killing of a pig was a festive occasion on many farms, when not only the farmer's own family but the relatives would gather for the great occasion of the killing, preparing and curing of a pig.  Very often it was an occasion for a family gathering and a party.  I would not like to see that done away with.  I hope these farmers will not be leaving themselves liable to prosecution.</P>
    <P>Before I get away from this section of the Bill, I would stress to the Minister the difficulty that may be experienced by victuallers in having an inspector present for ante and post-mortem examinations. All the killings normally, particularly in a country area, are done in the earlier days of the week, in other words, Mondays and Tuesdays.  In many instances, it may happen that the local authority will have one inspector and he will be expected to be in many places at the one time.  I do not know how the Minister proposes to deal with that.  There is no point in the Minister saying that it is the responsibility of the local authority.  The only way they can deal with it is to force a person to operate his killings outside normal hours without inspection or, alternatively, to inconvenience butchers by forcing them to kill on days on which they have never been used to killing or, indeed, to operate their slaughterings in the mornings rather than in the afternoons to facilitate an inspector.  I do not think this pressure should be put on the trade.</P>
    <P>The trade is paying for this measure; it is not like other measures that we would have had.  If this Bill had been brought in ten or even five years ago there would have been no such thing as charging for the slaughtering of the animals, although perhaps there might have been a charge for the licensing of a slaughteryard.  We should have had the Bill then and maybe before then, or some regulations.  There would not have been a £3.25 charge or any charge for the slaughtering of an <Col N="2716" /> animal ten years ago.  The trade would not have been asked to pay for it.  It would have been considered a necessary health regulation for the Government to carry out, just as food premises are inspected without charge.  The butcher is now being charged for this service and he is going to be inconvenienced to a great extent.</P>
    <P>I want to deal briefly with the charges I have just mentioned.  They can be pretty harsh.  Indeed, I am wondering if the Minister has given adequate consideration to the charges which he has enshrined in the Bill which can, of course, be changed, as he said, from time to time. These are the initial charges and we do not know what they will be in 12 months' time or in two years' time.  It could be for an initial six months and then the charges could be increased.  I am sure the Minister does not intend that, but he will not always be Minister.  A new Minister could very well double the charges if he found that the local authorities needed twice the number of inspectors this Minister envisages the local authorities as needing.</P>
    <P>Take a small family business of, say, four cattle and 12 lambs; that is not an excessive business.  In fact, I would say it is the average business of most butchers throughout the country, four cattle and 12 lambs, £3.25 per beast and 55p per lamb, giving a total of £19.60 per week &mdash; a considerable tax on a small businessman. Add to that the licensing of his slaughteryard, which is now £50 because that calculation goes over the 500 mark. If you have 501 animals, your fee jumps from £10 to £50 with which again I disagree.</P>
    <P>The next jump to 1,001 animals would not be as great because there would be a far greater volume of business in such a slaughteryard.  A slaughteryard doing an average butcher's business will slaughter over 500 animals and I wonder how the Minister came up with the figure of 500 because most businesses will slaughter over 500 animals and it puts them into the £50 licensing category.  If the £19.50 per week is added to that, the total is £160.  In addition, the cost of paperwork can be put at anything from £20 to £50 a <Col N="2717" /> year, and phonecalls are inevitable because of the arrangements necessary for slaughtering.  It will not be possible for people in business to say: &ldquo;I will slaughter at 3 o'clock every Tuesday&rdquo; to suit an inspector.  If he does come to that arrangement and it does not suit the inspector, inevitably there will be to-ing and fro-ing on the telephone and that will cost around £50 or more a year.  That brings it to a figure of about £250.  This is a further tax being imposed on small businesses and which many would consider to be enormous.  The Minister has made light of the charges, and while they may be reasonable for somebody who has a large turnover &mdash; the greater the turnover the less they will think of the charge &mdash; it is the small butcher I am concerned about.  We are imposing a further tax of at least £250 on them.</P>
    <P>It is not unheard of for an inspector to ring a butcher and say: &ldquo;I am at such a village, ten, 20 or 30 miles away and I want to be collected to inspect your animals before they are slaughtered&rdquo;.  Some people may frown at that but I have been in the business all my life and I know of cases where inspectors for transport business were collected, brought to the factory and left home again.  That would be a further charge and inconvenience on a business person.  It should be the responsibility of an inspector to be at a premises at a reasonable time and to get there of his own accord and not lie on the shoulder of the person who is being asked to pay all the bills.</P>
    <P>Although I cannot see the local authorities operating it to a great extent I am glad the Minister has kept the option for them to license a slaughtering outlet.  In some areas it may suit butchers to have animals slaughtered at a central point and the provision is made in the Bill for the local authorities to set up a slaughtering yard and license it.  I welcome that though I see little prospect of it being used because the emphasis is on the slaughtering operations being carried out by private operators.  I can have a slaughtering yard and charge business people to come in and slaughter their cattle or I could provide the butchers to do the <Col N="2718" /> slaughtering for them and charge accordingly. That goes on throughout the country. I am glad the provision is in the Bill for local authorities if the need is there. However a lot of pressure would have to be put on them to build or renovate a premises suitable for slaughtering, register it and carry out the operation because local authorities want to get out of this service rather than go deeper into it.</P>
    <P>The sale of meat which is unfit for human consumption must be stopped and if this Bill has that effect we have gone a good way down the road towards ensuring that the meat home consumers and tourists eat is of the highest possible standard. If we can ensure that meat is properly handled from the time it leaves the slaughteryard until it reaches the consumer then we will be in a much happier position.  At present far too much meat is being sold which is unfit for human consumption.  If you go for a drink to some public houses in this city at certain hours, particularly on a Friday evening, you can purchase a parcel of meat from £20 to £40 from the boot of a car without seeing what is in the parcel or knowing where it has come from.  That type of trading will have to stop.  The Minister will have to ensure that it is stopped rapidly because it has been developing over the years.  It had slackened off for a while but I believe it is on the increase again. The consumer is as much to blame as the business operator because he should not take the risk of buying that meat.  I do not believe they should be put at that risk.  They can buy the meat much cheaper than they could buy it in the local butchers because those operators do not have to pay taxes and rates on a premises. I stuck out my neck this morning in venturing to say that we were serving democracy to a lesser degree in having Bills initiated in the Seanad rather than in the Dáil.  I hope the initiation of this Bill this week will get widespread publicity so that I will be proved wrong in what I said here earlier today, and so that it will awaken people to what is happening and we will get a considerable feedback from those interested in the trade.</P>
    <P>It is a bit unusual that we are getting a <Col N="2719" /> breathing space before dealing with Committee Stage of this Bill which, I understand we are not taking during this session.  This is not so with other Bills because we passed them in their entirety during the last few weeks and they are now to be sent to the Dáil.  I understand that, only if they are amended in the Dáil, will they come back to us.  This is why this morning I questioned the advisability of initiating so many Bills in the Seanad. They get the main debate in this House but get far less publicity and, therefore, a much lesser feedback from the general public.</P>
    <P>I am not so sure that I got that point across to my colleagues in the House this morning.  I do not want to use the time of the House in making points about something other than this Bill.  I had hoped for an Adjournment debate where I could have made those points but the Leader of the House did not seem anxious that we would have an Adjournment debate to review our operations here over this session.</P>
    <P>I know it was my party who first introduced Bills into the Seanad in the seventies but we only initiated a few Bills in the Seanad to be returned to the Dáil. This was done only under pressure of Dáil business but now there seems to be a change in attitude.  I wanted the Leader of the House to clarify this for us and this is why I asked this morning for an Adjournment debate and why I said that, if we are to have a continuation of this, we are serving democracy to a lesser degree. We are running the risk of the main debates taking place in the Seanad and no matter how important we feel we are in dealing with these measures, they do not get the same airing outside, with all due respect to the men and women who frequent the press bench here.  I am not blaming them.  We appreciate their job and the increased publicity they have given us during this session as against what we got previously.  They are in attendance and record what happens here, but it is like the meat leaving the slaughter yard, after it leaves here it is dealt with by other people in other places <Col N="2720" /> and it does not get the same treatment as I am sure the ladies and gentlemen who frequent the press bench would like to see it getting.  They would like to see a result for their laborious hours spent in this Chamber.  It just does not get through for whatever reasons.  One newspaper seems to refuse to print&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to the debate on the Abattoirs Bill, 1987.  The purpose of this Bill is to amend and extend the law in this area.  I join in the general welcome which has been given to the Bill, and I appreciate that this very important measure has been initiated in the Seanad.  I am satisifed that the provisions of this Bill will have far reaching beneficial effects for the general public. I am also satisifed that this legislation, in so far as it applies to abattoirs, is very much in the interests of the butchering trade and of all who are involved in providing meat for the home market irrespective of whether they are operating at wholesale or at retail level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In section 2 the word &ldquo;abattoir&rdquo; covers any premises used for, or in connection with, the slaughter of animals whose meat is intended for human consumption. The Bill makes an exception, however, of certain on farm premises which are used for this purpose.  If such premises are situated on a farm ancillary to a hotel, guesthouse, school, hospital, nursing home, or other institution they are deemed to be an abattoir but if the on-farm premises are used only for the occasional slaughter of animals which are kept on the farm and the meat from these animals is intended for consumption only by the residents on the farm, the premises are not deemed to be an abattoir.  I <Col N="2721" /> wonder if the Minister was wise to have excluded such premises from the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It would have been in the public interest if all meat for human consumption were killed and processed only in premises which met the standards which will be provided for and specified in the regulations which the Minister will be making under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Bill states that, in the case of the excepted premises, the animals which are slaughtered in such premises must be animals which are kept on the farm and, secondly, that the meat from such animals must be intended only for consumption by the residents on the farm.  I accept, too, that the Bill further states that the onus of establishing that these conditions are complied with shall lie with the person seeking the benefit of such conditions.  However, this requirement is unlikely to arise except where a prosecution is brought and, since such premises are not even required to be registered, there are not likely to be very many prosecutions relating to the use of such premises.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister explain to the House what is meant by the phrase in section 2 (1) (a) &ldquo;which are kept on such farm&rdquo;? How long must such animals be kept on the farm?  Must they be kept for a year, a month, a week, or a day, or must they be there from birth?  The paragraph is not very specific and it is open to many different interpretations.  Will the Minister also explain what is meant in paragraph (b) of the same subsection by &ldquo;...is intended for consumption only by the residents on such farm&rdquo;?  Do the words &ldquo;the residents&rdquo; mean only the farmer and his family?  Do they mean the household which would include permanent employees on the farm, or would temporary employees also be included in the term, &ldquo;the residents&rdquo;?  What about visitors?  Is it intended in the paragraph that residents would include visitors to the farm who might have a meal with the farmer and his family or, indeed, visitors who might stay on the farm for a few days?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2722" /> I wonder why the words &ldquo;will be consumed&rdquo; were not used in the paragraph instead of the words &ldquo;is intended for consumption&rdquo;. If the words &ldquo;will be consumed&rdquo; were used in the paragraph it would read &ldquo;the meat from which will be consumed only by the residents on such farm.&rdquo;  Section 2 (1) (b), like paragraph (a), is imprecise and in my view this should not be the case in legislation.  I realise that the points which I have been making are really the type of points which are usually made on Committee Stage.  I am making them now so that the Minister will have an opportunity to consider them before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>My suggestion to the Minister is that he should remove from the Bill the exception which he has made in the case of the on-farm premises to which I have referred so that all animals for human consumption will have to be slaughtered and processed in premises which are licensed for use as abattoirs.  If he does that, he will not have any problems in relation to denning the type of animals which may be slaughtered in premises which are not required to be licensed or in defining the categories of persons who might legally be provided with such meat for consumption. If the Minister does not want to go as far as I have suggested, that is, to rule out completely the use of such on-farm premises for the slaughtering of animals, he should consider a registration procedure for such premises which will ensure that they will be liable to inspection at regular intervals and that proper slaughtering and hygiene standards will be met.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum, issued with the Bill, states that the first purpose of the Bill is to provide standards of veterinary control and hygiene at local slaughtering premises providing meat for the home market &mdash; which will be on a par with those already applying at export meat plants.  Part II of the Bill deals mainly with the way in which the legislation proposes to achieve this objective. A system of licensing is being introduced which will mean that a premises, before it can be used as an abattoir, will have to <Col N="2723" /> be licensed annually.  The licence will be granted or renewed by the Minister but under section 9 (3) of the Bill the Minister may transfer his functions in relation to abattoir licences to the various local authorities. Each local authority will be required by the legislation to employ at least one full time veterinary inspector to oversee and implement the new controls.</P>
    <P>The fees which are specified in section 10, in connection with applications for abattoir licences, are reasonable and I welcome the provision that in any case where an application for a licence is refused the fee will be refunded.  However, even though the fees appear reasonable, in very many cases the applicant will have been put to considerable expense in providing new premises or in bringing existing premises up to the standard required for the issue of a licence.  In almost all such cases, substantial planning fees will also have been paid to the local authority. I hope the Minister will take this matter into account when, as I am sure will happen in the future, there will be a suggestion from some quarter that abattoir licence fees should be increased.</P>
    <P>Another provision which is made in the Bill is that the Minister may assign a distinctive number or letter, or number and letter, to each abattoir in respect of which a licence is granted.  I assume that all meat originating in each abattoir will be stamped with this identification mark. If this is done in all cases, and I feel it should be, then the abattoir of origin of all meat offered for sale for human consumption will be easily identifiable.  I wonder why the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used in the subsection instead of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; if it is the intention that all meat originating in each licensed abattoir will carry the abattoir's identification mark?  I would prefer if section 11 (3) were to specify that the Minister shall assign a distinctive identification mark to each licensed abattoir with which all meat originating in that abattoir and offered for sale for human consumption would be required to be stamped.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Bill that abattoir <Col N="2724" /> licences are nontransferable is reasonable since before a licence is issued one of the conditions which the applicant must satisfy is that he or she is a proper person to hold an abattoir licence.  If such licences were transferable this would open up a method of circumventing this condition.  However, I welcome the fact that, if the holder of a licence dies, the licence will be allowed to continue in force and effect for the benefit of the licence holder's personal representative or spouse or some other member of the licence holder's family.  However two months or such longer period as the Minister may allow, after the death of the licence holder, the licence will expire.  It would not be unreasonable if the period specified in this provision were at least three months.  I know the Minister may extend the two months period as two months is a very short period after a death.  He should give sympathetic consideration to extending this period to at least three months with the proviso that the period may be further extended at the Minister's discretion.</P>
    <P>I welcome, too, the procedure which must be followed when an application for an abattoir licence is refused or where an existing licence is revoked.  The applicant, or the holder of the licence which is revoked, must be notified in writing of the decision and also the reasons for the refusal or revocation.  He or she must be informed of the appeal procedure which is available.  There is also provision for permission to be given to continue the use of the premises of an abattoir pending the determination of the appeal.  I am not happy, however, with the fact that the appeal in the first instance must be to the Circuit Court.  This is a matter to which Senator Ferns referred also.</P>
    <P>In the vast majority of cases where an application for a licence will be refused, or where an existing licence will be revoked, the decision to refuse or revoke will be based on the opinion of one individual, namely, the veterinary inspector involved.  I would be much happier if there was a procedure which would enable an appeal to be dealt with in the <Col N="2725" /> first instance by some form of independent appeals tribunal.  It is most desirable and in everyone's interest that the appeal should be determined as expeditiously as possible and should involve the very minimum of unnecessary inconvenience for all concerned.</P>
    <P>The composition of the type of tribunal I suggest would be a matter for the Minister. For example, a five member tribunal, consisting of a representative of the Minister, a representative of the trade, a representative of the veterinary profession and a consumer representative, with an agreed independent chairman, would be fully competent to deal satisfactorily with the majority of appeals which will arise.  The operation of such a tribunal would eliminate the inevitable delay and the considerable expense which an appeal to the Circuit Court involves. Four or five such tribunals, established on a regional basis, would cover the appeal applications throughout the entire country.</P>
    <P>Section 17 of the Bill is also a very reasonable and welcome provision, except in one respect.  This section allows the Minister where, in his opinion, special circumstances exist and he considers it reasonable to do so, to issue a permit in lieu of an abattoir licence where the premises involved were in existence prior to the coming into force of this legislation and where such premises are capable of being brought up to the standards required by the legislation in order to qualify for an abattoir licence.  This section will remain in force for a period of five years and I accept that this should be sufficient to enable all such premises to be brought up to the required standards. However, there should be some provision in this section for an appeal in a case where a permit is refused or revoked.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter.</P>
    <P>Regarding the regulations the Minister may make in relation to abattoirs and for the purpose of establishing the fitness of meat for human consumption, I sincerely hope he will ensure that a situation will obtain where all animals slaughtered for <Col N="2726" /> human consumption will be tested for banned growth promoter and antibiotic residues.  Any carcases found to show residues of illegal substances should and must be declared unfit for human consumption. The consumer is entitled to be absolutely certain that meat which is offered for sale for human consumption is free from all such residues.  The only way this can be guaranteed is by the rejection in all abattoirs and in all meat factories of any carcase which shows any trace whatsoever of the banned substances to which I have referred.  This, combined with the imposition of the severest possible penalties, will, I hope, have the effect of convincing those who are still using such substances that what they are doing is neither in their own nor in the public interest.</P>
    <P>The purpose of Part III of the Bill is to regulate the activities of knackeries where animal carcases and offals are handled for industrial and other purposes. The most important section in this part of the Bill is section 22 which makes it an offence for a person to sell, offer or expose for sale any meat which originated in a knackery.  I welcome the fact that the operation of such premises has been brought within the scope of this Bill and that the new controls in respect of such premises will include licensing and veterinary inspection.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with the appointment of veterinary inspectors and the duties and powers of such inspectors. I note from the explanatory memorandum that it is expected that the veterinary inspection fees, which will be collected in each local authority area, will be sufficient to cover the cost of the veterinary inspector's salary and the necessary back-up services which will arise.  I sincerely hope that the Department's calculations are correct in this regard but only time will tell if they are.</P>
    <P>In regard to the ante-mortem and post-mortem examinations which the veterinary inspector will be required to carry out I, like Senator McMahon, express the hope that every effort will be made to facilitate, within reason, the carrying out of the slaughtering on the days and <Col N="2727" /> at the times which are most convenient and most suitable for the licence holder.</P>
    <P>I want to comment on section 54.  This section details the powers of an authorised officer or a member of the Garda Síochána in relation to the inspection of premises, vehicles or records in connection with the enforcement of this legislation.  Section 54 (1) provides that:</P>
    <P>An authorised officer or a member of the Garda Síochána may&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  enter, by force if necessary, and inspect any premises which is, or which he reasonably suspects is, being used as an abattoir or as a knackery;</P>
    <P>(b)  enter, by force if necessary, and inspect any vehicle or container which is, or which he reasonably suspects is, being used in connection with an abattoir or with a knackery;</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the phrase &ldquo;by force if necessary&rdquo; which is contained in each of these paragraphs.  The phrase &ldquo;by force if necessary&rdquo; does not limit the amount or the degree of force which may be used.  It permits the use of more force than may be necessary in order to carry out the required inspection.  The use of excessive force will result in more damage than is necessary to the premises, the vehicle or the container in question. I see the necessity for the provision that force may be used in certain circumstances but I would like to see the degree of force which may be used limited to the maximum which is absolutely necessary.  I hope the Minister will give some consideration to whether the restriction I suggest could be incorporated in the section.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, again I compliment the Minister on having brought forward, so early in his term of office, this very desirable and necessary legislation.  As I said at the outset, I believe that the provisions of this Bill will receive a warm welcome from both the general public and those involved in the meat trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank the Members of the House for the contributions they <Col N="2728" /> made.  It is gratifying that the Bill has been so well received.  I anticipated, in general, the reception it has got because in my opening address I expressed the confident hope that not only the purpose of the Bill but the actual machinery of it would be supported by all sides of the House in view of the necessity to regulate and control this area.  The positive response and goodwill existing towards the Bill must be capitalised on and the best way to do that is to implement its provisions as soon as possible and as fully as possible.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned earlier, various groups were consulted in the formulation of the Bill.  At this stage I should thank the Irish Domestic Meat Traders Association, the Irish Master Butchers Federation, the Irish Meat Wholesalers Association, CBF, The Irish Bacon Curers Society, The Federation of Irish Renderers, the County and City Managers Association, the Irish Society of Medical Officers of Health, the Local Government and Public Services Union, the Irish Veterinary Association, the Local Authority Veterinary Officers Association, the Irish Veterinary Union and the Veterinary Officers Association, for giving their time and for their ongoing interest in the work of helping to raise standards on the home meat market.</P>
      <P>The wide variety of legitimate interests and interest groups involved explains to a considerable extent the time it took to get this legislation prepared and drafted. I acknowledged, in introducing the Bill, that I wanted to express my appreciation to all who have been involved at all stages, including my predecessor.  On assuming office I took the decision, with my colleagues in the Department, that this matter was top priority.  We had from the very first, indicated to some of the interest groups concerned that we would have this legislation which, I suppose, was awaited and expected for some years &mdash; brought into the Oireachtas in this session.  For that reason I was very glad that the Seanad was still in session to enable me to fulfil that commitment because, as I indicated, it is a matter of the most considerable importance.</P>

      <Col N="2729" /> I am sorry I was unable to be here for the debate, as I said.  Indeed, when I came in I thought my colleague, the Minister of State here, might have the opportunity to make a comment, although it was not part of the plan between us. Then I thought that out of courtesy to the House, as I had introduced it, perhaps I should reply.  In view of the fact that he has been attending here, my colleague, the Minister of State, is probably better equipped to reply to some of the points raised.  I will try to deal with some of them.  I am aware of some of these only from the information that has been passed on to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that we have been able to introduce this Bill to the Oireachtas in this term as the Minister said, because it is long awaited and very important in the area of the pigmeat industry.  We are talking about the raising of standards of hygiene and of quality of produce for the home market so that they will be on a par with those for the export market.  That is vital, particularly as in recent times the industry has had some bad publicity.  That is not good for the industry or the practitioners.  Under the terms of this Bill and the regulations which will be made under it, the very fine people in the trade and in the profession &mdash; in many cases generations of their families have been there &mdash; will welcome the provisions of this Bill as I know from consultations with them.  At departmental level the Minister, the Minister of State, Deputy Kirk, and I during the coming months before coming back to this Chamber and the Seanad again will, in consultation with the trade, be able to iron out particular points and deal with these matters in concert with the industry.</P>
      <P>Senators Connor, Fitzsimons and Ferris raised the continued involvement of environmental health officers in abattoirs. Under section 67 the provisions of the food hygiene regulations will not apply to premises covered by the Bill, otherwise there would be two sets of regulations governing standards in local abattoirs.  As the proposed controls are largely veterinary in nature, I see no great merit in providing for a specific role within abattoirs for environmental health officers.  Rather would I consider it necessary to avoid different State paid officials being employed on overlapping functions in the same area.  Section 35 (3) will, however, allow local authorities to employ environmental health officers to assist their full time veterinary practitioners. Further, the transport and retail sides of the meat trade will continue to be subject to the provisions of the food hygiene regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Connor raised the question of inadequate finance to fund the Bill's provisions. A detailed analysis of funding <Col N="2731" /> was conducted by the Department of Agriculture and Food last year.  The £1.4 million in veterinary inspection fees will cover all local authority veterinary service costs.  Currently the cost of the existing 160 staff approaches £0.9 million annually with no fees accruing save for Dublin and Cork where fees were introduced under the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1983.  Again on costs, I am mindful of the small local authorities, where fees would be insufficient to cover costs.  There is provision in section 35 for such authorities to pool together for the purpose of providing veterinary inspection services.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor and Senator Ferns referred to the need for non-lesion TB reactor animals.  At present TB reactor animals can be delivered only to export meat plants.  Here they undergo full ante and post-mortem veterinary inspection and any meat going for human consumption first has to be passed and deemed to be fully fit for human consumption.</P>
    <P>Senators Connor, McMahon and Ferris raised the question of equal treatment for butchers in each part of the country.  They raised the question of specifications for abattoirs in different parts of the country.  The Bill will provide a national standard and that standard will be the same in all parts of the country.  It will be the same in Roscommon, Tipperary and Cork as it will be in the cities. Any regulations made under the Bill will give specific criteria for abattoirs and premises.  Again, after consultation with the people involved, I see no difficulty in this area.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey referred to the bad image that meat had been receiving in recent years.  While not all farmers welcomed the EC imposed ban on the use of hormones for fattening, there are very positive aspects to these measures for us and for Ireland as a food producing country.  They will help to counteract the concern being expressed, unjustifiably, regarding the wholesomeness of meat. Coupled with the controls set out in this <Col N="2732" /> Bill, the case of the anti-meat lobby falters and consumers will have the assurance that all meat has been prepared under hygienic conditions and is fresh, wholesome and in every way fit for human consumption.  With present day standards and the more educated consumer looking for wholesomeness, freshness and natural products, Ireland as a good food producing country should insist on the highest possible standards in this area.</P>
    <P>Also Senator Hussey exhorted those local authorities without full time veterinary staffs to put the wheels in motion now for the recruitment of full time staff. I could not agree more and, in echoing his request to the 23 local authorities in question, I remind all sanitary authorities that under the Bill's provision the regulation of meat and milk for the home market in the future will be the responsibility of their corresponding local authority or county borough corporation. This will mean, as provided for under sections 37 and 38 of the Bill, that their existing veterinary staff, records, registers etc., relating to these functions will rest with the appropriate local authority for a sanitary area in question.  It would prove very useful, therefore, if the authorities concerned would now begin to prepare for such transfers and so be in a position to facilitate early implementation of the new controls once this Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey also asked that the trade and other interested bodies be consulted on the abattoir requirements and standards which will be set out in the regulations.  I assure the Senator that such consultations will take place before the regulations are made and that, in keeping with the detailed consultations before we introduced this Bill, we will do the same thing before it is finally enacted and in the drawing up of any regulations under it.</P>
    <P>To sum up, in the Department of Agriculture and Food we welcome very much the constructive attitude of the Senators towards this legislation and their general welcome for it.  Generally by their contributions, they were very positive.  They <Col N="2733" /> related to details of the Bill which can best be dealt with on Committee Stage in some cases.  In particular Senator Mullooly's contribution was very detailed. Certainly we will consider in detail on Committee Stage the matters he raised. Because of the time lapse between now and Committee Stage there will be tremendous opportunity to give this Bill a great deal of attention in relation to the details for the next Stage.  Some of the points raised related to detailed matters which are intended to be the subject of regulations under the Bill and obviously we are not in a position to go into these details today.  However, the interest shown by all the speakers is very heartening and augurs well for a highly constructive debate on Committee Stage.</P>

The motion will conclude not later than 8 o'clock.

      <P>I must protest at this change in the Order of Business.  We spent the longest time ever &mdash; 40 minutes &mdash; discussing the Order of Business today.  We said we were going to take items Nos. 1 and 2.  For some reason, best known to the Leader of the House, No. 2 is not being taken now.  I was in possession when this Bill was before the House last Thursday and I have waited around today to continue my contribution.  I find it unusual that we are going to take the Restrictive Practices measure which was not even mentioned on the Order of Business today by the Leader of the House. Some explanation should be given to the House for this sudden change in the Order of Business, with which I totally disagree.  I want to make the strongest possible protest against it as it is an inconvenience to Members.  The Order of Business is set for the day and its purpose is to determine what the House will debate.  If we are extending the time for the motion on education, and I agree it <Col N="2735" /> should be extended, it should not start earlier than was anticipated.  The normal time for starting this motion is 6.30 p.m. There is something unusual about the Order of Business as it is now.  It is not the one that was ordered today.  I ask you, as Cathaoirleach, for your ruling on it.</P>

      <P>I am surprised that Senator Doyle is upset because he has to wait around.  The House is sitting and I did not think that anybody was waiting around.  On the Order of Business this morning I said that items Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 were going to be taken today and that the only item I would give a time for was the matter of the motion.  It could happen that we will take the Adoption Bill later tonight.  If Senator Doyle wishes we can take it at 10 o'clock tonight; I have no objection to that.  I was quite prepared to take the education motion immediately, which is an anti-Government motion, and to give an extended time to it, but because I wanted to give an opportunity to the Seantors who proposed the motion to get in, it was agreed that we would take it at 5 o'clock.</P>

      <P>I support my colleague, Senator Joe Doyle.  I happened to be in possession on the education motion before it was adjourned.  I was visited just now by Senator Willie Ryan who informed me that the debate would start immediately upon the conclusion of the Abattoirs Bill.  I rushed here because I am determined to speak on this motion and did not want to risk losing my place, which would happen if I was not here.  I have just come from a meeting of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights and <Col N="2736" /> purely by accident I met Senator Willie Ryan who informed me of the change; otherwise I might quite reasonably and legitimately have arrived here at 6.30 p.m. expecting the debate to start at that time.  Senator Lanigan kindly told us that he would allow an extension of this debate and one normally thinks of an extention as being something that occurs at the end of a debate rather than at the beginning.  There is an element of sharp practice in this because those who very much wish to speak on the education motion might not have been available at 4.30 p.m. or at 5 o'clock and it is less than fair.</P>

      <P>If the House wishes, we can start this debate immediately.  I have been endeavouring all day to find members of the Opposition parties to seek their co-operation in attempting to get the Order of Business organised.  One reason the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Bill is not being taken now is that I have not been able to contact our Senator who has put down a number of amendments to it.  Because of that we had to reorganise the Order of Business.  I do not want the Restrictive Practices Bill to go ahead because of the Senator's absence.  If the House wishes, I will be strict in the ordering of business and I will not afford to people who put down motions and who are not present in the House the opportunity to disappear.  I will not allow the argument to be put back on this side of the House.  We have tried to accommodate the House all day. The leader of the Fine Gael group and the leader of the Labour group have been contacted.  We were unable to contact the leader of the Independent group because he is not available.  We tried to contact various members of the Independent group, one of whom has put down amendments on the Restrictive Practices Bill.  We can go ahead without her but that is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I had to tell the Leader of the House that I could not agree to it because I was unable to contact anybody. I am very sorry, I was not going to get involved in the controversy.  I could not agree because I had not the authority to do so.  I have sympathy with the Leader of the House and with Senator Doyle.  I feel the same as they do about the Adoption Bill.  As regards the motion in our names, I could not agree to it beginning at 5 o'clock because I was not authorised to do so and I am very sorry if I gave the Leader a different impression.</P>

      <P>The Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, and the Mergers, Takeovers and Monopolies Control Act, 1978, contain exemptions in relation to a number of services.  It is proposed in the Bill to remove most of these exemptions, as the House knows.  This is done by means of the repeal of the relevant provisions under the Second Schedule of the Bill. The parliamentary draftsmen have advised however, that it would be preferable, in view of the importance of the removal of these exemptions which the House is already aware of, to include an appropriate provision in the body of the Bill rather than in the Schedule thereto. Amendments Nos. 5 and 7 give effect to this recommendation.  Amendments Nos. 1, 2, 11 and 12 are consequential on amendments Nos. 5 and 7.

      <Col N="2743" /> In page 6, subsection (1), lines 39 to 42, to delete paragraph (c).</P>
    <P>For the record, I had better make it clear that some years ago Senator Robinson and I agreed that in the event of either of us having amendments to a Bill, we would propose them for each other. Having read her speech on Second Stage, I have no difficulty in speaking on this amendment.</P>
    <P>Section 8 will give the Minister enormous powers.  Senator Robinson's amendment proposes to delete paragraph (c) to &ldquo;make such provision as the Minister thinks necessary to ensure the equit able treatment of all persons in regard to the supply or distribution of goods or the provision of services&rdquo;.  Like Senator Robinson, and agreeing with her, I fully support the objectives and the spirit of the Bill, but like Senator Robinson I think the Minister is at least required to make a good and detailed case for a provision of that breadth and of such limitless extent in order to do something like discourage improper trading practices. At this stage I formally move the amendment that paragraph (c) of subsection (1) of section 8 be deleted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Any order the Minister makes under this section would have to be confirmed by a decision of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Therefore, the powers being given to the Minister are not limitless.  It is very important to put on the record straight away that under section 8 (3) &ldquo;An order under this section shall not have effect unless it is confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas but, upon being so confirmed, it shall have the force of law in accordance with its terms&rdquo;.  I understand Senator Robinson and Senator Ryan's worry but subsection (3) should cover it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of Senator Robinson's amendment would be to restrict the Minister's powers in relation to the making of an order under section 8 by removing one of the four matters in respect of which he will make provision in the order. Senator Robinson is, in effect, proposing <Col N="2744" /> the removal of section 8 (1) (c).  It is envisaged as I said on Second Stage, that this power would be used by the Minister only in extremely urgent cases, in cases where urgency was essential to the public good.  Therefore, Senator Robinson and Senator Ryan need not worry too much about it.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c), the provision Senator Robinson regards as being too wide &mdash; is already contained in the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972.  It is an integral part of the order making process and is essential in order to ensure that the Minister has the necessary powers to put an end to restrictive trade practices.  The equivalent provision in the Restrictive Practices Act has been availed of to include a provision in a number of restrictive practices orders to prohibit discrimination between persons in similar circumstances, for instance, discrimination by suppliers or wholesalers against individual retailers.  It is important to stress the phrase in subsection (1) (c) which Senator Robinson wishes removed; &ldquo;equitable treatment of all persons&rdquo;. The Minister is confined to that objective in making any such order and I do not think that is an objective anybody in the House would object to.  For example, the Restrictive Practices (Motor Spirit and Motor Vehicle Lubricating Oil) Order, 1981, provides that a wholesaler shall not differentiate between retailers either directly or indirectly, in relation to the terms and conditions subject to which he supplies motor vehicle lubricating oil or light quality grid or quantity whether on a single occasion or on a number of occasions during a specfied period.</P>
    <P>It is important to reassure Senator Robinson and Senator Ryan in regard to the powers of the Minister under section 8.  As I said, it is not envisaged that there would be frequent use of the powers but it is considered desirable that the Minister should have the powers as the present position is unduly restrictive, rendering speedy action when the need arises virtually impossible.  For example, the average time taken at the moment for an <Col N="2745" /> inquiry by the Restrictive Practices Commission is between one and two years and, hopefully, the enactment of this Bill will help to increase the efficiency of the operations of the commission.  It must also be recognised that an inquiry is, of its very nature, a very slow process involving extensive consultation.  It is important, therefore, that the Minister should have power to take swift, effective action in urgent cases.  That is what this section is designed to do.  I see the worry that both Senators have, but in view of what I am saying to the House there should be some substantial element of reassurance that this section is only to be used in urgent cases and the order which the Minister makes must be confirmed by both Houses of the Oireachtas before it can take effect.  I regard that as a safeguard.</P>

      <P>On a point of information, take the case of two retailers within a radius of 20 miles of each other to whom a wholesaler has made overtures to sell and then one retailer, who may have a large output of goods, puts pressure on the wholesaler who then stops selling goods to the smaller retailer. Would the Minister be able to stop that practice?  I know of one example of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I follow the Senator's point.  The new Fair Trade Commission could on their own initiative investigate that matter urgently.  Whether the particular Minister would regard it as of such urgency as to require his intervention is probably doubtful.  It would obviously have to be urgent and of extreme national importance and for the common good.  I doubt that a Minister will see that as an example of an urgent case in which he would get involved.  It certainly would be an obvious case for the Fair Trade Commission to have a look at, and quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not for one second suggesting there are any sinister intents behind the Bill as drafted.  However, the Minister will have to accept that the intention of a Minister in introducing a Bill and what subsequently happens can <Col N="2746" /> have a great chasm between then, particularly as the years go by.  It is true that a similar section is contained in the Principal Act, but in the Principal Act the Minister can only act upon the advice of the Fair Trade Commission.  The Minister made the point that section 8 is designed to speed up the making of orders.  In the Principal Act the Minister could make orders of the kind referred to in paragraph (c) only after he had a report from the Fair Trade Commission. He has now taken onto himself the capacity to make such orders without any formal report of that nature.  Given that there is now no more basis than the information available to the Minister through his own Department and anticipating expedient use of this measure, obviously not by this Minister, and given that orders of this nature are not exactly scrutinised in the detail in which perhaps they should be by either House of the Oireachtas, a section like this legitimately raises some concerns about how it might be used, not in the next month but in the next 20 years. Orders could pass through that Members of the Oireachtas would not even notice. Therefore, there has to be a very specific case for the way these are made.  I am not entirely convinced.</P>

Much legislation has powers given to Ministers regarding which, to an extent, one depends on the subsequent inspection of the Dáil and Seanad.  All I can say to the Senator in this case is, first of all, that the Minister must consult with the commission, with the director and with any other Minister concerned.  There are three sets of consultations that the Minister must engage in before he or she sets out to make an order.  That is the first safeguard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second safeguard is that, having made the order, the order does not come into effect unless it is confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas.  I see Senator Ryan's point but if a Minister must consult with the commission, the director and other <Col N="2747" /> Ministers under this legislation and then must await confirmation by the Oireachtas of the order which he or she signs, that is a fair check and balance in the system.  I do not think the Senator should worry unduly about it, considering those assurances which I have given him here today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point raised by Senator Reynolds, is the Minister saying that a wholesaler will still be at liberty to determine who in a town will sell his products or the products that he is dispatching to retailers?  In other words, can he withdraw a product from a certain street, or trader in a street, if he is put under pressure from another retailer in the town?  Even with all the legislation proposed in this measure, will a wholesaler still have the power to do that?  As it is at the moment, a wholesaler or a producer can determine who in a town will sell his product and it has even happened that a product was withdrawn from a shop or from a retail outlet on pressure from a greater retail outlet that wanted to have the monopoly in that town.  Is the Minister saying that that will still be the practice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the example given, the general rule would apply, that is, that any aspect of trade must be reasonable and justifiable and in any case where those conditions do not apply the normal procedure would be that an inquiry would be held by the Fair Trade Commission and as a result of that an order made. That would be the normal case.  The first step in the example the Senator has given would be for the commission to be of the view that what was going on between retailers and wholesaler was not in some way reasonable or justifiable but if they were found not to be, then an order could be made.  That would be the normal procedure. If, on the other hand, under section 8 of this Bill the Minister regarded that particular example as urgent &mdash; although as I said earlier I doubt that a Minister would regard that particular example as one of urgency &mdash; he would, <Col N="2748" /> first of all, have to consult with the commission, the director and other Ministers and having done that could then issue an order if it was to ensure the equitable treatment of all persons; that would have to be the objective.  He could then issue the order and that order could not take effect until it was confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas.  That is the position.  In the example given, it would depend on the decision by the commission in the first instance, or on the particular Minister whether he or she regarded it as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>So pressure from a monopoly or a retail trader in a town resulting in the withdrawing of a supply from a smaller trader would be regarded by the Minister as reasonable?  It sounds extraordinary that it is again the big fellow crushing the small man.</P>

      <P>What I am debating here are the procedures we are setting up to tackle those kinds of difficulties.  We are not debating the difficulties, as it were.  The procedure is clear that if there is some type of unreasonable and unjustifiable practice going on &mdash; like the one the Senator describes, which seems to be an unreasonable and unjustifiable practice &mdash; there is no reason why the Fair Trade Commission cannot investigate that and as a result have an order made to stop the particular practice.  The practice described, <i>prima facie</i>, seems unreasonable and unjustifiable and as such could be tackled by this procedure.</P>

      <P>I regret that I was not in the House to move the amendment and I am grateful to Senator Ryan for moving it on my behalf.  I had not appreciated that Committee Stage was being taken at this time but I am aware from Senator Ryan what the Minister has said in response to the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to remove from the section what appears to be a very broad provision.  I am aware that the Principal Act contained very broad powers of this nature but when we are drafting legislation and empowering <Col N="2749" /> Ministers to make provisions we should if at all possible have precision and defined limits on what the Minister's powers are. When I raised this on Second Stage I asked the Minister to seek to put a limit on the powers he would have under section 8 (1) (c).  He appeared to be of the view that it was couched in very broad terms.  I would like the Minister, in further response on this amendment, to identify specific areas where he would consider it necessary to have these powers.  I find it difficult to believe that it is either appropriate or good legislating to grant very broad and open-ended powers of this kind to the Minister.  It is very difficult to see what limits can be put on the Minister's consideration of what might be necessary to ensure the equitable treatment of all persons.  What does that mean and what are the concrete examples of where it would be required for the purposes of the good orders in relation to restrictive practices?</P>
    <P>When I raised this on Second Stage I took into account the fact that orders under the section require to be confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas but as the Minister is well aware those confirming orders do not get a full parliamentary debate.  The Minister will be aware also that when an Act to confirm orders made under restrictive practices legislation are brought before either House of the Oireachtas they generally go through on the nod and without any full debate. Quite often the text of the order is not before Members of the House but of course they can get access to it.  In primary legislation and in an amending Act like this we should try to ensure that no unnecessary powers are taken or that powers are not framed in a manner that is unnecessarily wide.  I would ask the Minister to illustrate further why he feels it necessary to have such broad powers because I am not happy with the wording of the section as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I value Senator Robinson's comments.  As I explained earlier one of the best examples I could give would be the Restrictive Practices <Col N="2750" /> (Motor Spirit and Motor Vehicle Lubricating Oil) Order, 1981.  That order provided that: &ldquo;A wholesaler shall not differentiate between retailers either directly or indirectly in relation to the terms or conditions subject to which he supplies motor vehicle lubricating oil of light quality, grade or quantity whether on a single occasion or on a number of occasions during a specified period to them&rdquo;.  That is an example of where a Minister in the future might use section 8 (1) (c).</P>
      <P>While I understand Senator Robinson's worry about the apparent width of section 8 (1) (c), the fact that the order has to be placed before the Dáil and Seanad and may be confirmed by the House should be a safeguard.  If anything needs revision perhaps it is the way we deal with those orders because if we are putting orders made by Ministers, which is right throughout our legislation, before the House in a routine manner without looking at them properly, a bigger job which has to be done is to find a procedure for investigating and debating those orders.  That is the real solution, not undoing the order system which has been put in place to deal with the urgency situations in many cases.  That is a safeguard. Both Houses should have a close look at how we deal with those orders when they come to the Houses.</P>
      <P>The other safeguard is the one which insists that the Minister has consultation with the commission, the director and any other Minister concerned before making a particular order.  That safeguard before he or she makes the order, the order having to go to the Houses after it is made and the example I have given of the type of area in which the Minister might move is adequate safeguard.</P>
      <P>Section 8 (1) (c) states: &ldquo;makes such provision as the Minister thinks necessary to ensure the equitable treatment of all persons in regard to the supply or distribution of goods&rdquo;.  This confines the Minister to moving in areas where the objective is to ensure equitable treatment of all persons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The equitable treatment of all persons is a noble objective. An example of that is the Restrictive Practices Commission Report of Review of Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1981, in which there is the following provision:</P>
      <P>A supplier or wholesaler shall not withhold grocery goods from any person or discriminate against any person as to the terms on which such goods are supplied because that person is or is not a member of a trade association or is not approved of by a trade association or because that person's name appears or does not appear on any list prepared, maintained, published or issued by a trade association or because representations that supplies should be withheld from such person or be made available to him only on specified terms have been made by or on behalf of any trade association.</P>
      <P>That is an area of equitable treatment of all persons which section 8 (1) (c) seeks to maintain in the legislation.  That is a very good example of where it has been used in the past and the question of equitable treatment of all persons comes out in that section.  Without section 8 (1) (c) it is possible that that type of action may not be taken rapidly.</P>
      <P>I see Senator Robinson's worries but there are enough safeguards there to get around them.  The overriding necessity for a Minister to be able to take urgent executive action is what we need considering the amount of time it takes to get one of these inquiries up and running. I should like to reassure the Senator that there are no motives behind this legislation other than those of speed and urgency.  The safeguards of prior consultation and of them putting an order to the House would alleviate the difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his explanation and in particular for his reference to the second example.  The <Col N="2752" /> first example appeared to fall more under section 8 (1) (d) than (c) but the second example given by the Minister does seem to fall more squarely within the requirements to ensure the equitable treatment of all persons.  That may be a noble aspiration but it is also a very broad one and that is what concerns me.  I agree with the point made by the Minister in reply to the issues raised in this amendment that the Houses of the Oireachtas, in relation to these orders, ought to have more regard to the subject matter of the orders and devise a more effective method of scrutinising and examining them.  In my experience that has not happened. Looking back on debates, they do not tend to be ones on which any substantive issues are raised and they go through virtually on the nod.  Irrespective of whether there should be a special committee to which orders of this kind can be referred and which builds up an expertise, there needs to be more effective parliamentary control but I thank the Minister for his full recognition and in the circumstances I do not propose to press the amendment.</P>

      <P>Getting back to the retailer-wholesaler business, I am a retailer and I was dealing with a wholesaler who decided that he would not supply me with any more goods.  I contacted him about this and after some time he decided that he would take my orders, but when I ordered goods he did not have them in stock although they were the most popular goods that I could sell.  This wholesaler never had these popular goods in stock; it was a reputable firm and if that was the case, it would have gone into liquidation.  This is something that should be examined.  As a retailer, I find it difficult to stock these goods and it takes away from my business.</P>

The extract which I read out for Senator Robinson, for example, is from a Restrictive Practices Grocery <Col N="2753" /> Order.  There are a number of orders in place already.  What we are doing is putting in place the structure which will permit anybody who wishes to complain to the old Restrictive Practice Commission or the new Fair Trade Commission. This body can look at exactly the type of case the Senator is talking about.  I hope with this new machinery we can very speedily bring about a situation where an order is made, if the matter is of such urgency or requires the equitable treatment of all persons.  The Minister can move quickly on it.  There are dozens of examples that members of the House can give in this area.  My answer to all of them has to be that the Fair Trade Commission is there to investigate allegations of restrictive practices in areas where there may not be fair play or where there may not be reasonable and justifiable practices operating.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 4 to section 8 deals with orders relating to restrictive practices.  Under section 8 of the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, the Minister, having considered a report of an inquiry by the Restrictive Practices Commission, may make a Restrictive Practices Order.  Contravention of any such order is an offence under section 20 of the 1972 Act.  It is proposed under section 8 of the Bill to give the Minister <Col N="2754" /> power to make an order subject to consultation with the commission, the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade and any other Minister concerned, without an inquiry first having been carried out by the commission.  The Bill does not, however, create an offence for contravention of an order so made and the purpose of the proposed amendment is to create such an offence and to apply the relevant provisions of the 1972 Act to orders made under the Bill.  The purpose of this is to create an offence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The exclusion on services is being removed.  Under section 1 (1) (a) of the Restrictive Practices Act of 1972, any service provided under a contract of employment is excluded from the definition of service for the purposes of the Act, and thus from the scope of the restrictive practices legislation.  It is proposed under section 3 of the Second Schedule of the Bill to remove that exclusion and to bring such services within the framework of the 1972 Act.  In view of the responsibility of the Minister for Labour in the area of employment, it is considered appropriate that his consent should be sought before any regulatory activity may be undertaken under the Restrictive Practices Act in relation to a service provided under a contract of employment.  Section 9 provides therefore that before a service provided under a contract of employment can be the subject of a fair practices rule, an inquiry or an investigation, the Minister must give his written approval and this approval may only be given with the consent of the Minister for Labour.

      <P>I am concerned that the Fair Trade Commission would have to receive a complaint either from their own inspector or from a representative trade association before making a rule or a law under the restrictive practices code. In other words, if a trader in a town who is not a member of an association has a complaint, where does he go with it?  He is restricted and limited in what he can do about it.  The Fair Trade Commission will not listen to an individual and they should listen to an individual.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reassure the Senator that the Fair Trade Commission will listen to an individual. Section 10 is purely an amendment to section 4 of the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972.  Under section 4 (1) of the 1972 Act, the commission are empowered to publish fair trade rules in relation to the supply and distribution of goods or the <Col N="2757" /> provision of services.  They can do this only on the recommendation of the examiner or at the request of a representative association.  The proposed amendment will allow the Fair Trade Commission to publish such rules on their own initiative.  That is the purpose of section 10.  They can do this on their own initiative as well as under the existing circumstances.  The provision is in line with the general plan to strengthen the powers of the commission.  We are referring here to the publication of the fair trade rules, not to the power or an individual to deal with the Fair Trade Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to seek clarification on the scope of this amendment. It is quite an important amendment to enable the Fair Trade Commission to make these fair practice rules on their own initiative.  I invite the Minister to comment on that, in particular in relation to the provision of services. For example, does this mean that, if the Fair Trade Commission wish to draw up fair practices rules in relation to the provision of legal services, they could draw up such rules on their own initiative?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The present position is that the Commission have to wait for the director or the Minister before they can move.  The purpose of this is to shorten that chain.  If we have a Fair Trade Commission they must be allowed to do the job on their own initiative rather than having to wait to hear from the Minister or from the director. It is in line with the general thrust of this Bill which is to strengthen the powers of the commission.  It would not make sense not to allow them to act on their own initiative if we are setting out to give them more powers to move more quickly.  The thinking behind this legislation is to speed up what is an excruciatingly slow procedure. As I said earlier, it can take up to two years for some investigations to be completed.  This is an attempt to speed up the procedure and allow the commission to act on their own initiative.  It <Col N="2758" /> is in line with the general theme of the Bill that they should be able to act quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quarrelling with the giving of this power to the Fair Trade Commission but it is quite a significant new power to act on their own initiative in this regard.  If the Fair Trade Commission, as they can only do at present, are acting on a recommendation of the examiner, that is because the examiner has examined the situation and has so reported.  If they are doing so at the request of a representative association, there has been some sort of complaint and the representative association have asked that the commission come forward with these fair practice rules.  Could the Minister indicate what the basis would be for the Fair Trade Commission deciding, when they were doing so of their own initiative, to bring in fair practice rules? It is a much broader power that they do not have to wait for the recommendation from the examiner or a request from a representative association.</P>
      <P>To look at this in a concrete rather than in an abstract situation, if we look at the provision of legal services, does this mean that the Fair Trade Commission can issue a fair practice rule that the two senior rule in the courts would not apply on their own initiative?  What are the limits on the initiative of the Fair Trade Commission under this section?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Senator to section 4 (2) of the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, to which I referred earlier:</P>
      <P>Before making fair practice rules the Commission shall cause to be published in such manner as they think fit notice of their intention to do so and shall give to any person desiring to make representations in relation to the making of the proposed rules an opportunity to do so, and the notice shall specify the time and manner in which any representations may be made.</P>
      <P>I cannot see the commission acting in any peremptory fashion.  It is clear from section 4 (2) that they must cause notices to be published and take representations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2759" /> Acting on their own initiative is obviously a safeguard and acts as a parameter on how peremptorily the commission may decide to act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly this is a safeguard in that the commission would have to proceed in that manner.  I am more interested to see whether there is any substantive limit to the commission acting on their initiative in this regard. By and large it is an amendment which strengthens the powers of the Fair Trade Commission and that is desirable.  There are safeguards of notice and consultation before fair trade rules will be drawn up but at the same time it represents a significant development particularly because it includes not just the supply and distribution of goods but also the provision of services in a broad context.</P>
      <P>The main significance of the amendment is to empower the commission to take an initiative.  It is that broadening of the powers which is of particular importance. Could the Minister give some indication of what might be the basis on which the commission might seek to exercise that initiative?  I would welcome also clarification by the Minister of the status of such fair practice rules, particularly in relation to, for example, the provision of services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will be well aware that the fair practice rules are voluntary and are not enforceable.  That would be at a later stage where an order may or may not be made.  They are a voluntary agreement in a particular practice, profession or trade.  Being voluntary and without being able to enforce them at that stage, the safeguard is already there about having to have prior publication and taking representations.  I am reasonably satisfied that that will cover it considering this is a voluntary set of rules in any case.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 8, lines 19 to 36, to delete subsection (4) and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(4) Any person of whom a requirement has been made under subsection (2) may apply to the High <Col N="2761" /> Court for judicial review of the decision of the Commission.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The amendment has been tabled really to see whether it is possible to simplify the procedure envisaged in section 14 (4). I realise that this is an amending section inserting subsections into section 12 of the Principal Act and to some extent the subsections being inserted are caught by the fairly elaborate provisions of section 12.  It is a little bit worrying that the commission have been given power to require a person to produce a document and then the person who refuses is being given certain protection, but the protection is so elaborate as to call into question whether we can simplify it.  A person may appeal to the High Court for a declaration under the section and under section 14 (4) (c) of the High Court having heard such evidence as may be adduced &mdash; so presumably you have got an appeal for a declaration, you have oral evidence possibly and, therefore, an expensive and elaborate High Court hearing and any representations that may be made by the commission.  The High Court may at its discretion declare that the exigencies of the common good do not warrant the exercise by the commission of the powers conferred on them. If that is so, it seems to me to be very close to the normal application for judicial review that a body has acted <i>ultra vires</i> and without the requirements necessary for it to act properly.  If that were so, it should be possible to allow a person to apply for a judicial review.  If that were so, it would not be necessary even to have the amendment which I tabled so that there can be a focus for the discussion of this.  A person does not require a statutory provision in order to be able to apply for a judicial review.  The purpose of tabling the amendment was to ascertain from the Minister whether it really is necessary to have the rather elaborate provision contained now in the proposed new subsection (4) (c) which is to be inserted in section 12 of the Principal Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that when <Col N="2762" /> tangling with Senator Robinson in this regard one is tangling with a very experienced person in this area.  I have to say to the House that the procedure we have adopted in the Bill is based on the advice available to us from the Attorney General's office as being the quickest, cleanest method of handling the situation.</P>
      <P>Senator Robinson has suggested another route, the route of judicial review of the decision of the commission. One worry I have about Senator Robinson's amendment is the word &ldquo;decision&rdquo; itself.  I presume that applies to the decision to seek further documentation as opposed to the decision of the commission in the first instance, or a decision on the substantive part of it.  If one were to look at that amendment I think that particular word might be inappropriate and might have to be looked at very carefully.</P>
      <P>I want to say to Senator Robinson that the primary purpose of subsection (4) which she seeks to alter to a judicial review, is to entitle the person of whom a requirement has been made by the commission to produce documents or to supply information to apply to the High Court for a declaration that the commission's request is unwarranted.  Paragraph (c) of the subsection is also designed to give more guidance to the court as to the basis on which a declaration may be granted.  Similar powers are already conferred on authorised officers of the examiner by section 15 of the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972.  The amendment proposed by the Senator appears to take away a lot of the certainty which is at present contained in section 14 (4) of the Bill.  First, we specify there that a declaration is the appropriate remedy as distinct from any other form of judicial review.  That is certainly the advice available to Government from the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, we make it clear that, even if a person refuses information and may thus be liable to an offence, he or she still has a right to seek a declaration that the action of the commission is not warranted. Finally, we give some guidance to the court in this section as to the basis <Col N="2763" /> for any declaration which they may make.  That is just a general comment on Senator Robinson's amendment.  The provision which already exists in the 1972 Act was contested &mdash; as the Senator would know better than I, indeed &mdash; in the case of Abbey Films <i>v.</i> Ireland and the Attorney General 1979 and was upheld by the Supreme Court.  One could have a long legal debate on which route is better.  Obviously I have to rely on the advice available to me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I reassure the Minister that we will not have a long legal debate. I do not think this amendment warrants that, particularly because of the change made last October in the rules of the superior courts in relation to judicial review.  It seems as though this fits within the current rules because part of the relief that can be obtained is by the declaratory action.  It is accessible because it is possible to go by way of statement of the claim in effect under the rules and affidavit and then there could be cross-examination on the affidavit.  It can come very quickly before the court.</P>
      <P>I fully accept that subsection (4) is being inserted here as a protection to a person.  It seems to me that the nature of the protection is so elaborate that it may defeat the objective.  The classic circumstances of looking for judicial review in a case like this is that a body has acted in a manner that is unwarranted, to use the Minister's words, has acted <i>ultra vires</i> and in a manner that is not warranted by the powers that it has.  I will not press the point but it seems to me that, if a person were faced at the moment with the alternative of going under subsection (4) or simply applying for a judicial review, he might well feel that it was both a speedier and more effective remedy to go by way of judicial review.</P>

      <P>The section as it is drafted puts us in a position where one does not have to establish one's right to go for a declaration.  That right is in the section.  I understand that in the judicial review procedure one has to establish <Col N="2764" /> one's right, as it were, to pursue a declaration.</P>

      <P>A point which arises on section 15 also arises more generally on other sections which we will be looking at but I would like to raise it at this stage. I raised it on Second Stage and I would welcome a response from the Minister. There is no doubt that in the amendments which we are making to the restrictive practices code, the role and office of the director assume considerable importance. The director's powers, duties and functions under the Bill are very extensive. I would be concerned that the director would be equipped through proper provision for staffing and the necessary follow through of capability, to discharge the increase in functions which undoubtedly he will obtain under this Bill.  Perhaps the Minister will outline the current staffing provisions in the office of the director and whether he envisages those facilities being substantially enlarged in line with the new powers of that office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1983, and there <Col N="2765" /> is an increased allocation, and I will have that figure for the Senator in a moment. Section 15 amends section 14 of the 1972 Act and incorporates into that section 14 certain provisions of section 16 of the 1972 Act which is being repealed.  Section 14 of the 1972 Act provides for the carrying out of investigations by the director either on his own initiative or at the request of the Minister.  Under the proposed new subsection (1) of section 15 such a request may also be made to the director by the commission, and the director, as the Senator knows, must comply.  Subsection (2) is the same as section 14 of the 1972 Act and provides for the investigation by the director of any aspect of the operation of fair practice rules.  Subsection (3) provides that where the director has carried out an investigation at the request of the Minister or the commission, he must furnish a report of the investigation to the Minister or the commission as may be appropriate. The purpose of the subsection is to enable the Minister and the commission to establish certain facts or background information on a particular subject before deciding to exercise their own statutory function.</P>
      <P>The purpose of subsection (4) of this section is to make it clear that the director should be free to furnish to the Minister or the commission a copy of a report of any investigation carried out by him whether the request for an investigation came from either source or not.  The existing provisions relating to the furnishing of reports by the director are being repealed.</P>
      <P>That is a general comment on section 15, considering that we are now discussing it.  Referring to the Senator's question in regard to funding of the director's office, the outturn for 1986 was £192,000 and the estimate for 1987 is £321,000.  As I said, the staff is up from nine in 1983 to 19 now.  Therefore, I am satisfied that the director will have the resources available to him to carry out his duties properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">

I would be grateful, therefore, if the Minister would respond to one point which I would have made had I been here earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to banking services the Minister will be aware that there was an important order which appears to have lapsed under the Consumer Information Consumer Credit Order, 1987, in relation to requiring banks to provide the annual percentage rate of charge.  As I understand it, this order did not come into effect because it was not laid for a sufficient number of sitting days, but I think it has been regarded by many people as an important protection in relation to the supply or provision of credit facilities. Will it be possible under the new amendment which the Minister is proposing to bring banking services, at least in part, <Col N="2768" /> under the restrictive practices legislation, to provide for the APC order, or does he intend to reintroduce it?  That is a most significant protection for persons who are seeking to avail of credit facilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a copy of the draft order which was proposed to be made, and certainly that is made under the Consumer Information Act.  It is entitled &ldquo;Consumer Information Consumer Credit Order, 1987&rdquo; which did not come into effect because it was not laid before the Houses for a sufficient number of days and would have to be retabled now.  The protection afforded by requiring those providing credit facilities to provide an annual percentage rate of charge so that persons would know more fully what rate of charge they were incurring and so that they could compare different rates between different banks &mdash; at the moment it is very difficult for a consumer to compare rates &mdash; was regarded as a very important form of protection.  If the Minister is of the view that it has to be a power exercised under the Consumer Information Act, does he intend to reintroduce that APC order?  It would be very much in tandem with extending the powers of the commission into banking services and would be a very important protection.</P>

      <P>The position is that the Seanad approved the draft consumer credit order on 18 June and that Dáil approval is awaited.  A draft consumer information consumer credit order will require advertisements which show a cost for credit to give the true cost of that credit by means of the annual percentage rate of charge.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce informed the Dáil of that matter on 25 June 1987 and pointed out that Dáil approval was awaited for that order.  That is the position as I understand it.</P>

The <Col N="2772" /> motion has been bedevilled by surrounding activity and I look forward to getting down to the meat of it as opposed to the distractions that surrounded the commencement of Second Stage of the debate of the Bill we have been dealing with.</P>
      <P>I was here for most of the debate on this motion last week and in particular for the Minister's speech which was bland, which contained a great deal of waffle and, as subsequent speakers said, which had a hidden agenda and was more important for what it omitted than for what it said.  I was very struck by a cartoon by Martin Turner, in <i>The Irish Times</i> on the following morning.  He is adept at these things and in that delightful cartoon he depicted what he called the Fianna Fáil 22 letter alphabet.  There were photographs of the sort of alphabet signs one sees in a classroom.  &ldquo;The cat sat on the floorboards&rdquo;, it said, and then it went on to say: &ldquo;an apple for .93 of a teacher&rdquo; and the missing letters from the alphabet added up to the word &ldquo;cash&rdquo; and, of course, that is really what this motion is all about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The education cuts have been completely overshadowed by the furore caused by the health cuts and have not yet really sunk in.  But come September and indeed, October when the third level colleges come back, the full brunt and the full significance of these cuts will be felt very speedily by third level students and indeed members of staff.  This is another confidence trick that has been perpetrated against the Irish public by the present Administration.  Before the election, education cutbacks, as proposed by the outgoing Government and which were part of the Fine Gael election programme, were referred to by the Fianna Fáil leader, on a radio broadcast on the Sunday prior to the election, as counter-productive.  Now a further £11 million worth of cuts has been imposed on the education budget by the Fianna Fáil Party now in Government and there is no talk of counter-productivity at this stage.  The effect is a swingeing one.  There will be huge cuts in the pay and non-pay bills of RTCs, Dublin colleges and the <Col N="2773" /> universities, the fastest growing sector of education where the ratios are already very poor indeed.  Never was there such a demand for third level education.  All the demographic studies which have been scientifically conducted indicate that demand will rise for third level places and will rise inexorably until 1995.</P>
    <P>To take £3,100,000 from the RTCs and £2.65 million from the universities amounts to the most devastating attack on third level education ever known in the history of the State.  Somehow or other &mdash; apart from the education interests &mdash; the full effect of this has not quite sunk in yet but, as I said, it will, come September and October.  Already university students and young people are beginning to be concerned as to the number of training places that will be available in third level institutions when the term reopens in October.  My heart goes out to these young people because already they have to listen to dirges of hopelessness concerning the lack of employment.  Are they to be subjected to a further pressure from these cuts which will, when they are implemented, probably deny them chances in the education system?  It is a further hurt and a further injury to the young people whom as many politicians glibly speak about as being our greatest resource.</P>
    <P>We need more than lip service towards our young people.  If successive Governments, particularly Governments who denied that there ever was a problem, have mortgaged their future, will we deny them an opportunity of education so that they will be able to gain employment, if not in this country, at least elsewhere.  It is important that we make people skilled, self-sufficient and confident.  The only way to do that is to give them skills and the tools which will educate them and enable them to stand on their own two feet.</P>
    <P>The Minister evaded spelling out the reality of all this.  In volume terms, the cut of 4 per cent by 1988 in the gross pay of the staff of all third level institutions will have disastrous consequences for the development of this fastest growing sector.  Allowing for the normal <Col N="2774" /> incremental progression of third level staff and the full effects in 1988 of the present national wage agreement, it is clear that staff cuts of 6 per cent or perhaps 7 per cent will be necessary from next September or October if the institutions are to achieve the Government's targets.  Student numbers are increasing by 4 to 5 per cent per annum.  Student numbers will possibly have to be seriously curtailed and staff made redundant and-or suffer a severe cut in salary.  The horizon is a gloomy one.</P>
    <P>It has been Government policy to provide degrees and diplomas and other specialised courses outside the university system and to increase their provision.  I want to devote the little time I have at my command to an analysis of what this will mean for the RTC sector.  This development of degrees and diplomas has been sound educational thinking and a significant opening up of third level education to many people who would otherwise never have attempted or even seen its relevance.  In times of financial stringency, such as we are now experiencing, the provision, for example, of relevant degree courses outside the university system has proved to be a most cost effective one.  The RTCs, in order to cope with increased demands for course places, have maximised their use of teaching resources.  As a result all fat was trimmed from the system almost seven years ago.  The RTCs have absolutely no room for manoeuvre.  In a new technological era it is of the utmost importance that as wide a variety of courses as possible be made available and nurtured in order that those skills in educational needs which are necessary for our survival exist and can be called upon as and when required.</P>
    <P>Waterford Regional Technical College, the one I know best, has provided and is providing for the needs of a region with approximately 400,000 people and has at all times been under-funded.  Since 1980, together and in partnership with the National Council for Educational Awards, it provides relevant degree programmes as well as a range of new diplomas, some of which also satisfy national <Col N="2775" /> demands.  From 1 January 1988, colleges have to implement what is in reality a 4 per cent pay cut.  They have horrendous choices to make.  They can reduce relevant pupil/teacher inputs, they can reduce courses, they can reduce course hours or they can reduce courses that are not fully self-financing.  The Minister seemed to target the self-financing side of courses.  She spoke about surveying all colleges and courses to see what was economic.  It is my firm view that self-financing courses must be encouraged and maintained.  Because of our frightening unemployment statistics we must, if adult education is relevant, offer updates in skills and in education in order to assist people towards a chance of employment.  We must, if we are serious, be prepared to subvent and underwrite these courses.  It is daft to insist that they be self-financing and purely self-financing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I originally did not intend to say anything on this Bill because I thought we would leave the motion to the principal speakers supporting it but anybody listening could hardly sit back and allow such a distortion of the facts. From the language used to describe the nature of the cutbacks and funding, one would think that concern was felt by only one or two people in the House.  I compliment the Minister for Education who is doing a courageous job.  When she took office the cupboard was bare, it was like the pub with no beer.  She is a courageous lady to have taken on that marathon task. Everybody here knows that all the funding was earmarked and politically committed. I recently said to somebody from my own county who was critical about house building that it was extraordinary that people could not be four months <Col N="2776" /> away from the heap until they were complaining about the smell.  One would think that we were living in two different worlds.</P>
      <P>I strongly support the Minister in regard to effective economies because she had no alternative.  The future of our young people is at stake.  If no economies were effected the young people about whom we are now talking, would have no future.  The Minister is the person concerned and is demonstrating in a crystal clear fashion that she has a duty to protect the future of our young people, which is what she is doing.</P>
      <P>There must be a revision of expenditure. I am on the management board of an RTC in Letterkenny and it was very interesting to look at the budget and to realise that there would be no difficulty in saving 10 per cent in areas other than teachers' pay.  One institution were using £19,000 worth of fuel oil but when economies had to be effected they were able to keep the heat at sufficient temperature for £9,000, thereby affecting a saving of £10,000.</P>
      <P>We must take into account the size of the Department of Education, the size of the institutions and the complexity of management.  Those who say there should be plenty of money to meet every situation are living in a different world.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education deserves our support.  I would like to acknowledge publicly that she is doing a courageous job.  She went into her Department and found that Department without funds. She looked for areas where economies could be effected because that was the only way she could find funds to support and to promote new programmes in education. The Minister is doing a useful job and has the confidence of the people. Even those people, the so-called deprived and those who are scaremongering, will admit that there is more confidence in the Department of Education today than there has been under any previous Administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have 3,363 students in the Donegal vocational education system.  The Donegal Vocational Education Committee <Col N="2777" /> had a total budget of £938,841.  We looked at a few areas where economies could be made and found that we could effect £150,155 worth of economies.  I do not claim any credit for that; nor am I looking for any bouquets.  We were only doing what we and every section of administration should be doing to survive.  My vocational education committee were able to effect economies of £44,876 in teacher travelling expenses.  You would not need to be a university graduate to establish that some of these people are very reluctant to lose that untaxed income.  That would be a factor in their concern, because nobody likes to lose that kind of income.  Nevertheless, under the previous Administration we were allowed to appoint teachers and to share teachers in different centres with the result that we did not know where we stood.  We had teachers in two centres, in two schools, 25, 30 or 40 miles apart, and we were pumping money into travelling expenses.  Anybody who comes into this House and says there is no need for a review of that situation, shows he is not in touch with reality.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, was very actively involved as a member of a local authority. She served her time on the management board of the RTC in Athlone and has a practical knowledge of how to effect economies.  She is going about her job in a practical way.  I stand in support of and in total admiration for the Minister.  Her administration is a great change and improvement on that of the previous Minister for Education.  We were forced to sack a teacher in Ballyshannon for misconduct over a long period.  Having gone through the normal channels of communication with the TUI, my vocational education committee finally decided to sack the teacher.  At a TUI conference, the previous Minister for Education was lobbied to reinstate that teacher, in spite of a unanimous decision taken by the Donegal Vocational Education Committee.  The Minister reinstated that sacked teacher but I am proud of my vocational education committee who took the Minister to the High <Col N="2778" /> Court and succeeded in having that teacher dismissed.  The previous Minister for Education had been actively involved in a local authority, in local administration, in a vocational committee or in a management board, she never would have gone over the heads of the vocational education committee and reinstated a dismissed employee.  I raise that case in contrast to what Fine Gael Senators said from the Opposition benches today and the stand they took under the previous Administration. Whether this motion is passed or another motion is put down, the people will not be fooled.  People are aware that resources are scarce.  The Minister for Education is doing Trojan work and has the confidence of the majority of the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will confine myself to the allocated time.  Our main speaker Senator Brian O'Shea, is preparing for another motion and is not here at the moment.  I support the motion although, in my opinion, it is not broad enough because it is confined to two areas of the educational budget &mdash; the RTCs and universities.  Unfortunately I will have to confine my comments to the motion.  I reject out of hand the amendment in the names of the Fianna Fáil Senators representing the Government point of view because last year when we were discussing education, there was a great outcry from Fianna Fáil for additional expenditure, ignoring completely the words used in this amendment.  How can this group have such a radical change of heart within a couple of months?  What educational changes have taken place in the meantime?  I fail to understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I bow to the views expressed by Senator McGowan because he believes what he says.  He was not here last year and was not a party to what went on over an extended period, which created a lot of unrest in schools, among teachers and parent groups about how the Government were approaching an arbitration award.  We would have dearly loved to be able to pay that award in full.  I want to put it on the record tonight that, in my <Col N="2779" /> opinion, that debt has still to be paid whenever the State's finances can meet it.  In the discussions on postponing the payment of that award I listened to many comments from Fianna Fáil which contradicted everything said by them and by the Minister last week.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister is not present at the moment.  It is not her fault because we changed the time for taking this motion from 6.30 p.m. to 6 p.m.  As I said, I am sorry she is not present because reading her speech in the Official Report would lead one to believe we were talking about two different problems.  If one were to believe everything that was said last week one would believe there were no cutbacks and no problems in the area of education, in the student-teacher ratio, in the building programme for RTC colleges and so on.</P>
    <P>This is what we were led to believe and the Minister in her own special way admonished everybody this side of the House and waved her hand, saying &ldquo;This is my speech and I believe it and I am going to say it&rdquo;.  Senator Murphy was prompted into responding &ldquo;Well, obviously we are all misled so there is nothing at all wrong.&rdquo; All the experts in this House engaged in the whole process of education at third level particularly &mdash; that is what this motion deals with &mdash; and all the people dealing with education and the process of education at that level are convinced that there are problems.  We would want to agree on some formula to arrive at the total truth of the implications of this year's budget <i>vis-á-vis</i> education irrespective of what the Minister says about the budget estimate or about the allocations not creating problems.</P>
    <P>From my experience &mdash; it is limited in this field and I want to be honest with the Minister in that, I am not an expert &mdash; listening to parents and teachers there are problems and there will be problems following this year's budget allocation.  I know that my own party have had to hold a press conference to bring to the notice of the public the fact that there are problems and will be problems in this year's educational Estimate.  There is no doubt <Col N="2780" /> that it will create problems in the delivery of what was and is considered by all of us to be one of the most important areas of social services &mdash; the delivery of education. There is no doubt that there will be unemployment created among temporary teachers because wholesale layoffs of temporary teachers will follow on the budget.  It is inevitable that teacher managements and group managements will be unable to live within the budget that is already announced.  We are waiting still to hear the intricate details from the Minister as to how these will effect any of the areas mentioned in the motion.</P>
    <P>The quality of third level education will be affected.  There is no doubt about it but if you reduce the student-teacher ratio &mdash; and all of us would have liked to see a continuing improvement in that area &mdash; third level education will suffer.  The essential building programme that has been disappointing, to say the least, and I want to be charitable to the Minister, is postponed.  She said last week, and I have to accept what she says, that there is a precess of review or recapping on the projects that were already approved by the previous Government and Opposition Deputies who are now Ministers.</P>
    <P>I specifically interjected last week to remind the Minister for the new RTC college which was approved by Government for Thurles to serve the County of Tipperary, north and south.  There was total agreement between the VECs in the South Riding and North Riding, and agreement of all the industrialists as to the need for third level education in County Tipperary.  That college has now been put on the long finger after eight years of discussions, negotiations and review by this Government, the last Government and the preceding Government. One of the now Ministers who comes from that constituency expressed the wildest concern last year when there was some hold-up in the actual acquisition of the site.  As a Minister, as part of a Government now, he is in agreement that the whole thing should be postponed, despite the fact that we have bought the site and have planning permission. We had gone down the road as <Col N="2781" /> far as the specification of accommodation. That project has the total support of all the interested people in County Tipperary and that includes Government representatives on the VEC committees. I am not being political; I am just being factual.  That is what the situation is like and for Senator McGowan, Senator Mullooly or the Minister to say that that does not create problems, is understating the case, to be charitable.  There is a responsibility on this Government to cease this stop-go manoeuvring in areas of the provision of third level institutions which have been approved and on which considerable public expenditure has already taken place.  That is unfair to the people and to students who had hoped to be able to be educated at that level within their own county and not to be forced to go to Waterford or Carlow and create demands on the services there that they are unable to deliver to their own pupils.</P>
    <P>It is not unfair to say in a motion that the budget Estimate will stop these programmes. It is stopping them and the Government have announced that they are stopping them.  Perhaps the Minister says one thing one day and something else another day.  But eventually there is no doubt that the highly qualified young people who are essential to the future development of this country will suffer &mdash; the numbers will suffer.  The economic consequences of that will have repercussions for this Government and for the future of the State.</P>
    <P>The amendment is unreasonable on the basis that it is not in line with the facts. It specifically talks about the percentage increase on the 1986 figures.  No account has been taken of increased costs in education and there are increased costs. There are increased salary costs and other such commitments that were given to teachers' organisations and teachers' unions by the Government.  God knows, they gave them even further consideration when they were in opposition; they promised the sun, moon and stars. The knew the promises could not be kept and now with a small fractional increase on last year's Estimate they state that <Col N="2782" /> there is an increase on the overall allocation. Of course, there is not.  There is a reduction in real terms if you take into account the problems that have arisen with the increased costs in areas over which this House and indeed the Minister at times have no control.  These are statutory demands.  The amendment is unreasonable.  The motion is not wide enough and I would have hoped that it would have covered the whole area of educational allocation from this Government.</P>

      <P>Naturally, I will be brief. Ten minutes is the allocated time and I would like to add my support to the amendment which has been put forward by our group.  Despite what the previous speaker has said, it is a realistic and truthful assessment of the situation and one that will lay the foundation for a better educational service for the future.  Both the motion and the amendment have in some way a common denominator; both are suggesting that there is a need for controlling public spending.  It is right and proper that we should all be of that mind and it should be spelt out that not just in the field of education are we saying that, but that in the area of health and other areas of Government there is a need to control public spending.  You cannot unfortunately, control public spending without having some form of rationalisation or some form of economy.  That is happening and will happen in education, too.  Every area of Government needs rationalisation.  In an era of cutback, education is no exception.  If cuts are to come, I cannot see why university lecturers and professors or RTC lecturers should be excluded.  Among health board employees, local authority employees, with companies like Waterford Glass and Guinness, right across the board, this situation must prevail.  Everybody should be prepared to play ball, not just in the area of teachers, professors or lecturers <Col N="2783" /> but in the running costs of the universities and RTCs.</P>
      <P>We cannot forget, in regard to RTCs and to the universities, that the State continues to fund in a very real way the fees and maintenance costs of so many of our students, students who have not the means, who are good students and who qualify on a four honour basis.  They are being funded in a very practical and a very large way by the Exchequer.  In my own county alone, Westmeath, for this year we have received almost 200 applications for higher education grants.  The numbers for RTCs will be equal if not more and that, when it is worked out, will involve a massive injection of fees and maintenance costs for students who want to attend the RTCs and universities.</P>
      <P>We should all be striving for economies. There would be very little unemployment if strict management in our schools, colleges and institutions were adhered to.  We should be looking for ways of creating economies in different areas.  I cannot help feeling that students at, say, university and RTCs, their teachers and management boards should be endeavouring to create a better environment for self-study and research with the obvious consequences of a lesser emphasis on instruction.  In large educational establishments great savings can be made also on duplication in various departments in the area of equipment and of computers.  That is a reasonable request that ought to be examined.  The teachers' unions should be alive and helping in this critical economic time.  They should recommend to their members that they cut back on field trips and overseas trips which seem to be a feature of life for teachers at RTCs and universities and which of course are costing the Exchequer a great deal of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Adult education was referred to in this debate last week.  I welcome the recent statement by the Minister.  I want to make it quite clear that my views so far as adult education is concerned have not changed in the last two, three or four years.  I have always felt that taxpayers should not have to pay for hobby and leisure type courses. <Col N="2784" /> In Westmeath VEC for example, over the years we have had courses such as &ldquo;how to play better golf&rdquo; and &ldquo;how to know your car engine better&rdquo;.  These type of courses are typical of the adult education courses that have been run during the past number of years.  Of course there was nothing wrong with them in what one might call the good days.  If there was a demand for a particular course it was put on.  In almost every case these courses were pursued by people with good jobs who could afford to pay for this facility. The courses should never be subsidised by the Irish taxpayer.  I have made this comment before.  On the other hand I would welcome an increase in funding for the literacy and community education. As we all know, this type of education is pursued in the main by people who are on low incomes, or who may be depending on social welfare and should not be part of the self-financing concept of adult education.</P>
    <P>The motion as it appears on the Order Paper almost suggests that the Department of Education have a role in propping up the building industry.  We all know what the Minister, when she came into office, discovered early on that whatever money might be available for the building of extensions and in particular, new schools in the primary sector for the year ahead was all committed as far back as January.  Another point worth mentioning is that it is a reality that student numbers in post-primary schools will fall by 15 per cent by 1991.  Obviously, the fall will continue.  The obvious question then is why build extra facilities if this is the case?  Is it right to continue with this attitude knowing that there will be a reduction in the number of students attending post-primary schools in the future?  It is right that the Minister and her Department should sit back and examine the position before we get involved in the spending of millions of pounds on buildings which in years to come might not be required.</P>
    <P>Third level institutions should look to the EC for funding for the new technology courses and equipment that is coming on stream.  Greater emphasis <Col N="2785" /> should be placed on incentives for entrepreneurial type courses in RTCs and universities so that employment could be increased.  More jobs could be created in the manufacturing sector if entrepreneurial skills became part and parcel of university and RTC courses.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Francis Fahey, to our debate and I congratulate the Minister for Education on her appointment.  I am very happy and proud that a colleague of mine from Athlone is Minister for Education.  Whatever the Opposition may say, the Minister, as a former teacher, as a past chairman of a board of management of an RTC and as a past member and chairman of the Westmeath VEC has a practical outlook in regard to education.  She is well equipped to deal with the very real problems that are now cropping up in the area of education.  She is taking courageous steps and decisions to ensure that education for the future is kept at as high a level as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure you, a Chathaoirligh, will not find it inappropriate if before I begin my speech I pay respect to the memory of a man who was a great educationist, an ecumenist and a tireless worker for peace and reconciliation on this island.  I refer to the former Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of all Ireland in the Church of Ireland tradition, the most Reverend Dr. John Armstrong, of whose death I learned with great sadness this morning.</P>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister on her appointment.  She has the qualities of sensitivity, caring and understanding of the teaching profession which are necessary for somebody discharging this onerous responsibility particularly at a time of financial stringency.  I am aware of the Minister's special qualifications both as a mother and as somebody with a distinguished background in teaching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge the financial difficulties in which the country finds itself but I believe that these are recognised and clearly stated in the motion put down in the name of the Independent Senators.  I <Col N="2786" /> feel strongly, however, that despite the fact that cuts are necessary in certain areas to put the country back once again into the advantageous position, financially speaking, that we all wish to see it in, those cuts must be made prudently and the Government, before embarking on a policy of cutbacks, must make clear the principles that decide such cuts in every area.</P>
    <P>I have spoken on the health cuts and on many areas in which the Government are currently retrenching but I have never opposed the policy of saving money. What I have tried to make clear in everything I have said is that it is important that the principles should be clearly decided on and clearly stated before such cuts are implemented if they are not to prejudice our future.  I am sure that this is the last thing that the Government, the Minister or the Minister of State intend. I am grateful to my colleagues in the university with whom I have consulted widely in the preparation of this speech. I have received help from a distinguished colleague, Dr. Vincent McBrierty and it is my intention to quote some figures which I believe to be unchallengeable. Universities have not indulged in the historic budgetary over-runs experienced in other sectors of public spending.  Furthermore, in Trinity College there has been sustained improvement in cost effectiveness in recent years through the deployment of staff into developing growth areas and in the increase in student numbers in college without any comparable increase in staff.  In other words, we know what productivity is all about, because, without receiving any productivity bonuses, we are implementing precisely this desirable aim.  Student numbers in Trinity have increased from 6,600 in 1981 to a current complement of 7,500 in 1986 which represents an increase of 14 per cent.  In the same period staff numbers have increased by only 3 per cent and that 3 per cent has been largely due to the assimilation of personnel associated with new activities such as physiotherapy which are being transferred to college.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to what Senator <Col N="2787" /> Fallon had to say about people improving their golfing and these marginal interests. Our universities have not taken on anything like that kind of responsibility.  We have confined ourselves to areas which have some very clear and definable social practical application.  Over a similar period to that to which I have referred, the State contribution to the college budget has fallen.  It fell from 81 per cent in 1981 to 64 per cent in 1986.  Income from student fees has doubled from 11 per cent to 22 per cent while contract research earnings have increased fivefold. The annual cost to the State to educate a student in TCD is only about 60 per cent of the comparability cost for a student attending one of the British universities.  I include in that a university such as Queens University, Belfast, which is not administered from Dublin but which is part of the general university context on this island.  It is clear from these incontestible figures that the Government, and the people, are making an appropriate investment.  They are getting very good value out of the third level institutions so there is very little fat to prune back.</P>
    <P>I would also like to express my shock and disappointment that the Minister's speech did not find room to refer to the University of Dublin, Trinity College, which I have the honour to represent. We heard a great deal about the Regional Technical College in Athlone, the NIHE, UCD, UCC and UCG which are all splendid institutions.  I know most of them.  I have lectured in many of them, but I find it astonishing that the University of Dublin, which is the oldest institution &mdash; I suppose it might be considered contentious of me to allege that it is the most prestigious third level institution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but it has a long distinguished tradition in which we all share. The people are proud of the institution I <Col N="2788" /> represent and consider it in a very special way to be a national institution.</P>
      <P>Further fee increases are not the right approach to meet the current difficulties. I hope I have demonstrated that the universities are good housekeepers.  It is vital to preserve the right of access for citizens to third level education.  I understood that we were a Republic, that we wished to cherish all the people of the nation equally.  I am distressed that in regard to the right of access to third level institutions of people &mdash; I deprecate these terms, but to use shorthand because I must keep my eye on the clock &mdash; I must call the working classes, they are being afforded less and less opportunity to attend the university which I, for example, have had the privilege of attending.  The universities when I was an undergraduate were very clearly places of social and intellectual privilege.  This had begun to change.  There was a clear commitment on the part of all Governments that access to third level education should be made as widely available as possible.  We are once again in a tragic situation where people drawn from the working class, the less socially advantaged areas, are dwindling instead of increasing in numbers and there is enormous pressure on university places. There were 14,000 valid course applications to Trinity College in the last year for 1,200 places.  That shows the pressure there is on the universities as a resource. Education was already heavily cut in the proposed Fine Gael budget.  Further cuts were introduced by the incoming Fianna Fáil Government.  These cuts were further entrenched by the announcement of an intention to cut staff numbers.  The Government want cuts of 1 per cent this year and 3 per cent next year, and what about 1988 when the really serious damage will be done?  As I understand it, universities have been instructed to reduce staff numbers by 3 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that the only way the Government will be convinced that they are getting good value is if they begin to see jobs disappearing.  That produces serious problems.  We are talking about cuts of about 9 per cent in staffing as I <Col N="2789" /> calculate it.  I understand also that replacements &mdash; the Minister confirmed this in her speech &mdash; are now only to be made with the approval of the Minister for Finance on the advice of the Minister for Education.  I can put this in perspective, as I am one of the people involved through the constitution of the university, in the appointment of the professor of Irish and I understand that the chair of Irish in Trinity College, Dublin, may be frozen, a chair founded in 1840, the oldest such chair in these islands.</P>
    <P>I turn to what I regard as the most important element in this debate, that is, the Dublin Dental Hospital.  I regard it as important from the point of view not just of the university but of the city of Dublin.  I regret that the Minister made no mention of the University of Dublin in her speech but I welcome the fact that she did not announce any cutback of funding for this highly important development which is essential for the wellbeing of university life in the capital city and essential to the provision of adequate health services for the largest concentration of population in the island. I am sure that this coyness of the Minister indicates tacit approval for this scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister is unquestionably aware that Trinity College is about to celebrate the 400th anniversary of its foundation. It would be unthinkable morally and politically for any Government to contemplate cancelling the first major capital programme for many decades in the University of Dublin, a programme approved by Government and budgeted for in budgets that had gone through both this Administration and the previous one. Three million pounds of public money has been spent on preparing the site.  I am sure there is no intention to jeopardise this.  In a previous speech I referred to the knock-on effect whereby the College of Pharmacy which has been incorporated in Trinity College has been pressed to increase the number of qualified graduates from its present level of 50 per year, which is the maximum it can do with this site in Ballsbridge, to 70 per year by the pharmaceutical professions, and it would be an extraordinarily absurd <Col N="2790" /> situation where the Government acknowledge that unemployment is one of the most serious problems confronting the State, if they were to turn their faces against this kind of clearly productive development.</P>
    <P>While I accept the necessity for what I have described as good housekeeping in educational terms, it is demonstrable that in terms of third level education generally, and particularly in terms of my own college, this requirement has been met, but there is also a necessity to maintain in third level institutions the capacity to innovate and to maintain the development of new subjects such as biotechnology and computing sciences.</P>

It clearly accepts, as we all accept &mdash; and I do not wish to be contentious with the Government party on this &mdash; that there is a necessity for retrenchment.  Having acknowledged that, it makes this point which I ask the Government to bear particularly in mind. The imposition of uniform recruitment policy across the whole public sector has resulted in some unfortunate distortions in the development of key technological support institutions in Ireland.  This refers particularly to the Dublin Dental Hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on the way in which she has handled the education situation. She is not afraid to go out and meet the teachers and the people to discuss with them and explain the serious situation that we are in financially.  Everybody says there is a need for better housekeeping but that it should not be taken from their table; it should be taken from somebody else's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion states that the cutbacks will create unemployment and forced <Col N="2791" /> emigration of highly qualified personnel. We have had free education for the past 20 years and it is time our professionals took a hard look to see what have they achieved after 20 years.  A lot of money was spent and many schools were build.  If education was the answer to our problems we should have no unemployment today.  Certainly I thought that would be the case 20 years ago when we were embarking on this project of providing more education, just as I thought when we embarked on the health policies that we would have no sick people.  After 20 years we have more sick people in our society, more hospitals filled and more and more waiting lists. The products of our last 20 years are ending up in the courts and jails today, and there are far more people unemployed. What has education done?  Have we been serious about education?  I am saddened at the millions and millions of pounds spent on education and what is the end product?  All the professionals will have to ask themselves have they been on the right road, or on the road of squander-mania, of just doing a job and not giving a damn about the consequences.</P>
    <P>I am a product of a small vocational school and a large percentage of pupils from that school, which is in a rural village, are employed today.  Ten of those graduates from the vocational school have 120 people employed and contributing to the welfare of the country. What are the products of our big schools doing?  We, the workers, have been paying tax since we were fit to stamp a card.  When we go for the services of those people we pay taxes to educate, we can pay anything up to £20 for ten minutes consultancy.  It is time the ordinary citizen had a look at what he is getting and at what he has got for the vast amounts of money he has put into education.  There should be some return from those professional people to the State.  Instead we pay to educate them and then we have to pay dearly for the <Col N="2792" /> services they provide.  What is the ordinary man in the street getting?  This will have to be looked at seriously as I do not believe we have been getting value for money.  I am convinced that the Minister is taking a hard look at the situation.  The whole teaching profession &mdash; and I had experience of this in the health boards with the health cuts &mdash; is more concerned with self-preservation which is the motivation.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that we should be looking up to men like the Senator and his people and that they should be setting a lead and an example, but, unfortunately, this is not so today.  For many years in my innocence I thought everyone who came out of a university was a little god or goddess in his or her own right and there for our whole and sole good use and benefit.  I have not got the same regard for them today and I am disappointed. We will have to talk about higher motives than self-preservation for the base motive of getting a week's wages.  You must be productive, you must show value for money and, unfortunately &mdash; the ordinary Sean Citizens whom I represent &mdash; the majority of the people are not getting value for money. We must give them value for money because we are in an age when we can no longer live on nice high-falutin' highly-elevated phrases.  We have to think of the facts.  What is the end product?  What has our educational system given us after 20 years, which is a long time?  We must examine this very harshly.  If any other business organisation had that disastrous result after 20 years, it would not be in existence.  We cannot continue to prop <Col N="2793" /> up a system that has been taking quite a lot of money and not putting back into the economy anything like what it should.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator McGowan on the question of travelling expenses.  I know a little about that.  There were courses in the vocational school in Grange and I asked what they cost.  We had professors driving all the way from University College, Galway, to talk for ten or 15 minutes.  In my innocence, I thought that people went to those places to learn something.  The professor came and read a paper.  He could have put it on a taperecorder and it would have been the same.  What was the cost of that?  I can assure Senators that the students who stood there for ten minutes listening to him were no wiser or better.  This is the squander-mania we have to come to grips with.  We cannot have professors going around the country giving lectures which amount to reading a paper for ten or 15 minutes.  Those are the problems I see as a graduate of a small vocational school.</P>
      <P>The Minister is going the right way about education.  She is having a proper review of the whole system carried out which will be telling and the result will be that we will have a better system.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of the year everybody was concerned with the health cuts.  You would have thought that every hospital was to be closed and that we would have many people dying because of neglect. We are well through the year now and there are no ill effects.  Hospitals are working and I have no doubt that the schools will also work.  In my own area we have no problems.</P>

Everybody, including the bankers and the business people, sees a glimmer of hope on the horizon.  We will get our finances right.  The Government are doing a fantastic job in this respect.  The House knows that.</P>
      <P>I always give an example of a Galwayman living beside me who, when he left University College, Galway, got his first job in Sligo building a new bridge. He designed it under the guidance of the then county engineer.  Twenty five years later when that man had years of experience, we had to build a bridge in Grange but he was not considered good enough and we had to get consultants.  The bridge was built across the river at an angle and we have spent a fortune trying to change fences to make the bridge appear straight.  The consultants and I are well known for our great admiration for each other &mdash; and experts in particular.</P>

      <P>Is mian liomsa ar dtús fáilte a chur roimh an Aire Stáit go dtí an Teach seo.  In an important international report recently published entitled &ldquo;Innovation Policy, Ireland&rdquo; the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development stated:</P>
      <P>Modern development relies more and more on investment in brains rather than investment in fixed assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in the context of that independent and objective report that I wish to support the motion here condemning the education cuts of this Fianna Fáil Administration and to also condemn and deplore the dismal performance of the present Minister for Education and the Fianna Fáil Government.  No one person and no political party ever promised so <Col N="2795" /> much in the field of Irish education as did Deputy O'Rourke and Fianna Fáil in Opposition.  No Minister and no Government have ever so totally reneged and so comprehensively failed to deliver on those promises as Deputy O'Rourke and Fianna Fáil in Government, a Minister whose dismal failure is sad for Irish education, sad for students, teachers, parents and management.  For all these groups were assured by Deputy O'Rourke, by the present Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, and by Fianna Fáil &mdash; and I am sure Senator Farrell and Senator McGowan were included in their midst in the heady weeks and months leading up to the general election in February 1987 &mdash; that &ldquo;education was special&rdquo;, that the limited Fine Gael cuts were devastating and that they could not be contemplated and would not be tolerated.  This was the Minister who for four and a half years as education spokesperson for Fianna Fáil opposed all and every measure, whether reasonable or not, taken by Fine Gael Ministers to improve the efficiency and logic of educational spending.  She called for more spending in every area of the educational sector.  Never I believe was there such a betrayal of trust and never was there such a cynical misuse of democracy as the performance of Fianna Fáil before and after the general election in February 1987.</P>
    <P>All these fine notions, as Senator Farrell has indicated, are punctured and all these rosy promises are to be abandoned by this Minister and this Government as they endeavour to conceal the real impact of these cuts with their bland and continual waffling.  The biggest cuts, as indicated by the university Senators, pay and non-pay in the vocational, community and comprehensive schools, in the RTCs and the universities represent a U-turn of staggering proportions.  It will tax the ingenuity of all these managements to run their services at present levels, let alone deal with increased numbers. March 31, 1987, budget day, was a black day for Irish students in our educational system, for on that day it was clearly seen that Irish education had no champion at <Col N="2796" /> the Cabinet table and that the special protection given to the young people of Ireland and their parents by Fine Gael in Government was caring and resolute. These cuts must be seen in the context, as Senator Norris has indicated, that the third level institutions have not indulged in budgetary over-runs and that there has been a sustained improvement in cost effectiveness in recent years involving increased student numbers without any comparable increase in staff.  The cost efficient measures implemented during the squeeze by the previous Government in all third level institutions in recent years reduced very much the margin for manoeuvre in the face of the cuts now proposed for 1987 and 1988.</P>
    <P>However, the contribution of our universities and third level institutions tends far beyond the provision of education and training.  In particular the support given to the country's strategy for job creation cannot be over emphasised.  The provision of an adequate supply of well qualified graduates and the availability of a pool of specialist knowledge among staff who are expert in many areas together with comprehensive R and D support facilities are essential to a healthy climate for investment in job creation in the high technology sector.</P>
    <P>The salient conclusion of the OECD report is that it is essential for Ireland to pursue an aggressive innovation policy through &ldquo;a coherent approach based on an overall vision for the future&rdquo;.  That international report recognises that Ireland cannot afford to increase total public expenditure but it warns that &ldquo;the imposition of uniform recruitment policy across the whole public sector has resulted in some unfortunate distortions in the development of key technological support institutions in Ireland&rdquo;.  They recommend that there should be &ldquo;a deliberate and sustained reorientation of resources towards education, research, development and information&rdquo; and that the Government should take &ldquo;a series of measures to improve the climate of innovation and entrepreneurship in this country&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2797" /> The OECD report specifically recommends: (1) That there should be an increase in the intake of engineering and technology students by 25 per cent per annum over the next five to ten years; (2) That other university studies should be geared to the future needs of a society based upon advanced technology and international trade; (3) In developing the third level of education, inspiration could be obtained from the curricula of the NIHEs; (4) There is a need for expanding the quality of technicians and skilled workers educated in the regional technical colleges and for continuous upgrading of the courses offered in this regard.</P>
    <P>How have the Minister for Education and the Fianna Fáil Government responded to these recommendations? Not only have they implemented the limited Fine Gael cuts contained in the Fine Gael budget, but a further £11 million has been chopped off education and the current vote to the Higher Education Authority has been reduced by over £4.5 million for the 1987 calendar year.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, therefore, it must be recognised that we have a fundamental responsibility to meet as far as possible the aspirations of our young people who seek high quality third level education. Public expenditure has to be controlled, but in a manner that takes due account of long term consequences.  Short term expediency is particularly unwise and difficult to implement in the area of third level education where commitments have been given to students in respect of courses which span several years and which cannot be abandoned in midstream. Academic staff have traditionally enjoyed tenured employment and in this regard it must be recognised that we compete in an international market for academic third level staff.  Any further deterioration in the conditions of employment below those of other countries or the private sector would, coupled with the relatively low salary scales, be a formula for mediocrity.  The proposed cuts would adversely affect our industrial strategy of job creation in knowledge based industries and make it impossible to implement the recommendations of <Col N="2798" /> the OECD report relating to the steps required to ensure this nation's future viability.</P>
    <P>It has been recognised for some time in the universities and in the other third level institutions that the State's contribution cannot be expected to increase year after year.  Many novel and innovative means have been devised to obtain funds from other sources with much success. This process should be allowed to run smoothly without the imposition of arbitrary and short term interventions.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, support this motion and I reject the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before us condemns the arbitrary nature of the decision to cut back the funding to RTCs and universities.  When we talk about the 4 per cent reduction in the staff allocation to universities and regional colleges we need to examine the full implications of that reduction.  It is much worse than it appears on first examination.  The worst aspect of it is that it fails to take cognisance of the fact that the financial year and the academic year are different.  The financial year is from January to December while the academic year is from September to August.  The academic year straddles two financial years.  A 1 per cent cutback has to be effected in the staff allocations between September 1987 and December 1987 but the courses which begin in September 1987 will have to last for the academic year 1987-88.  In 1988 a cutback of 3 per cent has to be effected. The courses begun in 1987 will require the same level of staffing and will have the same student numbers throughout the academic year 1987-88.  The problem that arises here is that the cuts for 1987 will then of necessity be greater than 1 per cent and in the 1988 financial year there will be a further cut of 3 per cent. One is compelled to ask what genius in the Department dreamt up this piece of muddled retrenchment which is presenting horrendous problems for management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of regional colleges a very fundamental question must be asked. Where there is a very large proportion of <Col N="2799" /> courses in regional technical colleges that are funded by the European Social Fund, why are the Government cutting back? The same applies to the vocational education committee schools and colleges where again there is a considerable contribution from Europe.  Why therefore, is this area being so drastically cut when it is a sector which attracts considerable finance from outside the State?</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are very concerned about one basic issue and that is access to third level education.  The Clancy Report on participation in higher education shows that in 1980 1.2 per cent of entrants to higher education came from the unskilled manual worker group and 2.7 per cent from the semi-skilled manual worker group.  These stark figures are further compounded when we take regional factors into consideration.  The higher education annual report 1984-85 indicated that in the matter of degree courses in Waterford city and county 523 students were participating.  This represents 6½ per cent of the appropriate age group.  For instance, the figure in Cork city and county was 4,330 which represents 12½ per cent of the appropriate age group.</P>
    <P>There is a grim reality in these figures. In Cork city and county a student has twice the chance of participating in a third level degree course than a student in Waterford city or county would have. The whole south eastern region, which includes Counties Kilkenny, South Tipperary, Carlow and Wexford as well as Waterford, had a total of 2,300 students taking third level degree courses.  The population of the south eastern region is roughly the same as that in Cork city and county, yet Cork city and county would have almost twice the number of students. The Clancy report demonstrates the appallingly low level of students from the semiskilled and unskilled groups participating in degree courses.  The figures from the higher education annual report 1984-85 demonstrate that proximity to a university also influences the participation rate in degree courses.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated in her speech <Col N="2800" /> that third level scholarships and the income level applying to them were being increased in line with inflation.  Of course, this is very much to be welcomed but I must state most emphatically that the income limits are much too low.  Another factor to be taken into consideration is that there is now no child allowance under the tax code.  With the very high level of taxes in this country the difference between gross and net income is immense.  I suggest that the Minister make every effort to get income limits to a more realistic level.  Indeed, net income figures should be the yardstick to resolve this problem.</P>
    <P>A case in my area illustrates a fundamental flaw as regards access.  I came across a student who did not gain two honours in his leaving certificate but obtained a place on a national certificate course at an RTC.  For the first two years of the course when he was taking his certificate he was allowed a European Social Fund grant which is not means tested.  Having passed with distinction, which is the highest of four grades, at the end of two years he could not qualify for a grant from the VEC because he had not got two honours in his leaving certificate, yet a student who would have been three levels below him in attainment but who had got two honours in the leaving certificate could qualify for this grant. The tragedy of this case was that the boy's father was unemployed.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us in the House not so long ago that 60 national school building projects are ready to go to tender. This year there was a 10 per cent cut in allocation for national school building, and on present trends, it will take eight years to cover all the schools.  There is also what I must speak about as a cutback in adult education.  It seems that the message is that there is no hope for the hopeless.  The national adult literacy agency reported that there are about 4,000 illiterate people in our country yet this sector of our population have been abandoned to a large extent by the Government with the grant in the adult education area being reduced by 20 per <Col N="2801" /> cent, form £50,000 to £40,000.  The Minister, when she spoke on this motion last week, made a lot of play with the fact that there had been consultations with vocational education committees, CEOs and so on.  My information is that they were invited to her office, told what they were getting, treated to one of her charming smiles and then told to be on their way.  I would hardly consider that consultation. In conclusion, I support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. Everyone recognises that the country is faced at the moment with one of the most serious economic problems of our time.  I do not have to elaborate on the problem of unemployment and the need to take the necessary measures to redress that situation and to create a climate in which we can set about reducing the unemployment numbers, one-third of which represent people under 25 years of age.  We all appreciate that in order to reduce the national debt there must be a substantial reduction in public spending.</P>
      <P>The Government have set about that task since coming into office, recognising that unless the problems of the balances in the public finances are resolved there will be continuing and increasing problems for the economy.  However, the Government are at pains to ensure that none of the measures which they have taken in the education area will affect entry to education or educational opportunities. This year, they are spending 17.2 per cent of their total expenditure on education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The growth of the universities and other third level institutions in recent times has been great.  This contribution, particularly in the third level VEC sector, has been enormous and will continue to expand and develop.  This is a tribute to the excellence and the relevance of the courses they provide.  I am convinced that these colleges will continue to provide and develop an outstanding service to the overall educational sector.  As I have stated, the intention of the Government is that there will be no discrimination in service to students.  The improvement in <Col N="2802" /> the overall economic situation is of vital interest to the third level institutions in order to provide a future for the large numbers of highly educated students who pass through these institutions.</P>
    <P>A major development in recent times has been the very close links created between third level education centres and industry and, in particular, the development of incubator units and specialised research and development centres.  This is a development which I hope will continue to expand, recognising the contribution third level institutions can make to industry in terms of technology, management, marketing and product development.  It is extremely important that, with huge technological changes taking place at such a rapid pace, the opportunity is afforded to industrialists to update and refresh their qualifications.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that a task force has been established by the Department to examine admission procedures to third level colleges and to make recommendations on how best the present system can be improved because of the confusion and difficulty it causes to parents and to students seeking third level places.  The task force will also investigate the administration of grants and scholarships and this is also to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I support the amendment put down by our party.  Restrictions are being made rather than cuts.  I believe, as is the case in the health system, there have been no cuts.  There has been a 1 per cent increase in our total health allocation and a 6 per cent increase in our educational funding for the year.  In fairness to the Opposition and the people who put down this motion, to a certain extent it is rather divisive.  At the moment it is a good strategy for an Opposition party to put down motions like this and to say that the Government are dealing with the matter in the wrong way.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to say something which does not have much to do with education but in a way it is related.  We all wish Stephen Roche the best of Irish luck in the Tour de France and I hope he wins it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the last remarks of Senator Fitzgerald whatever about anything else he said.  The basic problem about the debate on cutbacks is that it is centred on a whole series of basic, fundamental, factual errors and unproven assumptions.  The first error is the presumption that cutbacks are necessary because we are giving ourselves too much in the way of public services.  If the cost of servicing our debt is deducted from the entire Government expenditure, what is actually left over is quite a substantial surplus in Government revenue. Without our debts we could improve the services we currently have and still reduce taxes.  At present there is surplus Government revenue of £900 million when debt servicing is removed from it.  The idea that we are living in a luxury of excessively expensive services beyond our capacity to pay for them is only true because of the state of the national debt, not because the quality of services is so high.</P>
      <P>The trouble, of course, is that the banks cannot and will not wait for their money and therefore everything else must wait.  Effectively, what we have is Fianna Fáil, the banker's party. However, if we are coerced by the banks, then clearly cutbacks are inevitable and the only way to avert such cutbacks is by a fundamental change in economic policy.  Cutbacks which are dictated by banks, stock exchanges, financial markets, etc. are not the sort that affect banks, stock markets, financial markets etc.  The sort of cutbacks that will be made will be those which will put up the price of some item or increase its scarcity and in that way produce a higher price. Of course bankers, stock brokers, etc. can afford to pay higher prices.  In fact, higher prices have a certain attraction for them because they limit demand and therefore increase access for themselves and their children, to services, whether they are health, education etc. which were in recent times tending to be overpopulated by what would be to them less acceptable elements of our population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As always it will be the poor who will suffer as a result of such a policy.  It is <Col N="2804" /> important to say that, notwithstanding the posturing, what is being done by the Government has the full support of Fine Gael and of the Progressive Democrats. Indeed, it is difficult to be certain which represents the greater hypocrisy, the U-turn by Fianna Fáil not only on their election manifesto but on their traditional policies, or the pretence of the two major Opposition parties in the Dáil and the one major Opposition party here that somehow they would have done differently. They are all at one in thinking that public expenditure must be curtailed, whatever the price.</P>
    <P>The final inanity in all of this is that, when you come to an area like third level education, you have the pronouncement that these cutbacks will lead to higher economic growth.  I cannot help wondering who in God's name is going to work in all the new high technology industries that are supposed to spring out of this new era of financial austerity when what we are going to produce are undertrained, under-funded and under-qualified graduates.</P>
    <P>Now is the time for an increase in expenditure in all the areas of third level education related to our future economic development in innovation, imagination, creativity, research and in developments in the quality of teaching if we want to develop into what the Taoiseach has often described as a high wage, high production economy.  We are trying to turn ourselves back into a low wage, low cost model of South East Asia.  This cannot be done and we must recognise that what is being done in third level education today is directly in contradiction of the expressed economic policies of the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply, even by the standards of ministerial replies, was infuriating. It was, perhaps, most infuriating in its lack of specifics, the pretence that there were no cutbacks when anybody who works in a third level education institution knows that there were.  That does not contribute to proper political debate, no more than does the idiotic utterances of Senator Farrell.  I do not propose to reply to the speech other than to say that <Col N="2805" /> the logic of Senator Farrell's position is that we should close down the schools, close down the hospitals that then we would be better educated and healthier. That was his logic, not mine, I regret that Fianna Fáil have reduced themselves to that.</P>

      <P>I am not sure what Senator Ryan meant but he has more than a vested interest in the field of education. He has a vested interest in ensuring that both his position and the position of those who are employed, rather than those who are being educated, are protected.</P>
      <P>The decision of the Government to examine all levels of education was not an arbitrary one.  Unless we have a reasonable look at the services being offered in every sector of the economy, unfortunately, what is happening at present will only be the tip of the iceberg. As has been said, the ship of State was heading towards a watery gravy unless changes were made, changes which are unpalatable to many people but which were necessary.  In spite of our very difficult financial situation, the allocation for the educational services this year is more than 11 per cent greater than the 1986 outturn.  The health services cutbacks, for instance, were not in relation to the outturn but in relation to the Estimates. Therefore, the cutback in education has not been as harsh as those in other areas.  We are talking about the need for rationalisation.  There is no doubt in the minds of those who have children going through any level of the education system, that the cost of education at third level is too high.  Nevertheless, young people are getting a level of education which is superior to that in any other country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the educational system there is a need for discussion and for rationalisation. I am not sure if additional funding is the correct way of having a proper educational system which is relevant to our young people who are supposedly being educated for work.  The educational system needs to change when the world changes.  A number of people in <Col N="2806" /> academia have lived and worked a little bit away from the realities of Irish life and are educating people in the wrong area.  That is not their fault, it is the fault of the educational system.</P>
    <P>Additional funding for third level education at this stage could only be secured at the expense of first and second level education which, I am sure Senators would agree, would be highly undesirable. Even as matters stand, the total allocation for recurrent expenditure in the third level sector in the present year is 5.6 per cent greater than the 1986 Estimate. In spite of this, the motion sets down supposed consequences arising from the present level of funding third level education which I can only describe as alarmist and quite unfounded.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt in detail with these matters and there is no point in going through them again.  The reality is that there have to be cutbacks although the stock market seems to be taking a bullish attitude towards what is happening at present when one sees a share which was 55 pence the day before yesterday ending up at £6.25 today.  There must be a certain amount of confidence in what the Government are doing.  Some areas need funding, obviously there are funds available and it is a pity that the people who are making a lot of money in the Stock Exchange do not put some of it into education.</P>
    <P>The Government, according to the people, are going in the right direction and will continue to provide the required level of education.  There is a need for computer-aided learning methods for distance education teaching and changes must be made.  The Government are looking at all these areas and I guarantee that as a result of the 5.6 per cent increase in allocations, the educational system will be better off.</P>

      <P>It is coming to the end of the debate on this motion and the time allocated to speakers has been shrinking. Therefore, I will be brief to allow other contributors, including the Minister, to come in before the debate concludes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion has focused on third level <Col N="2807" /> education and the effects of Government cutbacks on that sector but similar and equally serious implications arise at primary and second level education and I hope that we will have an early opportunity to debate those sectors in this House.  The debate is not a waste of time, notwithstanding that it may not hit the headlines tomorrow and notwithstanding that, to my regret, although the Minister is here and has obviously been listening with interest, there are no advisers present.  It is unusual to have no advisers present, who ultimately have a significant role in relation to policy but I hope they will look at the contributions both of the last occasion and of this evening because there have been some very interesting recurring themes.</P>
    <P>A recurring theme of many contributors to the debate sought to emphasise the need to broaden access to third level education.  We still cannot be happy about the limited, unfair and discriminatory access to third level education, notwithstanding our problems and the exigencies of the public expenditure crisis.  We must broaden access to third level education.  We must also support adult education and literacy programmes. In other words, we must have a value priority within the system.</P>
    <P>It was a valuable debate because of the recurring themes from those who contributed from the university benches.  I regret that the Leader of the House, Senator Lanigan, referred to vested interests.  I honestly do not think that that is appropriate in the context of a debate on third level education.  It is one of the values of the Seanad that there are university seats and that there are representatives of the university sector.  That means that those who contribute have a rather more specialist knowledge, not a vested interest as such, in this particular area.  If anyone wants to look at the debate there was some very significant themes from representatives of different colleges and universities.  One was that there has not been a large budgetary overrun by universities; another, that Government funding at university level <Col N="2808" /> has, in fact, been shrinking and that universities have quite significantly been able to obtain funding from other sources. Universities may be fortunate to some degree in this.  Cutting across what universities are trying to do at the moment appears to be an arbitrary curtailment of staffing, a requirement on staff reducing, which frustrates the efforts being made by universities to meet the challenge in the OECD report, to which a number of Senators referred, to be innovative and to expand in certain areas.  I would ask the Minister to take into account that one after another the university representatives have emphasised that an overall requirement of staff reduction of one per cent this year, three per cent next year and apparently three per cent the year after, cuts across in an arbitrary, discriminatory, unfair and stupid manner, what the universities could do but which would not in any way cut across Government expenditure projections.  We need to think about the way in which we develop and curtail expenditure in education in a manner which fits what we can afford to pay.  It has to be a very careful process because &mdash; and I can speak, as all of my colleagues can speak, on third level education &mdash; morale is very low.  Unfortunately, that means that those who are most talented and know they can obtain jobs elsewhere may be tempted to go.  This is happening, and it will happen more if we are not careful.  People are leaving academic life. Those who should be staying in it &mdash; in law teaching, an area I know about &mdash; are leaving the academic world.  That is a very serious loss.  This is also reflected in other disciplines.</P>
    <P>As I say, time is extremely short and I am not going to take up any more time. This debate has identified a number of issues which the Minister should bear in mind in relation to third level education. I look forward to an early opportunity for a similar debate about primary and second level education.  The Seanad has a very important role to play in reflecting on the very difficult situation in which we find ourselves in placing emphasis on the <Col N="2809" /> importance of education and in getting the balance right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that in five minutes I will not have time to give a party political broadcast on behalf of Trinity College, Dublin as Senator Norris had.  But I should say one or two things in reply to the debate.  First, I and the other university Senators do have a vested interest in the continuation of universities so Senator Lanigan is right to an extent, but I see no shame in that.  It is open for everybody to see.  What I do resent is the anti-intellectual, anti-university bias that has come from the other side of the House during this debate.  I can only conclude that there may have been an element of that in the Minister's speech last week.  From what Senator Farrell said this evening, you would think that his great disappointment in the university Senators would lead him to abolish the universities.  Maybe that is the position of Fianna Fáil, and perhaps they should say so, but it was certainly the logical conclusion of what he said.  Senator McGowan in earlier speeches in this House seemed to think that every university Senator was a professor and that professors were creating a certain amount of trouble.  I resent that sort of bias which has crept into this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had personal difficulties with this motion because I support fully the efforts of the Government to reduce public expenditure as I support fully also their honest efforts to reduce public expenditure, not only in the realm of health but in the realm of education.  Those difficulties were solved partially before I signed the motion but after hearing the Minister's speech, I found no difficulty with this at all.  The Minister gave us no hope for the future, no concept of what she thought education at third level was about; in fact, her speech could easily have been delivered by the last Minister for Education, Deputy Gemma Hussey. We received, from the Minister a long list of projects in the educational field which were continuing, nearly all of which had started under the previous <Col N="2810" /> Government.  It was a sort of weak apologia for what she was doing without any justification.  The last one is laughable. She said:</P>
    <P>In addition to these alterations, essential minor works, such as roof repairs, fire safety works and the installation of security systems, are being carried out in many colleges.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Minister could come before this House and justify her educational policy on the basis of the roof repairs being carried out on certain schools.  I would like to have seen a plan for the future, an idea in the Minister's and in Fianna Fáil's minds about what university education was for, and where we were going.  I shall have to curtail myself to just talking about one point.</P>
    <P>The problem in this motion is how educational establishments at third level are to be funded.  The problem is, very briefly, about money.  Traditionally, it is fair to say, universities are not very cost conscious. Those involved in the academic world do not think very commercially.  I believe it is not impossible that those involved in the academic world and those involved in the commercial world could be reconciled while academic standards are not necessarily being sacrificed.  I would ask that commercial criteria be extended to universities.  The Government should have put forward a plan for future and present funding of universities which should not have involved the sort of arbitrary costs that we have inflicted upon us.  Why could we not have far more overseas students in Trinity College, UCD, UCC, and UCG, all paying the commercial cost of their education?  I see nothing wrong with this.  I know from experience that there are thousands of people abroad who would be willing to come to the universities here and pay the full commercial cost of their education. They would pay for the privilege.  It would be a great asset to those who are educated here to be educated in a more cosmopolitan atmosphere, but it would also increase enormously the funding of universities.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the Government should look <Col N="2811" /> again at the idea of students being lent money for their education.  I know this offends many people with great egalitarian principles but we must recognise that we cannot afford to educate at third level everybody who wants that level of education.  We simply do not have those resources.  While it is absolutely right that the base of those who are being educated should be broadened, we have got to produce a means of funding it.  I suggest that the Government again look at the possibility of lending money to those who cannot fund their education themselves and requiring them to repay it because it <Col N="2812" /> is a privilege still to go to university.  It is funded by the State and I see nothing wrong with requiring those who are educated at the State's expense to repay this debt to society.  We should look at examples like the College of Surgeons which pays for itself &mdash; it is funded to the extent of only about £15,000 by the Government and I do not understand why it is funded to that extent because it is so minor.  I am disappointed with this debate because I do not see any future plan for education, except for more cuts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 16, before section 32, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  Where a court imposes a fine or affirms or varies a fine imposed by another court for an offence referred to section 31 of which a person was convicted summarily, it may, at its discretion, on the application (made before the time of such imposition or affirmation) of any person who was summoned as a witness on behalf of the prosecution in the proceedings in which the fine was imposed and who suffered personal injury, loss or damage resulting, wholly or partly, from the offence provide by order for the payment of the amount of the fine or of a specified part of it as compensation in respect of the injury, loss or damage to the person making the application.</P>
      <P>(b)  An application shall not lie under paragraph (a) of this section in respect of any personal injury, loss or damage if proceedings claiming damages for the injury, loss or damage have been instituted in any court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  Where the whole or part of a fine imposed under this section is paid to a person pursuant to this section and the person is awarded damages by a court in respect of the personal injury, loss <Col N="2814" /> or damage to which the payment relates, the payment shall be deemed to be in satisfaction of so much of the damages as is equal to the amount of the payment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes to insert a new section before section 32 in relation to the powers of the court.  It would, in effect, enable the court to have and exercise the same power as it currently exercises under section 17 of the Consumer Information Act, 1978, so that where the court was imposing a fine for an offence under the Act, at the discretion of the court part of a fine which was imposed could be paid over to a person who had suffered loss or damage resulting from the offence.  It seems that this is roughly parallel to an offence under the Consumer Information Act.  If a person has been injured by an unfair practice, restrictive practice, or unfair trading it should at least be considered that the court might have a similar power.</P>
    <P>What is proposed in this amendment is that not only would there be the possibility for the director to bring prosecutions and for fines to be imposed for breaches of the various requirements, but the person who suffered loss or damage could also have part of the fine apportioned to him in compensation, as happens under the Consumer Information Act.  I am interested to hear the views of the Minister in relation to this. It may be that the amendment will need some tidying up but, if the Minister is prepared to accept the principle of it, it would be a matter which would certainly be comparable to the jurisdiction under the Consumer Information Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for her amendment.  The amendment, as drafted applies to consumer legislation and not to restrictive practices.  The amendment would provide that a court would have the power to direct that part or all of a fine imposed for any of the offences in respect of which the director has now been given power of prosecution should be paid to a person who, as the <Col N="2815" /> Senator says in her amendment, has suffered personal injury or was summonsed as a witness in the proceedings and suffered injury and made application to the court before the fine was imposed.  The provision is similar to a provision, as the Senator rightly said, in the Consumer Information Act, 1978.  The provision in the 1978 Act has been used on a number of occasions in prosecutions under that Act.  In cases where holidays were mis-described in brochures, for example, part of the fines imposed on the tour operators were directed to be paid over to the aggrieved holidaymakers.  I understand what the Senator has in mind.  In cases where parts of a fine imposed on car salesmen arising from the sale of cars with, for example, false mileage readings, on occasions they were directed to be paid over to the aggrieved purchaser.</P>
      <P>However, our difficulty with the amendment as it stands is that we take the view that it is very unlikely that, in the case of the offences in respect of which power of prosecution is being transferred to the director, a similar provision would be of any real benefit to the consumer for a number of reasons.  There would be many cases &mdash; probably the majority &mdash; in which a consumer would not be involved.  The prosecutions would follow surveys and monitorings by the director's office.  Even in cases which involved a consumer, he or she would not necessarily be called as a witness in the case.  The normal practice would be that the alleged offence would be investigated in full by the director using his authorised officers, his inspectors, and in court the evidence would be given not by the injured party but by the inspector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of most of the offences involved the question of personal injury, loss or damage probably would not arise. That must be our view of it at this stage. The offence could result, for instance, in the consumer not being given information which the legislation requires he or she should be given but its absence would not necessarily lead to any loss, for example, the absence of an indication of fibre content in a garment or the <Col N="2816" /> absence of a unit price on foodstuff.  We do not envisage there being injured parties in the area we are dealing with because the inspectorate system would deal with it.  For example, in the food labelling system the director would probably carry out a survey and if satisfied would institute proceedings for, say, incorrect labelling, wrong labelling, or no labelling.  In that case it would be the inspector who would give evidence in the court.  This is appropriate in the area to which it already applies but I am not convinced that it is appropriate in this legislation because it probably would not arise in most cases in that the inspector would give the evidence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained, the amendment was tabled deliberately as an adaptation from section 17 of the Consumer Information Act in order to have consideration by the Minister of whether it would be appropriate to have a somewhat similar provision.  I accept that it would not be appropriate probably to tie it in to a person who was summoned as a witness for the reasons that the Minister has given, that the prosecutions would be using the information provided by an authorised officer, an inspector of the director.  If the Minister assures the House that there will not be the same incidence of loss suffered by parties who can be identified, perhaps it is not appropriate. I am in favour of devices of this kind, where we are seeking to enforce legislation where not only is it appropriate that there would be criminal penalties in appropriate cases, but where also there would be an apportionment of part of the fine to an injured party.  It was that principle that I was anxious to have discussed.  If the Minister is clear that it is not appropriate and that there would not be identifiable injured parties in the circumstances of this legislation, that is the matter fully discussed so far as I am concerned.  I will not press the matter any further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give that assurance, that we would not expect any significant number of identifiable injured <Col N="2817" /> parties because of the structure.  The principle which the Senator espouses is one that we could perhaps use more often in a general sense where it is appropriate to apply the proceedings from fines to individual injured parties.  In this case it would be difficult because of the lack of indentifiable injured parties and it would be difficult to agree to apply the proposed amendment to restrictive practices legislation without a lot of detailed thought because of the present drafting and the structure of the Bill, applying as it does to consumer legislation as it is drafted.  I have no problem with the broad principle the Senator is suggesting; but in this case it would be as well not to incorporate it.</P>

      <P>This is to do with weights and measures provisions.  Section 35 of the Bill creates an offence in relation to the sale of short weights or short measures.  Examination of the provisions, subsequent to publication of the <Col N="2818" /> Bill, has shown that the wording of the provision could lead to difficulties in proving an offence, in that the present wording refers to any person who sells or purports to sell.  We now consider that an alternative wording &ldquo;any person who sells or exposes for sale or offers for sale&rdquo; would be a more effective wording.  The proposed amendment is simply this change or wording.</P>

      <P>The Attorney General has advised that an offence under section 35 of the Bill would not be part of weights and measures legislation and that therefore, although prosecutions are to be brought by weights and measures inspectors &mdash; this provision is in section 35 (4) &mdash; the powers of entry of inspectors contained in the weights and measures <Col N="2819" /> legislation would not extend to prosecutions under section 35.

Rather have we relied on, very often, the Minister's reply to give an indication of what that would be.  Certainly, we would interpret it as meaning business hours.</P>

      <P>Under the Schedule the various statutory instruments listed there, the European Community's indication of prices of foodstuffs, the European Community's labelling presentation and advertising of foodstuffs, and the names and labelling of textile products, reinforces the point I was making earlier, that there will be a great deal of enforcement by the director, a very substantial amount of enforcement.  The Minister, in answer to an earlier question referred to the fact that there has been an increase in staffing since 1983 and that <Col N="2820" /> there will be six personnel from the Examiner's office, but it seems that the effect of this Bill will be, as I said on Second Stage, to create a very significant major office in the land, the office of the director, and the director will not be able to fulfil the functions under the Act unless there is a very significant concentration of expert staff and resources for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty at all with that concept.  Indeed, that goes for all legislation.  If one is going to legislate one must be sure that it is going to be effective.  There is no point in legislating if one is not going to make available the resources necessary to implement the legislation.  That is a totally academic approach.  I assure the House that whatever resources are needed to make the director effective will be made available, obviously subject to the usual national budgetary constraints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator might support the view that an effective director with new powers, and the new Bill behind him or her, would take the view that persuasive action might achieve a lot more than actually going to the difficulties of prosecuting, that that kind of authority which the director will have will enable the director to achieve a lot of action and settle a lot of difficulties without having to take the prosecutions.  I would rely very heavily on the directors persuasive powers, knowing that if he or she has to use the big stick it is there.  Very often, when people know the big stick is there, they settle much quicker and are much more reasonable about it.  I hope that the pressure on the director's office will be lessened by his or her use of persuasive powers to deal with matters, by dealing with them immediately rather than by going into court unnecessarily.  At present the Minister is enforcing these regulations and this is not a new function. The function is being transferred from the Minister to the director.  I assure the House that the resources necessary will be there, and I will rely heavily on the director's powers of persuasion knowing <Col N="2821" /> that he has the ultimate resources if he needs them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point that the way in which this Bill, when enacted, is enforced and implemented depends largely on the approach and the resources of the director.  I am concerned because I have seen other legislation, for example the area of equality legislation, where there are a number of provisions which have not been brought into full effect because the resources to do so do not exist.</P>
      <P>The Bill contains a lot of enforcement apart from persuasion.  The Schedule we are dealing with relates to summary prosecutions. I go a long way with the Minister. I do not think there should be unnecessary prosecutions but much of the thrust of this Bill is prohibiting and creating penalities and requiring and creating penalties for omission or failure to comply and either creating new offences for enforcement by the Minister or, as the Schedule does, transferring into his jurisdiction the monitoring and enforcement of various enactments, including European Communities enactments. Unless there are the personnel and the resources to do that, we will have passed a rather technical Bill portions of which will not come into effect.  That would be regrettable.  I welcome the Minister's assurance that he intends that the Bill will have full force and effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government <Col N="2824" /> announced recently that there would be decentralisation of Government Departments to Galway, Ballina, Sligo and Cavan.  The original plan was to have included eight centres.  Killarney, Letterkenny, Nenagh and Waterford were the other four centres which have not been included in the present round.  I understand that an interdepartmental committee has been set up under the auspices of the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach to deal with policy for further decentralisation.  Heretofore, we have had regional policy only in the industrial areas.  Modern trends show that employment growth is in the service sector.  There is a very urgent need for a regional policy regarding the service sector.</P>
      <P>Recently I raised the matter of funding for Waterford Airport on the Adjournment. The Minister of State was unable to be of assistance in the current year. There is an area where the Minister could be of assistance to the development of Waterford Airport and that is by extending the 10 per cent corporation profits tax to the 60 acre industrial development land attached to Waterford Airport.  This concession already operates in the Shannon free zone and is to be extended to the Custom House Docks site in Dublin. Strong representations are being made from Cork to have this concession extended to the development at Ringaskiddy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the case why the south eastern region, where I come from, and the other regions would benefit from regional policy.  In order to <Col N="2825" /> develop the Waterford Airport industrial estate there is a great need for this type of discrimination to effect growth at the regional capital of the south east.  At least one service industry was lost to the Waterford industrial estate because of fear of competition from the Shannon free zone.  Dr. Michael Bannon in his report on Waterford as a regional capital stated that Waterford had about the right number of industrial jobs for its size but that it was very weak in the service sector. Waterford Corporation, with the assistance of the package of incentives announced by the previous Government, succeeded in attracting a most exciting shopping development to the city centre. In the short term this will provide badly needed building jobs in the area.  In the longer term it will stimulate business and provide jobs in the retail sector.  The city council having examined the experience of York realised that the attraction of tourists to Waterford would need this type of shopping development going hand in hand with Waterford's very important archaeological and historical remains.  The confidence that has been generated in the city is most encouraging.</P>
      <P>Recently the city suffered a very severe shock with the announcement that the city's major employer, Waterford Crystal, is seeking 750 redundancies from its 3,000 workforce.  This amounts to about 10 per cent of the city's industrial workforce. These are jobs worth an average of £17,500 per annum and would remove at a conservative estimate £7 million from the local economy.  The unions at Waterford Crystal are opposing the redundancies and have engaged their own consultants to come up with a plan that will achieve the necessary savings for the company in addition to protecting existing jobs.  It is to be very much hoped that the unions are successful in this, that a settlement can be worked out to the satisfaction of the unions and the company and that jobs will be retained.</P>

      <P>I hate interrupting one of my colleagues but I had informed the Minister for Finance that I was taking a motion on the Adjournment regarding <Col N="2826" /> the non-inclusion of Waterford in the decentralisation programme.  I appreciate the Senator's point and I know Waterford nearly as well as he but I would like the Senator to zoom back in on the point as worded in the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a package agreed for eight centres during a previous Fianna Fáil Administration.  That did not come through in the time of the last Administration.  That package has been delivered now.  This involves four centres. I wish to make the case that Waterford and the south eastern region should be included and I raise the matter in the context of why this type of decentralisation is very necessary to the local economy.  I ask your indulgence to develop that point a little further before I get back to the body of the speech.</P>
      <P>Speaking earlier tonight, I dealt with the situation relating to third level degree courses in the south eastern region.  In Waterford city and county and in the region generally, 6.5 per cent of young people in the appropriate age group in 1984-85 were studying for degree courses, while in County Cork 12.5 per cent of a similar group were studying for degree courses.  This is a very significant factor because the investment in education is very much wound up with economic development in the region.  I made the point already that Waterford is extremely weak in the service sector and this is why it is particularly appropriate that Waterford should be considered for degree courses.  Whether this is achieved by expanding the courses available at the regional technical college or by the provision of a new institute such as NIHE is a matter for debate but it is very necessary that this problem is dealt with.  It should be remembered that Waterford had a teacher training college until 1938 and it is the only major city that has not got a third level institution, apart from an RTC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is basic to this whole question is the overriding problem of the imbalance of the growth of Dublin in relation to the eight other regions of the country.  The <Col N="2827" /> ERDO report, &ldquo;Eastern Regional Settlement Strategy 2011&rdquo; points to a 1.85 million population for Dublin city and county by the year 2011.  This represents an increase of 560,000 people on the 1981 figure and migration of 4,000 per annum to the eastern region.  This is a trend that in the national interest must be urgently arrested and the necessary policy measures must be urgently put in place to arrest that trend.</P>
    <P>Can the EC help?  The integrated approach relates to the further evolution and development which is one of the topics to be covered by the European Commission in its fulfilment of Article 130 (d) of the Single European Act and is an area which must be urgently explored. The objectives, contents and scope of the integrated approach is to bring out the potential for endogenous development and to concentrate financial flows in favour of a region or sector.  These objectives are to be achieved by providing or re-enforcing the basis for partnership between the Commission, national, regional and local authorities in the development process.  This area within the Community provides resources which must be of great assistance in getting a meaningful regional policy in the general service and manufacturing areas.  During the years 1971-78 the eastern region's share of natural increases in the following areas were: public administration and defence, 56 per cent; education, 48 per cent and medicine and hospitals 39 per cent.</P>
    <P>The NESC report, No. 81 &mdash; Designation of Areas for Industrial policy &mdash; states:</P>
    <P>The historical trend on the growth of the East regions relative to other areas is undesirable, primarily from a social viewpoint but also from an economic viewpoint.</P>
    <P>Finally I very much welcome the announcement by your colleague, Deputy Séan McCarthy, Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce with special responsibility for Science and Technology, in Waterford <Col N="2828" /> this week of a pilot programme for the south eastern region to harness the various agencies in the region to advance the economy there.  The Minister stated that the degree of high technology enterprise in the region is low compared with other areas.  Let us hope that this is the first in a series of positive Government initiatives to assist job creation in the region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator O'Shea for the information he has given us about Waterford Airport and other local problems and I am sure he will be quite capable of pursuing those issues with the appropriate Ministers.  For the purpose of my contribution here tonight, I will reply to the terms of the motion on the Adjournment which deals with decentralisation.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased to have the opportunity to talk in this House about the Government's decentralisation programme. It is just one of a series of progressive developmental measures undertaken by us in Government, and one which I am confident will have considerable social and economic benefits throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil recognised, as far back as the later seventies, the pressing need to promote a more balanced development between the eastern region with Dublin as its hub and the rest of the country.  It was obvious then that the concentration of population and economic activity at the centre was to the detriment of both the metropolitan area and the regions.  It was placing a huge burden on the capital city while contributing to the problems of regional disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1980 we initiated a comprehensive programme covering the relocation of over 3,000 public servants to 12 provincial centres &mdash; regrettably we were not in a position to see that implemented. However, while in Opposition we did not lose sight of our original objective and continued to pursue the issue as the opportunity arose in Dáil Éireann.  It is a pity that the Senator's party did not agree with our intentions at that time and over the last five years.  We continued to recognise the self-evident desire of many public <Col N="2829" /> servants to retain links with their provincial roots.</P>
    <P>In this modern age of advanced communications and computers there are no prohibitive logistical reasons for those administering many Government services having to be located in Dublin.  We have invested massively in our telephone system, it is now one of the more modern in Europe and computers function equally well in Galway, Sligo, Waterford or any other provincial centre as in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The drain of young people to jobs in Dublin has several undesirable consequences. First, it leads to an eventual demand for housing, education, and infrastructural services in Dublin at a high cost both to the public authorities and to the individuals themselves.  At the same time many of these services are being under-utilised in provincial towns.  Housing for example is noticeably cheaper and many would claim the quality of life there is better.</P>
    <P>One of the most important factors of all is perhaps less tangible &mdash; migration deprives provincial areas of the vigour and leadership talent of those who must unfortunately pack their bags on a Sunday evening for the week's work in Dublin.</P>
    <P>It was with the foregoing consideration that decentralisation was included in Fianna Fáil's <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and was vigorously pursued on attaining office.  To reactivate the programme as speedily as possible, a limited number of centres &mdash; those for which planning had already been substantially completed in 1980 and which could commence without undue delay &mdash; were selected.  In recognition of the more restrictive financial circumstances now in operation it was decided to invite private sector participation rather than fund the <Col N="2830" /> programme directly from the Exchequer. It is intended that the State will rent the premises with an option to purchase at a future date.</P>
    <P>It is prudent in recognition of the revised funding arrangements that some experience of its operation be gained before further commitments are made. The Office of Public Works have selected the firms who are being asked to tender for the provision of the accommodation required at the four centres which have been chosen.  Tender documents will be issued to these firms tomorrow.  Once we have settled the finer details in relation to these four centres, the Government will be in a better position to consider when the programme should be expanded to include further centres.  I sympathise fully with the Senator's wish to see other areas benefiting from this measure, but I hope he will understand the need to proceed in an orderly and planned manner.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the Government's initial moves towards decentralisation will be developed in due course, prudently and creatively, so that we can achieve a balanced expansion in all the regions of our country.  This is in line with the Government's belief that local areas can be given a more direct and creative role in contributing to the process of national recovery.</P>
    <P>I can say in conclusion, a Chathaoirligh, that we moved very fast in this programme because we recognised its importance.  I have covered in fair detail what the Government have in mind, both for these four centres and for the possibility of further extensions.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 23 July 1987.</P>
