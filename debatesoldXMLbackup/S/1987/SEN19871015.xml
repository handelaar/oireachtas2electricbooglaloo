      <P>I have notice from Senator Nuala Fennell that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to reverse his decision to abolish the Health Education Bureau as the independent service it provided cannot be carried out within a Government Department.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator John Connor of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance through the agency at the Office of Public Works to provide financial and professional assistance to the restoration of the 17th century Church of Ireland Church and Cemetery at Frenchpark, County Roscommon, the resting place of Douglas Hyde, where a commemoration will be held in the summer of 1988 to mark the 50th anniversary of Dr. Hyde's inauguration as the first constitutional President in 1938.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Fennell and Connor as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have <Col N="448" /> selected Senator Fennell's motion and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Connor may give notice for another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>A Cathaoirligh, knowing your commitment to this House, may I ask the Leader of the House through you yet again to reconsider his decision announced yesterday not to allow this House to discuss the most important issue facing the Irish people, namely, the Government's economic policy?</P>

      <P>I am sorry, I was not going to speak about the economic issue. I was simply going to say that the Order of Business for today is hardly earth shattering or extremely urgent.  Therefore, the pressure of business alone cannot be used to justify us not discussing the Government's economic policy.  Therefore, I ask the Leader of the House, having regard to the obvious lightness of the business before this House, to reconsider the decision he made yesterday.</P>

      <P>At the risk of incurring your wrath also, a Chathaoirligh, one of the reasons we are asking the Leader of the House on the Order of Business to reconsider his decision &mdash; which is the only time we can formally ask him this type of question &mdash; is because of the unfolding problems that have arisen as a result of the Book of Estimates.  There must be a reason for us asking it and the only way we can convince the Leader of the House that there is a reason is to explain it to him through you a Chathaoirligh, and it is not your position to quantify or qualify the questions we ask him.  It is a matter for you in the ordering of the business of the House to decide, when we have finished asking questions of the Leader of the House, to allow the Leader of the House to respond.  The Book of Estimates will have implications in several areas of economic development and in particular, in areas of social welfare and we now discover &mdash; and this is why I am asking the Leader of the House through you a Chathaoirligh &mdash; that pay-related benefits will no longer be paid on maternity leave&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not need your answer a Chathaoirligh.  I need the Leader of the House to respond to me through your office.  I want the Leader of the House to take note of the fact that yesterday the other House passed a resolution to receive the Australian Premier.  He is the Labour leader of the Australian Parliament. I want to know on the Order of Business if it is a joint sitting of both Houses, or is it solely a sitting of the Dáil. I do not think that is an unfair question to ask the Leader of the House.  Would you agree?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a facility in this House, which was passed by a previous Leader of the House, Gemma Hussey, whereby distinguished visitors would have a facility to address this House.  If the Dáil wants to ignore this House, as some of the media and some of the public do, we should stand up for ourselves and say that we are entitled to have a hearing with the Australian Premier as well as the members of the Dáil.  Senator Brendan Ryan made a good point: if this House is to be relevant we must have an opportunity to discuss the Book of Estimates.</P>

      <P>The motion which was presented yesterday in the name of Senator Brendan Ryan and myself, which was not acceptable for whatever reason, was not what we were referring to here. We were talking in terms of Government time being made available for the discussion of economic planning and strategies of Government, rather than the actual motion.  It is one thing for people to say that this House is being ignored. It is quite right that people should ignore it if we are not discussing central issues. The central issue that is of concern to everybody at present is the Government's strategy on economic matters and how the Estimates affect everybody in the State.  I ask the Leader of the House once more if he would reconsider his hasty decision of yesterday.  Now after a period of 24 hours perhaps he could give a new response, or at least some hope that we could respond to the needs of the community and of those people whom we represent.  At a time when people are facing massive unemployment, emigration&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business for today is as I have stated.  I am not acceding to the request of the Opposition that we hold an emergency debate on the Book of Estimates.  As I said yesterday, the Book of Estimates has been produced three months in advance of any Government's efforts in the past.  We have the Book of Estimates and many <Col N="452" /> people will have time to delve into it over the next couple of months.  I do not think that the Seanad is going to produce anything earth shattering.  The order of Business for today is, as I outlined.  The Insurance Bill is a very important one.  It may not be important to some of the people who spoke but to people in the industry and those who have to take out insurance it is an extremely important Bill.  The Abattoirs Bill is another very important Bill even if it is not earth shattering.</P>
      <P>Senator Ferris asked a question about the decision to have the Premier of Australia address the Dáil.  The sitting will not be a joint one.  It is not a matter of any aspersion being cast on this House. Mr. Hawke is Prime Minister of Australia. He is not a Head of State and as Premier he is being invited in by the Dáil. As is usual on such occasions accommodation will be provided for Senators to attend at the meeting.  Mr. Hawke is a political person but he is not a Head of State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There will not be time allocated next week for a debate of that nature.  Next week's business will be very important.  We will be taking such legislation as the Companies Bill which many people are waiting for.  The Video Recordings Bill may not be earth shattering but it has implications for us all.  We will also take Committee Stage of the Insurance <Col N="453" /> Bill.  Yesterday I ordered the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Bill for 28 October but we may take that earlier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it inexplicable and illogical that the Leader of the Government Party should desire and encourage a debate on these Estimates everywhere except in this House.  The <Col N="454" /> Dáil will spend four days debating it and the Taoiseach wants it debated everywhere so that people will be aware of its effects but it would appear that the Government party in this House are afraid to face up to, discuss and meet the effects of their own policies.  I demand a vote on this issue.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night before the debate adjourned I was dealing with the problem of young drivers trying to get motor insurance.  It is high time something positive was done to help those people.  Most of them are anxious to comply with the law and have insurance but the exorbitant prices charged by insurance companies puts insurance outside the range of most of those young drivers.  If they are under 25 years of age most of the insurance companies do not want to know about them.  There is a big difference in premiums between here and Great Britain.  I have compared some of the premiums quoted for drivers in Great Britain and those quoted for drivers operating in the Republic and there is a big difference between them.  Obviously there is something wrong with our claims experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another area of contention in recent years has been liability insurance, both public and employers liability.  Most of <Col N="455" /> the insurance companies operating here are reluctant to take on liability insurance.  This is making it absolutely impossible for business people, for people involved in the hotel business and, in particular, for publicans who are trying to provide entertainment at week-ends to get public liability insurance.  For those who can get it the prices are so high that they just cannot afford to pay, particularly now when the trade is more or less dwindling and the turnover is not as good as it was some years ago.  The same applies to small building contractors.  In the past year or two I provided public liability insurance for small building contractors where the premiums amounted to over £3,000 and in one case it was over £4,000.  Unfortunately contractors who have contracts with county councils, public bodies or semi-State bodies have to have public liability insurance before a contract can be signed.  In some cases this can increase the contract price by more than five times.  They cannot do anything about it.  If they do not have public liability insurance they will not get a contract.</P>
    <P>The insurance companies say they are meeting big losses and in 1985 this risk alone showed a loss of £34 million for the insurance companies.  Obviously something will have to be done about this.  It will be absolutely impossible for business people, contractors or engineering firms to continue in business if the price of insurance continues to rise as it has done over the past few years.  I am glad the Government have decided to tackle the area of costs by proceeding in the next Dáil session with a Bill to abolish juries in personal injuries cases.  I understand that the Minister for the Environment plans to introduce new legislation to strengthen the road traffic code and to deal more effectively with certain aspects of uninsured driving and other offences. When that legislation has gone through it will help in no small way to reduce the cost of insurance.  That is what the man in the street is concerned with at present. He wants to get a cheaper premium.  He wants to remain within the law but he <Col N="456" /> wants to get a premium that he can afford to pay.  That is what it is all about.</P>
    <P>The steps outlined by the Government which they propose to take in this session will help in no small way to reduce some of the costs. We all know that the insurance business is very important for the economic life of this country.  We do not want to see insurance companies collapse.  We have had two sad experiences of that before.  We want to see the industry established in a strong and viable position.  I believe that the legislation now before the Seanad will help to strengthen the industry.  It will help to tidy up many of the loopholes that existed there over the last number of years.  It will help the people involved in the industry both the insurance companies themselves and the brokers and agents who are all affected in some way or another by this legislation. The measures now proposed in this Bill will help the industry enormously.  When this Bill has passed through both Houses and has been put into effect the industry will be better because of it.  I sincerely believe that and I have discussed the proposed legislation with people involved in the industry and they are all looking forward to this legislation.  It may create problems for brokers and agents by way of increased costs, for example, if they have to get a bond, if they have to get professional indemnity insurance and all the other things that they are expected to provide under this legislation.  It will add to their costs but in the long run it will be better for the industry and it will be better for themselves.  It will be better for the general public because they will feel that they are dealing with the brokers who are bonded, secure and who are not going to fold up overnight and go away with the funds or in some cases with the money of the general public which they have collected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be the first to admit that the affairs of insurance companies are managed by very responsible people. This in itself is all very well but so far as the supervisory authorities are concerned the system still depends largely on the competence and honesty of those who <Col N="457" /> prepare the returns and even more so on those professional people who certify the returns.  I do not think that this is adequate.  Therefore the Bill is welcome for what it is trying to do in respect of additional supervisory powers.  There were of course powers there and they were availed of relentlessly by former Ministers, Deputy Cluskey and Deputy O'Malley.</P>
      <P>The insurance business is complex particularly when people have the right to spin off into other enterprises.  More is needed to help to bring problems to light more quickly.  When you embark on a lot of enterprises, spill-overs and so on, it is not always possible to keep a tight grip on the supervisory aspects.  Something extra is needed.  In this sense it may be needed not only in the insurance area but also in respect of companies as a whole.</P>
      <P>I would find it difficult to separate one company from another whether that be an insurance company or otherwise.  For this reason there is a special need for some sort of a companies commission rather than the Minister having the whole onus of responsibility of trying to get things brought to light fairly quickly. Since one of the divisions of the Department of Industry and Commerce probably would already be concerning themselves with this aspect, those civil servants with the expertise could be supplemented on an insurance commission by other people who have great expertise and experience, people who know the city as it were.  This should be the case not only in insurance but in linking insurance with other companies.  I do not want to overlap into the Companies Bill but I think it is the same thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This commission would be the principal source of advice to the Minister who in the first instance would appoint them and would set the guidelines and directions. It would be compatible with the Minister having the responsibility and at the same time the commission would be independent.  That would take us out of the situation where in the PMPA, for example, the then Minister Deputy O'Malley had great difficulty over a long <Col N="458" /> period of time in getting the person responsible to co-operate and be more revealing about what was going on and to come down the line to help him to put things on a right footing.  Of course he was resisted all the way.  One of the reasons the resistance took place was that the Minister himself, because he had not got such expertise as a commission who knew the city, even though he was warned he was not given sufficient time. A commission would bring matters to light rather more quickly.  The idea would circumvent the need for constant Ministerial interference which, as the Bill is written at the moment, will be called for. This is good legislation but it will mean that the Minister will have to get involved on a day-to-day basis.  Guidance and direction by a Minister is one thing &mdash; people should always be open to this &mdash; but taking guidance and direction into account, Members of the Oireachtas and the public in general would be dealing with a commission where people would know more of what was going on.</P>
    <P>I do not think the supervisory authority as it exists at the moment has the range of options that could be given to a commission. The options are contained in the Bill but the Minister will not be able to cope with that range of options on a day to day basis.  The disclosure aspects of the Bill could be kept up to date by such a commission.  It would also serve a useful purpose where information of a public or social type is required.  As I said, I cannot see the difference between the companies and the insurance industry.  In the past they have had ample opportunity for self regulation and have not taken it.  They have not taken it as seriously as they might.  However, the Bill recognises this in the sense that there is more Ministerial concern but I believe the Minister has enough to watch out for and his watch dog should be this type of commission with city expertise to supplement the work of the civil servants who have done a very good job but have been limited in some ways.</P>
    <P>To work effectively the commission would have to have sanctions available to them.  I do not mean that they would have <Col N="459" /> to apply the sanctions but if the Minister applied the sanctions, in essence what would happen is that they would be given the powers to take steps for enforcement. The question of regulations could also be subject to consultation and some initiatives could be taken by the commission to assist the Minister in respect of regulations. This would be the best way to protect the Minister's supervisory powers.  I still insist it is too big a job for the ministerial staff.  If we look back at the uncertain solvency of non life insurance companies we have to admit that it calls for greater diligence.  I believe the Bill is trying to provide that.  All I am doing is putting a point of view which I think will advance and strengthen those powers of application.  Greater diligence could be applied by the commission who would be specifically there to deal with insurance and companies.  I cannot separate the company from the insurance.</P>
    <P>Insurance is a serious business.  We have to refer to the PMPA when we are dealing with insurance.  It is a company that can not be left out of a debate such as this and we have to learn from history. It is a frightening fact that perhaps 450,000 people were going to be affected by the loss of policy.  I have had experience in the trade union movement.  Many officials joined a certain insurance society many years ago and it went broke and they had no cover for the year.  They had to renew it.  It is a very serious step for people when their car insurance is snuffed out like that.  It is not always possible for people to find £600 or £700, when the occasion arises, for full comprehensive insurance to cover all aspects of what they are doing, whether it is earning a living for themselves or trying to protect their family.  It is a very substantial amount of money to be taken out of a family without any fall back.</P>
    <P>I know that has been remedied.  In fact, it was remedied in the Bill introduced by a former Minister Deputy Cluskey.  On that occasion in the Dáil I think everybody supported it.  That is why I think it is necessary.  It emphasises the fact that an earlier warning light and closer vigilance <Col N="460" /> are needed to assist the Minister to give effect to the contents of this Bill and perhaps add to it.</P>
    <P>The Cluskey Bill took care of certain rights but what we were dealing with there was emergency legislation and obviously it could not do much more than see to it that people did not have to scramble for alternative cover.  It did a few other good things too.  It highlighted the problem.  Credit is due to all the people in the Fianna Fáil Government at the time and also to Deputy Cluskey for living with the problem and finally bringing it to a head and protecting the public interest.  The supervisory powers were there too and if they had not been used and used well the situation would have been disastrous.  It is a very serious situation. The supervision process by the Minister's Department was good.</P>
    <P>I still think the range of options needs something more than that the Minister be left with the onus &mdash; rather than having this kind of expertise there for him &mdash; not only to deal with insurance but to deal with the question of bringing problems to light at a faster pace.  Because of the way companies go and the way difficulties arise for business people in recession periods it is quite a serious matter and there is an obligation on us to do as much as we can to get this brought to light faster.  Under the powers that existed for Deputy Cluskey and Deputy O'Malley, the problems in the PMPA went back to about 1977 and it was 1983 before they could be brought to a head.  In other words, I do not think the PMPS, the provident society, would have been in as much difficulty had we these type of powers with a supervisory commission in existence.  If it had gone much further the consequences would have been disastrous. I take this insurance matter very seriously indeed.  The will of the Oireachtas was defied by one man.  Perhaps it was the Minister he was defying, but the Minister was acting on behalf of the Oireachtas.  He was defying the will of the Oireachtas to run down the provident society side of it when in fact he was advised to do it a long time before that <Col N="461" /> by the Minister responsible to the Government.</P>
    <P>I have not much more to say.  This is a very good Bill.  The 1983 Bill went a long way towards dealing with the question of appointing administrators through to an insurer and so on to help to achieve a viable position.  I do not think we can take the risk again even though these powers are extensive.  Because we have increased the powers and extended them, we should take a much more serious look at the insurance scene.  The Minister needs that backup support and I advocate it now.  It could well be argued that the present supervisory authority, the Minister's office and the civil servants, is adequate.  I do not think it is.  If it is not hived off already there will be a separation in the Department of Industry and Commerce and that separation would be supplemented by more expertise on the question of insurance.  The Government might take time to think about the value of it and the whole area of company law.  It is quite a serious matter.  We are talking about compensation funds, the Minister's power, and the type of sanctions that can be applied.  It is very extensive and I do not think the situation is adequate.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to say that probably the most serious aspect of the problems in the PMPA at the time &mdash; and this could apply to any insurance company but particularly to one that grows to the extent of the PMPA was that it got out of hand and became over ambitious.  In that case 2,000 people could have lost their jobs, a prospect that would be very serious at any time but even more serious in times of recession.  The commission who have expertise in the field of insurance should be supplemented by experts who have a knowledge of the City and extend beyond insurance.  We should think of that other operation, too, and regard the two as one for the purpose of providing greater vigilance and greater assistance to the Minister who will not be able to apply the contents of this Bill on a day to day basis without some substantial assistance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill on a number of counts.  It was prepared by the previous Government and it is courageous and indeed proper that it be brought forward in this way like the Companies Bill and other legislation.  I welcome it also because it has been introduced in the Seanad.  I am sure it will get the attention that all other Bills introduced in the Seanad have received and that when it leaves the Seanad it will be a far different Bill.  I welcome it also because it is long awaited and very timely.  It is a Bill that requires close study but in order to make a meaningful contribution in this House it would be necessary to have some expertise or knowledge in that area.  Since I do not have such qualification, I will confine my contribution to some comments on different sections of the Bill.</P>
      <P>In his very comprehensive introductory speech the Minister told us that the Bill as published has three basic objectives, that these are:</P>
      <P>First, to strengthen the Minister's legislative powers in relation to the supervision of insurers; second, to regulate commissions paid to intermediaries, where the policyholders' interests so require and third, to introduce a form of regulation for insurance intermediaries.</P>
      <P>This, more or less, corresponds to the information given in the explanatory and financial memorandum.  I feel that a fourth objective could be given for the Bill as published, that is, that elevating the status of the broker through virtual legislation under sections 37 and 38 would have a very meaningful and positive contribution to the insurance industry. Unfortunately, it seems that sections 37 and 38 are not being proceeded with or, in any event, will be amended.  My understanding is that while the Bill has received a very warm welcome in the area of insurance, the brokerage areas await with some anxiety the amendments to those and other sections to which the Minister has referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As nothing more than a positive criticism of the Bill, I feel that perhaps when <Col N="463" /> a certain period had expired, when the Bill before us was printed and changed from a Dáil Bill to a Seanad Bill, it might have included the variations and amendments the Minister referred to.  There is a certain anxiety, not knowing what those amendments will be but in a Second Stage speech it is necessary almost to omit any reference to those sections.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey dealt with the cost of insurance.  This is a very important aspect.  I recall that in this House we had a debate on the insurance problems of small businesses &mdash; the Fifth Report of the Joint Committee on Small Businesses which was a very comprehensive report. Perhaps this has very little relevance directly to the Bill but in the long term and in general it must have some implications. In that report, on page 61, the committee referred to legislation on insurance broking and I quote:</P>
    <P>The forthcoming Bill to provide for the regulation of financial intermediaries should stipulate (1) the establishment of an insurance brokers council which would have official recognition and be responsible for the registration and conduct of brokers, (2) Minimum solvency ratios for brokers and disclosure as required by the Department of Industry and Commerce, (3) That each registered insurance broker carry compulsory professional indemnity cover and (4) a contingency fund to insure full protection for all clients of registered brokers.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the first recommendation is for the establishment of an insurance brokers' council but it seems that this may not be forthcoming.  I await the Minister's reply with regard to this. Obviously the committee felt it was most important that this council be established. Furthermore, on page 58 of that report there is reference to the educational qualifications for insurance brokers. Again, I quote:</P>
    <P>While acknowledging the contention of the insurance brokers that insurance is becoming an increasingly complex <Col N="464" /> and specialised area we were struck by the lack of any formal minimum educational requirements for insurance broking.  We recommend that the proposed insurance brokers council arrange at the very least third level part-time release courses with appropriate VECs leading to a qualification without which an individual could not gain membership of the council.</P>
    <P>In the view of the committee that was considered very important.  I hope that the amendments to be introduced by the Minister will recognise this report and the necessity for the legislation as recommended in it.  I appreciate that the Minister in his introductory speech has given us an assurance that legislation will be introduced which will result in reducing the cost of insurance.  The Minister stated there was an inter-departmental committee which made recommendations and I hope the views of that inter-departmental committee, together with the views of the Oireachtas joint committee, will be taken into consideration as well.</P>
    <P>Through the influence of a colleague who is a broker and who is on the Cean-annus Mór Urban District Council I had the advantage of meeting a member of the National Insurance Brokers' Association to get their views.  Of course, a submission has been made by this association to the Minister and I am sure he is familiar with all of the details.  Other Members of the House have also met members of that association, as is normal practice when Bills are being introduced. I do not have expertise in this area. Therefore, I will refer briefly to a few aspects of the Bill and ask the Minister to take account of what I say and perhaps refer to some of these matters in his reply.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 7, the Minister stated that fees would be simply used to defray the costs involved with applications under sections 37 and 38.  In a sense it is pointless to make an issue at this stage of fees since sections 37 and 38 will be amended, but I hope if fees are introduced they will be simply to defray these expenses and that they will not in <Col N="465" /> any sense or at any time be used as income.</P>
    <P>Under section 12 there is a provision that the Minister may make regulations for the proper exercise of his functions under the Insurance Acts in respect of the valuation of assets of an insurance undertaking.  It is contended that this could have a knock-on effect and would reduce the credit available to brokers. Perhaps this could be expanded on on Committee Stage.  Overall the Bill will get more attention on Committee and later Stages but I mention it in passing and perhaps the Minister would take it up in his reply.</P>
    <P>Section 16 deals with prior notice and display of policy terms and premium rates.  This is excellent.  It has the support of the industry and all the members of the industry which the Minister referred to in his speech.  There are some companies who do not make the rate books easily available to the public.  It is very difficult to understand why this should be so.  In other countries this is not the situation.  It would lead to a more efficient and professional service if those rates were available.  As I understand it, motor quotations and other quotations are available instantly in the United Kingdom market.  I do not see why this should not be the situation in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Section 28 deals with the insurance compensation fund.  Other Members have referred to the situation with regard to the PMPA.  We are all paying an extra 1 per cent levy at present which amounts to £11 million per year.  Again the Minister has dealt with this in his contribution. Section 28 (2) states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo; `person' does not include a body corporate or unincorporated body of persons.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it seems that small businesses, such as the small grocer or the publican are excluded.  It is difficult to understand why this should be so.  They are paying premiums the same as individuals and I would make the suggestion to the Minister that perhaps it would be better to reduce the cover but to include all.</P>
    <P>Section 30 deals with the power to <Col N="466" /> require reduction in commissions.  I have no criticism of this except to say that perhaps the argument could be developed on Committee Stage.  It is unlikely that there would be any change in this area.  It seems perhaps to be equated with payment.  Obviously in the work situation the better a person is paid the more efficient one would expect them to be.  While the Minister has said that in general it is the policyholder who pays for the difference, or the service is reduced to some extent, I feel that some argument could be made to show that this is not always so.</P>
    <P>Section 31 deals with the prohibition of certain commission payments.  I welcome this in so far as it is intended to prevent circumvention of the commissions' agreement and that it prohibits non-monetary inducements.  I would sound a word of caution that it should not stifle co-operation in technology, marketing and product development, which is important at this time.  In the area of insurance, technological advance is most important and advantage should be taken of up-to-date technology.  I hope this prohibition would not stifle the development of insurance companies in the technological area, for example, in the provision of software or whatever is required to keep up-to-date in the computer area.  This should be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>Under section 31 (2) the timing of commission credits is dealt with.  There are two sides involved in the insurance industry &mdash; the life and the non-life.  The Bill does not differentiate between the two. The case has been made that just this one section falls flat in the non-life or the general insurance area.  It seems that the theory of having to wait is wrong and the present financial difficulties have brought about a situation where a client may use premium payment plan facilities.  There is a genuine difficulty here for brokers. Perhaps this section could be amended or removed although it is considered quite acceptable with regard to life insurance.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill is regarded by the brokers at any rate as the real crux of the legislation.  The Minister has dealt fairly comprehensively with this matter in his <Col N="467" /> introductory speech.  The case has been made by the brokerage associations that it will be less costly to supervise the members of their associations.  Therefore, members of the NIBA, for example, should have to pay less in fees because they would require less supervision by the Department.  This is logical and reasonable.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, amendments will be introduced here and the section will be replaced.  The people ask what the replacement will be and whether it will be effective?  Professional indemnity insurance will not become a legal requirement to operate as a broker and I understand that all members of the NIBA have professional indemnity, which is also in the interest of the insurers, the people who pay for the policies.  It appears there is no sense in any association providing professional indemnity if those who are not involved in an association do not have to make this provision.  In general if the association do not get the support of the Government they do not see why they should continue it, and this is reasonable. The Minister stated in his speech:</P>
    <P>However numerous individual brokers made it clear to me that for various reasons they would not be prepared to join either of the existing broking bodies.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be in a better position than any Member of this House to know the numbers involved, but this appears to be a case of the tail wagging the dog. If the Minister feels that it is in the interest of the industry to go ahead with sections 37 and 38, while taking into account whatever representations are made by any of those bodies, it does not seem right that some individuals who perhaps for good or not so good reasons decided they would not be prepared to join any of those bodies.  I do not see the logic of omitting two sections or changing them radically, if the reasoning hinges on individual members.  I am sure when the Minister has said numerous individuals have made representations the number would be quite large.  I would be <Col N="468" /> interested to hear the Minister's reply with regard to this problem.</P>
    <P>Section 39 deals with the insurance bond for brokers, the compensation bond or fidelity bond to protect the consumer against fraud.  The Minister dealt with this very fully and there is nothing in that to which I would take exception.</P>
    <P>Section 41 deals with insurance agents' qualifications.  The agent has an important role.  The broker associations have made a very good case to limit the agent to a maximum of four agencies.  If you take four of the top insurance firms, an agent having four agencies could be dealing with firms who cover 80 per cent of the insurance in this country.  The broker has a more costly undertaking than the agent.  A broker, for example, must have a bond.  He must have professional indemnity.  To be a member of a brokerage association, he must have certain qualifications and experience, and he must be responsible for his actions.  There are some very good agents, and I have dealt with agents over the years and I have got very good service, and at times when money was scarce the agent I dealt with for car insurance, for example, was prepared to take the money as I was able to pay it and a personal relationship existed with the agent.  Nevertheless the agent does not need to have a bond. He does not need to have professional indemnity.  He does not require any qualifications. He can become an agent without any experience.  The companies are responsible for his actions.  This is a problem where an agent would have more than one agency.  In circumstances where an agent might default or forget to forward completed application form proposals or in some way be responsible for the witholding of those, it would be difficult if that agent had more than one agency to determine which company should be responsible.  To limit the agent to a maximum of four agencies is reasonable and an agent who has more than four agencies should be a broker.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to industrial insurance business, which is covered in section 22. I welcome this legislation.  Coming from a rural area I know the insurance man <Col N="469" /> was a very important individual in the countryside down through the years.  I would not say he was as welcome as the postman or some other individuals who called regularly but nevertheless he fulfilled a very important role.  The weekly premiums were collected on a door-to-door basis and the sums assured were always very low.  The Minister has covered this very comprehensively.  The situation has changed, we have credit unions and more people have cheque books and it is a waste of time for insurance agents to call around when the sum assured is so low.  I welcome the increases in the Bill.  It is interesting to note the Minister's figures with regard to the decline in this type of assurance.</P>
    <P>I welcome the change with regard to assets.  I do not see where any significant difference arises but obviously those in the insurance business feel that it will help and I welcome that also.  The frequency of collection will be changed to not less than two months, which denote the changing times and the change in trends as I am sure that it will give a fillip to the industrial insurance business.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill for the reasons I have mentioned.  It is very important legislation and I look forward to the Minister's reply and the remaining Stages of the debate, I am sure that when it leaves this House it will be much different from the Bill we were presented with at the start.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be extremely brief. I am glad the Minister is seeking to strengthen the powers of supervision in this area and I am glad he will be empowered to regulate commission for intermediaries.  I developed over my adult life an increasing scepticism about self-regulating professions, whether it be my own profession of engineering or other professions such as law, medicine and so on.  I am not at all convinced that the consumer of any of those services is ultimately well served by a self-regulated profession.  Originally, some of these proposals were put forward and were then dropped because the profession undertook <Col N="470" /> to deal with them in a self-regulating way.  The experience of the lay person dealing with many of these professions would suggest that, whatever the good intention behind self-regulation, the experience is that self-regulation means self-interest and that obviously is neither in the interest of the consumer nor in the interest of the efficient operation of services or professions within a free market economy &mdash; whatever my views on that might be, but I will come to that in a moment.</P>
      <P>The things that insurance companies get away with never cease to amaze me and there seems to be a continual need to pursue, particularly in some areas, the extraordinary methods they have of avoiding or maximising the payments of people.  One that came to my attention recently was the experience of somebody who had had a no-claims bonus on motor insurance for a considerable number of year.  He went abroad and was not an insured motorist for a couple of years and on his return he was told that as he had not had insurance on a car for more than two years he would lose all his no-claims bonus and would be treated again as a novice driver.  I would defy any insurance company to produce evidence on the basis of claims made against them to justify that sort of loading; in other words, to produce evidence that people who had not been insured for a couple of years became immediately a higher risk to the extent of losing their entire no-claims bonus simply because they were not insured for a couple of years.  I find that astonishing and I do not believe that there is any evidence to sustain it.  It is simply another little trick by the insurance companies to extract a few bob from people in an area which they have, because of the law, something close to a monopoly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also ought to reflect a little on the nature of insurance and what it is all about.  It reflects philosophically the fundamental insecurity of human life, at least in the area of life assurance.  It is interesting that in Sweden there is a remarkably low level of savings and there are two reasons for that.  First, Swedes pay an extraordinarily high proportion of <Col N="471" /> their GNP in taxation and, secondly, in many areas of life people in Sweden do not feel the need for insurance because of the security that a welfare state of the scale and comprehensiveness that they have offers to them.  People there do not feel a need to have substantial life assurance and this reduces the level of savings quite dramatically.  The analysis I am relying on for that information comes from an article I read in <i>The Economist</i> some months ago.  Many people in Ireland would find that astonishing and quite appalling and if it did not work they would assure you that it could not work, because from commentaries on recent events many people feel that certain things are impossible.  Many of the things that we were told were impossible are working quite efficiently and successfully in other areas.</P>
    <P>Insurance is now an enormous business. Large sums of money are paid by people in all areas of life, for pension, life assurance, general insurance and, the most obvious one, motor insurance.  I agree that the motor insurance companies are dealing with an area of high risk and low profitability but the whys and the wherefores of that is another day's work.  Huge sums of money are available to insurance companies and those huge sums of money can become an instrument of power in our society.  That is why I welcome the decision to extend regulation in this area because, while it may be limited and only on the periphery, it gives rise to one of the fundamental problems western society is beginning to notice.</P>
    <P>The whole deregulation of the area of the financial markets and the interaction of pension funds and institutions on the financial markets is to considerably increase the capacity of those areas to determine the course society must take. The mythological marketplace which welcomes a Government decision or does not welcome a Government decision is not some sort of weather vane of public opinion with an infallible capacity to understand what is good and bad for all of us.  It is a small group of people with a <Col N="472" /> particular form of collective self-interest and that collective self-interest, in the words of <i>The Irish Times,</i> recognises no imperative either of patriotism or politics and that is the underlying reality of where all of us, of necessity, have to lodge considerable parts of our income in order to secure ourselves, our homes, or our children.</P>
    <P>The underlying distaste that I hold for this whole area is that the real motivating force behind all of this has got very little to do with my or our collective wellbeing or security and a lot to do with the advancement of the wealth and power of a relatively small number of people in our society and in western society generally. If I was to draw an extreme analogy, the regulations here are on the perhiphery of the business and they are somewhat like regulating how much one pays to get into a brothel while ignoring what goes on inside.  Sooner or later in our society &mdash; and probably later with the way we are going &mdash; the power of institutions to dictate what Government can and cannot do will have to be confronted and sooner or later, the fears of people for their security, old age, health and their children's education, that are now the stuff on which large-scale insurance packages are based, will have to be confronted.  The presumption that these are all matters for individual decision and that the sense of collective solidarity has no role in the future will also have to be confronted.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, I am glad we are moving in a direction which is not fashionable in western society.  It may be that we are just catching up with a minimalist level of regulation but I am glad we are moving in that direction.  I hope that at some stage that somebody will confront the fundamental question of what sort of power the control over huge sums of our money gives to a relatively small number of people, what sort of considerations motivate these people, whether those considerations are necessarily as compatible with the national interest and the interests of all of us as many would have us believe and whether the sort of power they have is appropriate is all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="473" /> I am glad we are moving in the direction which is opposite to the fashion. A slightly sordid image has been around in certain matters to do with insurance because of the collapse of the PMPA, the extraordinary mismanagement of their affairs by AIB, which resulted in the State having to rescue them and, on the other side, the experiences of ordinary small people with dubious insurance brokerages with a very unsavoury record. All of these things deserve more scrutiny; all of these things deserve the backup of legislation.  At the end of it, and underlying it all, I am particularly happy that we are moving further away in this legislation from the idea of letting a profession regulate itself.</P>
    <P>I encourage the Minister, with his interest in things like competition and prices and all those areas, to look at all of the professions on the whole concept of self-regulation, self-regulation of the legal profession, and the medical professional itself.  It is both fashionable and popular.  I have a profound instinct that, when you have a minority group with a monopoly in a particular area of professional activity and they are in favour of self-regulation, the rest of us who have to depend on that service have good reason to be suspicious.  Competition is the best quality a free market economy has to offer the consumer.  It is not necessarily the most important quality that a society ought to have, but it is the best one.</P>
    <P>It is an interesting fact that many of those who most talk about the value of competition operate from professions where that is the one thing that is almost entirely absent from the professional activity, that is, competition on the basis of quality and price of service.  Therefore, since we are talking about regulating one area of activity, perhaps the Minister might, at some stage in the future, address his interest to the other areas of business and professional activity where so-called self-regulation is no more than a protection of what would be in other areas described as a closed shop or antiquated <Col N="474" /> work practices, or one or other of the clichés used to describe certain areas of the workforce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this Bill which, it is being said, is the most important legislation on the insurance industry in the past 50 years.  The Government are very anxious and eager to regulate the insurance industry.  Progress in that direction has already been made in relation to the commission's agreement between the Irish Insurance Federation and the Minister. It is publicly acknowledged that the cost of insurance and of manufacturing this product &mdash; it is a product the same as any other product sold in the marketplace &mdash; is too high.  The cost of administration and distribution of the product, particularly in relation to life insurance based products, is higher than it should be.  These factors have shown the urgent need to rationalise the insurance industry. These issues have also concentrated the minds of some insurers to think in terms of direct sales in order to hold on to or increase their market share in the future when competition will come from the banks as well as from building societies and any other financial institutions competing on a regular basis for the regular saver's money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that regard I can understand and appreciate what Senator Fallon, Senator Hussey and Senator Fitzsimons said in relation to agents and the fact that insurance companies bring in a group of people, give them a crash course and set them free on an unsuspecting public.  I would view the development in that area a little differently.  Insurance companies will slowly change in the future into quasi-banks where the broker becomes the underwriting agent.  Those who are not geared to operate in this way and who depend on agents of different kinds will be forced into oblivion in the future.  It is interesting to note that the agent is already being displaced by the direction and the action that the banks themselves are taking in the broader financial services market.  By reducing production and administration costs the industry <Col N="475" /> should be in a position to improve the quality of service it offers at cheaper rates.  As the Minister said and all the other speakers mentioned, the costs of insurance are too high.  Some classes of risks have difficulty in securing cover. Significant changes and improvements will have to be seen in these areas to take account of competition from other financial institutions in the battle for the saver's money.  It becomes more and more important for the market to regulate itself.</P>
    <P>In relation to risks and premiums, the premiums charged will be dictated by the occurrence of claims in the class of insurance in question.  If losses are high and frequent, premiums will be high.  This is especially the case in areas of immense importance to the general public, notably motor insurance and fire insurance.  The premiums sought by insurers for motor insurance are nothing short of scandalous. I welcome the Government's intention to introduce a Bill to abolish juries in personal injury cases.  The insurance industry has long claimed that the operation of the jury system has been largely responsible for the very high premiums. However, I will not hold my breath awaiting a fall in premiums.</P>
    <P>I had occasion recently to hear to a large insurer speaking and he seemed to be playing a very different tune when he felt that the abolition of the jury system was imminent.  Other factors seem to be assuming a far greater importance in relation to premiums being charged.  It is important that we keep that point in mind.  Insurers have been playing a particular card continually over a period of time.  They find now that that card is to be taken away from them and they look for something else to justify the huge cost of premiums.</P>
    <P>I wholeheartedly endorse the recommendations in the report of the interdepartmental committee as outlined in the Minister's speech.  A number of people have mentioned the problem of young people trying to get insurance.  In many cases they are not even quoted and where they are quoted, the loading on <Col N="476" /> the premiums is absolutely enormous. People will have to recognise that a young person's job could be dependent on his having a motor car.  The premiums quoted in some cases are greater than the cost of the car.  That is a ridiculous situation.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the young people &mdash; and we have 50 per cent of our population under the age of 25 &mdash; it is essential at this time that they be given the opportunity to get some sort of realistic insurance on cars.  A number of reasons are given as to why premiums are so high, not least the number of vehicles that are uninsured and the number of uninsured drivers operating.  It is understandable why that number is so high.  I am not saying for one moment that I agree with that but I am specifying why the case is so.</P>
    <P>The Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland was set up to alleviate hardship for the victims of uninsured motorists. In fairness, it is totally financed by the insurance industry.  With regard to the cost of claims, it is an example of the huge problem we have in relation to motor insurance that the figure is somewhere in the region of £50 million per annum in relation to claims made through accidents from uninsured motorists.  The bureau exists to administer a compensation fund to aid the victims of the wrongdoer for personal injury.  Again I am open to correction, but I understand that somewhere between 150,000 and 200,000 motorists are uninsured out of a total of approximately 750,000.  That is an average of about one in five.  The corresponding figure in Great Britain is one in 12.</P>
    <P>The chief reason for uninsured drivers is the high cost of motor insurance.  There is a lesson there for both the insurance industry and the general public.  The insurance industry must show a bit of realism in the type of premiums they offer.  The general public must become more aware of the responsibility they have in relation to uninsured drivers.  The only occasion when uninsured drivers are really highlighted is in the case of joyriders but there are vast numbers of people who are abusing the system.  The onus is on the general public to become <Col N="477" /> more civic minded in this respect and encourage and demand from people that they should get adequate insurance cover.  It is a chicken and egg situation. Should the motor insurance industry take the lead in this direction and offer facilities that would be realistic particularly to young people or, on the other hand, should the initiative come from the other side?  The motor insurance industry have an enormous role to play in this direction.</P>
    <P>There is one other area to which I would like to make a brief reference. That is public liability and fire insurance. The difficulties experienced in the business sector and other areas has been adequately dealt with by other speakers but there is one area that has not been mentioned in the debate so far.  That is public liability insurance for small rural halls and community centres throughout the country.  Trying to get insurance cover is a tremendous burden on them. We must remember that they are all voluntary organisations.  In many cases they became the focal point for small villages when schools closed down through amalgamation. Indeed they have replaced the national schools in many areas as the focal point of the community.  They are a result of community spirit.  They are the life blood of many small local communities. They find themselves in difficulty at the moment because of the enormous premiums quoted in order to get cover for the different types of events they organise.  Much effort and expense and in the vast majority of cases Government grants have gone into the development of these community centres.  If something is not done in the near future in relation to the huge premiums charged for public liability insurance on those places they will close down as has happened in some cases.  That would be a great tragedy.  I appeal to the Minister and to the insurance.  If we look at to take a look at that particular section in relation to insurance.  If we look at statistics the number of claims made by community centres are few and far between.  If you go on the basis that the premium being charged is related to the risk that is being taken, it is totally out <Col N="478" /> of balance.  I am making a very strong plea on behalf of those community centres.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and give it my wholehearted support but I would hope that my comments would be taken into consideration particularly in relation to the under-25 drivers and also in relation to public liability insurance for small community centres.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief also because other Members wish to speak before the Minister replies.  I want to make a few points about the purpose of the Bill which is to add to the Minister's supervisory powers in relation to insurance companies, to provide powers to the Minister to regulate commission payments to insurance intermediaries and to introduce a system for the regulation in the public interest of insurance brokers and agents.  The Labour Party are totally supportive of this Bill, not because some of our colleagues were members of a previous Cabinet who published the Bill, but because we are genuinely interested in the consumer and in the overall benefit to the public.  In the long term we hope, and this point was touched on by Senator McKenna, that in regulating the insurance industry, premiums and in particular motor premiums can be reduced somewhat.  We think it is desirable to regulate by ministerial regulation the requirements for brokers and indeed the qualifications that are required of them in a very important area.  We deal with public liability, we deal with fire insurance, motor insurance mortgage insurance and life assurance and their benefit and otherwise to pension funds.</P>
      <P>I will deal briefly with some of those headings because they are important. The Minister will be aware of our interest and concern in these areas that affect all our constituents and, indeed, touch on most of our family lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the area of public liability, the area touched on by Senator McKenna, there is the difficulty that people are now becoming so conscious of their rights to compensation for all sorts of eventualities, <Col N="479" /> that the problem created for voluntary bodies in particular to get adequate public liability is enormous.  It is well nigh impossible for rural organisations to run any kind of function in parish halls or sports fields, such as agricultural shows, whether they are run under the auspices of Muintir na Tíre, Macra or anybody else.  The premium being requested for public liability in these areas is putting it out of reach of small community organisations.  Senator McKenna is right in highlighting that as an area which the Minister should address.  A national organisation such as the GAA and other foundations have funds set aside for this purpose but we must have regard for the smaller people who have to take out insurance before they are permitted by law to perform useful functions in the area of local community activity.  This also applies, but to a lesser extent, to small businesses and indeed to politicians who provide a valuable service in their constituencies.  It has come to my notice that if somebody arrives at a house to discuss a problem and trips up on the doorstep, even though they arrived there of their own free will, it is possible that if anything happened to them they could possibly claim on the politician who made himself available to the public.</P>
    <P>We must look at what people now consider to be their rights and demand that that makes on people who want to give a service such as a clinic advice service by politicians which will now be more in demand following the decimation of the Community Services Board which regulated community advice centres on a voluntary basis throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The question of fire insurance is one that nobody seems to be able to come to grips with because of the average clause that is built in by most companies which makes it almost obligatory that each year the value of one's property has to be index-linked somehow.  Otherwise if one is unfortunate enough to have a fire and is under-insured in the opinion of the insurance company, they will only pay the fraction that they consider one is <Col N="480" /> insured for irrespective of the capital sum covered.</P>
    <P>The cost of motor insurance is one of the reasons why so many uninsured young drivers are on our roads today. This was also touched on by Senator McKenna who gave statistics to prove it. Where the State makes insurance obligatory or compulsory for third party road users, then certainly the State would intervene much earlier in the efforts of young people to get reasonable insurance cover on a third party basis at least for the cars they drive or want to drive to get to work.  If the State makes it obligatory then the State should look at their own requirements about providing cover if it is not provided to a reasonable extent by the private sector.  My experience in making representations to the Minister in this area is that one must prove that five companies have refused to quote before the Minister will implement some of the powers he has to ensure that cover is given to young drivers.</P>
    <P>It is possibly the number of claims from that sector that makes it almost uneconomic for some insurance companies to give cover at all.  We must commend the insurance industry for having set up the motor insurance bureau which does to some extent cover the ordinary public from damages to their person by uninsured drivers.  That was the first welcome step we have seen from the insurance industry.  By levying one another they set up an overall fund which protects the common good and protects people who are injured by uninsured drivers.</P>
    <P>In that regard I want to bring to the Minister's attention my concern that the Wexford truck driver who proved to be a hero in the Zeebrugge tragedy found himself not insured for the loss of his vehicle on board that ill-fated ferry.  To say the least it was mean of the company to consider that it was his business to have marine insurance for the loss of his truck.  This man saved many people's lives but he has lost his own livelihood as a result of having lost his truck in that tragedy.  How many people who are road users and owners of vehicles know that a specific policy is required if they use <Col N="481" /> ferries, B &amp; I and all the other ferries into which we as a State, have some input. Clarification from the Minister's Department in this regard would be welcome because if disaster struck one of the ferries under our aegis and if people lost their lives that would be a tragedy and could not be compensated for but if they lost their property in this way they would not be covered.  In this instance it is the loss of a man's livelihood.  The Minister should use his good offices to intervene with the ferry company although they are in another jurisdiction.  This man intervened to save people and lost his property and was then told that it was his business to have his truck insured.</P>
    <P>The question of mortgage insurance is a bit of a laugh now because whereas changes were made recently which allowed mortgage holders to have the option of having their own insurance companies, the mortgage companies made the requirements so difficult that it would be inadvisable for people to change even at their own free will to another insurance company to insure their risks because of the regulations that have been laid down.  I have read them and they are unusual.</P>
    <P>Life insurance is another most difficult area to explain particularly to old age pensioners who are visited weekly by these agents for the 2s.6d. premium and the 3s. 4d., the 20p premium and the 24p premium.  If one tries to work out tax-free allowances for old age pensioners, because they are in the tax net if they have other small pensions, and tries to improve their tax-free allowances by ensuring that all their expenditure including life insurance is taken into account by the tax man, one finds that these old age pensioners can have up to 20 and 25 policies, the total amount of which would not bury them.  They have been paying premiums for 30 or 40 years.  There should be some stop put on companies who just continually collect small premiums from people in the knowledge that if they die their next of kin would get £20, £25 and a prize bond after 20 years.  There should be some limit because many of these policies have been paid over 20 and <Col N="482" /> 30 times.</P>
    <P>In that area the Minister should look at the question of life assurance.  When I mention life assurance I must express my concern at the Taoiseach's recent announcement that he would be disposed towards considering the disposal of Irish Life.  Why would any Taoiseach or any Government dispose of an insurance company which has been beneficial to the State and gives a useful service to the State?  Then two days afterwards somebody put a value on it of £200 million. From all our expertise and all our knowledge of this company we believe it is valued at at least £600 million and I would not be for advocating its disposal at all.  I was surprised to hear that proposal which had surfaced previously and had been reneged on because there was no popular support for it.  For some reason we are prepared to hand away the State's investment in this area to the private sector to reap further private profits.  That is a step backwards.  I hope the Minister will bring my views at least to the Taoiseach's attention. We deserve more than the disposal by the State of what is a profitable enterprise. It should not be handed over for a song to the private sector.</P>
    <P>The powers that will be conferred on the Minister by this legislation are welcomed. We hope he will implement them.  The Minister spoke about changing some of the sections in the Bill.  There is a fundamental difference between an agent and a broker and it is vitally important that we realise that brokers must have some degree of competence, that they be required to prove their competence and to have a bond.  If a broker is taking onto himself the role of representing companies the least the public are entitled to by way of self-protection is that the broker is bonded in the event of a problem.  We dealt with this in relation to the travel agency business.  That was a welcome development.  It protected the consumers in that area.  Likewise this development is an important one.  It is not unreasonable that somebody who acts as an insurance broker should be able to insure himself on this bond.  If he is acting as a broker for four or five reputable <Col N="483" /> companies he should have no difficulty in getting a bond to cover this amount even if he spreads it between four or five companies. The premium involved to protect the interests of the public would be very little but would be a welcome development. It is appropriate, too, that a broker would be obliged to disclose on his insurance documentation details of the companies he is acting for.  I see nothing wrong with that concept.  At least the public would have options and would know that the broker is registered and qualified to represent certain companies. That is the only way we can overcome the doubts people have about being insured properly.</P>
    <P>I do not think an agent has the same responsibilities as a broker.  An agent's job is to go and collect money which is then channelled through a brokerage back to the parent company.  The Minister has approached this question in the right way in the various sections which seek to regulate how that process will evolve.  All of us welcome that.  Why should a broker not have qualifications? Auctioneers usually have very little by way of qualification.  They are like politicians; they stand up on a platform and start talking.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="484" /> These are my overall comments on the Bill.  It is important that the public, the consumers should be protected.  If this Bill goes some of the way towards insuring their protection in the long term I hope it will be successful.  I hope, too, that it will put some semblance of regulation into the industry which, as Senator Ryan has said, up to now has been self-regulatory. This is welcome in a way but it is totally dependent on their goodwill. The State has a role to play in ensuring that when people project themselves as doing something or giving a service which is paid for at the end of the day by a consumer, that consumer is entitled to the full rights, protections and the rigours of the law.  It is obvious from some of the experiences that have been quoted by Senators in regard to insurance that that is an industry which is booming.  Advantage has been taken of people's obligations to have insurance by way of State regulation, statutory obligations and laws.  It is important then that the State should intervene to ensure that there is a reasonableness about how premiums are complied.  It is appropriate that the Minister should have regulations to intervene where exorbitant commissions are being charged, because this has a bearing on the overall cost of insurance.  Likewise the legislation about juries should have an impact.  Originally the industry claimed that the reason the premiums were so high was because juries were too liberal in cases in which insurance companies were paying.  As Senator McKenna said, they are now backing off a bit.  Any time there is a suggestion that premiums should be lowered because of the State's intervention the industry screams and gives another reason for having premiums so high, if not higher.  We hope that the Bill will have the desired effect. It will have the support of the Labour Party in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution on this very important Bill will be brief. Insurance is vital for people in this day and age.  This Bill has been described as the most important in the insurance industry since 1936.  For that reason we <Col N="485" /> must tease the Bill out fully with a view to ensuring that it will see the industry through tough days for the next 50 years. The Bill deals with the commissions payable to agents and brokers and with additional powers the Minister will have with regard to the examination of insurance companies.  This is very important work and it is necessary that this kind of activity be fully monitored at all times by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Many people say that if we had been as vigilant some years ago as we are today the collapse of the PMPA might not have happened.  Many people say also that we ought to have known about the ICI problem.  I hope that this Bill will produce a better investigating climate which will not allow companies to go out of business in the future.</P>
      <P>The public at large are more concerned with the real problem of insurance as they see it: the cost of insurance, the availability of cover, whether they are insured with a good insurance company or if they get any cover.  These are the problems that are affecting the community. It is a well known fact that jobs are being lost because public liability insurance and employers' liability insurance can either be too expensive or cannot be obtained at any price.  This will have to stop.  I share Senator McKenna's and Senator Ferris's concern about the high premiums that voluntary bodies and voluntary organisations have to pay for public liability insurance.  I am a member of the Gaelic Athletic Association who have a club in every parish in the country. The cost of public liability cover to this association is enormous.  They are trying to build up a fund of their own to ensure that the insurance will not be as costly to clubs as has been the case up to now.  The underwriters of that fund are a British firm.  It was impossible for the association to get the public liability insurance in Ireland.  Some clubs have to pay in the region of £1,000 to get public liability cover.  This puts great hardship on clubs who are doing great work for our youth and especially for the communities in their respective areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All halls should be insured.  When <Col N="486" /> Ballyboy Hall in Offaly was burned some years ago the trustees of the hall were liable for whatever claims were made. If Muintir na Tíre and other voluntary bodies had not come to their rescue they would have had to sell their farms and businesses to pay the claims.  Insurance is necessary and very important but the cost of public liability is causing concern.  If awards were not so out of proportion it might help to reduce the premium for public liability insurance.</P>
    <P>The cost of motor insurance, particularly for the young driver, is astronomical at present.  I hope that as a result of the introduction of this Bill, together with the Courts Bill, these problems will change for the better.  It is very unfair that a young driver who may never have had an accident should be asked to pay a premium which costs nearly as much as his car.  If he needs a car for his work he may have to finance it through a finance company.  His parents may not be in a position to buy a car for him because they may be in financial difficulty also.  The insurance cover is so great that it makes it almost impossible for him to insure his vehicle.  This is probably one of the causes of uninsured driving.  Young drivers are victimised because of the action of some other drivers.  Young drivers should be offered a premium they can afford to pay.</P>
    <P>I know that small insurance brokers are concerned about the status of agents. The brokers feel the attention they receive victimises them.  They are worried that agents are receiving preferential treatment.  I hope the Minister will address that matter in the Bill.  The insurance brokers in the cities and towns of Ireland have played a major role in getting insurance for people at very competitive prices and in a very professional way.  I would not like to see them downgraded in any way as a result of this Bill. I often wonder how people qualify as agents.  This was mentioned already. Insurance companies should ensure that they appoint agents who have the confidence of the people.  I am pleased to see that the Minister is also concerned about <Col N="487" /> this.  In his speech on Second Stage he stated:</P>
    <P>The position of insurance agents is catered for in this Bill.  Broadly speaking, the onus will be on the insurance companies to stand over the persons they appoint as agents.  In the case of both brokers and agents, there are restrictions and prohibitions on certain persons from acting in the capacity of insurance intermediaries.  The sort of persons involved are those who have shown that their financial and commercial dealings leave a lot to be desired.</P>
    <P>Overall I welcome the Bill.  The provisions of the Bill have been well received.  A broker should have a professional indemnity bond so that the policyholder would have better protection. There have been too many problems in the past as a result of insurance brokers and agents going out of business.  This has resulted in huge losses for the policyholder and the consumer.  If this Bill corrects these matters it will be worthwhile. I support the broad principles of the Bill and hope that on Committee Stage the very complex problems will be thrashed out in the greatest possible detail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my intention to be very brief.  I welcome the overall thrust of the Minister's legislation.  I accept that in a market economy it is really only possible to regulate these things in a fairly subtle and sophisticated way, that it is not the function of the Minister to direct insurance companies in a very blunt way and that they must take up certain classes of insurance and so on because the use of this blunt instrument can create a situation where paradoxically it becomes more difficult to insure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am still capable of being shocked, however, by the statistics about uninsured drivers.  I believe that the Minister in his valiant attempt to regulate the insurance industry requires the assistance of other organs of the regulation of our life and I speak particularly of the judicial system.  It astonishes me to see from time <Col N="488" /> to time that uninsured drivers can be let off with a slap on the wrist, the benefit of the Probation Act or a very small fine. If out of a population of 700,000 drivers 100,000 are not insured, this is because they are not sufficiently encouraged by the system to be insured.  Somebody floating around in a car is capable of inflicting serious injuries or death on a member of the public and if the driver is uninsured those injuries, with or without the operation of the jury system, will cost either the unfortunate victim or the State very large sums of money.  When somebody is discovered by the Garda to be driving an uninsured vehicle it seems astonishing that they are not subjected to very stringent fines.</P>
    <P>I would like to address myself principally to the question of loadings in insurance.  While recognising that the Minister cannot be too blunt in directing insurance companies in this area, I hope he will take a very keen interest in it.  It seems to me that there is some degree of unfairness that requires investigation.  I am thinking particularly of the sort of loadings that insurance companies habitually engage in with regard to specific areas of Dublin: for example, Finglas in Dublin 11.  There was a lady on the wireless earlier in the week who apparently found it either impossible or extremely costly to get insurance for her car because she lived in a particular area of Dublin.  When she and subsequently the investigators of RTE attempted to find out the statistics upon which this risk was calculated the Garda refused to supply them.  This is unfair.  This is a situation in which the insurance companies are not, to use an American expression, `user friendly'.  One accepts that insurance is the mathematical calculation of risk and the appointing of appropriate loadings, but surely the consumer should be entitled to access to the information upon which this judgment is made?  The woman living in Dublin 11, a working class district, should be entitled to know if there is a reasonable basis for the calculation of this risk.  It does not seem to be a very great burden that this should be made available to her.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="489" /> The second area I want to refer are loadings in terms of house insurance with regard to specific areas of Dublin.  I speak with some feeling on this because I am very interested in the refurbishment of the inner city.  The restoration of the inner city of Dublin, an ideal to which we all pay lip service, is penalised.  I am aware of cases where insurance companies apparently operate a black list against the inner city of Dublin in terms of insurance.  I would very much like to see an end to this.  I would like the Minister to find out if insurance companies are operating a black list or if they are attempting to extract unrealistic premiums from people living in the inner city.  I know of several recent instances where people were willing to purchase and refurbish important 18th century buildings in the inner city.  In one case they were prevented from doing so and in another case were nearly prevented from doing this very worthy work because they could not get the insurance cover which was a necessary requirement in order to take out a mortgage.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister appears to be sensitive to the interests of the consumer, particularly in regulating insurance companies in matters of disclosure of information and also of the compulsion upon somebody seeking insurance on a building for mortgage purposes to have the services of a surveyor who makes his or her report to the company directly.  This has caused considerable annoyance.  Access is forbidden to the unfortunate consumer: in other words you pay for a service which you do not get.  This is being addressed by the Minister and I welcome it.  If it is not specifically addressed I hope that he will do so.  It seems that the insurance companies are saying, in the words of Lewis Carroll: &ldquo;I'll be judge, I'll be jury, said cunning old fury, I'll try the whole case and condemn you to death&rdquo; and there is nothing the consumer can do about it.</P>
    <P>I was most interested in what my colleagues in the Seanad have had to say about public liability insurance.  They spoke as if it was simply a rural problem <Col N="490" /> and I regret to say that it is not.  I am involved in a number of voluntary organisations which find it exceedingly difficult to get realistic quotations for public liability insurance.  I can understand this in the case of one organisation because they generate their funds through running a discotheque and in the aftermath of the Stardust tragedy, which we all remember, the requirements for insurance have inevitably, and I suppose correctly, become much greater.  With regard to the city of Dublin and our architectural heritage the insurance companies have to bear in mind, as the planning authorities have to bear in mind, the fact that when you are dealing with old and in some cases ancient buildings, it is impossible to meet all the requirements, and still insurance must be given.</P>
    <P>The final area of loading which causes me very considerable concern &mdash; and I would greatly welcome some response to my remarks on this subject from the Minister &mdash; is life insurance.  I bring this up because I have this morning received a very detailed proposed submission to the Minister for Health on the implications of the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.  This comes from a union representing senior management and professional levels of employment, the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants.  They have put together a very careful and considered document. This material contains the very worrying suggestion &mdash; or information as I understand it &mdash; that certain insurance companies are appending a questionnaire on what they call lifestyles which is highly discriminatory and very dangerous in the way in which it is administered.</P>
    <P>According to the information with which I have been provided this morning certain insurance companies are asking the question which must be filled out by the applicant for insurance: &ldquo;Have you taken the HIV virus test&rdquo;?  If the answer to that is yes, whether or not that test proved positive, the putative assuree is either immediately disbarred from life insurance or has such a substantial loading placed on them that it is impossible for them to meet the payment on this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="491" /> This seems to be very dangerous.  It is not only highly discriminatory but it is also dangerous in undermining the work of various bodies in attempting to contain the disease, because it will certainly inhibit people from taking the test.  Why take a test if, even should it prove totally negative, you are still by virtue of having taken the test rendered ineligible for life insurance.  I look to some reassurance from the Minister that he will take a very active interest in this most worrying aspect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be a little unusual and respond to Senator Norris's last point and get it out of the way very quickly.  As the Minister charged with responsibility in this area, I would be amazed if, because you said in an application that you had taken such a test, that in itself would render you ineligible.  I would be annoyed and disappointed if any insurance company automatically took that view.  I can tell the Senator and the House that that will be taken up with the insurance industry within a matter of days.  On Committee Stage I will communicate with the House and with the Senator directly.  I can appreciate the need for companies to seek information.  However, I do not appreciate them taking a view &mdash; if what Senator Norris says is accurate &mdash; that automatically taking such a test would render one ineligible.</P>
      <P>In the health area and in particular, in relation to the scourge of AIDS, we have been anxious that insurance companies would be sensitive.  I have the responsibility to ensure that insurance companies remain solvent.  Therefore, I cannot push them into taking risks which are clearly not commercially healthy.  I have asked them, and will ask them, for as much sensitivity and as humane an approach as is possible within the bounds of their solvency requirement in this area.  I am happy to have the opportunity to announce that to the House today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to thank all of the Senators for the very useful and pertinent comments they made on Second Stage.  I have <Col N="492" /> sat through most of the debate and found it extremely interesting.  We all realise that this Bill is an important measure and is necessary to strengthen the Minister's powers in relation to the supervision of insurance companies and to enhance the position of the consumer.  I am glad that it has received general support from all sides of the House.  That is very often the best type of legislation.  This together with submissions I have received from interested parties reflects widespread agreement with the broad trust of the Bill's provisions.</P>
    <P>Because it is a very technical Bill it will come into its own on Committee Stage. There were many good suggestions from Senators and from interested bodies outside the House which we will be happy to take on board as we progress through Committee Stage.  The Government have a number of amendments to table.  I look forward very much at an early opportunity to going through the Bill line by line with Senators so that we can emerge from Seanad Éireann with a Bill that both the Government and the Seanad can be proud to send to the Dáil for its consideration.</P>
    <P>Apart from the changes proposed to Part IV dealing with insurance intermediaries many of the amendments will be of a technical nature.  The House should appreciate the need for sound financial insurance and a financial system generally and the powers under Part II of the Bill will underpin and enhance existing supervisory provisions.  These powers will enable the Minister to anticipate emerging problems with insurers and allow for swift corrective action to be taken.  That is an important reform.</P>
    <P>I would like to respond to some points made by Senator O'Toole and Senator Harte regarding the supervision of insurance companies and the position of the PMPA and the ICI.  In response to Senator O'Toole's comments regarding the need for a more interventionist or hands-on approach to be taken in the supervision of insurance companies in order to avoid the situation such as arose in the PMPA and in the ICI and in response to some of Senator Harte's <Col N="493" /> related points I would like to briefly outline how the supervisory authority operates in practice.</P>
    <P>The primary objectives of my Department in supervising insurance companies are the maintenance of the solvency of the companies and the protection of the policyholders.  At present there are 68 authorised insurers writing either life or non-life business and in order to transact insurance business legally companies are required to be authorised by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Applications for authorisation must contain comprehensive financial information and a full range of operations which is subjected to a thorough and exhaustive examination by the Department before we would attempt to give any applicant a licence or authorisation.  In addition, an applicant undertaking has to satisfy the Department that it will employ in its Irish office persons duly qualified to manage the business.  This is an important area and one which the Department examine very carefully in the consideration of any application which comes before us.  Criteria for the assessment of the adequacy of applications in this regard are kept under review.</P>
    <P>The supervisory process, therefore, begins before companies are permitted to commence writing insurance business and that is an important point.  Once an undertaking is authorised, the Department maintain close contact in the early formative years in order to ensure that the newly authorised undertaking carries on the business as planned and respects any conditions applied to its authorisation. This is important as it is essential to unearth difficulties when they can still be rectified with the minimum amount of disruption.  Action taken in a number of cases over the years to ensure the adequacy of initial capital, or to require an increase in capital as soon as it appears necessary, is not brought to the public's attention.  The annual returns submitted by insurers are subjected to detailed scrutiny and analysis by the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>While one might argue that end of year <Col N="494" /> information is not sufficient to enable potential problems to be averted I would like to emphasise that my Department do not depend solely on the annual year end returns.  Six monthly or quarterly information is requested where the Department are less than happy with a particular company.  In addition, where necessary, independent consultants are sent in to investigate aspects of a company's operation such as claims provisions.  We do this as a matter of routine by sending consultants into insurance companies on a regular basis to satisfy ourselves as to their position.  These studies are carried out in strict confidence and in general with the full co-operation of the insurer, and that is important.  For obvious reasons it is essential to the welfare of the company concerned and its policyholders that this confidentiality is maintained. However, this is possible only where the company under investigation is willing to co-operate with the Department.  I am happy to say we have had no great difficulty in seeking and getting that co-operation.</P>
    <P>A problem arises where a company is not prepared to co-operate and that should be looked at.  Under the existing legislation the Minister must, in such circumstances, go through the court to justify his actions.  This would lead to inevitable publicity which, in turn, would lead to the threat of loss of confidence in a company as described by the Senator. Consequently, the Minister could not act until he was certain the problem was of such a scale that it warranted taking action through the court.</P>
    <P>As explained by previous Ministers, this was one of the difficulties with the PMPA.  This Bill now before the Seanad will solve this problem by giving the Minister powers to act whether or not the company co-operates and to do so without the matter becoming public and, even if a court case ensures, the hearing can take place <i>in camera.</i>  It is important in this whole area of financial confidence that the Minister has the power to intervene without necessarily causing public concern.  If the Minister has to wait until he has such evidence that will enable him <Col N="495" /> to do it in a very public way, by then that very action could in itself be very damaging to the company.  It is important that the Minister has that power in this Bill.  The Senator should be reassured to learn that internal examinations of companies are already a regular feature of the provision.  Furthermore, the fact that this exercise rarely becomes public is testimony to the integrity and confidentiality with which they are carried out.</P>
    <P>I will deal now with the Senator's specific queries in relation to the ownership and the future plans of the PMPA and ICI.  In so far as the PMPA are concerned, while it is under administration it is not in State ownership.  Its shareholders remain its legal owners.  However, the shareholders' interests have been completely eroded by the past losses of the company.  The extent of these losses is such that the administrator has stated publicly that in realistic terms there is no prospect of the shareholders recovering any of their investment.  As in the case of ICI, the administrator has a statutory duty to restore the PMPA to a sound commercial and financial position.  The PMPA's latest published accounts show that the company is now trading profitably. Trading profits before exceptional losses amounted to £3.16 million in 1986 compared with trading losses of £6.3 million in 1985 and £13.4 million in 1984. However, the PMPA still has a deficit of some £200 million to deal with when the deficit is eliminated and the company's current trading activities are no longer required to contribute to the resolution of the problem.  The company could revert to the control of its legal owners provided the amounts drawn down by the company from the insurance compensation fund have been repaid.</P>
    <P>In so far as ICI is concerned it is, as the Senator remarked, State owned.  The reasons for this State take over of ICI were dealt with in detail at the same time and I do not propose to cover that ground again today.  ICI's latest published accounts for 1986 show a profit of over £10 million on the continuing business of the company and a net deficit of £120 <Col N="496" /> million on its discontinued business. Draft accounts for the first half of 1987 show that the company is continuing to trade successfully.  These satisfactory trading results on ICI's continuing business give some grounds for optimism that a track record of profitability can now be established.</P>
    <P>The administrator is confident that such a track record coupled with ICI's key position in the Irish market should make the company's continuing business an attractive investment proposition.  The company's position continues to be monitored closely to ensure progress towards recovery and towards the company's ultimate sale.</P>
    <P>Senator Hogan talked about section 14 and considered that the powers being taken under this section are too wide-ranging and that they amount to interference on a day to day basis in the running of the company and interference with the commercial interests of the company. The insurance industry has already made representations to me on the same point.  I wish to assure Senator Hogan that it is not the intention to take powers leading to unnecessary interference in the normal commercial activities of a company. I would like to put that on the record as strongly as possible.</P>
    <P>My primary concern is the financial security of insurers.  However, I also feel bound to ensure as far as possible a fair deal for the policyholders.  As mentioned in the Second Stage speech I have a number of amendments in mind which I will introduce on Committee Stage.  In the light of these I am confident that I will be able to meet the concern of Senator Hogan and other Senators and the industry by modifying section 14 to make it clear that it applies to the continuing financial obllgations of companies.  That should meet Senator Hogan's requirements.</P>
    <P>In response to some comments by Senator O'Toole regarding a financial services centre and the need for an independent supervisory authority of all financial institutions, the Senator has correctly stated that the lines of distinction between the various financial institutions <Col N="497" /> today appear to be becoming more and more blurred.  He argued that, because of this, there should be a single supervisory authority covering all financial institutions. The Senator should be aware that the question of a co-ordinated approach to the supervision of all financial institutions has been under examination over the past year both at national and EC level and the work is much more advanced than commentators give us credit for.</P>
    <P>As regards the international financial services centre, for my part as Minister with responsibility for insurance supervision, I can also assure the Senator that the insurance companies established in the financial centre will be subject to the same rigorous monitoring as their counterparts outside the centre.  I understand Senator O'Toole's feeling these days as the plethora of new financial institutions and the amazing amount of new financial instruments coming from the financial institutions are quite mind boggling. There is clearly a requirement to have some overall view of where the financial services industry is actually going.  I am confident that the development of the dockland project will give us the necessary experience and we will be able to apply it there in a real hands-on fashion, so to speak.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan was wondering also whether insurance companies were making exorbitant profits by over charging policyholders.  Insurers are running businesses and must make a minimum return on capital invested by shareholders. The overall level of retained profits earned by non-life insurance companies with their head offices in Ireland reduced in the period 1981-84 from £6 million to nil.  That is over that short period.  While 1985 showed a welcome improvement, the overall level of retained earnings is still very low.  It must be stressed that out of these retained profits companies must at least partly fund their increased solvency obligation and also the future growth and development of their businesses.  While all companies can and do have recourse to shareholders for extra capital, this is only <Col N="498" /> tenable in the long term if companies are in a position to reward shareholders adequately for their additional investment in the company.</P>
    <P>I share the Senator's requirement and concern about the cost of insurance.  I will return to that before I conclude.  I should say at this stage that many Senators have referred to issues such as the cost and availability of insurance cover in certain classes.  They referred also to the level of awards, to reform of the legal system and to measures to improve safety at work and on the roads. The common thread running through all these points made by the Senators is that insurance costs are simply too high and that lower insurance costs are crucial to our economic recovery because escalating premiums have added to costs in the past and undermined both our domestic and our export competitiveness.</P>
    <P>The Government are extremely conscious of the burden caused by high insurance costs and of the difficulty of even obtaining insurance at any price in some cases.  These issues have been raised in the House and I can assure Senators that significant measures to tackle these problems are already taking place.  The reduction of high insurance costs in an integral part of the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> published last week.  The Government have been moving and will move quickly to facilitate a reduction in costs in a number of ways.</P>
    <P>Since taking the insurance brief and since the Government came to office we have been moving to reduce insurance costs.  We are going ahead with the juries Bill which should contribute greatly to a reduction in insurance costs.  If I may digress briefly to say something to the insurance industry in as clear a fashion as possible because a number of Senators took up this point, it is that the insurance industry told the Government and the public that to abolish the jury system and leave it to the judges to decide on awards, would have a major effect on reducing insurance costs.  I am concerned at some commentators, admittedly on the fringe of the insurance industry, who are now beginning to make some noises that this <Col N="499" /> may not necessarily happen.  I would like to say on behalf of the Government that we expect the insurance industry to deliver on its commitment for lower insurance costs as a result of the juries Bill.  It was in good faith that the Government went ahead with this Bill, largely on the assurance of the insurance industry that it would have a major effect.  I know I can rely on the good faith of the insurance industry to deliver on that commitment and to deliver on it urgently.  I will not tolerate any foot-dragging in that area.</P>
    <P>The Government will move quickly to facilitate a reduction in costs by processing this legislation and also by introducing legislation to give effect to the main recommendations of the Barrington Commission of Inquiry on Safety, Health and Welfare at Work and by promoting greater involvement by insurance companies in the areas of road and workplace safety.  The scope for promoting the publication of a book of quantum of damages, for example, for introducing a pretrial procedures system and reducing the level of legal representations in the superior courts to help reduce legal costs are also being examined.  The insurance industry representatives have given assurances that reductions in insurance premiums will follow the introduction of the improved framework.  That refers again to my earlier remarks.</P>
    <P>While there has been no formal decision taken yet in regard to the number of lawyers involved in a particular case, I have during the summer called in the Bar Council of Ireland and formally asked them to consider reducing the number of lawyers involved in insurance cases in order to bring about a reduction in insurance costs.  Some figures have indicated that approximately 20 per cent of an average claim could be the result of, not just legal fees, but all fees.  That situation is untenable and we do not intend to permit it to continue for very long.  Pending any formal decisions I called in the Bar on a voluntary basis and asked them if they could justify to me and to the public why eight lawyers are required on an insurance case &mdash; a <Col N="500" /> solicitor on either side, two senior and a junior counsel.  I put that question to the president of the Bar Council and he has undertaken to consider my request that they do something voluntarily about it.  I am aware that in other countries Bar Councils have voluntarily undertaken to rid themselves of a situation which is no longer tenable.  Again, I would ask the Bar Council for a response to my request as soon as possible.  I am not making any threats or waving any big sticks at this stage.  I have asked them to consider making a voluntary gesture considering the economic difficulties we have and I see no reason why the Bar Council should not respond to me on that matter as a matter of urgency.  I have written again to them in the past four weeks and I am awaiting a response.  I would like to call for that response again today.</P>
    <P>I am confident that there will be rapid progress in all of these areas so that we can reduce the burden of high insurance costs in industry and on the ordinary consumer. I have been doing everything in my power to maintain the momentum already established to effect desirable changes.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey and Senator McKenna referred to the difficulties faced by motorists, particularly young drivers.  I will read for both Senators the content of a parliamentary question which I answered yesterday in this regard for Deputy Jimmy Deenihan.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the burden which high insurance costs impose on all sections of the motoring public and I intend to do everything practicable to alleviate this burden where possible.  I am particularly anxious to improve the position of young drivers.  However, the cost of insurance is directly related to the level of claims occurring.</P>
    <P>The motor insurance industry in Ireland has had significant underwriting losses in recent years.  In the absence of a change in the underlying claims experience lower insurance rates for young drivers would mean higher rates for the other categories of driver.  More mature drivers have been <Col N="501" /> statistically proven to be safer drivers than their younger counterparts whose rates reflect the higher risk.</P>
    <P>As the insurance supervisory authority, my primary responsibility is to ensure that companies are maintaining their solvency margins and reserve requirements.  I must, therefore, respect the right of insurers to charge economic premiums in the light of their underwriting experience.  The initial loadings imposed on first-time insurers and more specifically young drivers, can be offset over time by earning a no-claim bonus.  However, many young drivers have several years of claims free driving as drivers on their parents policy when they first take out insurance in their own name.  Many of them get no credit for this.</P>
    <P>I announced in the Dáil yesterday and I am pleased to announce here today that:</P>
    <P>I have had discussions with motor insurers and they have undertaken, when the Courts Bill is enacted, to give a 10 per cent to 20 per cent no claim bonus to young drivers taking out their first policies.  If they have been named drivers on their parents' policies for two years, have a full licence and have been accident free.</P>
    <P>That is substantial improvement and I am glad to inform the House formally of it today.</P>
    <P>I will be pressing for further improvements. Benefits should also come from tackling legal costs, the uninsured driving situation which I am talking to the Minister for Justice about and road safety, which are being considered in the context of the current joint Government-insurance industry discussions on how to reduce the cost of insurance.  Independently of this, one of the major motor insurance companies in this city has taken the initiative and introduced a special young drivers scheme which allows a young driver to earn a no claims bonus while at the same time his premium is capped at a figure of £850 if he is located in the Dublin area or £700 if he is located outside the Dublin area.  Yesterday I <Col N="502" /> urged and would again today urge other insurance companies to follow the same lead.  They are significant developments and ones which are designed to break the spiral of rising insurance costs.</P>
    <P>Let me remind the House that, in a few short months, the Government have taken pretty decisive action on insurance costs: (1) by announcing the Juries Bill and by pressing ahead with it; (2) by entering into a partnership with the insurance industry; (3) by making this arrangement with the insurance companies; and (4) by calling in the Bar Council.  There are a number of other reforms which are in the pipeline but they are all designed and all add up to the same thing: to force down the cost of insurance because our industries cannot afford the escalating costs and our motor drivers cannot afford the cost either.</P>
    <P>For uninsured driving a figure of 20 per cent to 25 per cent is frequently quoted and was quoted here yesterday as being the true level of uninsured driving in the country.  There is no conclusive evidence on this.  The Department of the Environment do not accept this particular estimate. A roadside survey of parked cars was carried out by the Garda in April and the found that over 90 per cent of these cars had insurance discs displayed.  This is not conclusive evidence that the particular insurance was in order but it does provide <i>prima facie</i> evidence of insurance of the vehicles which were surveyed. A comprehensive countrywide survey of the vehicle was also carried out early this year and the results of this should be available later in the year.</P>
    <P>I am aware, however, that a figure has been calculated which concerns me greatly.  This figure suggests that, if we could put uninsured drivers off the road, that in itself could reduce our average premium by as much as £70.  That is a rough calculation but one which I intend to check into further.  If that is possible, I can assure the House that I will be having urgent discussions with the Minister for Justice with a view to taking very strong action on the question of uninsured <Col N="503" /> driving.  I have also said publicly on many occasions that I have been considering suggesting to the Minister for Justice the impounding of vehicles in some cases where the legislation is not effective.  That is totally a matter for the Minister for Justice but it is a suggestion which I have put to him and I will put to him again after I double check those figures.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan and Senator Norris raised the underwriting practices of motor insurers in relation to loadings. The motor insurance advisory board is currently examining this whole area and has requested very detailed statistics of each motor insurer carrying on business here.  The motor insurance advisory board will be reporting to me in early 1988 following its analysis of the data supplied to it.  Senators can take it that only those loadings which are justified by actual claims experience will we permit to continue.</P>
    <P>Senator Reynolds stated that the growth in management expenses in insurance companies has averaged over 20 per cent per annum in recent years and that management expenses of insurers in the UK are less than two thirds of those in Ireland.  I am not aware how these figures have been calculated and whether or not they relate to specific policies or particular sectors of the market, but I would like to point out that one has to be very careful when making comparisons of this nature.  However, without going into too much detail and too many statistics I would like to comment very briefly on what the actual returns from the companies to my Department reveal.</P>
    <P>Taking all insurers operating in Ireland, management expenses have fallen as a percentage of gross premium in 1984, 1985 and 1986 when the percentage was 13.3.  When one looks at a breakdown of these figures as between head offices and branches, there is very little difference between them with a head office figure of 13.1 per cent in 1986 and a branch office figure at 14 per cent.  A straight comparison between the UK and Irish management expenses is hardly <Col N="504" /> valid.  With the larger scale of operations and the lower salary rates in the UK generally a comparison would not be very valid.  That is not to say I am satisfied there is no scope for further reductions in management expenses here.  I said quite the opposite on a number of occasions since I assumed responsibility for this area.  I will continue to look for improvements in the efficiency of insurers operating in the marketplace.  I do not propose to comment in any way on the privatisation of Irish Life or suggest a privatisation.  That is with the Minister for Finance and it is best left there on this occasion.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey asked when the levy of 3 per cent on insurance premiums would end, I have to remind Senator Hussey first of all &mdash; I know it is only a technicality, but just to get the record clear &mdash; that the insurance compensation fund is actually 2 per cent; the additional 1 per cent is a fiscal levy which is charged by the Minister for Finance.  I know that makes no difference to the person who pays it, but that is for the record of the House which is important.  With regard to the 2 per cent levy, the benefits of which, as Senators will be aware, are used for the administration of the PMPA, the position is that the latest forecast by the administrator of the company suggests that by mid-1990 the company is expected to have cleared its deficit, after which there will be no requirements on the fund.  I would hope we could do even better than that but that is the current forecast from the administrator.</P>
    <P>Senator Fennell expressed concern about section 28 of the Bill which seeks to limit the protection afforded by the insurance compensation fund.  As the Minister made clear in his speech when introducing the Second Stage, the decision to reduce the level of protection afforded by the insurance compensation fund was taken after very careful consideration. Under existing legislation the liability of the fund is potentially unlimited and policyholders should not be expected to contribute any more than the present maximum level of 2 per cent to provide against insolvencies of insurance <Col N="505" /> companies.  I should emphasise that it is to be hoped that there will be no further demands on the fund.  The fund will continue to be available to the administrator of the PMPA and the ICI.</P>
    <P>Senator Fennell referred to the changes in the Bill relating to industrial insurance business.  She expressed the view that industrial branch customers should be informed of the benefits of taking out an ordinary branch policy instead.  Industrial assurance business is differentiated from ordinary branch business of by the nature of its collection, the frequency of its collection and the much lower level of the industrial branch premiums and sums assured.  Expense levels associated with IB business are significantly higher than for OB business. The changes proposed in the Bill are designed to reduce these very high collection expense levels so as to improve the benefits to the IB policyholders.  A straight comparison between the benefits of OB and IB business would not, therefore, I think, be very valid.  I would like to point out that those persons taking out IB insurance referred to by some in this debate as penny policies &mdash; by Senator Fallon in particular &mdash; because of their low costs might not be able to afford the premiums on a typical ordinary branch policy.</P>
    <P>On the question of commission, Senators have agreed that Part III of the Bill is a most welcome and necessary step.  We are all too aware of the commission war which erupted earlier this year.  I want to say to the House that some life offices were paying overgenerous commissions and offering &mdash; I think the best way to describe it is &mdash; other inducements to intermediaries in order to grab market share.  This added to policyholder's costs and, if it had continued for any length of time, would have seriously threatened both the consumers' interest and the independent status of the broker market.  Following an immediate intervention by myself, the industry got its act together in the form of a new commissions agreement, subscribed to by all life offices from 1 August last.  It is <Col N="506" /> my strong preference that the industry should continue to regulate itself in a responsible fashion but I am convinced that it is necessary at the same time to have at my disposals substantial legislative powers, should these unsavory unethical practices recur.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment the industry after our initial scrap over those fun-in-the-sun ideas and so on that after that they got their act together.  I compliment them on doing so in such a professional way.  I would like the message to go out loud and clear to the life offices that, if an attempt is made to undermine self-regulation of commissions by the life market, the inevitable result will be a plague on all your houses in the form of statutory control of commissions by Part III of the Bill.  I do not expect that to happen but it is important to put it on the record here today.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other matters which I should cover but perhaps it would be wise as time is going on, if I defer some of those and deal with them on Committee Stage.  There are a few matters of a technical nature which we can take up when we get to Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contribution to the debate and I want to say in particular that the Government have embarked on a programme designed to get down insurance costs.  We are anxious to get down motor insurance costs and public and employer liabilities, in particular those three areas.  We have already taken three or four actions which I have told Senators about and there will be many more in the months ahead designed to give us a more competitive industry because insurance costs are now a major cost to Irish industry.  I look forward to an informed and detailed debate on Committee Stage.  I commend the Second Stage of the Bill to the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The thinking behind this amendment is that, whereas the section deals with the <Col N="509" /> Minister's power to make regulations for the reception of animals which are to be assembled and penned and rested prior to slaughter and all the normal requirements of that section, I suggest at section 20 (c) the times at which slaughtering may take place.  The Minister is taking unto himself the times at which slaughterings may take place.  I am quoting a reference being used in South Tipperary from by-law regulations already submitted to the Department.  Whereas legally the Department have not accepted the by-laws we are still operating within them.  I realise the Department have raised two queries with the sanitary authority in South Tipperary on the by-laws submitted but the section in question has not been raised by the Department as creating any problems.</P>
    <P>I suggest the use of the exact wording in the South Tipperary by-laws in respect of licensing and registration of slaughter houses for sanitary operations and the prevention of cruelty to animals, and that some flexibility be available to the butcher and to the local authority through the veterinary surgeon to arrange suitable times.  In my opinion suitable times are the normal times that a butcher would use for slaughtering purposes.  Of course I am excluding from that amendment the destruction of animals for humanitarian purposes or sick animals.  There are times when the norm would not apply in these cases; any veterinary surgeon would be obliged under their code of practice to destroy a suffering animal to take it out of pain.  If an injured animal was submitted to a slaughter house or a butcher for destruction naturally there would be some dialogue to arrange when a vet could be available and when the animal could be put out of its pain.  My amendment seeks to ensure normal, good business practice.</P>
    <P>The whole trade would accept that as being an effort to have a dialogue between the veterinarian and the butcher; if not we would be faced with the dilemma of nine to five veterinarians not being available at the normal slaughtering times for rural butchers in towns and villages throughout the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="510" /> They cannot all kill their animals between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. as the Minister will appreciate coming from a rural constituency like myself.  I am concerned because in parts of Cork where they have legally operating by-laws that are not flexible the veterinarians are not flexible and are advising butchers and small abattoirs of the time in which they will be required to kill.  I want to make sure that the legislation I have welcomed and I have been involved with becomes operable on the ground.  If the Bill should prove inoperable, then all of us, including the Minister, are wasting our time.  It would be a tragedy.</P>
    <P>The Bill is trying to raise standards, and people's awareness of the standard of meat for human consumption.  That will have a spin-off effect for all of our export trade and everything else.  Where butchers do not have the facility of a resident veterinarian surgeon as a factory would have, it is imperative that they would have some regard for the normal customary killing times and that the veterinary surgeons or their back-up staff &mdash; if they happen to be private veterinary surgeons &mdash; will be flexible in their operation of the times that slaughtering could take place.</P>
    <P>The by-laws in South Tipperary prove that we can operate at present in consultation with the veterinary surgeons who are employed part-time by the county council to operate this section on slaughtering times worded in accordance with the amendment.  I feel that this legislation should reflect the type of dialogue that can and must go on between veterinary surgeons and the butchers; otherwise I feel we will be heading for trouble with the 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. public servant who will feel that it would be inappropriate for him to be present at any other time because his job would not permit it.  Certainly that would not be applicable to the normal rural butcher who in the normal course of events would not be killing at those times anyway.</P>
    <P>The section would also allow for other such circumstances that might arise outside of the normal killing times.  The section would allow for dialogue on the <Col N="511" /> matter to take place between the butcher and the veterinary surgeon.  There are a limited number of hours in which a veterinarian can properly decide if an animal is fit for human consumption and has been slaughtered in accordance with humanitarian standards.  The period is about four hours from the time the animal is actually slaughtered and blooded until such times as the meat is hung and is ready for stamping.</P>
    <P>To accommodate all the rural butchers in the country we will have to have some sort of flexibility.  I suggest the words outlined in my amendment as are suitable, having regard to good business practice and such times as are customary in the particular area, except in the case of the slaughter of sick or injured animals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague has left me with very little to say because his submission was very comprehensive.  I do not like to be repetitive but I take it that you are taking the amendment to section 20 and my amendment to section 39 together.  This section presents enormous practical problems on the ground in getting a veterinary surgeon.  Normally the veterinary surgeon in a rural area has a large general practice.  He has to attend to sick animals, he has to carry out testing under the animal disease regulations and so on.  He will have relatively little time to carry out these ante- and post-mortem examinations of carcases in abattoirs. Nevertheless the law lays down that it must be done.  Also we have to consider the effect on butchers.  The ordinary High Street butcher usually has no set pattern of demand.  One week he may have demand to sell four or five carcases and another week it may be down to one or two; it may oscillate very much.  Therefore, he does not have a set work pattern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Minister envisages in this Bill means that every butcher must have a set demand pattern.  That means that on a Monday morning at 9 a.m. he is ready to slaughter his four animals and that the veterinarian can be there on time for the ante-mortem and be back on time again <Col N="512" /> for the post-mortem examinations.  Alas, it does not work that way because of the fact that at various times of the day and at various days during the week butchers may need to slaughter animals.  These times will not necessarily be the times that veterinarians can attend and this can lead to enormous problems.</P>
    <P>Although I have my name to this amendment, I recognise the practical problem and I recognise the fact that there are two interests.  We cannot come down too much on the side of one interest over another in this.  Above all, this Bill is about improving standards.  We appeal to the Minister that in making the final arrangements under these two sections the interests of both parties &mdash; the butchers have come to us and have expressed their fears &mdash; be taken into account, that they would not be dragooned, if you like to call it that, into carrying out their slaughtering operations at a time of the day or a day of the week that is totally inconvenient to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendments of previous speakers on section 20.  I think we have to take into account that we are dealing with family businesses where the family are directly involved in the sale of the meat over the counter.  One cannot expect that in a family business they will be in a position to slaughter animals at particular times of the day and also sell meat at particular times of the day.  There is enough strain on them in order to carry out their duties in the shop without having them confined to particular times of the day for slaughtering.  As well as that, animals are 30-day tested; they are bought from marts by and large and the necessary regulations in relation to tuberculosis and brucellosis and diseases of that nature have been largely complied with or else could not be sold at marts. In a family business most butchers kill either early morning or late at night in order to meet their requirements.  To have a situation where they would be compelled to kill at particular times of the day and wait for a veterinary inspector to look at the animal before it is killed and look at the animal after it is killed would <Col N="513" /> be impracticable.  I appeal to the Minister to amend this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are interlinked in that they would limit the power of the Minister in fixing slaughtering times and, as a consequence, the times that veterinary inspection of animals and carcases could take place.  It is important that the Minister should have power to fix slaughtering times.  Uncontrollable slaughtering at abattoirs throughout the country leading to loose veterinary examination of animals and carcases would seriously undermine the provisions and the intentions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>In the export meat plants, for example, the Minister has regulated the times at which slaughtering may take place under the power granted to him by section 26 of the Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Act, 1930.  For domestic abattoirs the intention is that the regulations to be made under section 20(1)(c) will establish core times during which slaughterings may take place.  These regulations will also provide that the actual times of slaughter will be settled upon by the local authority in consultation with individual proprietors.</P>
      <P>I would like to stress that there will be flexibility for local butchers in local towns and the times will be fixed in consultation with the veterinary inspectors.  Of particular relevance is section 36(2) which clearly provides for such consultation. There will be sufficient flexibility to satisfy the needs of local authorities and in the ordinary course having regard to business practice in particular towns and parts of the country.  In this connection where fixed slaughtering times are currently in operation the Department and not aware of any problems having arisen. I must be losing my touch a little because Senator Ferris has had some communication that there are difficulties in the Cork area.  As a public representative for the area I would be concerned if my grapevine were slipping up a little bit because I genuinely have not had any such difficulties brought to my attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to give a commitment that there will be nothing in the regulations on <Col N="514" /> slaughtering times which will prevent good sensible adult attitudes in relation to working arrangements being arrived at locally.  However, there will have to be some give and take and, as Senator Connor said, there are two sides to the matter.  It is a question of having a rational attitude to this matter.  This will be done through the process of consultation by and with the local authority and the local inspectorate.  This matter is well covered and will be catered for in the regulations which are to be made.  I give a commitment that that flexibility will be there.  If a problem should arise on the Government regulations there will be no problem about the ministerial order being extended, modified or amended to suit local situations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to the flexibility we have been asking for and I want to assure him that the comments I made on Country Cork may not necessarily be confined to his own constituency so he should not worry about the grapevine: they may relate to another constituency in the Minister's very large county.  I know that the regulations adopted by the Cork county sanitary authority have created some problems for smaller butchers in that area as there does not seem to be the flexibility we asked for in this amendment which the Minister generously said would be forthcoming.  I take it from the Minister's response that he has absolutely no problem in conceding the amendment simply because the section now says that the Minister will have the power to make regulations involving the times at which slaughterings may take place.  The amendment reads, &ldquo;...having regard to good business practice ...&rdquo; which the Minister confirmed he would have &ldquo;and such times as are customary in the particular area...&rdquo;.  The Minister said there could be dialogue between the local authority and the butcher.  If the Minister has now committed himself to that there is nothing wrong with having it inserted as a valid section after the section concerning his powers to regulate the times, which the Minister said he cannot and <Col N="515" /> will not regulate without dialogue and discussion.  We are asking the Minister to insert this in the Bill so that, while I accept that the Minister will have dialogue and discussion and rapport between the council and himself and between the council and the butchers, the same openness and frankness may not apply in the future.  The Minister is a man of the people who knows that he wants to have this legislation operative on the ground.  All I am doing is quoting the experience I have had in the local authority area which saw a need to regulate all areas involving slaughter houses before ever the legislation came into place.  We had regard to our responsibility as a local sanitary authority to see that some semblance of regulation would have to apply to slaughter houses.  The appropriate wording was put in by the then chairman of the council, Senator Willie Ryan, and by the other members of the council.  Under his jurisdiction this provision was written in to the by-laws accepted by the trade, found to be operative on the ground and submitted to the Minister's Department for legal approval.  The Minister raised other questions but did not refer to that provision as creating a problem for his Department.  I suggest it will not create a problem for my local authority because they already operate it.  If that is written into the section following the powers this Bill will confer on the Minister, everybody's wishes in that regard will have been met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept the amendment. It is a fundamental provision.  It will reassure the trade that there is give and take on all sides.  If Senator Connor who has spoken to people in his part of the country realises that this dialogue has to take place and there has to be give and take, we should legislate for the give and take not removing from the Minister his power to regulate times.  Surely no Minister would regulate times without consultation, dialogue or give and take between people.  There is nothing wrong with having it written into the Bill that this will take place.  The trade would <Col N="516" /> appreciate that kind of generous understanding from the Minister and his advisers.  This is a necessary part of trying to ensure that the legislation is operative. I earnestly request the Minister, in view of his response, to allow the amendment to stand.  It will create no problem and will reassure the trade that there are people in the Department and in the local authority services who are prepared to give and take.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the Minister's problem in accepting this amendment in that if he does accept it, it may limit his power in relation to the regulation of times for slaughtering.  In view of the commitment the Minister has given I am quite happy to accept this section as it is.  How is good business practice to be defined?  The times which are customary in one area may not suit every other area. I feel that the amendment would have the effect of limiting the powers the Minister is taking here and I do not think that would be a good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is important that the Minister should have the power to fix slaughtering times without the constraint mentioned in the proposed amendments.  They are to some extent indefinite.  As Senator Hussey said what is good business practice could be debated for a long time or what might be customary in one part of the country might be quite different in another part. Uncontrolled slaughterings at abattoirs would lead to loose veterinary examinations of animals and carcases and would seriously undermine the Bill's provisions. I am going a long way towards meeting the spirit of the amendments in saying that I give a commitment that there will be nothing in the regulations on slaughtering times which will prevent good sensible working arrangements being arrived at locally.  However, there will have to be some give and take and there could not be slaughterings at any time people might decide on.  For that reason I cannot accept the amendment. The situation is adequately covered in the regulations to be made by the Minister <Col N="517" /> that there will be provision for consultation with individual proprietors and individual situations.  That is the best way to carry out the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this the old story of the Minister, while legislating in a particular way, wanting to retain the powers unto himself?  First let me be quite clear and emphatic.  Nobody on this side of the House or indeed on any side of the House wants uncontrolled slaughtering.  We will not defend it.  The trade does not want it but neither does it want some Minister to define times which are impossible to comply with.  There is no question that this amendment means that we will have the same time all over the country.  Of course, that would not be possible.  We have 27 local authorities which are in themselves responsible as sanitary authorities. Each one of them will have to set down different times.  I am quite sure that the killing time in South Tipperary will be different from that in Galway, Cork, Roscommon, Kilkenny and even North Tipperary.  Senator McKenna will agree that as separate authorities we will be having discussions and dialogue with all of the butchers in our areas.</P>
      <P>The Minister would be very unwise to set down times at national level.  He has more or less confirmed that he would not do that.  I am asking him to ensure that it does not happen.  I am not looking for a blank cheque for uncontrolled slaughtering. Quite the opposite.  I want to try to make sure that every small butcher and abattoir that wants to kill animals will do so in the presence or with the permission or knowledge of the veterinary surgeon in the area, whether he is the local authority veterinary surgeon with overall responsibility or the back-up service that is to be given to him by private practitioners.  There is dialogue already between private practitioners and butchers to comply with the existing regulations and it is not creating problems, but nobody except the local authority, the veterinary surgeon and the butcher has set the times down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to use the flexibility my amendment allows.  I am <Col N="518" /> not asking that any power be taken from the Minister because he will be regulating the times but the Minister will not make a regulation setting down these times until agreement has been reached between the trade and the local authorities.  If they reach agreement on times and the Minister is unaware of them, then the Bill will be out of control.  I am suggesting that the Minister should retain unto himself the controls but that in making his regulation he should have regard to good business practice and the normal killing times applicable in a certain area.  These normal killing times are always subject to discussion and dialogue.  What is wrong with legislating in that way?  It reassures people who have a dread of bureaucracy. Senator Sean Byrne spoke last week about the dread of ordinary people of bureaucracy and how it might interfere with ordinary everyday practice.  The Minister would be surprised at what can happen on the ground.  When one puts a uniform on anybody they become a different person.  Put a uniform on a litter warden or on a traffic warden and there is a Jekyll and Hyde situation.  The minute one gives power and authority to people they tend to operate without having regard to the overall good practice in an area.  That tends to be in our make-up. But if the Bill states that they should have regard to this, then there will be some assurance available to people that dialogue will be essential and that agreement will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I do not want to labour this but I think the Bill should proceed and the amendment be accepted.  Even if the Minister considers after accepting it here that it creates problems for him, on Report Stage I will be prepared to listen.  I have not heard anything from the Minister to convince me that my amendment is not legitimate and is not warranted and is not desirable.  I am not being unreasonable. I am being absolutely consistent.  I do not want to push it to a vote but if we have to have a vote on it, then so be it.  I certainly did not want to proceed with this legislation along these lines.  I hope the Minister is taking upon himself the right to amend the Bill in whatever way <Col N="519" /> he would consider to be right and that he would not have to wait for approval from Cabinet for these incidental amendments which are relevant to the area for which the Minister has responsibility, namely food.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations which will be made under this Bill will provide for the actual time of slaughter and they will be settled by local authorities in consultation with individual proprietors.  I want to give a guarantee that sufficient flexibility will be there to satisfy the needs both of the local butchers and local proprietors and the local authorities and, of course, would have regard to local business practice in particular areas. <Col N="520" /> Where fixed slaughtering times are currently in operation, to my knowledge or to the knowledge of the Department there is no problem arising because of them.  I think the amendment is somewhat indefinite.  Customary times were established before the existence of by-laws. For that reason I cannot accept the amendment and I think there is adequate flexibility provided for under the regulation which would satisfy both the authorities and the butchers concerned.</P>

      <P>This section makes it an offence for a person to sell, offer or expose for sale for human consumption any part of an animal or meat which has been slaughtered in or which has originated in a knackery.  In view of the programmes we have seen on television recently I believe this section should be enforced rigidly and that contaminated meat of any kind should not be offered for sale by anybody.  I do not know what the fines are in relation to this offence but I believe that whatever the fines are should be applied rigidly to anybody found guilty of an offence under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree totally with Senator Hussey and I do not think anybody would suggest that this section of the Bill should not be implemented with all the rigour of the law which we will be conferring on the Minister in the Bill.  It will bring us back to another section which deals with the stamping of meat.  I presume we will be discussing which part of the meat will be stamped so that it can be identified at any time.  This is important power to have conferred in the legislation.  None of us would condone the sale by any outlet of meat for human consumption which did not originate either in a butcher's abattoir or a public abattoir under veterinary supervision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned about this section of the Bill and I dealt to some extent with it on Second Stage. It is fine to say that the meat will be stamped and that in this way we can be assured of its origin.  That is fine when it is going through the regular outlets but <Col N="522" /> my concern would be about the other outlets.  I know of parcels of meat being sold from cars outside public houses in this city on Friday and Saturday evenings. They are being sold for X number of pounds and people do not know what kind of meat they are buying.  That type of trade exists in this city despite the great efforts of the victuallers' association to put an end to it.</P>
      <P>There is another outlet about which I am very concerned and where I do not think any inspection whatsoever takes place.  That is the mobile shop that pulls into estates in and around the city at night time selling prepared meals, chips and so on.  There is meat being sold in these mobile caravans.  There is no inspection of these outlets despite the fact that there is a regulation whereby any person trading as a butcher or any other food outlet has to comply with certain regulations. These mobile shops have no regulations to comply with, they do not have running water, they do not have toilets.  In a shop the toilet facilities must be separated from the shop by room or other compartment. In other words, one must not be able to walk directly from the shop into the toilet.  I totally agree with this but how can that be the case in a caravan?</P>
      <P>These mobile shops are an increasing trade and many of them are operated by foreigners who care less than many Irish people.  This is particularly obvious in new housing estates in Dublin county where they are awaiting shops but also in estates where there are shops.  This is a serious matter and there is nothing in this Bill to prevent these people from trading in the way they are at the moment, that is obtaining meat, not from regular outlets, but directly from slaughterhouses or unofficial premises where it is being processed, or even from knackeries.  We do not know where that meat is coming from but the Minister can be assured that it is not all coming through the regular outlets. This area is not covered in the Bill simply because these are not subject to inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This section places an absolute prohibition on the sale for <Col N="523" /> human consumption of any product of any knackery.  There will be an absolute and total prohibition on the sale of any meat product from knackeries and this, taken in conjunction with section 34, the regulation in relation to knackeries and section 42, the restriction on the sale and supply of meat, etc., should ensure beyond any doubt that sufficient safeguards will exist to prevent any products from a knackery being offered for sale for consumption.  I am glad that the Senators have voiced their concern in relation to this matter because from a public health point of view we certainly want to protect the consumer.</P>
      <P>There are very stiff fines for offences under this section.  There will be fines of £1,000 or six months imprisonment, or both, on a summary conviction and £10,000 or three years imprisonment, or both, on an indictment.  Travelling salesmen, people who visit estates at night or have travelling shops of one kind or another, will of course, have to observe the regulations the same as anybody else. The meat for sale at all outlets for human consumption will have to be stamped.</P>
      <P>In relation to premises, the hygiene regulations will apply and the Department of Health will ensure that they will be rigorously applied because the overall consensus of all responsible people is that food, and meat in particular, for human consumption should be of the highest standard and that the cowboys in the business will have to terminate that type of operation.  This Bill, taken in conjunction with the food hygiene regulations operated by the Department of Health, will ensure that meat being made available for human consumption at all outlets will be up to the highest standards possible.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's reply because the hygiene regulations are there at the moment and as far as the travelling shops that move into housing estates are concerned, they are not enforced.  Nobody can say that they can comply with the hygiene regulations in an 18-foot caravan.  Firstly, how can the hygiene regulations be complied <Col N="524" /> with in those circumstances?  Secondly, the meat they are supplying to the public is processed and all the stamping in the world will not identify where this meat has come from because it is already processed before it arrives at the estate. Nobody knows where it comes from.  It is minced meat and whatever else they sell with burgers that they cook on the spot in a caravan and anybody who can say that the present hygiene regulations that apply to ordinary food premises are being complied with in these caravans is just not being realistic because it is impossible to have adequate running water in them, it is impossible to have a toilet which is separate, with a compartment between it and the working end of the caravan.  I could name a dozen of these caravans which have not, from the time they started operating, had an inspection.  Despite all the regulations, they have not had an inspection.  I believe the inspectors are afraid to go near them because they know what the report will be and that little can be done about it.  It is time that something was done about this.  If nothing is done I dread to think what the outcry would be if there were &mdash; and there have been cases though they cannot be proved &mdash; cases of food poisoning in some of the housing estates in County Dublin.  Doctors have told me that they know, but they cannot prove, that that has come from mobile shops which move in to catch the quick trade between 8 o'clock at night and 1 a.m. or 2 a.m.  That is the kind of operator I am talking about.</P>
      <P>The Minister would be more honest if he admitted that operators in small caravans cannot comply with the regulations.  Those are the facts.  I have seen nothing in this Bill which enables the meat they sell to be identified because the meat is minced or processed in one way or another.  It would have gone beyond the state where a stamp could be identified.  The Minister should admit it is an area that will have to be tackled by some other rule or regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing in this Bill to prevent food poisoning from happening.  I and <Col N="525" /> many doctors and other people are extremely worried about this type of operation.  It is increasing.  There has been an influx of refugees into this country and this seems to be one of their main lines of business.  The hygiene in these outlets is absolutely deplorable.  Going home tonight I will pass at least three of them.  They are there to be seen by anybody who cares to go into these housing estates after 8 p.m. or 9 p.m.</P>

      <P>The Minister may have misunderstood, as I certainly did, what Senator McMahon was getting into.  I understood that Senator McMahon was referring to meat being offered for sale from mobile vans but now I understand it is more or less chip shops where beefburgers, etc., are sold.  Mobile vans are operating all over the country.  I have seen them in my own part of the county. They operate outside dance halls, at carnivals and any place where there are groups of people gathered.  They sell chips, beefburgers, bunburgers, and so on.</P>
      <P>There is legislation, which is the responsibility of the Department of Health, to control that kind of activity and it should be enforced.  If people are being offered food from mobile units, the type of food they are getting and the conditions under which it is supplied should be monitored.  I hope the regulations will be enforced but I do not think this Bill should be expected to correct that kind of operation.  My understanding is that the regulations are there already but they are not being enforced.</P>

      <P>This Bill ensured that the processing of meat and meat as it leaves abattoirs is fit for human consumption. Therefore, the retail sale of meat is not subject to this Bill.  Retail operators have to be governed by the food hygiene regulations which are the responsibility of the Minister for Health. Any slipshod methods, deterioration or malpractices are the responsibility of the health inspectorate.  In most parts of the country the provisions of Article 28 of <Col N="526" /> the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1950, governing food vehicles and the convenience of food apply.  The Department of Health are currently engaged in updating the provisions of the Food Hygiene Regulations.  The Department of Agriculture and Food are in consultation with the Department of Health in upgrading and updating those regulations.  I take Senator McMahon's point that they need to be upgraded and rigorously enforced.</P>
      <P>It has been agreed with the Department of Health and the Department of the Environment that in future the provisions of the Food Hygiene Regulations will apply to the transport of meat and to meat at various outlets.  Local authority veterinary inspectors, being the authorised officers under the Food Hygiene Regulations, will have regard in the future for the provisions of these regulations. The inspection and control of meat will be their function.  I can assure everybody that those regulations will be rigorously enforced.  The amended Food Hygiene Regulations will come into effect within a few months.  There is a consensus that we need to tighten up the regulations in relation to meat and food products generally and that we have to have regard for public health.  Again I want to say that that is not a function of the Abattoirs Bill.  I wanted to give the initial information that the Food Hygiene Regulations are being updated and will be rigorously enforced and will cover the genuine concerns expressed by some Senators and in particular Senator McMahon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;knackery&rdquo; is used often in a slang way about various people, professions and premises. Knackeries are a very important part of the regulated control of dead animals in rural areas.  Without knackeries farmers would be unable to dispose of animals that died from various diseases or accidents on the farm.  Of course they are an added source of outlet for various hound hunt packs and people who require this kind of meat for non-human use.  At present there seems to be a spate of unregistered, unrecognised and unregulated knackeries which have somehow grown up.  Sometimes they are adjacant to people living in semi-urban areas. They create a lot of annoyance for people either by smell, or pollution and by attracting rodents and other undesirable things.  In this section the Minister precludes anybody from having a premises unless it is licensed.  The Minister should in giving licences to knackeries, have regard to the overall level of pollution caused by these unrecognised knackeries.</P>
      <P>Large commercial knackeries also create tremendous problems.  I am talking about the by-processing meat industry, the bone meal industry or the other larger enterprises which collect dead animals, store them and then process them by cooking, grinding and other processes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are absolutely scourged with one in my constituency at present.  A well known meat baron &mdash; in fairness I will not name him but everybody knows who I am talking about &mdash; has got considerable <Col N="528" /> Government support for his business.  He has ignored to a large extent requests from the local authority to tidy up his enterprise and to stop polluting the town of Cahir, polluting the environment, and the river.  He has been brought to court and fined and he has until next year to put in the proper process that will remove the obnoxious smell that emanates from his by-product factory.  The factory gives tremendous employment and everybody appreciates that but there is a price to be paid for anything.  The town of Cahir has 100,000 visitors per annum.  They come to look at the magnificent castle which was restored at colossal expense to the taxpayer but people are now unable to visit it because of the unpleasantness of the environment in and around the factory. Likewise, sporting activities have almost to be cancelled.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister that in the process of giving licences to people, that he and his Department, in consultation with the Department of the Environment, have overall regard to the problems created by knackeries.  I opened my remarks by saying that knackeries are very important. I know they are but surely there must be places where they can be allowed to develop which will not create problems for the people living in the area and to the environment to which we are addressing ourselves these days.  I hope this section will not allow people to have an unregistered premises and that the Minister will have regard to the points I have made.</P>

      <P>This section provides that any premises used for or in the collection, delivery, supply, slaughter, storage, skinning or cutting up of animals or parts of animals which are not intended for human consumption will be required to have a knackery licence granted under this Bill.  In my speech on Second Stage <Col N="529" /> I acknowledged the important contribution which these premises make to agriculture.  I am aware of the concern of the general public about pollution.  I recently visited Cahir and it was quite unpleasant to travel alongside the River Fee.  The smell from the river was absolutely horrific.  I am fully in accord with what Senator Ferris has said.  I am sure that the Minister for the Environment and his Department will ensure that waste from these premises will be handled properly so that pollution will be eliminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations should be enforced to ensure that these knackeries carry on their business in a manner that will not be injurious to any other section of the community.  I am glad that both the Minister and Senator Ferris recognise the service that the knackeries give.  Last year or the year before many animals in the west died of starvation and they were not taken to the knackeries. The animals were left on farms to decay and that was far more unpleasant than anything that emanates from a knackery. The animals were not taken to the knackeries because the farmers did not want it to be known that their animals had died.</P>
      <P>I am not sure that the smell from knackeries is so objectionable.  It may be to people who pass through towns and who are not used to it.  Many years ago we got medical advice which said that it was harmless.  Many knackeries have operated for years in Dublin.  There is one near the Coombe Hospital.  Many thousands of people were born and have lived all their lives there and they were not harmed by the smell that came from the knackery.  It is not the smell that causes the harm: it is the pollution in the water or the grounds around the knackeries. We did not have that problem in the city of Dublin because all the polluting liquids were taken away and disposed of properly.  In knackeries in rural areas there may be inadequate provision made for the disposal of the drainage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations should be such that they will not put out of business anybody <Col N="530" /> who is prepared to make a reasonable effort to ensure that there is no pollution. I hope that the regulations will not be so strict that there be fewer knackeries. They give a very important service.  If they are not there the problem might be far greater.  Knackery owners will only travel a certain distance to take in animals. There will be no such thing as travelling from Galway to Limerick or even half-way between either city to take in an animal.  It will only pay them to travel so far.  It is important that we should keep the small knackery in business.  The problem will be far greater if the regulations are so strict that they put knackeries out of business.</P>

The regulations should be rigorously enforced.  I have made representations to the Minister for the Environment in relation to the transport of offal.  Sometimes when one is travelling along a road one can come upon a truck with offal without a cover on it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the reasons I thought the Minister might have allowed my previous amendment without a vote. I did not use this against the Minister because in debates on legislation I want to be fair to the Minister as well.  Section 36 (1) provides that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="532" /> A local authority shall allocate one or more veterinary inspectors to carry out the duties conferred on a veterinary inspector by this Act to each abattoir and its functional area but may allocate any particular veterinary inspector to two or more abattoirs.</P>
    <P>That is acceptable because it may not be possible for some local authorities to have more than one vet and he will have to have a back up service.  However, section 36(2) states:</P>
    <P>A veterinary inspector shall attend at each abattoir to which he is allocated at such times as the local authority, after consultation with the holder of the licence, may determine....</P>
    <P>That is all I was asking for on the other section.  The Minister has legislated for it in this section yet he refused to legislate for it in that other section.  Either I and the Minister are on different wave lengths or the parliamentary draftsman took a rest in between one section and another. The power conferred by this section is what I required on the other section.  Now that it is written in here I am satisfied that there will have to be consultation between the holder of the licence and the local authority and that that consultation will arise at the time the veterinarian will be sent out and that any other times the Minister may lay down will have to have regard to that.  I want to bring to the Minister's attention and put on the record of the House that the parliamentary draftsman has conceded in this section what I was seeking before.  For that reason I thought it would be appropriate to have the legislation consistent throughout. I am not a parliamentary draftsman but I do see the desirability of what I was seeking to have included.  In order to keep the Bill consistent, perhaps on Report Stage the Minister might tidy up the previous section to keep it in line with this one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not put down an amendment to this section because it is important that it remains as it is so that the carcass can be identified by a mark.  I welcome the Minister's commitment that particular abattoirs and butchers might have an identification mark on their meat.  This would enable people to trace carcasses back to the source where they were killed under veterinary supervision.</P>
      <P>I just want to tidy up, for my own benefit and for the benefit of those who will need to stamp meat, where the stamp will be put and what substance will be used in the identification mark.  I know from experience that meat is stamped with a blue mark which can look undesirable and may lead to consumers sometimes requesting butchers to remove it.  I am not sure what substance is used in that mark but I presume it is non-toxic. It should be possible to identify a carcass without having to look at the ear and tuberculosis tags which are the overall identification marks, so long as they have not been removed before the animal is killed and that is not beyond the bounds of possibility either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is more presentable to hang a carcass without the head so we must decide what portion of the carcass the mark can be put on and at what stage that mark can be removed by the butcher.  If the portion of meat that has the mark on it is sold or if the mark has been removed at the <Col N="534" /> request of the customer, how can a veterinary inspector or any public health inspector who calls later confirm that the meat was ever marked.  When can the mark be taken off, where is it to be put on and what substance will be used in the dye?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The design, type and composition of the mark has not yet been decided on.  Furthermore, with 32 individual local authorities and up to 180 veterinary practitioners in some 850 private abattoirs the global or individual nature of the stamp will have to be considered. However, the likelihood is that in order to ensure a tracing facility something along the lines of an individual abattoir stamp will emerge.  In anticipation of this, section 11 (3) on abattoir licences already provides for the assignation of a distinctive number or letter or both to each licensed abattoir.  This is the standing system that obtains in the export plants where it has worked satisfactorily. I will take the views of the trade into account in coming to a final decision on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the mark may be put in one of a number of places. When people buy meat they could buy the portion that bears the mark.  For that reason it would be necessary to put the mark on a number of parts of the animal, for example, the hind quarter, flank, shoulders or the strip loin.  This will be decided when the regulations are make. The stamp used will contain no residues and the public need have no fears in this regard.  The public are becoming increasingly concerned about colouring matter and additives.  The mark will be edible and will not contain toxic residues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a misleading discussion because it is impossible to put a stamp on a carcase of an animal, say, cattle or sheep that is going to carry right through to the consumer.  More and more <Col N="535" /> meat is being processed behind the shop and is offered for sale in a pre-packed condition.  I agree with the Minister on the four positions where the stamp is put on a carcase.  You can do no more than that.  I do not think it is intended that the stamp should carry right through to the consumer.  First, the trade would not stand for it and many consumers would object to it.  The removal of the stamp will not be at the behest of the consumer, it will be at the behest of the trader because no trader would put meat on display showing a stamp on one part of the cut and no stamp on a cut beside it. The consumer will always go for the piece that is unstamped.  Let us be frank about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was never intended that an inspector would inspect every slice of meat.  All traders will have a carcase lying by and that is the carcase that will be inspected and he will take a reasonable inspection of the cut up or processed meat.  I do not think it is possible to have a stamp and if we go to the extent that a local authority would insist on the stamp being put on every square inch of the meat then it is tantamount to putting a man out of business.  We must be reasonable about this.  The stamp on the carcase or the half carcase or quarter carcase in the cold room should be sufficient.  These inspectors will be intelligent enough to know whether one is held for the purpose of an inspector calling and the rest is being traded otherwise.  That kind of operator will be quickly caught up with.  We are labouring too much on this stamping aspect.  It is essential to identify where a carcase comes from but if I buy a pound of round steak I do not think an inspector should look for a stamp on that and no trader will offer that piece of steak for sale.  I am in the business for years and I know exactly what happens.  The stamp is removed before the quarter is cut up unless it is being processed and the stamp would not be identifiable after processing. I think that the stamp being at the four locations, as is the practice to date, is sufficient to carry through to <Col N="536" /> ensure that and the rest should be left to the inspectors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there was ever any suggestion from me that all cuts of meat and bits of round steak and T-bones should be individually stamped. This section talks about the Minister making regulations about where the stamp is to be applied.  Surely then it is appropriate to ask the Minister where he considers, in discussions with anybody, that the stamp should be applied because it would be an offence to remove a mark if it is so applied.  The reason I am asking the question is because people in the trade have asked me where this stamp will be put.  They have had customers asking them to remove the stamp because it looked unsightly on particular cuts.  I am less concerned about meat that comes from a small domestic butcher which is hanging up in the butcher's shop and visible to everybody and is usually stamped than I am about cuts of meat that are pre-packed and sold at supermarkets. Nobody that I am aware of at the moment knows the source, the quality, the standard or the hygiene that that has acquired or what disease status that particular meat might have had.  Because it is going through a big chain store is one of the reasons I am extremely anxious that we should have the regulations for everybody. I know that meat which is sold into a factory for export, if it is sent in as animals that have reacted particularly to tuberculosis and to a lesser degree brucellosis, is precluded from being exported unless it is pre-cooked.  The only outlet for factories then are the supermarkets. It is important that we know about that pre-packing and all the butchering that goes on behind the scenes before it appears on the actual stand of the major supermarket chains in this city and in other larger towns.  I am more worried about the source of supply of that meat than I am about the source of supply of meat from a small butcher who will have had the meat examined from a disease eradication point of view and from the human consumption point of view.  It will have a stamp where the <Col N="537" /> customer can see it and somebody actually identifies where they want the piece cut from.  That is how the rest of the country outside of Dublin survive in the provinces.  That is how a normal butcher survives on the high street of any of the towns.</P>
      <P>I realise that Senator McMahon has a professional experience in the business and his experience is invaluable to us but I do not want it to be insinuated that we want marks on every piece of meat.  I want to ask if the Minister has decided where he is putting these marks.  Now the Minister has spelled out for the record where he hopes they will be put and no doubt the trade will have consultation with him to know whether that is practicable or impracticable and when it can be removed so that no inspector can arrive afterwards which would still be possible, because this Bill confers certain powers on various inspectors to come at the source of selling to ensure that the meat is a proper sale.  I have a further amendment dealing with that in another section of the Bill.  That is the only reason I raised the location of the mark.</P>

The Minister has, in the initial <Col N="538" /> stages of the Bill, confirmed that he had a worry about this particular section.  It is accepted that we do not want to preclude the right of the occasional killing of animals on farms for their own personal use.  If that is the case then it is appropriate that we should remove that provision from the regulations that apply to subsection (2).  The subsection would then read as follows:</P>
    <P>(3) Subsection (2) of this section shall not apply to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  meat which is in an abattoir and is awaiting the application of a health mark in accordance with this Act;</P>
    <P>(b)  meat which the person in whose possession it was found can establish was acquired by him in good faith and he did not know that it required to be marked with a health mark.</P>
    <P>This would mean that anybody who kills animals privately would be subject to the regulations in the earlier part of subsection 42.</P>

      <P>As mentioned in the discussion on section 2 of this Bill it is proposed to bring forward on Report Stage an amendment to the home slaughtering concession contained in the definition of &ldquo;abattoir&rdquo; in that section.  The purpose of this amendment is to confine the home slaughtering concession to a pig or an animal injured by accident where slaughter is necessary to prevent suffering. This amendment will therefore considerably restrict any home slaughtering and should also allay the trades concern about the abuse of such a facility. Arising from the amendment to section 2 a consequential amendment will be required to section 42(3)(b) of this Bill. Here the provision allowing home slaughtered meat to remain unmarked will be amended confining it to a pig or an injured animal.  The amendment to this section will also be brought forward on Report Stage.  The inspection of meat derived from home slaughtering would be extremely difficult to implement on <Col N="539" /> the ground and would represent an overkill in bureaucracy and red tape.  There would be a serious danger that where home slaughtered meat bore a health mark such meat could readily find its way onto the open market.  Thus controls on the home slaughtering concession &mdash; and that concession could be restricted by amendment to a pig or an injured animal &mdash; could be seriously undermined and perhaps the whole Bill could be put at risk.</P>
      <P>We are saying that home slaughtering will be allowed for a pig or an injured animal for use in the household and that that meat will be unmarked.  The suggestion that it should be marked would cause a lot of bureaucracy and would enable that meat to find its way onto the retail market.  In giving a concession for home slaughtering we are confining it to household use.  If it is unmarked it cannot end up at retail outlets.  I cannot agree to this amendment because of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister has said.  When I put down this amendment he had not conceded the other one. Time has passed it out, so to speak.  One of the reasons I wanted home killed meat to achieve a certain status as well was in the interest of the consumer.  I am concerned &mdash; but I suppose that concern is now lessening with the regulations we have introduced in connection with the use of hormones &mdash; that, even with our best efforts, a certain amount of illicit hormones will still be on the market.  If people in their innocence used hormones for their own animals at home to improve the texture in heifer meat in particular and if one of those got injured within the stipulated time lag between implantation and destruction if that meat was used by the female members of the household it would confer a major health risk.  I was concerned that even if people were doing it for private purposes the overall good of the individual cannot be ignored by us with responsibility in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is confining himself, as he has committed himself, in the slaughtering of animals in the home to either a porcine animal or an injured bovine, or <Col N="540" /> any other animal that might be injured on a farm and he is removing the obligation to have that stamped, so be it.  I was presuming he would allow it to be done and I wanted him to apply the same standard of health regulation to the meat killed at home.  In the original section there was a risk that meat killed at home, purportedly for private use, could find its way on to the market.  Perhaps this is the source of supply to which Senator McMahon referred.  It is appropriate that there should still be some consultation between the veterinary surgeon involved and people who may want to kill at home. This should probably be done in the presence of or by the herd owner's private veterinary surgeon because there must be regard for the humanitarian destruction of the animal also.  I do not mind whether it is marked but I worry about the need to ensure that some veterinary control is there in connection with implanted animals in particular over the next period of years until we get people to move away from the concept of requiring implanted animals to achieve weight gains they felt they could never acquire if they did not use hormones.  That was my only concern. However, I accept that the original amendment tightens up the section and removes the necessity for this.  Therefore, I will not press the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to have a point clarified.  The Minister said the slaughtering of animals for home consumption would be confined to a pig or injured animal.  Does he mean by that that the pig need not be injured, that one can slaughter a pig without notifying anybody but in, say, the case of a lamb it must be an injured lamb?  If that is so I do not understand the difference between the risks involved in slaughtering a lamb for home consumption and the risks involved in slaughtering a pig. Why make a distinction between the two?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think anybody would object if there were a requirement to notify the local authority that slaughter of an animal was taking place.  It might not be any harm if the Minister considered putting that into the Bill.  The local authority <Col N="541" /> would notify the veterinary inspector and, though he would not have to pay a visit, he would at least know how many slaughterings were taking place in his area.  This would control slaughterings to some extent.  I know many of the animals could be injured at the weekend or even on a weekday and it would not be possible to notify the local authority, but there should be a requirement on that person to notify the local authority, but there that the animal was killed.  If the veterinary surgeon felt that he should make an inquiry as to the health status of the animal that had been slaughtered or was about to be slaughtered, he would be free to do so.</P>
    <P>I would be opposed to the elimination of the slaughter of animals for home consumption. If a man is rearing 100 sheep or 1,000 sheep he should be entitled to slaughter one for his own use.  It is ridiculous that he should have to sell the sheep to a wholesale or retail outlet and then buy back again.  If people are producing an item of food surely they are entitled to use it themselves.  The vast majority of people would not use meat that was chancy in any way.  I know there is a risk there and some people would not realise that there was a risk.  For that reason it would be no harm if in future legislation, the Minister, put in a requirement that the local authority should be notified of all killings.  They need not take any action but it would be open to them to make some inquiry.  In ignorance a person could kill an animal for home consumption that would be injurious to his own health and that of his family. There are not many farmers or producers of animals who do not know the difference between an animal that could harm them and one that could not, but there might be the odd one.  There should be some regulation to tighten that up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be inclined to agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator McMahon.  I know that in recent years we have seen a growth in the deep freeze business.  In rural areas, in particular, farmers tend to kill an animal and <Col N="542" /> put it into the deep freeze.  Whether it is one, two, three, four or five lambs does not matter.  The same applies to a beast. That is a regular feature of rural Ireland at present.  There should be some way of allowing that to continue because I do not think there is any health hazard.  The farmer knows the beast he is killing.  He knows he is free of all disease and would not kill him otherwise.</P>
      <P>This happens on a fairly regular basis at this time of the year.  Farmers kill a few lambs at this time of year and put them into the deep freeze.  They kill a bovine and do the same thing and they know the type of meat they are using for their families.  They do not have to be afraid of contaminated meat or any other kind of meat where they might be at risk. I hope that some way can be found to get around the problem so that people would be allowed to slaughter.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this section is to allow the tradition of killing a pig or an animal in the home for home consumption to continue.  In consultations the trade wanted this practice outlawed altogether but in deference to the tradition, in particular in outlying areas, we allowed this concession. However, I suspect it is not a very widespread activity now.  Many people who want an animal of their own killed and cut up go to a local butcher or to the local abattoir to get it done because people do not have facilities on farmyards for doing this.  At the same time we felt that as a concession&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the amount in question may be dwindling but, at the same time, there is a tradition as has been stated, not just regarding the pig but also regarding lambs, not so much about a beast because it is not so easy to handle a beast.  There are many people &mdash; and not too far from this city &mdash; who have beasts slaughtered.  They normally take them to a slaughter yard and have them slaughtered and taken back and put in their deep freeze.  There are many people throughout the country who kill a lamb, or several lambs, during the year.  Now they are going to be prevented from doing this.  In other words, they must take that lamb to the slaughter yard to have it killed for their own consumption.  That is asking a bit too much of these people. No matter what regulation is there the Minister cannot stop it.  So we might as <Col N="544" /> well admit it and allow in the Bill that an uninjured lamb or pig could be slaughtered on their own farm for home consumption.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Minister that thousands of lambs will be slaughtered up and down the country for home consumption and no regulations of the Minister, or of his successors will stop that until the person himself stops it.  I would not have to go too far from this city to be able to point out places where this is being done now.  I was in that business up to a few years ago and the offal used to come to me because they had no way of disposing of it.  There is a new tannery in my part of the country so they dispose of it now in that way.  I know by the individual sheepskins going in there that it is still happening to a great extent in County Dublin.  I can assure the Minister that it is happening up and down the country and I do not believe that this regulation is going to stop it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I think a case is being made for a smaller type of animal.  We are still awaiting the Minister's suggested amendment on Report Stage.  The Minister has suggested a pig or injured animal but why not meet the wishes of both sides of the House that it be either a pig, lamb or injured animal?  That would presume that a bigger animal such as a bullock or heifer that might be injured could be killed at home without the necessity of going to the abattoir or a butcher but that all other slaughterings of healthy animals would be done in a regulated place and would be subject to what is contained in the rest of the Bill such as the health regulation and so on.  One should not have to sell the animal to do this.  There are exceptional circumstances where people still kill the occasional bullock or heifer themselves even though they are not injured.  They do this sometimes and they have facilities. I was anxious that they would retain some standards but if the Minister legislates that that animal must be killed in a butchers' or an abattoir that is fine and I know the trade were looking for that. The exclusion should also include lamb and I think the Minister would meet the <Col N="545" /> wishes of the House.  The Minister still has time to do this on Report Stage and he should certainly consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly agree with these sentiments because I know what is happening in my own part of the country. For the past few years quite a number of farmers in the country have got deep freezes.  They kill a few lambs or a heifer at this time of the year and as far as I can see this Bill is going to prevent that kind of thing happening.  They do that by taking the lamb or heifer to the local butcher and get it slaughtered there.  I gather from this section that they will have to have the veterinary surgeon there to examine that animal before it is slaughtered. They will have to have the veterinary inspector to stamp the meat after the animal is slaughtered and that, in itself, is going to create problems, as it is only one animal in the year because that is all most of them kill.  One animal will do the whole year.  It is going to create problems for some of them as far as I can see, unless I am misinterpreting the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>A farmer can easily get over this.  He can easily break the animal's leg.  Many farmers would not do that but this is pushing them into injuring the animal.  If they do not want to leave themselves open to acting illegally they can ensure that a lamb is injured.  I do not think that temptation should be put in the way of anybody when the lamb can easily be included in the Bill before the provision dealing with the injured animal.  Maybe the people go for beef in Cork but we all cannot afford that meat and in my part of the country we go for a smaller animal.  The Minister can put ten more sections into the Bill but I do not believe it will stop that trade.  We might as well admit this and have it straight in the Bill.  If sheep are included with the pig before the word &ldquo;injured&rdquo; it would be much better.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this section is to allow a farmer to kill a pig <Col N="546" /> or an injured animal for household consumption. There was widespread representation to the Department that this be opposed entirely but it was felt that there was a tradition, in particular of killing a pig.  Therefore, we decided to introduce an amendment on Report Stage to allow for the killing of a pig or an injured animal or heifer or whatever for household consumption.  We felt that this was going far enough because if it was allowed on a wide scale there could be abuses and we wanted to eliminate or reduce the areas of abuse as far as possible.  There is no difficulty for any farmer or any landowner going to his local butcher or his abattoir and having an animal or any kind killed and dressed up for his deep freeze.  There is no difficulty there.  That is the sensible way to approach this matter.  I feel there could be some abuses as the facilities are not on most farms for slaughtering animals.</P>
      <P>I have experience of visiting farms where animals were slaughtered or in some cases where somebody tried to slaughter the animal.  They were strung up on loaders of tractors and so on.  I do not think it would be wise to allow widespread slaughtering of animals on farms because the facilities, plant and equipment are not there.  Nevertheless, as a concession the killing of a pig or an injured animal will be allowed for home consumption.  If farmers want to regularly kill any animal for household consumption they will still be able to do that and get it prepared for the deep freeze at their local butcher shop or local abattoir.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points here.  There is a contradiction because, first, the Minister is permitting the killing of a pig while stating there are no facilities on farms for the slaughter of animals. It is much easier to slaughter a lamb than a pig.  I would think if that argument was being put forward it would have been the reverse because any farmer's son can slaughter and dress a lamb but it takes the farmer, his son and his neighbours to do the same operation for a pig, as has <Col N="547" /> been the tradition and as the Minister knows.</P>
      <P>We ask that the Minister would allow a smaller animal to be killed than the one allowed to be killed on the farm for home consumption.  I could not accept the argument that there are no facilities on a farm.  There are far greater facilities to kill a lamb than there are to kill a pig and a lot less harm can be done in killing, processing or cutting up a lamb for home consumption provided there are freezing facilities available.  A pig can be dealt with without any freezing because a pig is normally salted.  The meat is put into all sorts of baths and tubs and salted although we have passed from that age also because people do not like meat quite as salty as was the case years ago.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider if he were faced with the killing of a lamb or a pig which he would choose to do because it is much much easier to carry out the operation on a lamb.  It would be a pity to victimise the person who does not rear pigs, because whereas his neighbour could kill a healthy uninjured pig, he has to wait until a lamb is injured or transport it to the butcher or the local slaughteryard.  There is the risk that some people, who may not feel as we do, may injure the animal to ensure that they are within the law in killing that lamb and I do not think we should put that temptation in their way.  I had another point but it escapes me at present.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 26, between lines 14 and 15, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) In the case of any dispute arising from a determination under this section, the matter shall be referred to any recognised research station for independent arbitration and decision.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 43 deals with the rights of veterinary examiners.  As I said to Senator McMahon earlier, a veterinary examiner now will have the power to decide whether meat he examines is fit or unfit for human consumption.  There is a whole area of disagreement about minced meat: it could be considered to be bacteriologically correct but from the moment it is put through the mincer the heat process of mincing meat starts a new bacteriological process which is then open to question.  I am anxious in the interests of everybody that we would have regard to some independent view as to the bacteriological content of meat which is subject to disagreement.  I suggest it be referred to a research station, if we have any research station left after the Book of Estimates.  I presume AFT <Col N="549" /> and ACOT will have some research facilities available to them.  They are capable of carrying out bacteriological tests on meat on whether it is edible or fit for human consumption.</P>
    <P>I would like if the trade could have access to an independent view rather than depend on the physical examination by a veterinarian who will be just looking possibly at the colour of meat.  At times if you hang meat well and long enough and it becomes slightly discoloured that meat turns out to be the tenderest most juicy piece of steak but in the opinion of some veterinarian it might be considered to have gone off.  With the extension of the power to be given to the veterinary examiner they would implement regulations and remove licences and all these other unpleasant things we talked about. I hope the Minister will accept the principle of what I am trying to do: in the area of any dispute, a recognised research station or independent arbitration would give the final decision on whether meat was fit for human consumption.  It is an area of wide argument so I understand if there is a problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes to allow an appeal against condemnation of meat by a veterinary examiner in the export plants.  It is with those plants that this section is solely concerned.  Such a provision would make life impossible for a veterinary examiner as every condemnation would be appealed.  It would also be very impractical having regard to the volume of slaughtering at such plants and the assembly line nature of the process.  Production at the plants would be seriously impaired also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The absence of such an appeal has not been a problem at the export plants to date.  Plant managements recognise that veterinary examiners are best qualified in determining the fitness or otherwise of meat.  Perhaps what Senator Ferris is saying is that there should be a provision against condemnation in domestic abattoirs as opposed to export plants.  In this <Col N="550" /> connection the domestic trade has contended that the local authority veterinarians should not be the sole judge as to whether meat is good or bad.  Then what would apply to the export side would apply to the home front and probably more so given the fact that there are some 850 domestic abattoirs as opposed to 70 export plants.</P>
    <P>In the context of meat or offal being condemned at local abattoirs, domestic traders have sought provision for meat to be tested by an independent research body; such a provision would prove to be inoperable, create delays and add to expenses and, of course, these expenses will fall back on the traders themselves.</P>
    <P>Adjudication of meat solely by local authority veterinary inspectors has not proven to be a problem in the past.  Meat condemnations are and have been taking place at domestic abattoirs and I fail to see why there would a problem in the future.  I certainly have not had any complaints about it because either the meat is fit for human consumption or it is not. That is a simple standard and I do not think any butcher would disagree with that.  The veterinary inspectors will be qualified and experienced in determining the fitness or otherwise of the meat which is, after all, the primary reason such officers are being conferred with major responsibilities under the Bill.  They must follow and can only have regard to the veterinary examination regulations to be made under section 39.</P>
    <P>The condemnation in whole or in part of a carcase could deal a heavy blow to a small proprietor and seriously affect his operating margins.  For that reason I am confident that veterinary inspectors will prove to be absolutely objective in their determination of fitness or otherwise of meat for human consumption.  Indeed, where there may be doubt and further analysis is necessary, sections 36 and 39 allow for laboratory tests to be conducted. For the most part, condemnations will be on visible inspection. Where laboratory analyses are concerned and the bacteriological quality of the meat is concerned, sections 36 and 39 <Col N="551" /> allow for laboratory tests to be conducted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend the amendment to apply to the carcase because if we are to have legislation we must determine and agree that somebody is responsible and competent.  A veterinary surgeon is trained to make decisions when he examines a carcase on whether it has lesions which can be removed which would not affect humans or whether the whole animal or part of was either ill-bled or had been damaged in some accident that would make it unfit.  I would defend the right of any veterinary inspector to make that decision.</P>
      <P>I was concerned &mdash; but the Minister has now removed some of my concern&mdash; about other sections of the Bill relating to meat &mdash; not the carcase.  A carcase is intact after killing and is visible.  I know the mayhem that goes on in factories on the production line and that a veterinary surgeon has to be on his toes to be able to come to grips with the number of animals passing him by.  I realise that, but I am concerned about meat because there can be disputes about whether meat is ripe, over-ripe, edible, ready, well hung or not hung long enough.  People's tastes vary in this area.  If the Minister can assure me that in the two other sections there are facilities for laboratory examination I am satisfied and I accept that there is no need to make the amendment to this section.  This deals specifically with carcases or offals, as is stated in the section. I will have to re-read the other two sections to ensure that the Minister is not pulling the wool over my eyes.  I do not think the Minister would do that anyway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Ferris is perfectly right.  There are customers even still who insist to their local butcher that the carcase is seven days killed. People in the trade have to hold back meat to ensure that it is seven days old because, if some customers were to find out that the butcher had misled them, or had sold them meat which was only four or five days killed, they would go elsewhere. There is the risk that there could <Col N="552" /> be a difference between what an inspector would consider fit for consumption and what, perhaps, a family have been using for 20, 30, 40 or 50 years and no harm has come to them because of it.  It is extremely dangerous if pig meat is well hung or over-hung but very little harm, if any, can be done by beef being over-hung. Many people like their beef to smell a little before cooking it.  There are people who have been doing this for many years.</P>
      <P>Inspectors will be covering a very wide area because of cutbacks on overtime etc.  The local authority will have one inspector doing their entire area or, indeed, two local authorities could have one inspector.  Apart from that, we must ensure that they carry out their work efficiently.  I have the greatest respect for the majority of inspectors.  An inspector could have a brother in the business and it might be beneficial to the family to limit or put another person out of business.  If it was suspected that a person had meat which was unfit for sale for human consumption, they should have recourse to some other body rather than the decision of the inspector being final, because the country is not that big.  There is room for a lot of us here, despite what the Minister for Foreign Affairs said.  Our relatives are getting these jobs and, therefore, we must ensure that this does not creep in, where the relative of a butcher down the road was the inspector for my shop.  I would like to have the Minister's assurance that this is not likely to happen.</P>

      <P>I discussed amendment No. 13 with the other amendments in the context of indexation of charges as a whole which involved fees.  It would be unfair to press this amendment as a previous vote has determined it.  I am still not satisfied though, and certainly the trade are not satisfied, that there is a sufficient safeguard in the levy section. To try to meet all the arguments made for and against it, I will be putting down an amendment on Report Stage seeking indexation of the levies, not indexation of the licence fees and all the other areas of recompense that the State will need to do the job properly.</P>
      <P>As Senator Connor said we could suddenly run out of money and not be able to do the job properly.  People in the farming industry have been worried about levies because they have been subjected to doubling in the past.

Can the Minister confirm if that will be the process of collection because there are a number of <Col N="554" /> days here that butchers are supposed to send in money.  Our experience is that that will not happen.  The only way this could be applied is that the local authority might be made responsible with the Revenue collectors for the collection of fees under this section.  If that were to happen, then I would not be worried because the local authority now have Revenue collectors who would be in a position to call to the butchers to collect the money which is the way it is being done at the moment by the BTE offices.  If we were to depend on butchers to meet on a certain number of days in the months, like everybody else, it would be put on the long finger or forgotten about.  The Minister might confirm if the local authority will be collecting the fees?</P>

What records are we talking about?  I referred to this in my Second Stage speech, that I think it is important that records would be kept of animals from a disease eradication point of view.  Small abattoirs and butchers should be required to keep those records.  What records are the Minister referring to when he talks about records here?  I just want clarification.

The maintenance of records is provided for herein in connection with the payment of fees on slaughtering by abattoir licence holders.  Already abattoir licence holders have a duty to keep records under section 12 of the Bovine Disease (Levies) Act, 1979, and section 31 of the Central Fund Act, 1939; in effect of levies tabled under these Acts.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 34, subsection (1), line 31, after &ldquo;knackeries&rdquo; to add &ldquo;provided that in making regulations under this subsection the Minister shall give full details of the requirements specified therein.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 61, probably worries the meat retail trade, butchers who have slaughterhouses themselves or abattoirs.  For the record we might read section 61 (1):</P>
      <P>The Minister may, by Regulations, specify requirements in relation to the siting, layout, accommodation and construction, water supply and sanitary facilities and equipment and appliances for premises which are, or are to be used as abattoirs or knackeries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very general statement and it confers very wide powers in the hands of the Minister.  Naturally the people who are involved in the trade are extremely worried as to the full implications of those words.  If you take, for instance, the siting of an abattoir; the question arises in relation to existing abattoirs as to what implications this holds for the present <Col N="556" /> sites of abattoirs.  Will they have to be resited as a result of this section in this Bill?</P>
    <P>We would like the Minister to come out and state exactly what is meant by the wording of this section.  The words &ldquo;layout&rdquo;&ldquo;accommodation&rdquo; and &ldquo;construction&rdquo; are used.  Does that mean the present layout of existing abattoirs may not be satisfactory?  If they are not satisfactory, under layout regulations what must be the minimum and maximum size of abattoirs?  The same thing goes for the word &ldquo;accommodation&rdquo;; what kind of accommodation?  What size of accommodation? The word &ldquo;construction&rdquo;, is used.  Is there a particular kind of construction up to a certain specified standard that must be used?</P>
    <P>Of all the sections of this Bill which the trade fears, this is the one that most of them feel has the potential to put them out of business because many ordinary butchers in the trade at the moment have their own premises for slaughter, observing the standards, regularly inspected by the health inspectors as it is under the existing legislation.  To all intents and purposes they are carrying on their business or they are carrying out their slaughtering to a very hygienic standard and indeed the provisions of this Bill will not or cannot improve the standards under which they carry out this part of the business. They are naturally very fearful of the implication of this section because it may place upon them the burden of replacing their existing facilities which would mean the commitment of thousands of pounds or possibly tens of thousands of pounds for new buildings or finding a new site.</P>
    <P>The other words used there are, &ldquo;equipment&rdquo; and &ldquo;appliances&rdquo;.  Most butchers nowadays have chilling facilities in the vicinity of their own shop or within the actual selling area.  Does the use of the word &ldquo;appliances&rdquo; mean that new chilling equipment will have to be provided in abattoirs under these new regulations? The statistic has been mentioned during discussion on this Bill in the House that there are about 850 abattoirs <Col N="557" /> throughout the country.  The organisations representing the butchers feel that this has a potential to wipe out half of them.  It would remove the slaughter of animals for the domestic meat trade more and more into certain approved large abattoirs or perhaps to abattoirs that are specifically there for the export meat trade.</P>
    <P>One of the major factors which keep bottom in the lifestock trade is that there is competition which exists between the domestic meat trade, the people who purchase for the domestic meat trade, the butchers, and the people who purchase for the export meat trade, the export meat factories.  Competition keeps a buoyancy in the trade.  It is a well established competition.  If we were to take out by these regulations, perhaps half of the existing abattoirs in the country, and that might be a conservative estimate, you would also be taking out a very large element of the competition of the trade and that would have a major implication for the farmers.  We have already seen too much monopolisation in the slaughter of animals for the export trade.  We have got this coming together more and more of large conglomerates controlling huge sections of the Irish meat export trade at the moment and that is not good.  If the effects of these sections in this Bill is to take out some of the smaller abattoirs, that has an implication for competition. I ask the Minister &mdash; and we feel very strongly about this &mdash; that you would come up front and let us know in broad outline what you mean by siting, layout, location, construction applicances and equipment in so far as they are referred to in this section?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies, I had gone over this section in my mind to know if this was the appropriate way to amend it.  First of all, the Minister when replying to Second Stage confirmed that there will be a uniform set of regulations and requirements and standards throughout the country, that it will not vary from one county to another and that that will be based on the number of animals that are likely to be killed at <Col N="558" /> any given time and the facilities available and that also a period of some five years will be given from the date of implementation of this Bill for the trade to bring their existing abattoirs up to the standards required.</P>
      <P>I hope when the Minister is making the regulations that he will come forward with some of the suggestions made by Senator Connor because people are worried in case their existing facilities are unsuitable.  They do not know yet what regulations the Minister is bringing in and they are afraid that half of them might be closed down.  Five years is a reasonable period for them to achieve the required standards.  Perhaps the Minister would outline in broad terms, if he does not want it written into the Bill, his idea of an appropriate area for a slaughter house.  In our regulations in South Tipperary we say that it should be located in a place free from conditions that may injuriously affect the sanitary operation thereof; that the slaughter house should be adequate in all respects for its intended purpose; that the lay-out and design of the slaughter house should be such as to facilitate the total physical separation of clean and dirty operations carried out therein and that for that purpose rooms or areas in which edible and inedible materials are handled and/or stored should be physically separated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody in the Department might consider that a tiled floor was probably the best floor for a butcher's shop.  All of us who know anything about butchers' shops will tell you that a floor on which you can sprinkle a bit of sawdust is the best floor because it will absorb pieces of meat that might fall and it can be all swept away cleanly.  That is the reason for the widespread use of sawdust in butcher's shops.  A tiled floor would have to be scrubbed about ten times a day if you were to keep it as clean as we would all like it to be kept.  The Minister might tell us what kind of regulations he will introduce.  Will those regulations come before us so that we can discuss them at length in this House to see whether they can be met physically and financially by the trade who have from the very outset <Col N="559" /> intimated their desire to co-operate with the Minister in bringing this legislation forward and trying to make it operable. This was an area about which they were concerned.  I assured them that the Minister in making regulations would probably bring them before us for discussion. But at least the Minister has confirmed that he will be making them consistent and uniform throughout the country.  At least nobody will be at a disadvantage then.  Let us talk about the requirements the Minister might want and then we can argue whether they are achievable or not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations to be made under this section will set out the standards to apply to premises used as abattoirs and knackeries.  They will be uniform and consistent throughout the country.  Generally the regulations will seek to ensure that premises are of sound construction, adequate in all respects for their intended purpose and in a state of good repair at all times.  As mentioned in my Second Stage speech the emphasis will be on hygiene and the standards will be reasonable and realistic and will be attainable.  An adequate amount of time will be given for butchers and proprietors to bring their premises up to standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to reiterate that the trade will be consulted on the provisions of the regulations before they are made.  In relation to subsection (1) the siting of a premises will be concerned with its location particularly in relation to any adverse environmental conditions which may affect its sanitary operation and the lay-out of the premises will be concerned primarily with satisfactory design so as to preclude congestion and the total physical separation of clean areas and unclean areas of operation.  The accommodation requirements will relate primarily to the provision of satisfactory lairaging, slaughtering and storage areas.  The construction requirements will specify criteria for yards, ceilings, doors, light, ventilation, drainage and so on.  The water supply and sanitary facilities for premises will specify standards in relation <Col N="560" /> to the provision of potable water, sterilisers, washhand basins and sanitary conveniences on the premises.  The equipment and appliances for premises will specify requirements in relation to stunning and slaughtering equipment, to rails, books, tables, benches, waste containers and various items of equipment within the premises.  I have already given assurances to the trade.  They will be fully consulted in advance about the content of the regulations before they are made law.  In this connection I hope to be able to forward drafts of the regulations, before the end of the next month, to the trade, to discuss in detail with them the contents of the regulations before they come into effect.  The officials of my Department have already had consultations with at least one of the organisations. All representatives of the trades will be fully consulted before the regulations come into effect.  It would seem that the aims of this amendment are adequately covered as it stands.  The regulations to be made on foot of the section will be specifying the requirements and standards for premises in consultation with the trade.  Accordingly there is no real requirement for the amendment because we are already discussing with the trade and their representative organisations the content of the regulations.  I again want to give an assurance that the draft regulations will be forwarded to the trade by the end of next month.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that the draft will be ready for circulation within a month.  It is a great pity that the draft is not before us here in this House as it would allay many of our fears or maybe it would heighten our fears.  The explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill states:</P>
      <P>The purposes of this Bill are (a) to provide standards of veterinary control and hygiene at local slaughtering premises providing meat for the home market which will be on a par with those already applying at export meat plants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="561" /> There are very high standards at export meat plants which can be well afforded because they are such large operations. Our great fear arises from the intelligence reports on existing slaughterhouses.  A report in the sixties or seventies stated that a high percentage were unsatisfactory and recommended that they should be brought up to standard or put out of operation.  Could the Minister give us any indication from the information gleaned by his Department of how many of these abattoirs would have to go out of business as a result of this section?  In relation to siting, it is obvious that the present siting of many abattoirs is unsatisfactory. I agree that if the siting is unsatisfactory they should be relocated. Nevertheless we would like to know at this stage from the information available on the unsatisfactory siting of a percentage of them, how many of them would have to be relocated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Connor that it is a pity the regulations are not before us.  I believe that if an effort had been made they could be before us and it would make it much easier to discuss this Bill and in particular this section.  I would like to inquire who will make the final decision.  Will it be a local inspector?  Will it be an inspector from the Department?  Again I want to put in a word of warning.  If it is a single inspector, even if he comes from the Department, he could be sent to a part of the country with which he is familiar. If so, there is a danger that he could be over exact in implementing the regulations in one instance while he would relax them, while meeting the regulations, in another instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Connor has spoken about the location of a slaughter premises.  It could be that in the opinion of one inspector the present location is satisfactory whereas in another inspector's opinion it would be more satisfactory to have it moved.  In these grey areas an inspector could, if he so wished, for whatever reason, be more exact in wanting the regulations to be implemented and in his interpretation of the regulations and the situation on the <Col N="562" /> ground.  Also I would hope that the Minister would give adequate time to allow the operators of these slaughter yards to bring them up to the standard required. I know we discussed this on Second Stage when the Minister dealt with it at some length but I forget if he put a time on it.</P>
    <P>Many of the slaughter yards have been brought up to a higher standard in the recent past.  Senator Connor referred to a report.  Since that report came out many of these slaughter yards have been brought up to a higher standard.  They have had their walls tiled.  The thinking today is to do away with tiles.  In a couple of hospitals I have visited around the country the tiles are left out of the kitchens and other materials put in their place.  If an inspector is going to insist on that under the regulations a person who has made an effort in the last ten or 15 years to bring his operation up to a higher standard of hygiene will be penalised. If tiling of walls is out and will not be permitted that could put a heavy financial burden on somebody who has already expended amounts of money on bringing his premises up to a fair standard of hygiene.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1980 a survey of abattoirs was conducted by the Department of Agriculture.  Of the 854 abattoirs in the country the following was the result of the survey: suitable premises, 19 per cent; suitable with minor modifications, 21 per cent; suitable with immediate modifications, 23 per cent; suitable with fairly major modifications, 21 per cent; unsuitable or requiring total construction, 16 per cent.  That was in 1982. The modifications required concerned such matters as equipment, fittings, lair-age, water supply, drainage, storage and sanitary facilities.  Following the survey in 1982, which Senator McMahon talked about, each property manager was communicated with a view towards action being taken to raise the standards of premises.  Some areas responded positively and improvements were made by the proprietors.  The fact of the matter is that there are still a large number of abattoirs where improvements will be <Col N="563" /> necessary.  There is a period of five years to allow people to bring their premises up to standard.  As can be seen from that survey there is a degree of modification and improvement in buildings, equipment and water supply required.  All of this will be done in a responsible way and in consultation with the trade.  Five years is an adequate length of time.  A number of people will suggest that five years is putting it on the long finger a bit and would prefer a shorter length of time.  In relation to these regulations the draft will be available before the end of next month, it will be available to the trade and will not be introduced until full consultation and discussion takes place with the trade.  At least one of the representative sections of the trade has had discussions in relation to these regulations. I would hope that they would be drawn up to fully meet the standards which will be required by the party to ensure that meat for human consumption is up to the highest standard and at the same time allow the proprietors of these premises an adequate amount of time to bring their premises up to standard without bankrupting them.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for giving me time to have this debate and, indeed, I would like to thank the Minister for coming in to hear it.  There was, as we know, widespread public disbelief when the announcement was made of the abolition of the Health Education Bureau by the Minister in September last.  No one really could decide what the motivation was or what the reason was behind this Government decision.  Why had they decided to axe this very relevant and very effective bureau?  The question was asked: was it a saving to the Exchequer?  Well no, not really, now that it is being funded and as it was funded to the tune of £2 million by the national lottery.  This presumably would have been how it would continue to be funded.  The question was asked: had they completed their role in that the type of campaign they mounted was no longer valid or necessary?  Certainly this could not be the case.  They had only really started their work and got the public familiar with and accustomed to their campaigns.</P>

    <P>Given the potential disaster in the spread of AIDS, given the high place Ireland occupies in the league table for cardiovascular disease, given the likelihood that smoking will rise again &mdash; and it is rising among some sectors notably women and younger people &mdash; this could neutralise the anti-smoking campaign of past years which was very effective, which had great impact and which cost a lot of money.  Above all, what is to happen to the health education needs &mdash; and I have a special interest in this &mdash; of women and children, given the horrific neglect of this Government to even maintain, for instance, the cervical and breast cancer screening facilities, much less to expand them as is happening in neighbouring European countries.  It is ironic and sad to realise that this is taking place on a date which coincides with the women in health week which was held between <Col N="566" /> 11 and 19 October last year.  It was organised by a separate committee in the office of women's affairs and was regarded as highly successful and extremely practical in terms of community education and encouraging self help.  It involved five major conferences in Dublin and meetings, seminars and conferences in every health board area.  It proved to be a seminal project so that when the week was over the issue of health education for those groups was not over.  Small groups and associations sprung up around the country to expand their knowledge and information on illness prevention.</P>
    <P>That health week was very much a collective venture with the active support of a number of voluntary groups of doctors, social workers, health boards and politicians.  A splended role was played by the Health Education Bureau. For instance, they staffed an information kiosk in the ILAC centre, Dublin, which was visited in that one week by 15,000 people seeking information leaflets.  This was the story all over the country.  That health week stimulated interest.  Women flocked to the events in their areas. Above all, they were seeking information. We had a very fine array of information literature but they were looking for more.  They were looking for dialogue, discussion and answers to many questions.</P>
    <P>The initiative for this week came from my office.  Everyone involved wanted it to be an annual event.  People from the HEB assured me that they could and would take it over and use the same module as we used last year.  Presumably it would have been as successful this year as it was in other years.  However, it has not happened.  I am very sorry about that.</P>
    <P>The move in the Department was a stupid and shortsighted one.  Health education and preventative medicine ought to be the cornerstone of any effective health policy.  No reasonable person could accept the reasons given by the Minister in his press statement as an improvement on what we have.  The <i>Irish Medical Times</i> in their editorial of 25 September says:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="567" /> Ostensibly, it might appear to signal the Minister's desire to see health education exercise much more clout within the actual health service and health professions.  We suspect, however, that more sinister reasons are operating and, in particular, the remorseless intention to make savings and equally remorseless intention to get absolute control of every aspect of health care in the country.</P>
    <P>There is the need for an informed public regarding the risks of cervical, breast and testicular cancers, the need for public discussion about sensible drinking and public action against excessive drinking and driving.</P>
    <P>There is, in short, a need to awaken the public to the fact that since the diagnosis and treatment of disease is an expensive business which threatens to overwhelm countries very much richer than our own, it makes sense to do as much as we can to improve our own health through attention to what we eat and drink, to the exercise we take, the behaviours we approve, and the risks we take.</P>
    <P>All of this was the work of the Health Education Bureau.  There are many reasons that the Minister's statement is poor and has to be challenged.  We have seen very successful campaigns run by the Health Education Bureau.  These have consisted of a campaign for the immunisation of children which was very badly needed as was shown by the response to it, with mothers bringing their children for immunisation against rubella and whooping cough.  Their anti-smoking campaign must have been one of the best that has ever been put together and was effective.  Their drugs and alcohol campaign and the publication of their book, <i>The ABC of Pregnancy</i> were both incredibly successful.  They were written in plain, clear, simple English and given away free to all parents through maternity hospitals and clinics.  They were reaching the target groups who most needed them.  That was the good thing about the HEB publications.  Parents <Col N="568" /> who cannot afford to go into bookshops and buy books by, say, Dr. Spock, Dr. Jolly or whoever is the guru of child rearing at present, still need to have their anxieties resolved and points clarified and to get direction about child rearing or pregnancy.  The HEB developed the life skills programme for schools with great caution and consultation.</P>
    <P>What have we been promised instead of the Health Education Bureau?  We have been promised three new bodies: a health promotion unit in the Department of Health, an advisory council on health promotion representative of the interests involved in the health status of the community and a committee under the chairmanship of the Minister for Health which will include the Ministers for the Environment, Agriculture and Food, Education, Labour and Energy who will coordinate the health promotion policy. The main point of all these new bodies is that they are all under the jurisdiction of the Department of Health.  This is the nub of the matter.  It is a case of the over protection by a cautious parent chastising an offspring and confining it to the backyard where the parent can watch, monitor and control its activities.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the main reason the Health Education Bureau have suffered the fate they have is to control them.  The agency have been in the past embroiled in controversy over their excellent life skills programme and were subjected to a systematic campaign waged by organisations such as Family Solidarity earlier this year.  Several members of the Church hierarchy, included Bishops Comiskey and Newman, criticised the agency's approach in the area of sexual morality. I know that there have been grave reservations in the Department about what sexual or moral areas might be involved under the aegis of health education.</P>
    <P>During my four years as Minister in charge of women's affairs I tried to push out the boundaries of health education and help in promoting awareness of special relevance to women because I felt there was a great lack there.  Given that the majority of doctors are male and that <Col N="569" /> many women are isolated in areas where they cannot get to special clinics for, say, advice on the menopause or on family planning I felt that a lot more needed to be done to meet the needs of women.  I had great difficulty with the Department of Health.  I fooled myself by trying to believe that it was just bureaucracy and not something specific or sinister. However, it was very clear after a while that the people in the Department with whom I had to deal were terrified and cautious when it came to dealing with questions of women's health.  There seemed to be the attitude that if it was a question of below the waist it might involve some moral issue.  That was very regrettable because it hindered and inhibited much worthwhile work and things that could have been done.  When I went initially to the Department about the women's health week I got at least 100 reasons why it should not be held, could not be held and was not needed.</P>
    <P>The Health Education Bureau were beginning to have a mature and responsible approach to women's health in the last year or two but the whole issue now goes back to zero with little hope that under the jurisdication of the Department of Health real contentious issues of concern and need to women will be dealt with.  In this context I want to point out &mdash; perhaps it has changed since I was dealing with them &mdash; that there are no women in senior positions in the Department though perhaps there is one at decison making level.  One sees the effects of this.  There is a need to have women at all levels so that they can bring their influence and experience to bear on any area of their work and campaigns.  This is particularly important in Government Departments.</P>
    <P>I despair for the health education and information needs of women under the new arrangement.  I further suspect that we will see the systematic dismantling of the life skills programme.  I regret to say that the Government and unfortunately the Fianna Fáil Party have very often capitulated to groups who make enough clamour in the name of morality.  There <Col N="570" /> was no need either on economic or financial grounds to bring in this change and there is a very definite risk that whatever body are responsible for health education they will be impotent because they will not have the independence that the Health Education Bureau had.</P>

      <P>I am glad that Senator Fennell attaches considerable importance to health education. I share her view that, it must be an important element in a modern health service, particularly if we are to unburden ourselves of the huge demands arising from sickness now being reflected in the cost of medical services.  Far from diminishing the role of health education my recent decision to integrate the functions of the Health Education Bureau in the Department of Health will help to advance it.  I see health education as an element in a broader policy of health promotion.  The concept of health promotion requires that not only should we concentrate on the health education of individuals but we should also ensure that we develop the necessary social, economic and environmental policies which will make it easier for the individual to acquire a higher standard of health in the broadest sense.  Bringing about these changes will require the commitment and participation of many sectors in our society.  It also requires that the Minister of Health and his Department should take the lead role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to embark on this broad policy of health promotion I have, with the Government's agreement, decided to establish a health promotion unit within my Department and from the end of the year the functions of the Health Education Bureau will be merged in it.  Most of the present staff of the bureau have been offered appointments in the unit.  I shall also be appointing shortly an advisory council on health promotion which will include representatives from the major social and economic areas which influence the quality of our health.  The appointment of this council is based on a recommendation which was made earlier this year by the Health Education Bureau <Col N="571" /> in their report entitled <i>Promoting Health Through Public Policy.</i>  The new unit within the Department will have responsibility for developing health education campaigns.  They will also provide the secretariat for the council and will have the immediate responsibility for taking action on the council's recommendation. The implementation of the council's views will have the further support of a special Cabinet sub-committee which I, as Minister for Health, will chair. That committee's role will be to secure the necessary support and co-ordination of the sectors concerned.</P>
    <P>Senator Fennell referred to smear testing. I share her concern about this but I have been concerned for a number of years about the stop-go approach to that campaign.  A few years ago, when we were not in office, Saint Luke's Hospital were not able to deal with the number of tests that were being sent to them and it was necessary to have the testing carried on outside the country.  It is nothing new that there are problems in this regard. This is something on which I share her concern and hopefully we will be able to do something about it.</P>
    <P>Regarding the programmes for 1987 &mdash; and Senator Fennell referred to programmes that were in place this time last year and have not been in place this year &mdash; I would like to point out that the Health Education Bureau will continue in their existing role until the end of this year.  Why programmes that were in place in 1986 but are not in place in 1987 has nothing to do with the arrangements we are making from the beginning of 1988. I do not agree with Senator Fennell's <Col N="572" /> contention that the new arrangements will reduce the independence of our present health education service.  Senator Fennell said it was her belief that we wanted to control all the health services in the Department.  At the same time her colleague in the Dáil the spokesman on Health, Deputy Allen, is calling on us to abolish the health boards and to bring more control into the Department.  This is something which I have been resisting.</P>
    <P>Senator Fennell is also concerned that there are no women involved in decision-making in my Department.  I accept responsibility for policy in my Department and I am satisfied that with people like the Cathaoirleach, Senator Tras Honan, in the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party the interests of women and all other sections will be represented in any policies that we may formulate, in any legislation and in the delivery of the health services generally.</P>
    <P>Independence means little if one does not succeed in getting goodwill and support for what one is doing.  By broadening the scope of our present service I consider that I am giving far more power and authority to it.  If we can get the willing co-operation of the many sectors involved I have no doubt that the introduction of the health promotion unit and the merging of the Health Education Bureau in that unit will advance to a notable degree the course of good health in this country.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 21 October 1987.</P>
