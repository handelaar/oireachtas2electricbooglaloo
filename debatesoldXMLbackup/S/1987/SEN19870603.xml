      <P>I have notice from Senator John A.  Murphy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The presentation by the Government, through publicly-funded advertisements, of a party political view of the issues involved in the Referendum on the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Dan Kiely of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Tourism and Transport, in these years of economic difficulties, to ensure maximum potential and earnings in the lucrative and job creating tourism industry.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Maurice Manning of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The current position in the Irish lighthouse service, where a considerable number of lighthouses are being converted from a manned to automatic status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senator <Col N="564" /> Murphy and Senator Dan Kiely as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator Murphy's motion for today's Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m.  Senator Dan Kiely may give notice for another day of the matter he wishes to raise.  I regret I have to rule that the matter raised by Senator Manning is not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the ground of lack of ministerial responsibility. I have written to Senator Maurice Manning that it is the responsibility of the Commission of Irish Lights.  Therefore, we will take Senator John A. Murphy's motion tonight on the Adjournment of the House from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m., if that is the time we adjourn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended to take Items Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 today.  It is intended to take the Second Stage of Agriculture (An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta) Bill, 1986.  If it is not finished by 5.30 p.m. we will take Item No. 4.  If Item No. 1 is finished before 5.30 p.m. we will deal with Items Nos. 2 and 3.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise a matter on the Order of Business.  As I am a new Senator I am not fully accustomed to the procedure here and I should like to ask the Leader of the House when Item No. 22 on the Order Paper will be taken.  This is the Fourth Report of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights &mdash; Sexual Violence.  I ask this in the context of the need to examine very closely this whole question.  That report dealt with the treatment of complaints in rape cases. We have an obligation in this House to look into these events given the case in the Circuit Criminal Court last week to examine this matter seriously.  I propose that this item be brought forward for discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise two points on the Order of Business.  The first <Col N="565" /> is Item No. 4 which deals with a subject on which very many Members of the House would like the opportunity to contribute especially in view of some of the extraordinary, unfair and unsubstantiated things which have been said by some Members of the House in public over the past few days.  It is a subject upon which many Members have some very positive ideas.  I should like to ask the Leader of the House if extra time could be made available for this motion; if, perhaps, some time could be made available tomorrow or extra time next week.</P>
      <P>Secondly, on the Order of Business, I raised two weeks ago what the Leader of the House described as a rumour, that is, the establishment of parliamentary committees which is of concern to all Members of this House.  Since then the Chief Whip in the Dáil has confirmed that it is the intention of the Government to curtail seriously the number of committees to be established.  In all parts of this House that would be regarded as a retrograde step.  I would like the view of all parties in this House to go from the Leader of the House to the Government that we should regard the committee system as it finished up in the last Oireachtas as our starting point and that we want to see a vigorous committee system established quickly.  We do not want the summer recess to come upon us and the committees not even established. This is a matter of great urgency which I should like the Leader of the House to convey to the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>In support of Senator Manning with regard to item No. 4, I expressed some concern the first day we met about the attacks on this House and I was amazed to learn of the cannibalism that is now taking place &mdash; we are starting to attack ourselves.  To see this item on the Order Paper in the names of two Members is reasonably fair, but to hear a public attack by one of those Members this morning is totally unfair.  I support the call for extra time in this House to discuss the matter fully because the <Col N="566" /> advantage that has been given in placing one side's view on the record is grossly unfair to the Members who believe in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise two points on the Order of Business.  For the record, could the Cathaoirleach give some information to Members of the House on the matter raised last week about finding a new Chamber for this House as an interim measure.  I understand many people feel they are being misled by what they read in the press and there are public rumours going around.</P>
      <P>The second item I wish to raise is of no less importance to some of us, but probably is of lesser importance to most people.  I raised it before.  It is the question of accommodation for Independent Senators.  The Cathaoirleach gave an indication to me a fortnight ago, as did the Leader of the House, of full support in getting proper accommodation.  This was much appreciated by the Independent Senators.  However, we have now run into a difficulty as the rooms which we were hoping to use as offices cannot be made available to us without the consent of the Dáil or the Ceann Comhairle.  This accommodation was previously used as offices for Senators and was taken from Senators to be used by a joint committee without any consultation whatsoever with either the Whips, the Leader of this House or the Cathaoirleach.  I believe we are getting a very poor response on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is making a speech.  I take the two points he has made for the third week.  With regard to the first one: when I know where the next Chamber of this distinguished House is to be I will come in here and make a statement without the advice of any Senator.  I do not know at present.  With regard to publicity, after 35 years in public life I do not always believe what I read in the papers.  When the next move is to be made I will <Col N="567" /> announce it to my colleagues, who should be the first to be told anyway.</P>
      <P>With regard to accommodation for Senator Joe O'Toole and other Senators, that is not my responsibility as Cathaoirleach. I understand the Whips are doing their best to accommodate every Member of the House.  Before I call on the Leader of the House, I appeal, as somebody who has served this House for 11 years, for support from inside this House for the Seanad.  If we do not support the House to which we have been democratically elected, I do not know where we are going.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking my cue from what the Cathaoirleach said, I hope the media have had sufficient notice of this motion which is generating great interest. It is important that Senators should maintain respect for the House.  We may continue to discuss the issues that affect this House until kingdom come unless the media are prepared to disseminate that information to the general public.  Without in any way implying criticism of the media I hope having had notice of this motion, that the media, in relation to the debate which is about to take place on this motion, which is so important to the future of the House and to the conduct of and respect for the House, will be conscious of their onerous responsibility to ensure that the people are made fully aware of the debate as it continues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I did not misunderstand the Cathaoirleach's statement that when another premises becomes available to this House she will make a statement to the House.  I hope when that happens Senators will have an opportunity to decide whether that accommodation is suitable.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I meant that it is normally done through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I do not decide on matters in the House or outside it without discussing them with my friends.  I consider everybody in this Chamber my friends.  I will try to do <Col N="568" /> everything right as Cathaoirleach.  With regard to where the next Chamber will be, we seem to be in a whirlpool at the moment and I do not know whether eventually they will get us out the gate for good.  I did not mean that I would come in and pontificate and say: &ldquo;This is where you are going now, Senator Doyle&rdquo;.  I am sorry if I gave that impression.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Fennell mentioned Item No. 22.  That is one of a long list of reports which are down in my name, some of which are now out of date and no longer relevant.  In the next week or two we should eliminate the ones that are irrelevant.  We can put together others so that we can have a reasonable debate on what is relevant.  As far as Item No. 22 is concerned, there is much public concern about it and we should debate this matter at the earliest possible moment.  I will get in touch with the Minister for Justice about this matter and I can guarantee that we will make progress as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>On Item No. 4 there is no doubt that quite a degree of public concern has been expressed about the operation of this House.  Indeed, some of the concerns that have been expressed are ones that all of us who have the interests of the House at heart would wish to discuss.  However, as has been said, quite an amount of rhetoric has been used by various people who do not have the interests of this House at heart.  Whether on radio or in the press, there is no doubt that there has been quite an amount of ill-informed comment about the powers, functions of the House and debates on various items.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make certain that nobody will feel he or she is not getting an opportunity to discuss the matter which is embodied in this motion.  The normal length of time for a debate of this nature is three hours. We will extend the time available.  We will take an hour and a half this evening and we can allow time tomorrow.  We can discuss in the morning the amount of time <Col N="569" /> we will take up with this matter tomorrow and we can take it again next Wednesday. I do not think we should extend the amount of time each contributor is allowed but we should allow any Senators who want to contribute to get in on the debate.</P>
    <P>I take the points raised by Senator Mooney and Senator Loughrey.  Senator Kennedy in association with Senator Loughrey was going to make the point that some of the elements in the media have been very critical of this House.  I hope they will take cognisance of the debate when it takes place here.  Could I appeal to one of the organs of the media I have been critical of in the past.  <i>The Irish Press</i> group, who commented on quite a number of occasions on the activities in the Seanad but do not see fit to send representatives to the Seanad, that if they want to comment on the activities of the Seanad they should send somebody to the Chamber to listen at least to the debate and, having listened to the debate, if they want to comment nobody will have anything but good reactions to that.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the remarks of Senator Joe O'Toole concerning the Chamber and equally the remarks of the Cathaoirleach. The Committee on Procedure and Privileges will be meeting again today. We will be discussing the questions raised about accommodation for the House and Independent Senators.  Senators are still coming up against problems particularly in terms of accommodation and telephones. We will deal with those as soon as we can.</P>

      <Col N="570" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to enable ACOT to charge for agricultural advisory services. The position is that the current annual costs of providing and maintaining the agricultural training and advisory services are of the order of £28 million, of which £23 million is funded by the Exchequer and local authority contributions.  At present ACOT provide agricultural advice to approximately 70,000 farmers, 29,000 of whom receive an intensive service. This service which includes up to 170,000 farm visits annually is provided by professional staff and is necessarily an expensive one, costing in the region of £7 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a copy of the Minister's speech available?  I am sorry for interrupting him.  It is the normal procedure that we should have one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister like to sit down for a moment?  I do not usually tell Ministers to sit down.  Normally Members have copies of the Minister's speech as he speaks.  That is what they are asking for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is reasonable, therefore, that those who receive substantial benefit from the service should make an appropriate contribution towards this cost.  The existing legislation does not empower ACOT to charge fees for advisory services and consequently this Bill has been introduced to make the necessary amendments to the relevant Acts.  The intention in the Bill is to enable ACOT to require reasonable contributions from those receiving these services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While this legislation will enable ACOT to charge for advisory services, it also provides that any such charges and the criteria on which they are based will <Col N="571" /> be subject to the prior approval of the Minister.  I would add that should the Minister consider, in the light of changing circumstances, that any fees or charges should be varied or, indeed, terminated, the legislation will enable him to direct ACOT to vary or terminate them.</P>
    <P>While there may be a body of opinion that the introduction of charges will act as a disincentive to some farmers to seek advice from ACOT, I believe there is now a much greater awareness in the farming community of the need and value of skilled, technical and management advice.  Proper professional advice in the planning and development of farms can make a crucial contribution to maximising potential benefits.  Such advice, therefore, should be viewed as an important input.  It hardly needs to be emphasised that all inputs should be cost effective and I am confident that the technical and management advice of the farm advisory services will continue to be so, thereby giving good value and enhanced returns to the user.</P>
    <P>During the course of the Dáil debates on this Bill a good deal of concern was expressed about farmers who might not be in a position to pay for these services and might, therefore, be excluded from them.  I appreciate that concern.  The position is that the charges made will be reasonable and applied in an effective and constructive manner.  There will be full consultation between the Department and ACOT prior to the introduction of any charges on the level of these charges and the criteria to be used in their formulation.  As the Minister's approval is ultimately necessary for the making of charges, the Bill provides adequate safeguards that the overall interests of the agricultural sector will be fully taken into account when the fees which ACOT may charge are being determined.</P>
    <P>As my ministerial colleague has already stated in the Dáil, we would be opposed to laying down any advance prescriptions which would pre-empt ACOT's freedom to devise proposals which they consider appropriate.  Nevertheless I can give an assurance that, when <Col N="572" /> proposals are being considered, due account will be taken of the position of farmers on low incomes or in financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied, therefore, that there are adequate safeguards in the Bill to ensure that the charging of fees for advisory services will not inhibit ACOT's key role in the promotion of the efficiency of Irish farming and assisting its development to full potential.  I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this is my first occasion to speak as Opposition spokesperson on Agriculture in this House, may I take the opportunity to congratulate the Minister on his appointment and to wish him very well?  When he was in Opposition and we were supporting the Government in the lifetime of the last Dáil, I got to know Deputy Kirk very well and I have no doubt that he will bring his undoubted talents to bear on the onerous task he has been given.</P>
      <P>The first thing I have to say about this Bill is that I remain worried about the lack of assurance about who will pay for these services and what category of farmer will have to pay for these services. The Minister of State may have gone a little farther here today than his colleague, the Minister, in the Dáil.  Nevertheless there remains a very large grey area and the statement made remains very vague.</P>
      <P>We all know this Bill was originally introduced by the former Government on 10 April 1986 in the Dáil.  The then Minister of State moving the Second Stage in the Dáil said at column 479, volume 365 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>Farmers who can afford to pay for an advisory service which is tailored to their individual needs will be required to make an appropriate payment for the service.</P>
      <P>I find nothing in what the Minister of State said today or in what the Minister Deputy O'Kennedy said in the Dáil six weeks ago which is as unequivocal as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="573" /> My party agree with the need to charge the small minority of commercial farmers for the services of ACOT.  Only a small minority fall into that category.  Farmers who can pay, should pay, particularly those lucky enough to be highly developed and commercially profitable enough to do so.  These farmers very often get from ACOT a very highly specialised advice.  That demands a lot of the time or the advisers in terms of research and imparting advice and knowledge. It is only right and proper that farmers who fall into that category, because of their profitability and because of the kind of information they demand and get from ACOT, should be asked to pay in part or in whole for these services, depending on how commercial they are. Away from that magic relatively small circle of farmers there is the vast corpus of Irish farmers who do not fall into that category.</P>
    <P>Looking at the other side and we see a section that has an accumulated borrowing of £1.7 billion.  Many who not so long ago were prosperous farmers with well developed enterprises and good land are now bankrupt because of falling commodity prices and very high interest rates.  The high interest rates are the result of madness imported into public policy in the late seventies and in the eighties.  There are also the disadvantaged area farmers, particularly in the 12 western counties where 70 per cent of the farms are not viable and where only 30 per cent are viable.</P>
    <P>I have to ask on behalf of my party: will the advisory service concentrate more on servicing those farmers who are paying simply because that will be generating revenue and income for ACOT?  Will this be at the expense of the other developing farmers whose survival is linked to good advice from ACOT and who at the same time cannot afford to pay for it?  Related to this also is the fact that there is a relatively high number of advisers in the disadvantaged areas.  Will they be moved to the more highly developed areas where they will be placed to advise farmers who will pay for the service?</P>
    <P>We have often heard the criticism that, <Col N="574" /> if you take 200 farmers living east of the River Shannon, it will be found that a very high percentage of them are commercial farmers, or have the potential to be commercial, or have better land.  The point is made that a far greater percentage of them are in touch with and taking advice from their ACOT adviser. On the other side of the coin, on the western side of the Shannon, if you took any 200 farmers as an example, a very low percentage of them would be deemed to be viable, a very low percentage of them would be deemed to have the potential to be viable and, of course, a low percentage of them would be in touch with their ACOT adviser.</P>
    <P>There is the temptation to use these crude comparisons to justify the withdrawal of services in disadvantaged areas and to move them into the more relatively advantaged areas, if I may call them that.  The real advantage the Minister and his Department might see in it would be the financial returns that would accrue by concentrating the service where there is major potential for selling the service to commercial farmers.  I would like the Minister to amend this Bill to read &mdash; or to include in the wording of this Bill &mdash; that all farmers living in the disadvantaged areas would be excluded from the terms of these proposed charges. I ask for that to be done because of the special remedial attention these areas need to get if they are to be brought to any semblance of economic viability. That goes for the 70 per cent majority we were talking about earlier of marginalised farmers who live in these areas.  It is quite unfair to have to say to them: &ldquo;We are trying to pull you up by your boot straps by giving you advice by which you might improve your enterprise and now we are saying to you that you will have to pay for that advice.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Before we finish the Bill in this House, I want an assurance from the Minister that there will be no reduction in the size of the advisory service in the disadvantaged areas.  Bear in mind that the only major farm grant development service operates now in these areas &mdash; I <Col N="575" /> am talking about the so-called western package.  In recent years there has been a huge drive for silage slabs and winter housing of livestock in the 12 western counties, some of it, I admit, prompted by the bad weather of the two appalling summers we had.  The ACOT advisory service took full advantage of the lessons learned and the changed attitudes brought about by the appalling summers and they led a large move towards silage rather than hay, which is absolutely appropriate in these areas, and to better housing systems.  The advisers have been deeply involved in this very beneficial move and they have devoted an enormous amount of their time to helping farmers to decide on new systems and in the preparation of the necessary plans, the paper work and bureaucracy that go along with all of these things.  This drive is only getting into top gear now and to remove it or to reduce it, or to reduce the number of people who are responsible for its working and providing the dynamic by which it operates &mdash; I am talking about the advisers &mdash; or to stymie their efforts with the threat of charges would be irresponsible and it would be almost bordering on the criminal.</P>
    <P>I have another major area of worry, that is, the effect these measures could have on the farm education service operated by ACOT.  Again, we can have the temptation to move more of the advisory service towards the paying area and this could have disastrous effects on the farm educational programme.  The whole farm education programme is conducted largely by the ACOT advisory service.  Nowadays there are, if I have correct figures from ACOT, approximately between 5,000 and 6,000 young farmers in various ACOT centres and in agricultural colleges throughout the country.  In fact, this is the only effective training and education we have for our young farmers outside the third level institutions and universities, etc., but only a minority will find their way into those institutions.  We have to admit that this is a totally inadequate education service in a country where agriculture is still the greatest <Col N="576" /> single factor in the economy, where 17 per cent of the workforce are still directly on the land and where 30 per cent of all employment in the economy is agriculture related.</P>
    <P>If this measure in any way interferes with the share of ACOT resources that goes into young farmer education and training in terms of manpower, in terms of administration, in terms of duration of classes, etc., we will oppose it vigorously. I want the Minister to inform this House unequivocally, one way or the other, about the intentions in this area in order that we will know what we must do, as a famous member of the American Senate said in the last century.  It is bad enough that the Government have removed the establishment aid scheme for young farmers; it is indeed bad enough that the Government have abolished the stamp duty waiver scheme for trained, competent young farmers taking over the family holding; but it would be bad in the extreme, indeed the breaking point, if this legislation were used in a roundabout way to cut back on farm education, to save money by doing that and by making money by devoting the released resources to the fare paying area, that is, the farmers who are supposed to be able to pay.</P>
    <P>My party are not opposed to this measure in principle.  We said in Government and we said out of Government that there is no such thing as a free Government service; somebody has to pay for it.  We believed in Government and we believe now out of Government that people or institutions who get a Government service &mdash; and if that service is used to generate a profit and allowing that the people or the institutions getting the advice of the service can afford to pay for it &mdash; should be asked to pay for it.  We fully accept that principle.  My abiding worry is this &mdash; and I am not being political because it is a fact &mdash; that the once profligate and poacher Fianna Fáil Party, profligate and poacher both in Government and in Opposition, are now back in Government.  They have now turned to almost fanatical gamekeeping, and they are looking in every direction to cut back <Col N="577" /> and to make savings.  The Taoiseach said in his famous leaked letter to his Ministers that no area is sacrosanct from a cutback.  The real danger is that hidden in this Bill is more of that diktat to use the service to generate additional revenue from those who can pay; and those who, according to the Minister are supposed to be able to pay, maybe multitudes more, in terms of their income and in terms of their level of development, than we ever dreamt were there or that any of the farming organisations ever dreamt were there.</P>
    <P>These are our real fears.  I do not think the Minister has done anything to allay our fears by what he had to say to us today.  We counsel the greatest caution in choosing people who will have to pay for this service.  The point was made in the other House that in one country where a service charge of this kind was introduced &mdash; and I think the example given was Finland &mdash; 22 per cent of the people who were participating in the service prior to the introduction of the service charge no longer applied for it or looked for it.  With the agricultural economy in this country in such a fragile state, and with the meaningful side of the agricultural advisory service being geared towards young, resourceful farmers with a dynamism about building up this most important industry, it would be utterly disastrous if the greatest care and the greatest sensitivity were not adopted in the application of these charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, like Senator Connor, I would like to congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment and hope he will have many happy and rewarding years in his office.  It is not a very pleasant duty for any Minister or Minister of State to have to come to either House of the Oireachtas asking for an increase in levies or charges.  But, unfortunately, in the time we are living in everybody accepts, as Senator Connor said, that those services must be paid for. There is no such thing any longer as a free service; somebody has to pay for it, whether it is the individual farmer or the general body of taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="578" /> Agriculture, as we all know, is our main industry.  All of us who have an interest in agriculture want to see this industry develop and expand because we know that, if we have a thriving agricultural sector, then all other areas of the economy follow suit.  That is why it is important that every facet of agriculture would be allowed to develop to its full potential.  I submit that is not happening at present.  There is room for improvement in every area of agriculture.  There are markets which we can explore and develop.  I submit that we have not developed these markets to their full potential.  I know we have strong opposition from other European countries, from people who are competing with us in the marketplace.  I believe that the climate is right here, that we have a lot going for us.  We have many advantages other European countries do not have. We should make full use of those advantages, try to capitalise on them and achieve further expansion in the marketplace.  I am satisfied we can do that.  I hope the Government, the Department of Agriculture and all the other agencies involved in promoting Irish agriculture will be at all times vigilant and will secure every opportunity to advance Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>There is always an outcry when fees or charges such as those which this Bill imposes are levied.  Nobody likes those charges; but, unfortunately, I suppose it has to be.  ACOT at present are being asked to collect £1 million in charges for services in 1987, but we have only six months of 1987 left.  I can see this creating a problem.  Charging for services will mean that the better-off farmers will get advice and those not able to pay will not get the same level of service.  ACOT must propose to the Government the method by which they will collect these charges, and from whom.  It is then up to the Government to decide what method they will accept.  Up to now collection was by commodity deduction, that is.  An Foras Taluntais research levy or BTE scheme levies.  I wonder if the same system could not apply for ACOT.  Could not some of the headage grants paid on ewes or <Col N="579" /> suckler cows be retained by the Department and paid over to ACOT, rather than imposing individual charges for services rendered?</P>
    <P>If I could give an example &mdash; and here I will have to localise it to my own county because they are the figures I have &mdash; a £1 million collection for ACOT nationally would mean approximately £70,000 for County Galway.  If deductions were made from headage grants, County Galway has approximately 40,000 suckler cows and at 50p per head that would take in £20,000.  We have 350,000 ewes and at a deduction of lOp per head that would bring in £35,000.  Twenty million gallons of milk are sold to the creameries and a deduction of 0.1 per cent of a penny would bring in £20,000, making a total of £75,000.  There you have the full amount collected without any of the fuss of going out and charging farmers, with the better-off farmers availing of the service and the smaller and more backward farmers not availing of it simply because they cannot afford to pay for it.  They are the types of farmers I would like to see helped.  The prosperous farmer, the farmer who is anxious to get on, will always attend the conferences and always attend the lectures.  Unfortunately, the man you would like to help and would like to drag up by the bootlaces will sit at home by the fire and will not go out to the lectures; neither will he avail of the services offered if there is a charge.  That is my reading of the matter.</P>
    <P>The main advisory effort is to increase suckler cow numbers and increase the use of continental bulls.  All herd owners with five or more cows are being visited before 30 June 1987.  Where farmers are liable for income tax they can claim levy payments as expenses and similarly for VAT refunds.  I submit that small farmers and those not liable for either income tax or VAT refunds cannot claim.  Exemption from charges should apply to all who are not liable for income tax.  In the case of suckler cows, in order to maintain calf numbers it is necessary to increase cow numbers because of the decline in milk cows.  Here again ACOT must give <Col N="580" /> advice and encouragement to farmers to do this.  Because of the withdrawal of implants continental breeds are necessary to meet export requirements of cattle, and again this requires advice and encouragement.</P>
    <P>With regard to sheep, an expansion in ewe numbers can take place because of the market requirements in Europe, but lambs must be of a very particular quality and be produced and marketed at the correct time.  Of course, the technical information must be provided by ACOT advisers.</P>
    <P>With regard to the farm improvement scheme, at present the Department collect £20 for each farm visit made by ACOT and Department of Agriculture staff.  Of course, ACOT do not get the £20 stopped from grants by the Department; that is retained by the Department. If I can localise this to my own county, up to 24 May 1987 there were 2,000 applicants under the farm improvement scheme in County Galway.  At £20 each that contributed £40,000 to the Department of Agriculture.  The two years 1985 and 1986 placed a big strain on winter feed in wetland areas and on fragmented farms.  ACOT are pressing for an increase in new silage makers and they require advice.  They require advice because it has been proved, and over those two years in particular, that silage making is really the only thing which will guarantee that farmers will have a satisfactory supply of fodder for stock during the winter and they are being asked and encouraged to go away from the traditional system of saving hay.  Again, of course, that requires the advice and help of the agricultural adviser.  Due to late springs and poor yields of fodder in 1985 and 1986 considerable destocking, particularly in suckler cows and cattle, took place which, together with high purchases of feeds such as hay and meals, led to a considerable number of farmers getting into financial difficulties.  ACOT have just designed a farm business service to help these people manage their farms and home finances in these difficult times. These are the very people who cannot afford to pay for services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="581" /> There is a very disturbing increase in the number of farmers who are in financial difficulties, even in my own county. I submit that farmers in disadvantaged areas should not be charged for this service. Possibly the 12 western counties should be exempt from the fees now proposed in this Bill.  If, however, charges must be made across the board, it is quite clear that districts in the west and north west should not be asked to collect as much as districts in the rest of the country, because we all know that the farmers in the eastern part of the country have many more advantages than we have in the west.  They have better farms, they are not as fragmented and they are near centres of population, which in itself can be an advantage.</P>
    <P>As regards education &mdash; this is very important &mdash; the certificate in farming is taught by ACOT advisers.  We know that educated young farmers are essential for the future.  If Irish agriculture is to develop we need such people to promote agriculture and to develop it to its full potential.  Charging for services would mean charging young people for education. Indeed, in recent times widespread concern has been expressed about the funding of agricultural educational training.  In December last year the IFA rural development committee set up an agricultural forum to which representatives of the IFA, Macra na Feirme, ICOS, the farm relief service, ACOT, ICA, the Agricultural Science Association, the Farm Apprenticeship Board, the Association of Private Agricultural Colleges and the General Council of Committees of Agriculture were invited.</P>
    <P>The report issued by their forum highlights the very serious problem in the field of educational training.  We all accept that there is an absolute need for agricultural education and training, but the situation is deteriorating all the time.  The prospects for employment of people who have undertaken agricultural education are excellent.  It makes sound economic sense to provide adequate agricultural education.  It is necessary also to ensure equality of treatment of young people <Col N="582" /> seeking vocational educational training for any sector of the economy.  At present that equality of treatment simply is not there, because there is a big discrepancy between the financial support available to a young person going to a residential course at an agricultural college, on the one hand, and that available to a person attending a regional technical college or a course with AnCO or CERT or, indeed, on work experience with the National Manpower Services, on the other hand.</P>
    <P>A person attending an agricultural college is required to pay a fee of between £690 and £1,250 for the one year course, whereas a person attending a regional technical college or a training course with AnCO pays no fee and receives a weekly training allowance of up to £40.  The position of agricultural college students has deteriorated drastically since 1980.  If we look at some of the figures available we can see that in 1980-81 the number of scholarships, both agricultural and horticultural, was 748.  In 1986-87, it was 682. The average value of the scholarships in 1980-81 was £432.  In 1986-87, it was £488. The average value of scholarships at 1986 prices in 1980-81 was £798; in 1986-87, £488.  The average fee payable by scholarship holders in 1980-81 amounted to £193 and in 1986-87 to £762.  Since 1980-81 the number of scholarships has declined by 9 per cent.  The average scholarship value has declined by 39 per cent and the average fee payable by scholarship holders has increased by 130 per cent.  That is the comparison between the fees charged in an agricultural college, and the fees charged are not charged at the other centres that I have outlined.</P>
    <P>This situation in which young people seeking training in agriculture have to pay high fees is unjust to those who wish to work in the industry whether they are farmers' children or urban young people. A further inequality arises because of the failure to grant ACOT any derogation from the public service staff embargo to enable them to maintain staff-student ratios.  Staff-student ratios have been maintained only by redeploying staff from advisory work into education, <Col N="583" /> thereby eroding some of the advisory service to farmers.  It is estimated that an additional grant of £1.65 million to ACOT would provide equality of opportunity for trainees in agriculture.  Indeed, I would consider this investment in our young farmers money well spent.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator, I do not like to interrupt you, but you may be going a little bit outside the scope of the Bill, and if I allow it for one Senator it may happen throughout the whole afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly accept your ruling, but we are dealing here with services and charges and I was just relating the type of charges that apply in colleges and also in the other areas where young people seek opportunities in other industries. I do not think that discrepancy should apply but, however, I bow to your ruling on the matter.</P>
      <P>I have already stated that there are excellent opportunities available to young people who are interested in taking up agriculture as a career.  The Farm Apprenticeship Board could readily expand the number of training places available to meet the demand that exists in agriculture for skilled people, including the requirements of the farm release service.  A study carried out by An Foras Talúntais in 1985 indicated that over a three to five year period the equivalent of 1,000 full time jobs could be created in farm release services provided operators are properly trained and have the facilities for such training.  ACOT need more finance to meet the requirement to provide in agriculture a highly trained and effective workforce for a changing agricultural environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the tariffs being levied under this Bill will not create serious problems for farmers.  I have suggested a few ways in which the levy might be collected rather than imposing the charge on farmers who require the services of an agricultural adviser.  If that is the way the levy is to be collected the poorer farmers, the backward farmers and those who are <Col N="584" /> not as progressive as their counterparts, will not avail of the services of the adviser.  That would be unfortunate because we want to see agriculture developed.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the Bill does not allow us to go into other areas of farming.  If it did we could be talking for a long time about areas such as the eradication of bovine TB and animal diseases.  I hope that in the years ahead our main industry will develop and prosper.  The potential is there and it only needs leadership and commonsense in the marketplace to provide the market requirements.  We look to people like Deputy Kirk and the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, to guide us through the difficult years ahead.  They have the capabilities to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Murphy for allowing me to speak before him on this Bill.  I want to join with other speakers in welcoming back to the Seanad the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Kirk.  He was with us once before.  Unfortunately he always seems to bring bad news when he arrives here but, in this day and age, it is difficult to avoid that.</P>
      <P>I will be constructive in my remarks on the Bill.  Far be it from me to suggest that there should be anything free for any sector, in particular a sector which is always subjected to criticism from various uninformed sources who do not know the full implications of the difficulties involved in farming.  When the Bill was mooted by the previous Government I made a submission to the then Minister. I had meetings with the board of ACOT who represent the General Council of the County Committees of Agriculture.  They made a submission on the possibility of imposing charges and the implications for the farming sector and ACOT in charging for a service which heretofore had been free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister confirmed in his speech that agricultural training and the advisory service cost £28 million.  The cost of providing the advisory service at farm level <Col N="585" /> is £7 million so I take it that the balance of the cost is in the area of farming education at colleges which Senator Hussey was not allowed to debate.  When one draws a parallel between young people in other sectors and young people in agriculture, there is a disadvantage for young people who want to be further educated in the area of agriculture.  I suggest to the Minister that agricultural colleges should change their structure into one of training rather than educational.  Funds could be made available through the European Community if the emphasis was placed on training because education at that level for young farmers is generally considered to be in the area of retraining.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with the concept of charging farmers for a service which was originally free.  About ten or 12 years ago the General Council of the County Committees of Agriculture, who were responsible for the provision of the service before ACOT took over, researched their enterprises: what they were doing; what staff they had available to them; who appointed the staff; and how the staff could get to the people they were intended to get to.  The general council discovered that the number of people they wanted to get to was about 50 per cent in real terms.  They offered their services free.  They advocated their services at every co-op, creamery, and parish pump.  At meetings ACOT advisers sold themselves to farmers as being available to advise them on projects, plans, buildings and stock maintenance. In spite of that only about 50 per cent of the farmers availed of the free service.</P>
    <P>The Minister should exempt some categories of farmers from these charges to ensure that they will receive proper advice in determining their ability to continue in family farm enterprises.  Those of us who are interested in farming want to see it prosper to the benefit of the community.  The Minister is running a risk that if a charge is imposed on people they may sit at home and not go out to group meetings, farm walks or any other areas from which they can benefit.</P>
    <P>I have reservations about imposing the <Col N="586" /> charges on a headage basis, a product tax basis or otherwise, because he will be charging everyone in an area from which only some will benefit.  That is the disadvantage of the system suggested by Senator Hussey.  He represents a western county, most of which is disadvantaged. Therefore, I cannot blame him for making that suggestion.  It is one way of collecting fees from farmers in difficult areas.  If we are to live up to the constitutional right to be treated equally, I suggest that the charge should be determined on one's ability to pay.  At local authority level I defended charges for people who availed of a service which up to then had been free.  We realise that it has to be paid for by the PAYE worker who pays for most of the services for everybody, farmers and business people alike.  Most beneficiaries in this country benefit from tax paid by the PAYE sector.  The statistics available to the Minister for Finance confirm that the vast majority of the wealth of the country is created by workers who contribute to it out of their pay packet.  If we are advocating free services, we are advocating that taxation should be increased.</P>
    <P>I have no objection in principle to the concept that farmers who have the ability to pay should make a contribution towards the service which will be of benefit to them.  It is for the Minister, when he gets a proposal from ACOT, to say how it should be carried out.  It is a matter for the Minister and his Department to decide whether the charge is fair and collectable or whether it is unfair and uncollectable.  Now that some elite farmers have decided that their rateable valuation process is illegal &mdash; to their detriment in the final analysis &mdash; the Ministers can no longer use that norm when deciding who has the ability to pay the charge.</P>
    <P>Following the Government's decision to abolish land tax it will now be obligatory on everybody with any rateable valuation to keep accounts.  If the Minister makes a charge based on accounts, it may be an incentive for people to keep accounts.  I am all in favour of the concept of people keeping accounts for their own <Col N="587" /> benefit so that they can be aware of whether or not a project is uneconomical. For that reason the concept of accounts does not do anything for my philosphy but it creates problems for farmers who are not geared to keeping accounts and who generally have a horror of the tax man, the health board levy collector and all other collectors.  What worries me is that they will not have a horror of ACOT advisers.</P>
    <P>When the general council carried out their research they reached out to the people whom they hoped would avail of the service.  Those people were not prepared to be told or advised by anybody on why or when they should change a product or process of production in case they were found to have been incorrect in the past.  The Bill deals with one of the most conservative groups of economically developed people in the country &mdash; those in the farming sector.  They are extremely slow to change and they resent being advised, this is why ACOT had such difficulties in the past in trying to reach out to those people.</P>
    <P>ACOT have had tremendous dilemmas with regard to the allocations given to them by Governments.  The previous Government and this Government have done nothing to allay the fears of the ACOT board concerning their ability to provide a service in the area of agricultural advice and education.  This created some pressure on the Minister and his party in Government who a couple of months ago were against this concept and who are now faced with having to look to every area in order to collect money.</P>
    <P>I would hate this charge to be used as a way of penalising a section of the community who are accused by many people of not paying their way.  I would rather see people genuinely needing advice asking for advice and being prepared to make a contribution for it.  Those who are unable to pay for it should certainly be accommodated by any legitimate State advisory service.  I do not think people's inability to pay should be used as a deciding factor in having an agricultural adviser call to them or refusing to call to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="588" /> The Minister should be extremely careful about how this legislation is applied on the ground because for the first time he will be changing the role of the agricultural adviser who up to now had the confidence of his clients.  He could help them with their taxation problems and the problem of handing down their property to their successors.  This was done in the knowledge that the information was confidential between the adviser and the farmer and would not be disclosed to any third party such as the tax office, the Department of the Environment or anybody else.  If the Minister interferes with the relationship farmers and advisers have built up over the years, he will do a disservice to the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>Farmers need assistance and advice. About 29,000 of them have availed of that intensive service.  I wish many more had availed of it.  If they had, agriculture would now be the better of it.  With hindsight people can criticise decisions taken by agricultural advisers on the acquisition of land and the possibility for increasing production within the European Community. How could advisers have been privy to what might happen afterwards at Councils of Ministers, at the Commission, or at any other level in Europe, or to the changes that have taken place including the review of the Common Agricultural Policy?  How could any adviser have been privy to that kind of information during the seventies which is the time they were accused of giving very liberal advice to farmers.  If the advice that was given generally had been given to more people, we might have had a healthier agricultural economy than we have at present.</P>
    <P>The ACOT-AFT review was carried out at the request of a previous Government. I will not go into the personnel who served on this review; I have some reservations about them but that is outside the scope of the Bill.  In that review a question was raised about the possibility of charging for services.  ACOT who will be responsible for the implementation of the law on the ground said in the review:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="589" /> If ACOT is obliged to earn a significant proportion of its income by charging, this will result in a major change of direction which would adversely affect many farmers, especially in the prevailing situation in agriculture.  In accordance with the previous Government's policy <i>(Building on Reality)</i> ACOT's advisers are concentrating on the middle segment of farmers with the resources and motivation to develop.  As a high proportion of these could not or would not pay for services, ACOT would be forced to move away from this sector. This would prove detrimental to dry-stock farming in particular, the main engine of growth in the immediate years ahead.  Instead, ACOT would be forced to concentrate its resources in providing the more commercial/ developed farmers with a high quality service capable of commanding fees.  It is important that the Board would get clarification from Government as to whether the development of the middle segment of farmers or income generation should receive priority. These objectives are not mutually compatible.</P>
    <P>That is the problem as I see it.  That middle segment of farmers is the area the previous Government had pinpointed as being possible to motivate into improving their position.  If they are now to be subjected to charges, they may not be able to or may refuse to pay.  Then we will have a commercial advisory service requested and paid for by those who can afford it.  Once they have paid for it they will demand the service, possibly at the expense of all the other people we are concerned about who were pinpointed by the previous Government as being capable of motivation.</P>
    <P>We will have a fundamental problem with this if we apply it on the ground and the people charged under previous Acts with the responsibility of carrying it out said this in the review.  As legislators we have an obligation &mdash; as has the Minister and the Minister of State &mdash; to take on board the problems that will arise for <Col N="590" /> the agencies involved in the collection of these charges.  Members of the staff of ACOT throughout the country have made submissions to many of us who they were aware had an interest in this regard. They were of the opinion that these proposed charges would result in a fundamental change in the organisation and direction of the advisory services which were provided, and that this would be to the detriment of farmers and the whole community.  The Minister said there was a body of opinion that the charges would be a disincentive to some farmers.  The body of opinion I quoted from are the people involved in the service &mdash; the ACOT people and the agricultural advisers.</P>
    <P>The proposed commercial service will be in direct competition with consultancy services which are now available from private firms.  The Minister will remember that in the past many county committees were involved with people who assisted co-operatives to give specialised advisory services in particular categories and areas.  County committees helped to fund 50 per cent of the salaries of some of these specialised advisers.  This was done with the recognition by the county committee that there were certain areas which needed specialised advice.  So there was nothing wrong with the concept of a co-operative giving specialised advice. Groups of people set up afterwards as private consultants.  They were employed by farmers to give professional advice. They were prepared to pay private consultancy firms.  I suggest that if any farmer wishes to do that today, he can do so.  I have no doubt that advice given in the past by the staff of ACOT was given for the benefit of the farmer and not for the benefit of a co-op, a brand commodity or anything else.  It was given impartially for the benefit of farmers.  That is what I liked about the ACOT advisory service. They were beholden to nobody except the county committees, the board of ACOT and the Minister for Agriculture. They had the overall good of the farmer and country at heart and not specialised commodities, co-operatives or anything else.  That service is still available and is <Col N="591" /> still being paid for by elite groups of farmers who can afford it.  Good luck to them if they want to do that and can afford to pay for it.</P>
    <P>I am extremely concerned about the middle group of farmers who may be unable to pay for a service all of us know they need to survive in the changing face of Irish agriculture.  I do not have to remind the Minister of the difficulties in the present round of talks in the Community on the changing face of agriculture and the new challenges which will be put in front of our Minister, whoever he is.  That is the reality.  We know it and it will be extremely difficult in the future. It is difficult enough as it is now but it will become more difficult.  We are beginning to have fewer and fewer friends in Europe when we talk about agriculture. Agriculture is the mainstay of our economy and none of us should apologise for it.</P>
    <P>The concept of making charges means that ACOT will have to match the range, direction and level of expertise now provided by these private firms, many of whose efforts are directed towards tax avoidance by big farmers.  Our agricultural advisers never got into the area of advising farmers on how to avoid their rightful contributions to tax.  Because fee paying farmers are demanding &mdash; and are likely in the future to be allowed &mdash; to choose their own adviser or group of advisers, it seems inevitable that the best advisers will be forced into consultancy groups catering for big farmers.  The service could be at risk if the charge is made. In the future our best advisers who have given a lifetime of service to all of us, to the county committee system and the ACOT system, could see a better role for themselves in private firms.  We could lose some of the best brains in agriculture to these consultancy firms.  Small and medium farmers who have the biggest capacity for improvements in productivity will receive a much poorer service than is the case at present.  This will result in increased hardship for these people and in a diminished rate of expansion in national agricultural output.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="592" /> When similar charges were proposed in the UK, a firm of independent consultants concluded that if the agricultural advisory service were to charge for advice currently provided free, this would result in an inequitable system of information being provided to the detriment of the less well off farmer.  There could be a reduced financial return to the Irish economy as a whole arising from the introduction of charges, despite the fact that revenue obtained from fees in the area would go into the overall Exchequer.  We have to look at the consequences of that for the overall national economy and not just for the board of ACOT or the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that, primarily as a result of the advisory work of ACOT, the increased return to the Irish economy over the past decade or so in real terms was about 10 per cent or 12 per cent. Very little of that increase went directly to farmers.  Most of us agree that it was creamed off by all sorts of people before it arrived at the farm gate.  The benefits were seen only by those of us who were looking at the overall export figures, in increased activities in industries that provided services for agriculture and in reduced rates of increases in the price of foods.</P>
    <P>Directing the ACOT effort into a commercial service will result in failure to exploit the potential of the expanding agricultural sector to provide the impetus for growth in many sectors which may appear removed from what is happening on Irish farms today.  A highly concentrated ACOT effort directed at that will be non-fee paying farmers.  That is essential if agriculture is to continue to fuel the widespread growth available outside of agriculture.  The primary motivation behind the proposed changes is an anxiety to collect revenue from farmers in fees, arising from the reluctance of large farmers to pay tax.  I would hate the charge to be used for that reason.  If they are avoiding tax, there are other methods of ensuring that they pay their contribution. The small farmers who are always the first to pay any charges should not be penalised.  They are always the <Col N="593" /> first to pay while the bigger farmer try to avoid paying for as long as possible.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the people in ACOT to whom I had access argue that farmers would receive a poorer advisory service because of those proposals and in any case they are paying their fair share at present.  This assertion is well supported by various estimates of these farmers' current incomes and tax liabilities. I hope the Minister will realise that it is not as easy as it seems to impose this charge in a short Bill.  When the people on the ground, the staff and the board, see difficulties involved, the Minister should look again at the people he proposes to exempt.  I would hate any legislation we produce or are assoicated with producing in this House to be a disincentive to the kind of farmers we all want to aim our sights at: those who are capable of improving their position, keeping on family farms, and avoid having to dispose of property and move into areas of high unemployment thus creating housing problems and demands on local authorities who are not geared to meet them.  This would denude the countryside of family farms which have always been there, have been part of the country scene and have made a major contribution to the economic development of the area, the maintenance of country schools, churches, shops, pubs, villages and everything that goes with family farms in Ireland.</P>
    <P>That whole concept could change if we suddenly decided for economic reasons to charge farmers for advice we have been giving to them free in the past.  It is difficult to make people pay for something that is obligatory, for example, refuse collection or a water service which is delivered and which people cannot do without.  It is easy enough to bring in legislation to make people pay for it.  In the past I defended that being done in a reasonable way.  But at that time there was always provision for a waiver scheme which excluded some categories of people from paying charges which they were unable to pay.</P>
    <P>That will happen to small farmers. <Col N="594" /> People who want to get advice will be unable to pay for it and will be excluded from it unless the Minister uses his power to ensure that they are not penalised in the future.  I sincerely hope that the Minister's reference to this in his opening speech means that he will take into account people on low incomes, or in financial difficulties.  Now that the Government have decided that everybody will keep accounts, the Minister concentrates his efforts in the area of account keeping and decides on who should pay for services arising from accounts.  People who genuinely make an effort to keep accounts, who pay their tax, will be paying for services which they require and to which they will be entitled. I hope this will not be done at the expense of poorer people who need advice and who may be unable to afford it.  It is a change in our attitude to agricultural advice from the State to people engaged in agriculture into an area of a further tax collector at the farm gate.</P>
    <P>This form of tax collection was welcome in the past because it assisted farmers to improve themselves.  However, in the future it will be looked on as a disincentive. Our efforts to get advice to these people may be spurned because people will feel they are paying enough already. Farmers believe that the Minister has suddenly changed from a concept of free advice for the benefit of the community to one which will now be charged for and will be demanded by those who can afford to pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator McDonald on his appointment as Leas-Chathaoirleach and also Deputy Kirk on his appointment as Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a farmer I spoke on this Bill previously in the other House and I was critical of it.  I am not too happy with the Bill at present even though there has been a change of roles.  The Bill to introduce charges on farmers for the agricultural advisory service will have a major long term effect on farming.  Its effect will not be noticeable in the short term but in the long term it will have major repercussions <Col N="595" /> on the agricultural industry.  Like Senator Ferris I believe it will damage confidence between farmer and adviser.  That will be sad because a great bond of trust has been built up over the past 30 years between farmer and adviser.  The Minister should tread very warily in case we damage that great trust, friendship, co-operation and teamwork between the advisory service and the farmer.  I am referring to the average farmer, not the large farmer who can afford to pay for advice from other quarters.</P>
    <P>In line with other organisations in the semi-State sector ACOT will have to raise some of their finances from the clientele with whom they deal.  Farming today is at a crossroads, with production no longer attainable due to the imposition of the super-levy and the low returns from cattle and cereal enterprises.  The very bad weather conditions of the past two years put many farmers in serious difficulties.  Few farmers today are in a position to wave their hats at their local bank manager.  Because of the unemployment problem we need to be careful that we do not rock the boat too hard as far as farmers are concerned, because tourism and agriculture are two of our most important industries.</P>
    <P>Farmers are divided into several categories regarding their ability to pay for an advisory service.  Those in dairying with a high milk quota will be able to pay for a service but the vast majority of farmers will not be able to pay.  Farmers with low milk quotas, low acreage, farmers with cattle and cereal enterprises will not be in a position to pay for the service due to financial problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister will need to be careful about the legislation now being enacted because its results will take years to measure. We all know that any levies or fees introduced over the past 25 years under successive Governments have been increased.  I appreciate the difficulty in which the Government now find themselves. In recent months many speakers both in the Dáil and Seanad have accused the Government of U-turns.  There is an <Col N="596" /> old saying: &ldquo;Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard&rdquo; but when this Government took office there was hardly a cupboard. A U-turn in their policies was necessary in order to keep the State afloat.  Because of the national debt, unemployment and lack of confidence everywhere, the Government had to look to every quarter to try to balance the books and at the same time reduce the national debt and reduce borrowing.</P>
    <P>There is no great mystery about what Fianna Fáil are trying to do.  I am sure most people on the Opposition benches are aware that, no matter what cuts are made by the Government, they are necessary and they will create hardship across the board.  There were four years in which the previous Government could have put our affairs into a better shape but they failed miserably.  I am sure they will be patient with the Government in their efforts to help everybody across the board, whether self-employed, unemployed, over-taxed.  There are so many major problems confronting the Government that I am sure most people in the Opposition will not be too critical.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that the reason for the introduction of this Bill is to cut down on public expenditure.  This, in itself, is good but I am not happy that that justifies the present structures within ACOT which are top-heavy at administrative level. That is also a problem in many of our semi-State and State bodies.  Over 1,100 people are employed in ACOT.  Out of that 1,100 there are 450 advisers.  Can any cheeseparing be carried out in that area?  More money could then be spent on the ground rather than at administrative level.  The headquarters is in Dublin and there are five regional offices around the country to run their affairs. We have a tendency here when setting up an organisation to have layers of bureaucracy and in the end the tail is wagging the dog.  The Minister of State and his colleague Deputy O'Kennedy, the Minister, ought to look at this very seriously in the weeks and months ahead.</P>
    <P>On top of that we have a system whereby each county is divided into districts. The amount of duplication taking place <Col N="597" /> is very high.  The advisers who provide the service to the farmers, are involved in excessive paperwork.  I would prefer to see advisers in the field advising farmers there rather than filling forms and sending them off to head office.  This is the crazy merry-go-round this country has got into in the last 20 years.  We have many people telling others what to do but very few helping them to do it, which involves enormous expense to the taxpayer. The finger cannot be pointed at any political party because this system has grown up under successive Governments.</P>
    <P>As a small country it is something we will have to examine seriously.  Senator Ferris referred to the ordinary taxpayer and we all have sympathy for them because they are overtaxed, but we would like to see the money taken from a farmer in a fees for a service spent wisely.  These advisers are kept in their offices and are prevented from going out to the farmer because of a limited mileage allowance per month.  Therefore, the farmers must go to the advisers.</P>
    <P>Anyone who knows anything about farming is aware that one cannot conduct a proper advisory service in that way. One must be on the spot, whether it involves dairying, beet or grain.  It needs an on-the-spot discussion and inspection of the problems.  These advisers have provided an excellent service to farmers down through the years.  There is a great bond of trust between adviser and farmer.  I hope this Bill will not be the cause of a division or any bitterness between them.  The nation as a whole would suffer because the vast amount of exports which the fanning community creates and the jobs created off the farm, as well as on the factory floor in our meat industry, would be affected.  There are thousands of jobs at stake.</P>
    <P>The system that operated, prior to the formation of ACOT, where the service was under the county committees of agriculture, was a far better system.  The committees had the running of the system in their hands and they could take the pulse very easily.  The same happened in other areas over the last 15 or 20 years where <Col N="598" /> the remote control system was introduced. Some areas experienced trouble recently.  There is much to be said for a service provided in a county and monitored by the public representatives and the officials concerned in that county. There would be less wastage.  Under that system every farmer got a fair service whether he was big, small or medium. This change, following the formation of ACOT, has switched advisers away from dealing with the small to medium sized farmers and that is an unfortunate development.  We always had a few &ldquo;tulips&rdquo; in each county to point to as being top league farmers in the country if not in Europe; they were happy with that and it did not matter about the others.  ACOT have a duty to provide a service to every farmer whether he is big or small.  The basic objective of the advisory service should be to maintain as many small farmers on the land as possible, particularly because of the long dole queues.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will note that ACOT should be concerned about the number of families that are helped to stay on the land.  It costs the Government an enormous amount to provide jobs in industry and some industries have to be rescued by State funds to keep them going, yet we have the finest land in the world for growing grass, or for producing top class beef and we are not utilising it properly.  Since the people of Ireland voted for the Single European Act we were told that our markets would open up more than in the past.  ACOT will help people to develop other lines of production. We should have some kind of levy whereby farmers may &ldquo;switch off&rdquo; in dealing with the advice that has been so freely available to them down through the years.</P>
    <P>Since its foundation the policy of ACOT was geared towards bigger farmers; I have nothing against bigger farmers, they are entitled to proper advice. The bulk of farmers are medium to small and they have never received the same incentive or advisory service as the larger farmers.  That was wrong of ACOT from the beginning.  If this trend continues over <Col N="599" /> the next ten years I shudder to think what rural Ireland will be like.  Many people will not be able to rear their families on the land.  We will have the position where the bigger farmers will be able to pay for the service.  I am sure the Minister will pay attention to that when he is deciding on the type of levies to be paid by farmers. The very efficient dairy farmer who has reached his peak in milk production does not need an advisory service any more because he may not produce more milk, due to the quota system.  The small farmer down the road with a small milk quota will need the advice and he will have to pay for it.  The weaker farmers will be caught in this net.  I listened to the Minister very carefully when he introduced this Bill.  Being a practical man from the land I am sure he will be careful as to who will have to pay and what he will have to pay.</P>
    <P>The Minister should encourage ACOT to seek funds from organisations with a vested interest in farming to make a contribution towards the running of the service.  I will not name them.  There are so many people making millions out of farming today that they, too, should be asked to carry the can.  The first objective should be to ensure that the structures within ACOT, which are top heavy, are examined and that any waste or overlapping should be eliminated.  In these times, whether we like it or not, we all could do with better housekeeping within our own business, whether we be farmers or fishermen.  If there are to be cuts and if there are to be levies they should be applied across the board whether in a health board, in ACOT, or elsewhere; everybody should carry the can and should be seen to carry the can.  It is not just the small farmer with 20 acres who cannot afford it who will just switch off. Maybe a young son might come along after he had inherited a farm and might be in a bad state having to pay out a lot of money to have an adviser call.</P>
    <P>I hope the senior people in the Department of Agriculture, of whom I have been critical in the past and of whom I am critical today as well, will come down <Col N="600" /> from the clouds and put themselves in the west or south of Ireland.  They will then see that it is not possible to provide a service by pressing a button and that one call will not solve all the problems for a farmer.  Continuous communication between adviser and farmer is necessary, particularly if the farmer inherits a farm with no milk quota.  That young man needs much assistance today.  I do not want to see him bled by the farmer up the road with 100 cows who reached his peak in production and who got every kind of assistance and advice at the taxpayers' expense.  That farmer will not need further advice because he cannot increase his production.  The smaller farmer who is caught in between with a low quota, or with no quota, is the man who needs assistance.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to be careful because there are more small farmers than big farmers.  If it meant keeping one or two more people on the land on each farm it would be a job well done and money well spent.  I would prefer that to the IDA paying £20,000 to create a job for one of them in a factory that might close down in four or five years.  We got our act all wrong in the past 25 years.  We have not enough confidence in agriculture. Successive Ministers should have had more confidence in agriculture.  They will have to have it in the future.  I have every confidence in the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, who spent many years in Brussels and who knows the scene.  I am sure he will fight his corner not alone for the farmers but for the nation.  Instead of spending billions of pounds to provide jobs that will only last for a few years, we should look to agriculture to create more employment for our people both in town and in country.</P>
    <P>The number of jobs created by a prosperous agricultural industry is often underestimated.  There is an old saying: &ldquo;When the farmers are down the nation is down&rdquo;.  I could go on.  I appeal to the Minister to be very careful and to have a hard look at the overlapping and over-manning at administrative level in the service.  There would be no complaints if <Col N="601" /> justice was done across the board.  We are at a crossroads in farming, in industry, and so on.  We must all pull together to get the country out of the mess it is in and to give hope to future generations. We have the youngest population in Europe most of whom are well educated. With our help these young people can be prevented from crossing the pond or flying to the States.  It is our duty in Dáil Éireann and in Seanad Éireann to do what we can for them.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the predicament in which the Minister for Agriculture and Food and his Minister of State find themselves. It does not take any great commonsense to understand that they would have acted differently if the books were different when they took office.  These are the hard facts.  Some Senators referred this morning to media attention to this House.  I am sure it would not be difficult for them to understand the very drastic action taken in the last two months by the Government, not alone in agriculture but in other areas also.  We cannot go on fooling ourselves any more because if we do &mdash; it has gone on for far too long &mdash; we are doing a disservice to the coming generation, the unemployed and the over taxed.  The buck has to stop someplace and if it does not stop in Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann, how can the people have confidence in us?  No matter what our walk of life, the buck must stop someplace and economies must be made.  I hope the searchlight will go right across the board.  We have massive waste for a country of this size.  It is a non-productive area for which the taxpayer is paying dearly.  I would prefer to see the money which is being poured into this unnecessary bureaucracy being spent in an area which would create genuine jobs.</P>

      <P>Nobody is under any illusion that the Government must seek finances from whatever source they can in order to pay for the services they provide. It comes as no surprise to this side of the House that the Minister is introducing a Bill to gather in finances to pay for the services of ACOT.  The previous Minister of State, Deputy Hegarty, introduced a Bill in the Dáil before the previous Government fell and he indicated that a particular segment of farmers are in a position to pay for services and should be making a contribution to the quality of service being provided.  I am glad Senator Byrne referred to the fact that there was no mystery today about the introduction of a Bill of this kind.  I am glad that the mystified have now been brought to heel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>ACOT were set up in 1979, established under the agricultural Acts of 1977 and 1979, and got under way in 1980.  They were charged with the responsibility of development in agriculture through the provision of agricultural education, training and advice.  ACOT integrate and further develop and expand the work previously carried out by the county committees of agriculture, the agricultural advisory information and education sections of the Department of Agriculture, including the State-aided private agricultural colleges and the colleges of rural home economics.  To realise the broader objectives concerned with production, processing and marketing of farm produce, they were given power under the Acts to expand in these areas with the overall aim of improving the economic and social conditions of those engaged in the agricultural industry as a whole.  To achieve greater production, processing and marketing, ACOT were equipped with the resources of knowledge and research to develop and adjust to the changing ways in the agricultural and rural environment that were coming <Col N="603" /> to bear on our community following our entry into the EC.</P>
    <P>The general function of ACOT has been to provide and cause to be provided education, training and advisory services in agriculture and to make available scientific and practical knowledge which is essential to improve agricultural output and improve and make our farms viable. ACOT continue to operate within the role provided for them in those Acts. They continue to give advice to farmers, albeit on a client-adviser basis.  They continue to provide training and education for many thousands of young farmers each year.  In 1986, up to 4,000 farmers received practical education and training through ACOT schemes of various kinds. This figure is increasing yearly.  In that context there is a great incentive for the provision of those courses.  The popularity of those ACOT courses was enhanced by the ability of the State to provide stamp duty exemption for the early inheritance of farms by sons from fathers or by nephews from uncles.  An educational qualification was required under the law to provide that service.  I regret that the Government have not seen fit to continue that stamp duty exemption in the Finance Bill, 1987.  The fall off in applications for the courses over the next 12 months will reflect that course of action taken by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Another area which was providing a great incentive for young farmers to gain additional hours of education and training experience was the young farmers installation aid.  This was in operation for a very short time, brought in under a structures directive by the European Community.  I regret that the Minister for Finance has seen fit to terminate this scheme in the budget.  For the past few years we have heard various Fianna Fáil spokesmen saying that any money that one could get from Europe, from whatever department, was very valuable to the country in that half of that source of finance was recoupable from the EC.  I find it very strange that people who were speaking in those terms have terminated <Col N="604" /> a very important scheme for many of our young farmers who may not have benefited in large numbers so far, but were looking forward to the day when, for the first time, they would be put on an equal footing with many of their young counterparts in industry who were receiving grant-aid from the European Social Fund, the IDA or the Youth Employment Agency to establish a small industry or to set up in an enterprise.</P>
    <P>It is another example of how farming is treated differently from other walks of life.  This was referred to extensively by Senator Hussey and other speakers who outlined the discrepancy in funding that is available to people doing AnCO courses and CERT courses and people who are being funded to set up small industries by the Industrial Development Authority.  It is appropriate, at this stage, to appeal to the Minister for Agriculture and to the Minister for Finance to consider the agricultural industry as the dominant industry, the industry which can provide the greatest value-added in terms of food processing, the greatest possible number of jobs in the food processing industry and has the ability to keep young farmers on the land as long as possible and prevent them from swelling urban areas with further unemployment.</P>
    <P>Senator Byrne was perfectly correct when he stated that any scheme that would keep young farmers on the land is a welcome scheme.  The installation aid was a great vehicle, in principle, which was established under the structures directives of the EC to ensure that young people who were interested in farming and interested in a career in agriculture were kept at home and kept on the land and that the particular farm could support two families rather than one.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent development by ACOT in providing very valuable advice in terms of the socio-economic service. This is a very important service which provides on-the-spot advice, lectures and courses for farmers who are thinking of passing on their farms to their heirs.  We have had many social history and social geography studies carried out over the years which indicate that we have a very <Col N="605" /> old farming population, particularly in the west.  Any socio-economic service like this, which increases the possibility of handing on land to the younger generation at an earlier age is certainly bound to assist in creating greater agricultural output and greater possibilities for employment in food processing.</P>
    <P>A welcome development in recent times in the ACOT service has been the provision of more courses nearer the place of residence of young farmers.  This has been particularly so in the introduction of the certificate in farming, a three year course, which is provided through the local ACOT offices in the various counties.  The number attending those courses is certainly a justifiable indication of how important it is to have courses and educational facilities as near as possible to the target people ACOT are proposing to meet.</P>
    <P>In County Kilkenny the level of uptake of young farmers in the area, either through certificate and farming courses, or through agricultural colleges, means that 95 per cent of young people who are entering farming are now getting some education.  This has been a major step forward in ensuring that the challenges being faced by young farmers and the challenges being faced by farming in general are being met &mdash; and on-the-spot important educational requirements locally as well as regionally &mdash; in the agricultural colleges.  In this respect I should like to pay tribute to the agricultural colleges at Kildalton and Rockwell which have been over the years providing a tremendous educational facility for many young farmers in my area of Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>We are living in an age where we have to become more conscious of the alternative enterprises in agriculture over the coming years.  An effective lid has been put on many of the expanionist enterprises we became used to over the years. The milk quota has put a stop to further expansion in dairying, the uncertainty about beef prices and intervention has put pressure on the beef farmers, the dear price of the store bullock and the uncertain future of the outlet for the finished market product of the beef farmer <Col N="606" /> mean that farmers have to be increasingly aware of the market trends and increasingly aware of the market opportunities for their produce.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food is engaged in farm price negotiations at the moment and he is under tremendous pressure to hold the line for the cereal farmer, a farmer who has come under tremendous pressure over the past two wet years in terms of the output he has achieved over those same years.  There is a general thrust in Europe to further depress cereal prices.  This is regrettable. I urge the Minister to take every opportunity to ensure that these hard pressed cereal farmers get the necessary Green Pound devaluations to ensure that their livelihood is not depressed.</P>
    <P>ACOT have a tremendous role to play in ensuring that, where the lid is on these enterprises, the alternatives for these young farmers of the future will be highlighted and the doorway will be opened to future opportunities to them.  A better trained young farmer is a prerequisite to having better quality produce, better productivity, better farm production and a better farm viability at home.  We have to become more competitive.  We have to be able to market our product more astutely and, above all, the farmer has to become a better business manager.</P>
    <P>In that regard, I welcome the recent ACOT innovation of the farm business service.  This service will provide for the farmer an opportunity to discuss the financial position of his farm and identify if he is on the slippery slope down the hill towards financial difficulty.  One of the problems over the years has been that the farmer did not realise he was heading in the wrong direction financially.  ACOT are providing a very valuable service by identifying through their farm business service those farmers who need to take corrective action much earlier and prevent the type of situation in which up to 2,000 farmers were in financial difficulties up to 28 February 1986.  This certainly brings home to people the level of farming indebtedness of £1,500 million, which is causing tremendous problems for many <Col N="607" /> of those farmers and indicates the necessity of having up-to-date farming advice and up-to-date farming trends on the market possibilities for them.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the Bill before us and to the context in which the ACOT charges are being introduced.  The Minister for Agriculture has decided that he needs £1 million in 1987 to be collected from farmers through the ACOT charges. Is the Minister aware that most of the year is gone and that the Bill has not gone through the Oireachtas?  The earliest possible opportunity he will have to levy any charge on a farmer will be in September this year.</P>
    <P>I would like to know how much money the Minister expects to get from a farmer for the agricultural advisory service between September and the end of the year.  I suggest that £1 million is a very ambitious target.  What are the administrative costs for ACOT personnel in making known to these farmers the level of charge they will have to pay, at what level of the service they will have to pay these charges, what services are to be exempt of charge?  What financial outlay will be necessary to promote the service? What packages has the Minister in mind or discussed with ACOT to ensure that the lower echelons of the farming community, who are least in a position to pay, will not be penalised by an excessive charge?</P>
    <P>Various reference have been made by previous speakers to the smaller farmer &mdash; Senator Byrne referred to the smaller farmer with no milk quota &mdash;<i>vis-a-vis</i> the farmer up the road who has a 100,000 gallon quota and is well developed? Those are the categories that have to be taken into account.  I hope that whatever contract of service emanates at the end of the day between ACOT and the Department of Agriculture and Food it will take into account the financial situation of the farmer and his level of operation.  Unfortunately we are going to create a situation where we will have tiers of farmers. There is no escaping that under the Bill we are to treat people fairly under a waiver scheme, or whatever scheme is necessary to ensure that no financial <Col N="608" /> hardship is encountered and, above all, to ensure that the advice still gets to the farmer who needs it.</P>
    <P>The ACOT budget was cut by £1 million in the Fine Gael budget of January 1987.  In addition to that there was a deficit of £1 million to 31 March 1987. Along with that there was a further £1 million cut in the revised budget of March 1987.  This has meant that ACOT will be £3 million worse off than they were in 1986.  This will place a great burden on the ACOT staff to give the level of service they gave in 1986 and in the years before. It cannot be done with that level of financial allocation for ACOT.  If the ACOT people are to remain within their financial allocation we are facing a redundancy situation in ACOT.  We are creating an elitist service for some farmers who are better able to pay than others and we are moving, unfortunately, into a situation where, because of the desperate financial position of ACOT, that the end of ACOT could be in sight.  This would be a tremendous blow to the farming community.</P>
    <P>I hope I am wrong in making these assumptions but when we consider the gradual reduction in the level of finance made available to ACOT and the huge amounts of money being given to people to make a lot of money out of courses in AnCO it is a symptom of how the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Department of Finance see the role of ACOT in the future.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the farm improvement scheme operated by ACOT at the moment.  I want the Minister for Agriculture and Food to confirm or deny that the farm improvement programme will come under threat when the axe falls in the next round of financial cutbacks.  The farm improvement scheme is essential for many farming developments.  When any incentive was given in the past to a farmer to develop he was able to meet that on a 50-50 basis, and even more in recent times, to carry out that development and thus increase his viability and increase agricultural output.  It is rumoured that the scheme is threatened.  I want the Minister to confirm or deny its termination in the near future.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to the role of county committees of agriculture under ACOT.  I regret that the Department of Agriculture and Food, under the financial allocation given to them have seen fit to squeeze out, financially, county committees of agriculture who up to 1979 had a primary role in providing agricultural advice and training for farmers. County committees of agriculture are made up of elected representatives and representatives of all the rural organisations in that county.  Under statutory authority they provide a vital county forum, a unique mechanism of filtering agricultural policy from the Department of Agriculture and Food to farmers. ACOT have said continuously that they recognise the importance of having the mechanism for a contribution to be made by this forum for the development of their policies and the implementation of their schemes, to farmers and to the people who derive benefit from those schemes.  I am thinking in particular of the fodder schemes for which ACOT had to pay out of their own finances and did not get any recompense from the Department of Agriculture and Food for the last two years.  The county committees of agriculture and ACOT together were in <Col N="610" /> a position to draw up a fire brigade programme to help many farmers who were badly caught by fodder shortages in 1985 and 1986.  Will ACOT continue to have that particular funding for that type of fire brigade action next year and the year after?</P>
      <P>Financial savings can be made in many areas in agriculture but I would not like to see a financial cutback taking place where advice is so necessary in the changing challenges in agriculture we have today.  We are living in a time when changes are taking place rapidly.  The breeds of animals, varieties of corn and alternative enterprises are the order of the day and are on the agenda of every farmer's calculations each day he rises.  A farmer fending for himself cannot be expected to know the answers to all these developments. He needs the services of ACOT; he needs their advice and expertise.  I am not objecting to a farmer paying for that level of service but I hope the viability of some farmers will not be called into question due to the fact that they have to pay a certain amount for that service.</P>
      <P>There is a cliché that agriculture is our main industry.  It is a tired and worn statement at this stage when one considers the barriers to development in relation to agricultural advice and training and when we see the imbalance in agricultural training <i>vis-a-vis</i> other training schemes.  I hope the charges brought in under this Bill will not militate against farming development but will provide even more finance to improve the agricultural service which has been very good to the farming community over the years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of Senator Murphy giving way I lost my place in <Col N="611" /> the queue also.  I will have to leave very shortly.</P>
      <P>This can be regarded as transitional legislation which was initiated by the previous Government and is being brought forward here because it was in the pipeline. I am very sceptical about any legislation which is agreed on by both sides of the House.  You can always term it as bureaucratic legislation from ACOT or wherever.  If you go back to the days of the Congested Districts Boards, they recognised the western areas, as did the EC, when they introduced the disadvantaged areas of the west and the severely handicapped areas.  They recognised the west in introducing the western drainage package.  Various schemes have been formulated for the benefit of the disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>This Bill will militate against the small farmer.  The way it will be worked, on a district basis, will, as Senator Byrne said, set up more districts.  I understand that a programme will have to be sold in the future by our ACOT advisers.  A small farmer in the west who has a traditional programme which he cannot change will have to pay the same fee to ask the adviser a simple question which might take about ten or 15 minutes or, at most, half an hour to an hour.  On the larger farms a programme will be sold to the bigger farmer, an appointment will be made over the phone, an agricultural adviser will arrive at the appointed time in the morning and spend the whole day discussing that programme with the farmer.  He may have to come back another day to complete the programme. That is not operative in the west.  For that reason this introduction of charges is not realistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Munster and Leinster and the bigger farming regions, the commercial bodies such as Avonmore, Kerry Co-Op, Waterford Co-Op and the various milking coops send out their advisers without any charge to the bigger farmers and if there are any charges they are painlessly deducted from their milk cheques.  In the same way if you go to seed merchants such as Dardis and Dunnes, Powers and <Col N="612" /> various other commercial firms, they will give a free service.  So will the people who sell you a spray, as will the grain merchants.  This does not apply in the west; nor does it apply to the small farmer.  The large farmer may be in a position to pay.  He can have the adviser for the whole day who will formulate a programme and he will be prepared to pay for that.</P>
    <P>With regard to the farm development service, if you build a sheep dipping bath you will get a grant of £120.  The ACOT adviser will come out and charge you £20 for his advice.  A man will come from the farm development service and lay out the plans for the dipping unit and later on he will come back to see that it is finally completed.  You get a grant of £120 and £60 is deducted from that for the small farmer, but in the bigger farming area where you are building a slatted house or a major modern cow byre, a £50,000 to £100,000 unit, you can have that advice in the package I am speaking of for the same fee.  The small farmer is being penalised and I feel the Government should bring in an amendment to the Bill to exempt the disadvantaged area farmers.</P>
    <P>How do you collect this money?  It will be collected from the farmer by the ACOT adviser.  It will be up to the districts I spoke about earlier to collect this money.  Most farmers will not have the cash flow.  Most farmers in my part of the country have not got cheque books and have to have money available.  The legal collector will have to collect the fee.  I do not think that is practical.  It is discrimination against the small farmer and I am not too happy with it.  I have said this time and time again and I have no reason to change my stance on it.</P>
    <P>It is discrimination against the small farmer.  I do not believe he will avail of the service.  The good farmer will be looked after.  Having been competent in the past he will not need the advice.  It is the farmer we are trying to help in these changing times who will require the advisory service.  It is unworkable from the point of view of collection.  I do not think the amount of money recouped as a result <Col N="613" /> of the introduction of this service in the severely handicapped areas will justify its implementation.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to have another look at the disadvantaged and severely handicapped areas where I feel it may not be practical to introduce such charges. They are not working too well under the farm development services and I do not think they can work too well under this Bill.  I appeal to the Minister to have another look at it and see what can be done to bring in some amendment to exempt that section of the farming community from this legislation.</P>

      <P>Whenever I hear my colleagues in the major political parties talking about agriculture and farming I begin to wonder do they and I live in the same world, because they seem to envisage an agriculture of perpetual growth, perpetual increased production, perpetual increased prices, increased employment, increased wealth based on no real fundamental change in the traditional production patterns of agriculture. I heard it <i>ad nauseam</i> over the past four weeks during the determined campaign by the major political parties to give up what was left of this country's sovereignty and in which they, unfortunately, succeeded. I heard it at great length and with great monotony and without any rational base.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The representatives of farming are much given to presenting themselves as the brave advocates of free enterprise, free markets.  They are much given to giving lectures to people whom they see as not being prepared to work, in particular the organised trade union movement whom they are much intent on lecturing about excessive wage demands, etc.  I remember the hysteria, the almost fascistic hysteria, of certain members of the Irish Farmers Organisation during the ESB strike because the ESB workers dared to look for a 5 per cent wage increase or, indeed, dared to look for a wage increase that kept them in line with inflation.  The ESB workers show substantial <Col N="614" /> productivity improvements from year to year.  They produce the product for which there is a demand, which can sell on the open marketplace in competition with a considerable number of other forms of energy.  They are lectured about their arrogance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is a very dangerous thing to get involved in arguing about averages.  A minuscule charge being imposed by An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta for advice has to be looked at in the context of the business to which the advice is being given.  What I was leading to was the apparent incessant demand by agriculture for increased prices for their production.  Nobody else is entitled to such an unquestioning commitment to increased prices, irrespective of market demand, irrespective of productivity, irrespective of the state of the market.  Farming, apparently, is entitled to seek indefinite limitless increases in prices, guaranteed markets for products produced at those increased prices and no real attempt to interfere with it.  That is, of course, entirely unreal.  It is unreal even to a committed socialist like myself. It ought to be entirely unreal to those who claim to live in the brave world of competition, free enterprise and market economics.  Yet, listening to the advocates of market economics here, the one area in which they all abandon their market economic's hat and wear the hat of planned economy, guaranteed prices <Col N="615" /> and State intervention is in their own pet area of agriculture.</P>
      <P>It is not as if the dawning realities were not well forecast to us.  I was reading here, as I waited my chance, the report of the Conference of the Irish Management Institute in Killarney this year.  I am quoting from <i>Management,</i> volume 34 No. 6, June 1987, from the comments of Alistair McGuckian, chairman of Masstock, who is probably better known to the agriculturalists here than he is to me.  Mr. McGuckian said in Killarney that around 1974-75 it became apparent that the European beef and milk markets were nearing saturation.  That was 12 or 13 years ago and yet we have had the entire agricultural lobby trying to convince us, indefinitely, <i>ad nauseam</i> and with unanimity, that the future of agriculture since 1974 rested with producing more beef and more milk.  They did it, and they did it in great quantities and with great determination.  Suddenly, about two years ago, it all stopped.  They were absolutely flabbergasted that it could not continue. I wonder where these people have been living.  An efficient, effective businessman noticed it 13 years ago.  The agricultural industry finally noticed it when they were presented with no alternative but to accept the fact that the old ways could no longer continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the first unreality &mdash; the unreality of presuming that the market could go on for ever.  The second unreality was the assumption that farming, as currently structured in this country, was capable of responding to all the innovations that were needed.  We have still failed to address the fact that 45 per cent of our potentially arable land is under the effective control of male bachelors over 55 years of age with no enthusiasm for new ideas, no need for new ideas and no desire to innovate.  If we are to have a vibrant industry, that fundamental structural change is the first requisite for innovation. We are also faced with the mythology that there is something mystical about farming that only those who come from a farming background can handle. <Col N="616" /> The most successful agricultural economy in the world is New Zealand and they have by far the highest proportion of people from non-farming backgrounds working in farming, far higher than any country in Europe.  They have done it because they have got rid of this mystique and recognised that farming, like all other areas, is a business to be run by people with a sense of business and a capacity for scientific business.  The idea that there is some sort of mysterious art form involved, close to magic, which only those from a farming background can come to terms with is arrant nonsense and it is time we faced up to it.  We should run farming as a business.</P>
    <P>It is in that context that one looks at something like the role of ACOT and the advice they are giving to farmers.  I do not know what innovative production methods, or new products, or new markets they have identified, because I have not heard of them.  What I hear from everybody is about the need to protect the principles of the Common Agricultural Policy, about the need to preserve farm incomes, about the need to allow agriculture to grow.  Of course, it would be fine to allow agriculture to grow if there was somewhere for it to grow into.  I would like to hear somebody, who could describe themselves or be recognised as part of the farm lobby, tell me where they are going to sell all this production they would have if they were only let.</P>
    <P>It seems quite clear to me that the old ways are over, that the idea of a Common Agricultural Policy carrying on merrily paying us more and more to produce more and more of things that nobody wants is over.  It is self-deception on a grand scale, almost on a national scale, to pretend otherwise; and to have a State agency involved in advising people how to do more and more of that &mdash; whether they pay for it themselves or whether the State pays for it is a minor matter, in my view &mdash; the idea that this is what people are being encouraged to do seems to me to be a self-deception, indeed self-hypnosis, on a scale that we in this country used not to be thought to have.  We had <Col N="617" /> a capacity to face reality before.  It appears to me that, perhaps in the face of the problems we now have, we are less inclined to face that reality.  Just in case all of those in this House, and in the other House indeed, who defend artificial prices, unreal production, unmarket-related production in agriculture, think I am in a minority of left wing aniaysts, may I quote from the communique issued by the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development which met in Geneva on 12 and 13 May and at which our own Ministers for Finance and Agriculture and Food were present?  It recognises the realities and it is a foretaste of the future; and it is a future which is far different from the future being advocated by everybody, with the passing exception of something Senator Hogan said &mdash; I would have been interested to hear him elaborate on it but he did not elaborate on it.</P>
    <P>The section of the report I am referring to deals with agriculture.  It refers to the joint report of the Trade and Agricultural Committees.  What the communique says is this:</P>
    <P>This important work clearly highlights the serious imbalances that prevail in the markets for the main agricultural products, boosted by policies which have prevented an adequate transmission of market signals to farmers. Supply substantially exceeds effective demand.  The cost of agricultural policy is considerable for Government budgets, for consumers and for the economy as a whole.  Moreover, excessive support policies entail an increasing distortion of competition in world markets, run counter to the principle of comparative advantage, which is at the root of international trade, and severely damage the situation of many developing countries. .</P>
    <P>It goes on and refers to what they call reform but which I think, given the perception that people have about the future of agriculture, could only be described as disaster in this country.  It continues:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="618" /> The long term objective is to allow market signals to influence by way of progressive and concerted reduction of agricultural support as well as by all other appropriate means the orientation of agricultural production.</P>
    <P>So, that is it.  That is what the OECD has accepted and determined: that for the future agriculture will be based on what the market can accept, what the market will accept and what the market will sustain. To have people with their ostrich heads in the sand going on about whether the Minister should tolerate a 4 per cent, 3 per cent or a 2 per cent increase in prices at the annual price fixing exercise in Brussels in the light of that clear cut policy intent of every major industrial country in the world, and some that are not so industrial, is an exercise in self-deception that even exceeds the Fianna Fáil election manifesto in its extraordinary unwillingness to face basic realities.</P>
    <P>Agriculture as it used to be in this country is on its way out.  It will be on its way out unless the Minister here present manages to persuade people that they should start producing things that they can sell in the marketplace.  If they cannot do it, there will be no prices, no markets and no sales, and there will be wholesale bankruptcy in Irish farming.  The presumption that people will go on selling production at guaranteed prices to guaranteed markets is the most foolhardy self-deception and self-deceiving presumption that this country has seen in the last 20 years.  It was the presumption that was wrong when we joined the EEC, which was a wrong basis for a whole series of economic decisions and which still underlines all of the arguments, all of the campaigns of the farming organisations. There is a lot more in the OECD report.</P>

      <P>Back again to the Bill, Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming again to the Bill.  The Bill has to do with training people in what is described as a productive sector of the economy to produce goods which, presumably, they are going <Col N="619" /> to sell.  As a person with an interest in the productive sector of the economy &mdash; wearing my engineer's hat, again &mdash; I teach my first year students that the basic requirements are that you must produce something economically at a profit to sell in a market that wants what you have to sell at the price you can afford to sell it at.  That is what I would like people to start telling the whole agricultural industry. You can only produce something in the long term if the market wants to buy it and if the market will buy it at the price which the market will accept and which makes it worthwhile for you to produce it.  That is what market economics is all about.</P>
      <P>I am not an advocate of market economics, but I have to face the fact that we are now part of a 320 million people market which is based on market economics and that market economics are going to dictate irrespective of whether our Ministers postpone it for three months, six months or five years.  That is the reality that Irish agriculture has not even begun to face up to.  That is what the agricultural training board &mdash; An Comhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta &mdash; ought to be doing.  They ought to be moving us in the direction of products that can sell on free markets without guaranteed prices.  In that context it is, of course, severely under-funded; it is severely under-resourced in every area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know, because I am not involved in agriculture, what the products should be.  If I knew what were the new products that the market would require in any area of production I could probably make myself a millionaire overnight. That is what enterprise is about.  It is about identifying new products, developing a way of producing them and getting them to the market in a way that the market will accept.  We have not begun to do that, and that is what a training service ought to be about.  The idea that we will have a training service leading people to produce more and more of something that nobody wants, that is costing us money just to store and at prices that are not guaranteed, is the <Col N="620" /> height of nonsense.  Nevertheless, I am intrigued at the squeals of pain that the extraordinary effective agricultural lobby can produce here at the suggestion of even a minor contribution to the costs of their own security from the realities of market economics.</P>
    <P>The Minister quoted a figure of £7 million as the cost of the Farm Advisory Service and he said that there was somewhere between 29,000 and 70,000 farmers taking advice.  I am intrigued by the fact that the last time I looked up the statistics there were about 170,000 farmers in the country and, of that 170,000, 100,000 do not bother with advice, so we have 70,000 who bother of whom 29,000 get intensive service.  If you divide 29,000 into £7 million it works out at £250 a year. It is hardly a huge charge, if they have to pay at all.  If you divide 70,000 into £7 million it works out at £100 a year, which is hardly an enormous charge.</P>
    <P>When I hear Senators here who support the Government who are going to charge £10 a month to people on medical cards to have access to prescriptions and who then start to shed tears about poor misfortunate farmers having to pay out the same amount for advice that can make them richer, I get quite humid and upset at the way people can shift their views depending on whether the lobby they are talking about is powerful or powerless.  I do not have any great objection to farmers being required to pay for the services that are available.  The top 14 per cent of farmers, the last time I checked their incomes, were earning average incomes of about £30,000 a year. You can add on 100,000 or so farmers at the bottom of the agricultural production market&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will show the Senator the figures if he wants them.  The rich farmers in this country have managed to fox the country on such a scale by having themselves averaged with the 50,000 or 60,000 who earn very little and so reduce average farm incomes quite substantially. The truth is that there is a section of the <Col N="621" /> farming community who are rich by any standards, who have done very well out of the EEC and who not only should be paying for these services but should be paying for every other service since they are manifestly unwilling to pay for them through taxation.  My only regret is that there is so much left in the area of agriculture which is provided <i>gratis</i> to produce things that nobody wants, at prices which people cannot afford, in order to sustain a large section of the economy in the luxury to which they are accustomed without having to worry about those things they lecture everybody else about.  Everybody else gets lectured about the need to be competitive, efficient, economical, market oriented and export orientated.  There is only one section of our community which sits back and presumes that it is entitled to a living simply because it has a traditional role and a traditional cosy view of ourselves.</P>
      <P>It is time agriculture copped itself on and realised that it has no future unless it is able to sell in a competitive market on the basis of competitive market economics selling products that people want. If reality is beginning to dawn in the way of charges, demands for payment and for taxation and in the way of prices that reflect market demand, then it is about time it happened.  The consumer would benefit, this country would benefit and in the long term a slimmed down but real agricultural industry, based on real products that can sell on real markets, would be far better for this country than an artificial economy based on high consumer prices and no reference or concern for market demand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food with responsibility for horticulture and congratulate him on his appointment and wish him success especially in the field of horticulture. He displayed a great willingness, when he was spokesman on horticulture in Opposition, to familiarise himself with every aspect of the horticultural industry.  I have no doubt that this sector of our economy is in safe <Col N="622" /> hands.  This is one area in which we need to specialise, especially as we have many horticultural imports.  We could benefit if the horticultural industry was brought to full production here.</P>
      <P>Having listened to Senator Brendan Ryan, he has convinced me that agriculture is at a great loss in that he did not choose farming as a profession.  I doubt that he would become a millionaire overnight, but definitely from the way in which he spoke I think agriculture is at a loss in that he did not choose farming as his profession.  Perhaps wisely, he chose an academic role.  However, speaking in favour of the farmers, I might give this House some figures which were quoted by the West German Minister for Agriculture and which I read recently in a periodical.  He said that the income per person employed in agriculture in 1986 in The Netherlands was £14,135 per annum. In Great Britain it was only £8,500 and in Ireland it was £3,900.  That average income is much lower than the income of people employed in other sectors in this country.  While, as Senator Ryan said, some farmers might enjoy a good standard of living, the majority of farmers have not a decent wage to enjoy a good standard of living.  The purpose of this Bill is to provide a training service for these farmers.  It will train them to become efficient farmers and bring them into a good line of production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity to speak on the Bill.  It is important when discussing anything concerning the agricultural community that Members should acknowledge the contribution made by the advisory service to the development of this industry over the years.  They made an immense contribution in terms of the progress which has been made in the area of research.  It is worth noting the advances that have been made in the dairying sector.  There have been great advances made in the dairying sector.  I spoke in this House on the milk cessation scheme and I will give Senators figures drawing a comparison with The Netherlands. In 1965, the average yield per cow per annum in The Netherlands was 4,207 kilograms, while in Ireland it was 2,308 <Col N="623" /> kilograms per cow.  In 1983, in the Netherlands it was 5,290 kilograms and in Ireland it was 3,654 kilograms.  This proves that we were closing the gap and that we were progressing in this country regarding production.  This was due to the advice given to the dairy farmers by the advisory service.  The old advisory service proved of great benefit to farmers. Research carried out by the specialists in Moore Park was conveyed to farmers by the advisory service and led to great advancement in the dairy sector. I do not think anybody will dispute the fact that we have some of the most efficient dairy farmers in Europe &mdash; of course, we have others who are not efficient &mdash; but that significant development is as a result of the dedication of those involved in research and in the advisory service.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Seanad recognises that any money voted by the House for education or research into the agricultural field is more than repaid in terms of returns to the nation.  We are all aware of the increase in the volume of agricultural exports and the benefits that accrue to our economy.  We should recognise that farmers were very eager and willing recipients of the advice given to them.  They have always displayed a tremendous commitment to the industry for their own benefit and also for the benefit of the nation.  Advisers who worked in close co-operation with the farmers were, in effect, development officers because of their involvement in local communities.  Investment in agricultural education was more than repaid through agricultural exports.  The agricultural community were always anxious to learn, to improve their living standards and overall efficiency of the industry.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that our entry to the European Community provided us with a base on which to build our agricultural industry.  There was a lot of controversy at the time about our application to join the Community, but there can be no doubt but that the agricultural industry and our economy benefited significantly from our membership; and it <Col N="624" /> continues to do so, although on a somewhat reduced scale.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that the response of Irish farmers to the call for increased production by good farming techniques has resulted in the introductioan of the quota system for most of our agricultural products. I must express strong criticism of the present marketing position in agriculture where the opportunity for expansion no longer exists.  That is the real problem facing agriculture.  A quota applies to most of our agricultural products and that automatically restricts potential for development in that industry.  Because we depend on agriculture we should endeavour to renegotiate our position in the Community regarding that sector. Our production of milk is three-quarters of a tonne of milk per hectare, whereas in the Netherlands it is 3½ tonnes of milk per hectare.  I do not know whether the previous Minister used that to make Ireland an exceptional case when the quota was introduced, but it proves that we were not as developed as other EC countries and should be treated as a special case.</P>

      <P>Right, a Chathaoirligh. We depend on agriculture and, unless we can come to some satisfactory arrangement within the EC to give us an increased share of the European market, there will not be a real scope for improving the agricultural industry or for saving many farmers who are in extreme financial difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is about the advisory services. Since the early fifties I have had a close association with the advisory service in my own county.  I had the privilege of taking their advice and benefiting from it.  They have done great work, especially in planning development programmes for <Col N="625" /> farmers, and in silage lay-outs which make farm enterprises more modern in order to meet the challenges facing this country since joining the European Community. They can visit farmers more than once.  The can draw up a plan and the farmer and themselves can discuss it.  The can also change that plan, but I think they will always come up with the most suitable plan for the particular farmer. They advised the farmers in such a way that money was spent in the proper way towards increased production.</P>
    <P>Tribute must be paid to them for the contribution they made to the changing face of agriculture.  Many of the instructors and advisers went far beyond the call of duty in order to visit halls, meeting places and community centres during winter months.  I am sure people involved in farming well know that they have gone beyond the call of duty to organise lectures in local halls in the evenings, something for which they must be appreciated. They are prepared to give their time in that way and for no pay.  They made an essential contribution to agriculture.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of this Bill is concerned with charges.  Nobody likes to pay charges, but we must appreciate the constraints on the economy and the Government at present.  Farmers will not object to paying these charges because the advice they get will be worth two or three times what they will pay for it.  If the farmers were to get advice from another source, for example, a semi-State body or a private, commercial agri-business, they would have to pay for it.  I am sure they will avail of the advice because they will benefit from it.  Farmers will never refuse advice because it will put them on the right road to efficient farming.</P>

    <Title>Government Review of Seanad Éireann: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to carry out an urgent <Col N="626" /> review of the powers and functions of the Seanad and the methods of election of its members.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate this motion because the Seanad has in recent times become more and more the object of public scrutiny, press scrutiny and party political scrutiny and particularly the object of the scrutiny of one party who has called for its abolition.  These calls have intensified.  This scrutiny is welcome because it is right that we as Senators should be able to justify ourselves and our existence to the public.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in saying that the popularity and image of the Seanad outside these walls is not a good one.  That may be our fault, it may be the fault of the press, it may be the fault of the political parties, but there is no doubt that the public perception of the Seanad is undoubtedly that it is a cosy club and is probably, to a degree, a waste of taxpayers' money.  The public at worst are ignorant of and at best are disinterested in our proceedings and in what we do. They wonder what we do.  I do not think they have any distinct outline of what the Seanad is about.  Therefore, the calls for its abolition struck a fairly popular chord around election time.  It may be because of ignorance but it is a case we are obliged to answer.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that the Seanad is all bad and that everything is wrong with the Seanad.  What I am saying is that there is massive room for improvement in our procedures, our functions, our personnel and our identity and our image.  We should all have an obligation to get across to the public exactly what we are doing and how we fulfil a function which the Dáil does not.  What we should do is try to portray a distinctive and useful role for ourselves which is not confused with the role of the other House.  The Dáil is undoubtedly the democratically elected body and we should not try to compete with it on that score.  It is the supreme body.  It should have the ultimate say in any legislation or motion which goes through either House.  We should try to <Col N="627" /> carve an identity for ourselves which is recognised as different; it may be subordinate but it is useful and it is different.</P>
    <P>My problem with the Seanad &mdash; and this is probably one which is shared by the majority of the public &mdash; is that it is far too party politically orientated.  The Seanad, if possible, should be taken out of the realms of party politics.  In our deliberations, in our numbers, in our complexion and in everything we do we are a shadow of what goes on in the other House.  During this debate I would like to see Senators putting forward ideas as to how we can become more like the original concept of a Seanad &mdash; more a vocational concept and more a concept where people represent pressure groups and particular interests in our society rather than political parties.</P>
    <P>This Seanad was known as a vocational Seanad.  The original idea was that all sorts of pressure groups should be represented in this House.  There is a vocational element in this House at present but that vocational element has become drowned by party political interests because the nominees of most of the vocational bodies are members of political parties.  The division of the Seanad is 11 of the Taoiseach's nominees, six university Senators and 43 Members elected from the various panels.  The result of having these panels is that every single one of those 43 is a committed member of a political party.  Their first commitment is obviously to a political party.  I will demonstrate that successfully by saying that out of the 43 Senators elected by the various panels at least 27 have at some stage stood for the Dáil.  I stand corrected if this is wrong.  I would like to read their names into the record: Senators Seán Haughey, Katherine Bulbulia, Joseph Doyle, Patrick Kennedy, Mary Wallace, Michael Ferris, Rory Kiely, John Connor, Charles McDonald, Paul Bradford, Padraic McCormack, William Ryan, Thomas Hussey, Tom Fitzgerald, Seán Byrne, Joachim Loughrey, Maurice Manning, Seán Fallon, Mick Lanigan, Philip Hogan, Brian O'Shea, Des Hanafin, Dan Kiely, Denis <Col N="628" /> Cregan, Nuala Fennell, Brian Hillery and Larry McMahon.  All these Senators have at some stage stood as candidates for the Dáil.  There is nothing wrong with that but their first preference is to be Members of another House and the Seanad is very much their second preference. I do not like it being a second preference House.  It is a pity that the Seanad remains a second preference House.  We are aware when we are here of the laudable and the perfectly understandable ambitions of many Members of this House to get to the other House but it denigrates this House by their having stood for the Dáil and by their having indicated that preference.</P>
    <P>I have suggested that one of the ways of ensuring that career politicians, those who are not failed or aspiring TDs, are elected to this House is to change the electoral system.  This would be very simple.  The idea of vocational bodies and vocational members has evidently failed. The reason why it has failed is not because of the nominating bodies; the elections are carried out by politicians. Quite understandably, politicians vote for politicians for various reasons.  To take it out of the political arena it would be necessary to change the electoral college. In other words, to deprive outgoing Senators, incoming Dáil Deputies and county councillors of a vote.  I have a vote and I would feel no great deprivation as an outgoing Senator if I lost that vote. I see no reason why I, as an outgoing Senator, should have a vote for an incoming Senator.</P>
    <P>The result of the present system is that every Senator takes a party whip.  The lines on which they break down are as rigid as they are in the Dáil.  It is so seldom to see members of political parties in this House breaking the party whip that it proves and points to the loyalty which Senators hold, not to that body which nominated them, but to their party.  One has only to listen, as I did several times in the last Seanad, to some of the speeches made in this House when many Members referred regularly to what they called &ldquo;my constituency&rdquo;.  They mean the &ldquo;Dáil constituency&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="629" /> I recall Senator Alexis FitzGerald and Senator Mark Killilea referring to &ldquo;their constituencies&rdquo;.  Their constituencies are the county councillors &mdash; the electorate. They refer to their constituencies as the geographical areas which they hope to represent in the Dáil.  That is the sort of confusion of thinking between the two Houses.  That indicates where those Senators want to be and what they feel this House is &mdash; it is merely a stepping stone for them to somewhere else.  That is a great pity and a great shame.  One has only to look at the motions which are put down in this House by the Opposition parties to see that they are party politically orientated.  Senators have to do this because they are in groups and parties in this House.  Most of the motions are reflections of the motions in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the campaign for those 43 seats which those who have to win them have to go through.  This is possibly one of the most ridiculous campaigns I have ever come across.  It is degrading; it is a waste of time; it is humiliating; and it is absurd.  People drive thousands and thousands of miles to achieve about 50 votes.  They spend more time in their cars than they do canvassing votes.  The system of election involves them in fighting &mdash; not on policy grounds, because one knows beforehand how many seats are going to each party &mdash; members of their own party to secure one of those seats.  There are five or six people fighting for the three seats and they are fighting only for those three which are allotted to their own party.  They do not fight on policies.  They fight purely on personalities and on seeing that they beat the people within their own party.</P>
    <P>At election time, one has only to ask a candidate who is on his panel and who he is standing against and he automatically names the people in his own party.  I have never come across anybody who has mentioned any members of the opposition when asked who the other people are.  They know there are seats allotted to them and that they have to beat those in their own party.  They do not know who is standing in the opposition parties because they are not trying to take their <Col N="630" /> seats.  It is an absolutely absurd system that they have to canvass throughout the country on little policy, on backstabbing and deals to see that they keep out members of their party and get in themselves. That is not the way a Parliament should be elected and it is certainly not the way the Seanad should be elected.</P>
    <P>I have already gone on record by pointing out one example of the absurdity of this system whereby one man &mdash; and he is not alone &mdash; of enormous distinction could not get elected on the panel system. This man is Ken Whitaker.  He was appointed twice to the Seanad by two different Governments.  He is as distinguished as any living Irishman in his record and achievements but at the last election he came nearly at the bottom of the poll.  Ken Whitaker stood on the nomination of the Royal Irish Academy purely to demonstrate the point that, if he stands for election, he cannot get elected as a Member of the Seanad because the system works against him. One may not agree with his views.  I do not agree with his views on anything. What I do not dispute is that he would have an enormous contribution to make to the deliberations of this House, but the system as it stands ensures that party political hacks are elected and that those who want to get into the Dáil are elected at the expense of those who have years of distinguished experience and different contributions to make to this House.  That should be remedied.  A man of distinction like Ken Whitaker &mdash; and there are many others &mdash; cannot get elected simply because the system favours those whose allegiance is to a political party.</P>
    <P>I should like to see county councillors, the outgoing Seanad and the incoming Dáil taken completely out of the Seanad electoral process.  I should also like to see the right of the Taoiseach to nominate 11 Members taken away.  Traditionally these 11 Members have been nominated, to give the Taoiseach of the day a majority.  Also successive Taoisigh have been able to place here those who will possibly gain Dáil seats.  The Seanad has been unscrupulously and ruthlessly used <Col N="631" /> for this purpose by successive Taoisigh.</P>
    <P>At this stage I will make an exception to that by saying I think the most recent spate of Taoiseach's nominees are a great credit not only to the present Taoiseach but to this House.  I welcome the majority of them.  They are innovative.  They are original and they have something completely different to offer.  This trend was started by the present Taoiseach when he nominated Senators Robb and Mallon from Northern Ireland.  It was an eye opener to me and to many others in this House to listen to Senators Robb and Mallon, coming from Northern Ireland, telling us things which are completely different from and totally out of step with the normal political jargon and line we hear in this House.  I welcome those nominations and I welcome the continued nomination of people from Northern Ireland.  I welcome in particular the five Senators who were nominated this time who are not taking the Fianna Fáil Party Whip.  If we had more people with these types of contributions to offer and who come from these different strands of Irish life, the Seanad would be a far more useful and a far more relevant place.</P>
    <P>The first principle that should be established is that the Seanad was never meant to be a democratically elected body in the pure sense.  The Seanad was not meant to be: one man one vote; put them in; we represent the people.  We do not represent the people.  Nobody here represents the people as such.  If one wants to represent the people one should be in the Dáil representing a constituency.  The Seanad is not a democratically elected body and is not meant to be a democratically elected body in that pure sense.</P>
    <P>I would like to see direct nominations to the Seanad by the nominating bodies. We should see a wider spread of nominating bodies.  I was the first person to suggest that the Seanad should contain representatives of the unemployed, the underprivileged, the handicapped, the disabled, the trade union movement, the Confederation of Irish Industry, farmers, doctors, lawyers, businessmen, teachers and all sorts of people from different <Col N="632" /> aspects of Irish life, not people whose first allegiance is to a party Whip but to the pressure groups they represent.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the procedures of the Seanad which I have found cumbersome and extremely unsatisfactory ever since I have come in here and, from what I can see from the record, were unsatisfactory for a long time before that.  Private Members' Bills introduced in the Seanad by Independents have a deplorable record.  It was said recently that the last Seanad, to the great credit of the last Leader of the House, was a very effective and a very different Seanad because Bills were initiated here.  Bills were initiated here, but they were all Government Bills. Bills like the Clinical Trials Bill, the Children (Care and Protection) Bill and the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill were all Government Bills initiated here. While this was an improvement because it gave us a chance to make necessary and very good amendments, the record of Private Members' Bills in the Seanad is absolutely deplorable.</P>
    <P>The last Private Members' Bill introduced by a private Member in the Seanad to be passed into law was the Protection of Animals (Amendment) Act, 1965.  It is over 20 years since such a Bill was initiated in the Seanad and passed into law.  All Private Members' Bills could not have been that bad.  Several Private Members' Bills on the Order Paper were debated during the last Seanad but never got anywhere due to the constant obstruction of the Government at the time and the fact that the Government were not prepared to take a stand on them one way or the other.</P>
    <P>That shows a certain contempt for the proceedings of this House and the opinions of those in this House.  I respect the right of the Government to govern but I would like to be able to hear them say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  Senator Brendan Ryan's Homeless Persons' Bill did not get through the House and my Bill on capital punishment was obstructed and temporised by the Government of the day. This again shows the contempt for this House.  The Government should allow these Bills to be debated, should welcome <Col N="633" /> their debate and they should give their reasons for rejecting them.  The Dáil would and should be the final arbiter. I do not want to see the Seanad given increased power; I want to see the Seanad given increased opportunity and increased potential.</P>
    <P>One of the most fundamental reforms that has been suggested, besides taking the county councils and the politicians out of the electoral process for the Seanad, is to hold the Dáil and Seanad elections on the same day.  It is a very simple but a very fundamental reform.  It is obvious that if the two elections were held on the same day that would surely remove a large degree of the political element from this House.  It would mean that those who are in this House who want to stand for the Dáil as a first preference have made their choice and could not come here as a second choice.  Those who want to stand for the Seanad and regard it as a preferable House would come here.  It would remove a large number of party politicians from this House which, unfortunately, would be very welcome.</P>
    <P>I should like to see also a system whereby Ministers were more accountable to the Seanad.  The procedures of holding debates on the Adjournment which are held regularly here, is moderately unsatisfactory.  It is only one particular issue per week.  It is a restricted type of issue and it is not an issue which allows for backwards and forwards repartee, answers or supplementaries between the Minister and the Senator who raises the matter on the Adjournment. Such a system would give Senators scope to have a formal question time, when Ministers would come in and answer Senators' questions.  This is something which ought to be considered.</P>
    <P>There are other issues which apply just as much to the Dáil as to the Seanad. Why, for instance, do we not sit on Mondays and except in very exceptional cases on Fridays.  I am told the reason is that the county councils sit on Mondays.  It is a great pity that the county councils should decide when the Seanad and Dáil should sit.  Why do we have such tremendously long holidays?  Is it planned once again <Col N="634" /> that we should break up at the end of June or the beginning of July and take four months holidays, the longest holidays of any parliament in Europe?  Is there any reason for this?  Is it because the Government have no legislation to bring forward?  If they have no legislation why do they not have any legislation?  I suggest that the Seanad and the Dáil should sit until August and take the month of August off only.  If the Government cannot provide the legislation we will provide it for them.  We have plenty of Bills in the pipeline which we will debate until the end of July and through August if necessary.</P>
    <P>I would welcome the views of Senators on the Seanad.  I hope that this is not going to become too much an &ldquo;us and them&rdquo; with people defending vested interests, a cosy club-like atmosphere.  I would like to hear what Senators feel about including all those different strands which I have mentioned.  I would like to hear what Senators feel about reducing the party political content in the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to be relatively brief and non-contentious.  We should welcome Senator Ross's initiative in bringing this motion before Seanad Éireann.  It seems that he has nothing to gain from doing this.  I am not supporting him just because he is a friend of mine. Senator Ross is ensconced in a relatively cushy seat in Seanad Éireann, as an intermittent Senator, I say somewhat wistfully. One has to accept the Senator's good faith that he is doing this in the best interests of the House.  Earlier today there was some intimation that many Senators felt that the idea of bringing this motion before us was treachery to the House; that we are somehow under siege from people who want to abolish us and that, therefore, it is time to close ranks, that Senator Ross was being disloyal in putting this motion on the Order Paper and being guilty of a kind of <i>lése-majesté.</i> On the contrary, I assert that he is doing the House a great service because the House is under attack and therefore it must look to its laurels and see how it can justify itself.  On the other hand, I would <Col N="635" /> say to party political Senators that I, and I am sure Senator Ross also, do not approach this motion in any &ldquo;holier than thou&rdquo; spirit or a purer than pure spirit.</P>
      <P>There is a certain suspicion on the part of the majority of the House towards the university Senators.  We are a gracious relic of olden times.  Our former masters have long since got rid of university seats but nonetheless, as was their custom, they insisted on feeding the nostrum to the dog.  In Great Britain university seats were not possible after the welfare state experiment of post World War II and also because new universities were coming on stream.  It was no longer possible to maintain the university representation in the House of Commons.  They survived in the Seanad because they were originally intended for the Dáil and were translated to the Seanad as a form of compensation. We are a threatened species within a threatened species.</P>
      <P>I do not approach this in any &ldquo;holier than thou&rdquo; attitude.  The university Senators are as elitest as the rest of the House.  We also represent rotten boroughs. My rotten borough happens to be a very large one; Senator Ross's, for his comfort, is very much smaller.  We would not exist as Independent Senators unless there were party politics in this country. Independents in politics exist because there are party politics and because other people take upon themselves the responsibility of mobilising public opinion and submitting themselves to party discipline which some of us more restless spirits cannot endure.  We owe our existence to the party politicians.  We would make no sense only for the party politicians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My experience in this House goes back ten years.  It is my privilege to have known and to have watched in action some very great Senators from all political parties who performed a great service to the State.  I may be forgiven if I invoke the spirit &mdash; because it is not invidious to do so &mdash; of the late Senator Alexis FitzGerald who was an ornament to any parliamentary assembly and who gave freely of his talents to this House.  Therefore, it <Col N="636" /> is not because we think that we are better than the rest that we have tabled this motion; it is because Seanad Éireann has been unsatisfactory from the beginning in one way or another.</P>
    <P>The fundamental problem in a unitary State is how do you justify the existence of a second Chamber?  You can do so, but it is not self-evident. When I am asked that question at election times, I put forward a pretty plausible case but in the small hours of the morning, in the dark nights of the soul I am not entirely convinced that there is an absolutely cast iron case for a second Chamber.  There is a case, needless to say, for a second Chamber in a federal system like the United States.  As, apparently, we have to take integration into the European Community seriously now, hopefully there will be a proper Seanad as well in a Federal United States of Europe because the present European Assembly is usurping the functions of a parliament.  To have any proper popular representation in a large community, you will have to provide for the small countries as well as the big ones just as in the United States.</P>
    <P>There is a fundamental problem in a small and relatively poor State like this of absolutely justifying the need for a second Chamber and we continually have to establish the case.  The classic dilemma of a second Chamber was expressed by Abbé Sieye, whom I am sure many of you will remember from the history books on the French Revolution.  He was the original and great survivor.  He could have taught the Taoiseach several lessons in the art of survival.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Having survived all the vicissitudes of fortune from the outbreak of the revolution until the overthrow of Napoleon he came to the conclusion that it was very hard to justify a second House, because, as he said, it either duplicates the work of the first House, in which case it is superfluous, or it conflicts with the first House, in which case it is pernicious.  It is very hard to <Col N="637" /> gainsay that kind of logic.  This has happened in recent times.  New Zealand abolished their Senate because it was superfluous.  The Danes abolished their Senate because it was pernicious, just as the first Seanad of the Irish Free State was pernicious.  There is that fundamental dilemma about the existence of the second Chamber.  That is why Senator Ross has done us a service by getting us to examine the fundamental reasons for our existence.</P>
      <P>The reason there is a Seanad in the first place is because the British bequeathed it to us, just as they did the university seats.  The whole idea of a bicameral system was built into the Government of Ireland Act, 1912, and the Government of Ireland Act, 1920.  The first Dáil did not need a Seanad.  The first Dáil to which we look back as to a golden parliamentary age, did not need a Seanad or did not even think of a Seanad.  Because of the need to safeguard the Unionists and the minority representation, the Seanad was built into the Irish Free State's Constitution and for that reason it was in conflict with Dáil Éireann which enshrined the Nationalist aspirations of the Irish people.</P>
      <P>When Eamon de Valera got rid of that first Seanad, it looked for a time as if he was not going to usher in another Seanad but he did because fashions changed.  Just as it was necessary in 1922 to accommodate the ex-Unionist minority population so in the middle thirties it was necessary to pay lip service to the then highly fashionable idea that society should be organised on vocational lines. Éamon de Valera was never very satisfied with the Seanad which he devised because, as he said in 1937, and I quote:</P>
      <P>I say it would pass the wit of man to get a completely satisfactory scheme for a Second House.</P>
      <P>If it passed the wit of Eamon de Valera to get a completely satisfactory scheme, what hope has lesser mortals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the first decade of the State Governments were in conflict with the Seanad and when they established it, according to their image and likeness, <Col N="638" /> they found that they needed to control it.  Basically, what is wrong with Seanad Éireann is that there is an unresolved identity problem.  Is it a place where aspiring politicians and retiring politicians rest themselves for a while or is it truly a vocational assembly?  It is, I suggest, in the in-between world of unresolved tension between vocationalism and political control.</P>
    <P>Under the Constitution the Government must have control over the Seanad. If the Seanad is to be an integral part of processing legislation then it follows that the Government of the day must control it.  It seems to me that as long as that situation obtains, the kind of scenario which Senator Ross and I desire &mdash; although I do not agree with Senator Ross on every detail &mdash; will be very hard to come by.  Governments tolerate Seanad Éireann because it is one of the few areas of political party patronage at their disposal.  This State is relatively immune from the grosser excesses of political party patronage found, for example, in the United States of America. The Seanad is a large area of political patronage and therefore Governments are reluctant to get rid of it but at the same time they are reluctant to take it seriously.  It is also true to say that individual Members of Dáil Éireann are jealous for the primacy of the first House. There is that additional tension of Deputies towards Senators.</P>
    <P>The attack by the Progressive Democrats has concentrated our minds fearfully. Whatever the intentions were of the Deputy who raised the question of Seanad expenses she has, at considerable pain to many Senators, caused us to ponder on the reasons for our own existence. I say to the Progressive Democrats that they will have to think again before their facile talk of abolishing Seanad Éireann can carry any conviction.  I made the point in a very brief letter to the newspapers a couple of months ago that under the Constitution it is impossible to abolish Seanad Éireann.  Going through Bunreacht na hÉireann the other night, I am more than ever convinced that it is impossible to abolish Seanad Éireann <Col N="639" /> unless we have a new Constitution because references, direct or indirect, specific or non-specific to the Houses of the Oireachtas, both House, each House, etc. and to Seanad Éireann particularly, occur throughout about one-third to one-half of the Constitution.  It is not simply a question of neatly excising Articles 18 and 19.</P>
    <P>What Senator Ross has been suggesting tonight has been suggested by the Seanad Electoral Reform Commission, 1959.  What that suggested, in effect, was to dilute at least party political control in the Seanad by taking Article 19 of the constitution seriously.  Article 19 provides for direct representation in Seanad Éireann from the vocational bodies.  The Seanad Law Reform Commission, 1959, came up with that suggestion and said that of the 43 let 20 be directly nominated from the various nominating bodies.  It was turned down by the Government of the day for reasons mentioned already and has never been seriously taken up since.  As Senator Ross said, the Seanad has been ignored by the public; it has puzzled the public despite the notable contribution to public life and to the legislative process of individual Senators. They were not all university Senators. Now we are experiencing undesirable and lurid limelight.  It is a time of great financial retrenchments.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's famous observation that nothing is sacred when it comes to cuts is not irrelevant to our situation here. If we are to survive we have to change and become, as Senator Ross said, more vocational, if not entirely vocational, and the ordinary people of Ireland must find this Chamber meaningful.  One of the most frequent experiences I have as a university Senator &mdash; elected by a restricted franchise &mdash; is that people, like my family grocer, say to me: &ldquo;Why can I not vote for you?&rdquo; You will pardon the vanity in passing.  I have great difficulty in explaining to him why he should not, as a grocer, be able to vote for me as a constituent who lives in Cork South-Central. In other words, why could not every Seán Citizen or Siobhán Citizen &mdash; and <Col N="640" /> this is ultimately the only justification I can find for a second Chamber because I distrust the idea of nominating bodies being directly responsible for putting people in the Seanad because they would be open to pressure too &mdash; have two votes, one for his or her House representatives and one for his or her vocational or trade union or professional choice, without prejudice to class or sections in the community?</P>
    <P>It seems to me that that is the vision we have to look to.  We must take the duplicating process as it is out of the Seanad and replace it by a consultative process where there will be experts and disinterested people from all walks of life bringing their talents to bear in legislating, not with a view to obstructing the Government, but with a view to helping the Government of the day.</P>

      <P>That is all I propose to use, a Chathaoirleach.  Your timing as my own is indeed perfect.  Seanad reform in the last analysis cannot be separated from parliamentary reform as a whole because one justification we can make for ourselves is that as long as the average Dáil Deputy is preoccupied with constituency matters then I think we are not only desirable but absolutely essential. Parliamentary reform is the overall context to which we have to look for reform of our own House but I have no doubt that the issues raised by Senator Ross are vital and I think the publicity we are getting at the moment means that in the long term we either have to reform or be abolished.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Consideration of this motion by the <Col N="641" /> House is timely in that it is a reflection of the current mood of critical questioning of the existing institutions of Government.  The fact that Members of the House are prepared to initiate a debate on their own role and functions is indeed to be welcomed and puts paid to any suggestion that Senators have a vested interest in perpetuating the system merely because they are part of it themselves. I listened with interest to the views of the Senators who have contributed and in particular I will be anxious to see whether a consensus is emerging on the need for reform and the type of reform that is considered desirable.</P>
    <P>This debate is part of the continuing process of the evolution of the role and functions of the Seanad.  For the first years of its life the structure and powers emerged, one might say, on a piecemeal basis.  Amendments to the method of election, and to the powers of the Seanad were effected from time to time.</P>
    <P>A number of review committees were established to report on various aspects of the role, structures and method of election.  In a unitary State such as ours, with a system of parliamentary Government deriving from a bicameral Legislature it is only to be expected that the role of the second House should evolve over a period of time and should be adapted to changing circumstances.</P>
    <P>The fundamental question that arises in relation to the Seanad is: do we need a second House?  Indeed, one political party have made the abolition of this House a major part of their policy.</P>

      <P>I must acknowledge that their arguments have, so far, failed to impress me.  Nonetheless, it is a point of view and one that we should not shy away from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had only limited experience in this country of a single Chamber Parliament, that is during the period between the abolition of the old Seanad in 1936, and the adoption of Bunreacht na hÉireann in 1937, so we cannot speak <Col N="642" /> from great experience on this point.</P>
    <P>While most parliamentary democracies have a bicameral Legislature, there are instances where the upper House has been abolished.  For example, the New Zealand Parliament has consisted of a single Chamber since 1950.  However, it is interesting to note that in the case of New Zealand a practice has been adopted in which select committees consisting of elected members of Parliament scrutinise most legislation and provide a forum for further consideration of legislation.  One of the main arguments in favour of a second Chamber is that it helps to safeguard against ill-considered or overenthusiastic action by the lower House and provides a further means by which more detailed consideration can be given to a Bill.</P>
    <P>The report of the Committee on the Constitution which was published in December, 1967, contains the most recent review of the position of the Seanad.  This informal joint committee consisting of representatives of the three political parties then represented in the Dáil dealt with the necessity for a second Chamber.  While the report referred to the arguments in favour of and against retention of the Seanad, it did not issue a specific recommendation on this point. It did, however, note that Constitution makers and political theorists worldwide tend to prefer a bicameral Legislature.</P>
    <P>In this country, as in most countries with an indirectly elected upper House, the role of the Seanad is to an extent subordinate to that of the lower House, which has been directly elected by the people.  This is a necessary safeguard to ensure that a clash of interest does not arise between two Chambers of equal importance.</P>
    <P>There are no hard and fast methods of determining what type of second Chamber is appropriate to particular circumstances, but it seems that a powerful upper House would be best suited to a situation where there is a separation of powers, between the executive arm of Government and Parliament, such as exists in the United States.  A strong upper House may also have a role to <Col N="643" /> play in federal systems of Government to ensure proper representation of states within the federation.  In a unitary State like ours, an upper House elected by a restricted electoral college, with powers somewhat less than those of the lower House seems to be the norm.</P>
    <P>This is not to say, of course, that the role of a second Chamber must be seen as inferior or second-rate.  A properly structured and constituted House contributes invaluable expertise to the parliamentary process.  Indeed, it could be argued that such a House to which the appropriate powers and functions are assigned should complement, and does not compete with the lower House.  The power of the upper House to scrutinise and, if necessary, hold up legislation is a salutary reminder to the lower House that any ill-considered measure is unlikely to secure an easy passage.</P>
    <P>The 1967 report of the Committee on the Constitution, in considering the powers of the Seanad, felt that the general view of the population was that there should not be two Houses of the Oireachtas with equal powers.  It was felt that such a situation would inevitably lead to conflict.  The committee indicated that the general feeling in this country was that the directly elected Dáil should have authority superior to that of the Seanad. I would feel that it would be very difficult to argue otherwise, as any other arrangement would make the job of everyday Government more difficult than it already is.</P>
    <P>Mar sin, pé athrú a chinnfear a dhéanamh amach anseo, is léir go gcaithfear tús áite a thabhairt do Dháil Éireann i gcónaí.</P>
    <P>We are all familiar with the cynical and facile comment sometimes made about the composition of the Seanad.  We are told that it is a launching pad for aspiring Dáil candidates and a haven for those who fail to make it back to the Dáil.  I think the facts speak for themselves &mdash; some of our outstanding parliamentarians have served in this House. If an able and experienced public representative is, for one reason or another, <Col N="644" /> unable to continue in the service of the Dáil, it would be unfortunate, indeed, if Parliament and the country were to be deprived entirely of the benefit of his knowledge and experience.  We need make no apology on this score.</P>

      <P>The Seanad has been criticised on the ground that it fails to reflect the vocational character originally envisaged for it.  It is said that of the 43 members elected from vocational panels, a large proportion tend to be politicians or, perhaps, as Senator Ross suggests, politicians on the way up, the way down or on the way out.  Persons elected from the panel must, of course, have the requisite knowledge and experience appropriate to the particular panel, but it is scarcely surprising if many of them also have political interests.  The report of the Seanad Electoral Law Commission, which was published in 1959, emphasised in relation to this that, even if the Seanad was composed entirely of vocational representatives, elected by vocational organisations, it would still, because of the powers and duties vested in it by the Constitution, have to make decisions which are in the fullest sense political.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present method of election is an area which would have to be considered in the context of a review of the position of the Seanad.  Apart from the 11 members appointed by the Taoiseach, Senators are elected by a restricted electoral college consisting of members of the Oireachtas and of local authorities, and by university graduates.  Whether this method is the most appropriate is a question which will, no doubt, generate much debate.  I feel that few people would argue in favour of a Seanad directly elected by the people.  The 1967 Committee on the Constitution considered <Col N="645" /> this and concluded that it would be inadvisable to involve the public directly in the election.  The point at issue, then, is whether changes could be made to the present electorate and, if so, what form such a change should take.</P>
    <P>This was considered by the Seanad Electoral Law Commission which reported in 1959.  It is worth noting that that commission made recommendations for a separate electorate for candidates nominated by nominating bodies, the electorate to be determined by the registered nominating bodies themselves. Under the recommendations, Members of the Dáil and Seanad and county and county borough councillors would continue to elect candidates nominated by Oireachtas Members.  This would have entailed broadening the scope of the electorate considerably by giving the nominating bodies a direct role in the election of a proportion of Senators. There was considerable debate on this recommendation in the House in 1960 and it is fair to say that the then Senators were not enthusiastic about the idea.  For my own part, I think it is singularly appropriate that local authority members, who themselves have a direct mandate from the people, should continue to have a say in the composition of the upper House.</P>
    <P>Another facet of the system of election to the Seanad that would have to be examined, in my view, is the appropriateness at present, of having a separate university representation.  Tá fhios ag an saol go bhfuil obair fhónta á déanamh ag na Seanadoirí ollscoile.  De ghnáth, bíonn dearcadh úr le nochtadh acu ar cheisteanna an lae agus, an méid a bíonn le rá acu sa Teach, go h-iondúil, bíonn sé suimiúil, éifeachtach, agus bhí sé éifeachtach agus suimiúil anocht freisin.</P>
    <P>While acknowledging the contribution of university Senators, the question must be asked: what today is the democratic justification for awarding a second parliamentary vote to a citizen who has had the good fortune as well as the intellectual capacity to achieve a university degree? Two subsidiary questions arise here.  Why should one university with an electorate of 15,000 elect three Senators while the <Col N="646" /> other, with an electorate more than four times that number, also elect three?  Furthermore is it reasonable to give a Seanad vote to a graduate whose degree is awarded by a university while withholding it from a graduate whose degree is awarded by the NCEA?</P>

      <P>The Seventh Amendment of the Constitution in 1979 paved the way for a change in this area by providing that provision may be made in the Seanad Electoral Law to allow graduates of other institutions of higher education in the State to be included in the electorate in respect of the Members currently elected by the Universities.  I would welcome the views of the House on this aspect.</P>
      <P>I have touched on many of the areas which must be addressed in considering the whole question of the role and functions of the Seanad.  It will be important to determine whether there is a consensus on what direction we should now take. In an area such as this, it is only through consensus that satisfactory progress can be made.  The Taoiseach has already indicated his willingness to consider constitutional reform in consultation with the other parties, provided there is a general and genuine interest among all the parties to consider change.</P>
      <P>However, I think it only fair to refer also to another statement by the Taoiseach which puts this matter in its current context.  If I may I will quote briefly from the record of the other House.  On 10 March last the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;I want to emphasise that at this stage of our affairs it is the effective management of the economy which must take priority&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In any consideration of the constitutional and legislative provisions <Col N="647" /> relating to the composition, powers and functions of Seanad Éireann, it is useful to put the matter into perspective and to examine the political theory underlying the existence of bicameral Parliaments, that is, those Parliaments with two Houses, and to endeavour to answer the question as to why some countries prefer the bicameral system to the unicameral system.  This question has been described as &ldquo;one of the most controversial in constitutional law&rdquo;.  The answers given to it reflect the diversity of parliamentary institutions. The arguments in favour of bicameralism in a unitary State such as ours are summed up in a report on bicameral Parliaments prepared by the Association of Secretaries General of Parliament and published in 1966:</P>
      <P>The protaganists of a bicameral system invoke an argument which seems to them decisive: the work of legislation has more chance of being done well if it is carried through in two processes, each complete in itself.  A further argument is advanced in favour of a bicameral system.  A single House may be tempted to exploit its omnipotence, above all if it is confronting a weak Government.  Inherent in these arguments in favour of bicameralism are the premises that a second House should have lesser constitutional powers and prerogatives than a popularly elected House and that it should not be constituted and elected in the same way as the first House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Otherwise it would be superfluous as representing the same types of opinion in the same way.  Constitutional powers are, therefore, so bestowed that the Government are responsible only to the first House.  Thus a defeat of the Government, even on an important issue, in the second House, would not <i>ipso facto</i> involve the downfall of the Government.  However, for reasons of prestige and, because they may adversely affect public opinion, Governments dislike defeats in the upper House and so many Constitutions seek to ensure that the <Col N="648" /> Government have a working majority in the second House.</P>
    <P>How then should a second House comport itself if, however, there is a majority in it opposed to the Government of the day?  This has been described and, indeed, analysed by Professor Bernard Crick in his book entitled <i>The Reform of Parliaments.</i> In particular, he refers to the work done by the House of Lords in dealing with the Transport Act of 1947, a Bill which was initiated by the then Labour Government.  He concludes:</P>
    <P>There was a real endeavour by the Conservative Opposition as well as by the Government peers to make constructive amendments.  The Opposition sharply criticised the detail but admitted that the mandate for nationalised transport in some form was definite.</P>
    <P>Professor Crick concludes:</P>
    <P>The passage of the Bill in an efficient form would have been impossible but for the existence of a revising second chamber.</P>
    <P>The second House in such a case, so runs the thesis, should recognise the constitutional superiority of the first House. It should not capriciously obstruct measures for which that first House has a clear mandate and in general should use its own powers constructively and with discretion.</P>
    <P>Assuming then the principle of bicameralism, the next problem seems to be to resolve what should be the composition and selection of the second House.  It has been said of the House of Lords, for example, that if it did not exist it could not be invented.  We in Ireland, however, in common with most other unitary States, have had to invent and the history of the Irish Seanad since 1922 reflects the changing attitudes towards the role of the second House which have manifested themselves from time to time over these past years.  Commissions and parliamentary committees have expressed <Col N="649" /> their views on the best method of choosing a second House and political commentators have waxed eloquent on the subject.</P>
    <P>In all this discussion, however, Sir Kenneth Wheare in his book entitled <i>Legislatures</i> makes what I believe is a very crucial and important point when he states:</P>
    <P>First of all it may be worthwhile to get out of the way a doctrine about the proper function of a second chamber which rests upon an illusion, the notion of a second chamber above and beyond politics composed of eminent gentlemen and ladies of great distinction in various walks of life but politically neuter.</P>
    <P>Professor Wheare continues:</P>
    <P>There is undoubtedly a case for saying that second chambers should contain people who are less dependent upon party considerations and party organisations than are the members of the first chamber.  But if second chambers are to be anything more than debating societies and discussion circles party is bound to come in.</P>
    <P>Professor Wheare concludes:</P>
    <P>The second chamber is invited to give its opinion upon measures and policies initiated and pushed forward by a party government supported by a majority party or a coalition of parties and criticised by a minority party or parties in the first House.  How can it avoid politics and party politics at that and why should it?  A second chamber is part of a political system, its business is politics.  It need not be as partisan as a lower House but it must, unless it is to be completely powerless, express views and take decisions which usually means taking sides on political questions.</P>
    <P>The report of the Seanad Electoral Law Commission 1959 puts the position as follows:</P>
    <P>We would like to emphasise that even if the Seanad was composed entirely of vocational interests elected <Col N="650" /> wholly by vocational organisations it would still, because of the powers and duties vested in it by the Constitution, have to make decisions which are in the fullest sense political.  No alteration in the system of election or the composition of the Seanad can alter this fact.</P>
    <P>Like most democracies the Legislature in Ireland has two Houses, a lower or first House called the Dáil and an upper or second House called the Seanad.  The Dáil consists of Members elected directly by universal suffrage whereas the Seanad consists partly of indirectly elected Members and partly of nominated Members.  The report of the Committee on the Constitution, 1967, interestingly enough, a committee chaired by the late George Colley, TD, and which included such notable Deputies as Seán Lemass, Robert Molloy, Don Davern, Seán Dunne, Denis Jones, T. F. O'Higgins, David Andrews, Gerard Sweetman, James Tully and Senators James Dooge, Michael Kennedy and Eoin Ryan.  They asked themselves the question: &ldquo;Is the Seanad necessary?&rdquo; and stated:</P>
    <P>While Constitution-makers and political theorists seem in general to prefer a bicameral legislature the problem of devising the perfect second chamber has proved to be almost insoluble</P>
    <P>&mdash;as the Minister for the Environment has said.</P>
    <P>There is no formula which is likely to be acceptable to all people.  However, the recognition of the fact that perfection cannot be achieved has not, however, deterred the majority of countries from making the attempt to devise some system which is considered to be at least of some utility in their special circumstances.</P>
    <P>The 1967 committee concluded:</P>
    <P>We are satisfied that what most countries expect in providing a second House is that they will thereby have a safeguard against ill-considered or hasty action on the part of the first House.  A second group of public representatives <Col N="651" /> will have the opportunity of examining legislation and commenting upon it.  The first House will thereby be given time for reflection on the utility of the measures which it has proposed.  Furthermore, a reasonable opportunity will be given to affected interests to organise public opinion in relation to controversial matters.  In addition, important technical matters may receive in the second House more comprehensive treatment than it has been possible to give them in the first House.</P>
    <P>James O'Reilly and Mary Redmond in their book <i>Cases and Materials on the Irish Constitution</i> have this to say;</P>
    <P>The Seanad has made valuable contributions to legislation in this country in recent times.  Such notable examples of these contributions include The Redundancy Payments Bill, The Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill and the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Bill.</P>
    <P>&mdash; the various Bills referred to by Senator Ross.  Then of course there was the Dentists Bill, 1985, the first such Bill introduced into this country since 1928, a Bill which was initiated in this House and much amended here and which on 2 May 1985 was passed by Dáil Éireann exactly as it left the Seanad, a comprehensive Bill consisting of eight Parts, 68 sections and two Schedules, a Bill which has now paved the way for the establishment of a new era in Irish dentistry.  Therefore, as Members of this House, we welcome the decision of the Government and of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to introduce the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987, every aspect of which I am sure will be closely monitored and scrutinised by Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>The principal provisions relating to the present Constitution, as Senator Murphy has said, are set out in Articles 18 and 19 of the 1937 Constitution.  There are, of course, many other clauses in that Constitution which relate to the powers and functions of the Seanad.  The report of the Committee on the Constitution, 1967, <Col N="652" /> again states that the whole framework of the Constitution would have to be examined, not alone Articles 18 and 19.  I do not want to be unfair to the report of the Committee on the Constitution, 1967, but I have not that exact quotation.  The report goes on:</P>
    <P>If the Seanad were to be abolished it would be necessary to go through the Constitution from start to finish and to make alternative provisions for all those safeguards resting upon the existence of the Seanad which are already contained therein.</P>
    <P>This report concludes:</P>
    <P>If the Seanad is to be retained it does not necessarily have to remain unaltered in matters relating to its composition and method of election.  In this connection we think it necessary to find out, first of all, that the Constitution, as at present drafted, affords extreme flexibility in its basic provisions relating to the Seanad such as the composition and strength of the panels, the nature of the electorate, the method of voting and, indeed, the timing of the elections. A great many fundamental changes in relation to the Seanad can, therefore, be brought about simply by the enactment of ordinary legislation without any change in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, recommend that the following reforms, which can be enacted without any change in the Constitution should be carried out immediately: (1) Governments should launch Bills in the Seanad in sufficient numbers so as to avoid the bottleneck just before the summer and Christmas recess which leaves the Seanad with too little time to execute its revising function properly; (2) that the electorate in respect of the election of the 43 Senators, referred to by the Minister on the five panels, should be indeed expanded to include not only the members of county councils and county borough councils but also the members of every borough council, urban district council and town commission because I <Col N="653" /> believe, like the Minister for the Environment, emphatically in the wisdom and contribution made by our local councillors who, more than anybody else in this country, know the needs and the requirements of their local people; (3) the Seventh Amendment of the Constitution Act, 1979, allows for a change in the election of the six university members of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The 1979 Act inserted a new paragraph 2 in Article 18.4 so that Article 18.4.2 now envisages the franchise being extended to include other institutions of higher education and other third level colleges as may be fixed by law.  Under Article 18.4.2 a member or members of Seanad Éireann may be elected by, as stated in the Constitution, &ldquo;institutions grouped together or by a single institution&rdquo;. I urge the Minister for the Environment to introduce the appropriate legislation to give effect to this provision in the Constitution and I hope that the movers of this motion will welcome the extension of the third level Seanad electorate and the widening of the franchise to include graduates of other third level institutions.</P>
    <P>It was Lord Bryce who said the second House has four major functions: (1) the function of revision of legislation; (2) the function of initiation of legislation; (3) the function of inter-position of delay; and (4) the function of debate on important issues.  Under these headings I believe that Seanad Éireann has made a valuable contribution to the development and advancement of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with other Senators in welcoming the Minister for the Environment to the Seanad to discuss this fundamental motion.  It is over 20 years since I was elected to the House.  When I started off I had some experience in politics in Donegal and perhaps I should give my qualifications.  I have been elected to Donegal County Council five times.  I headed the poll five times, if that is not too much of a boast, against Members of the other House and I never went for <Col N="654" /> membership of the other House.</P>
      <P>I want to compliment the movers of this motion.  Senators Ross and Murphy, because it is proper to give this opportunity to Seanad Members especially when the purpose of having a Seanad is under attack.  It is great to have an opportunity to discuss here the justification for having the Seanad.  The first observation I should like to make to Senator Ross is that one of the greatest problems we have in this island is that of trying to make politics work in the part of the island I am fairly close to and have to travel through to get to my base.  I have some knowledge of how important it is to try to make politics work in that part of the country.  People in this part of the island would spare no effort, and there is no contribution they would not make, to get politics to work in the North of Ireland.  It is very hard to contrast that with proposals in this House suggesting that politics should be taken out of the House.  I find it difficult to understand, because when I first came into the Seanad and was feeling my way politically, I looked at the Seanad and asked: what is wrong with the Seanad and what is right with it?</P>
      <P>I found it very hard to keep an interest in it because of the attitudes of people I thought would have more knowledge and more experience than I.  The Dublin based professor and barrister, the people who led the posse in the House, got up and made their contribution, went out to the stenographer and corrected it.  They made sure their contribution got across to the media and then they went across the river and attended to their business. I formed an impression that these were the people who were making the running in the Seanad, whether they were professors or barristers, and there were a number of them.  They were the people who created the outward impression of the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was not the national intention for the Seanad to be administered in that way.  I felt that the people who made a contribution, went elsewhere to look after their business for part of the day and came back to see how things went <Col N="655" /> during the day, were making a casual input.  I say to Senators Ross and Murphy that I try to understand their attitude to the Seanad and I sympathise with it to some extent, but when they say the voting system should be taken out of politics and local authority members should not have an input, they show that they have very little knowledge of local authorities.</P>

      <P>The two Senators have not had 27 years, as I have had, of being a member of a local authority, vocational committee, county committee of agriculture, a regional technical college and numerous other bodies such as school management boards and spending most of my time attending meetings.  I would class myself as a fairly average rural representative. I certainly am not ahead of the average public representative from any political party in counties Donegal, Mayo, Kerry or any other part of the country.  Rural Senators especially have a very serious commitment to public life. The impression I get is that a Senator who is based in Dublin gets off lightly because he could cover the whole area in half an hour on a bicycle.</P>
      <P>Apart from the few acquaintances they have within their profession Senators based in Dublin would not know 100 people, whereas somebody from rural Ireland would have to be able to name a person he meets on the street and to understand his problems.  It is a totally different involvement.  I am very friendly with a man in County Donegal who always gives the impression that he is above politics, but mentally he always makes a little recording.  He gives politicians more to do than those who are easily identified as politicians.  There is a good bit of that in it as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were to take away the involvement of local authorities we would be <Col N="656" /> moving away from the grass roots completely. With the indulgence of the Leas-Chathaoirleach I will give the House an example of a County Donegal problem. We had an arts committee and the artists suggested that they should be involved in the nomination and selection of Members of the Seanad.  The council members selected a regional development organisation. They formed a technical committee and the technical committee formed an arts committee.  If somebody disappeared from the technical committee, the RDO or the arts committee, we did not know where to go to get a democratic nomination back to the arts committee.  That is the kind of suggestion being made here, that the nominating bodies should be widened, that there should be a wider base and many more people should be involved.  I do not know where one would stop.</P>
    <P>There is a fairly large list of nominating bodies at present.  Many of them have not used their nominations.  Would it make the Seanad more democratic if that change took place?  I would like to think that the selection, nomination and final vote will be kept pretty near the grass roots.  I have been elected to the Seanad on seven occasions.  Everybody complains when they are standing for the Seanad that it is a fairly rough journey. Nevertheless, it does not stop them as there are generally two candidates for every seat.  With regard to the people involved in the Seanad election, if a council member had not got a vote &mdash; I know one council member who lost a vote &mdash; he would feel seriously disadvantaged. I do not consider that it would be an improvement to change the system of election and take the franchise from local councillors.  If we did that, we would be making the Seanad more undemocratic and then it would be entitled to be questioned.</P>
    <P>The difficulty about the Seanad is that of communication.  Many improvements could be made.  I will suggest one improvement if there is a review of the Seanad which I believe will be welcomed generally.  The voting system could be regionalised on a geographical basis in <Col N="657" /> smaller areas and a Senator based in Cork would not have to travel to Donegal, Cavan or Monaghan.  That aspect of it might be looked at.  Otherwise the system of panels, the system of qualifying for panels, is reasonably good.  It might not be perfect but the system that might be put in its place would have to be looked at very seriously.  The present system involves those members of the community who have been elected and they are certainly as near the grass roots as possible.</P>
    <P>The question of having a more efficient Seanad should be considered.  I would like to see the introduction of Question Time in the Seanad so that one could ask questions about what was happening.  At present Members have to go to Dáil Deputies and ask them to get information. It would be helpful if Question Time was available for Seanad Members. My two recommendations are: the facility for asking questions and the possibility of having smaller regions.  These are two simple areas that could be looked at.  Basically the Seanad works pretty well if it is not completely hogged by a few people who believe they are more qualified than others, that their elocution is better, that they are better equipped and that their research facilities are better. The Seanad is very convenient actually. Some people can run their businesses from within the Seanad whereas most of us cannot.  Most of us have to put up with the criticism levied at Seanad Members from rural Ireland who have to claim substantial travel expenses.</P>
    <P>The criticism about those Senators who incur very substantial travelling expenses is totally unjustified because there are other ways in which one could run up equally as big a bill.  If some Senators administer their business largely from this House, they can use the phone continuously and use the facilities of this House.  If we are having a good hard look at the Seanad we could look at that aspect of it as well.  A review of the Seanad is timely.  It would be welcomed by most people but let us get at every aspect of it, not just how it should be run and how the elite few could be more involved.  The <Col N="658" /> whole country is interested in the future of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The Minister's contribution has been very useful.  Every Senator here has an opportunity &mdash; and I am grateful for the opportunity &mdash; to look at the changing role of the Seanad, and I hope that this debate will enable us to do that and to refute the criticisms that have been made at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to welcome the Minister and I do not propose to look so distinguished a gift horse in the mouth.  Nonetheless, I am curious <Col N="659" /> as to what role he is fulfilling in this instance.  I understand that the Government Information Services are answerable to the Taoiseach's office.  In his reply, perhaps the Minister will deal with that point.</P>
      <P>As Senators will be aware, there was a saturation advertising campaign in the weeks, particularly in the last week, leading up to the referendum on the Single European Act.  I do not think it is an exaggeration to describe it as a saturation advertising campaign.  I did not take note of the actual column inches involved but they were certainly lavish.  No expense was spared, it could be said, even though our poor country is in a sad situation. Nonetheless, one estimate suggests that the newspaper advertising campaign, as well as the issuing of pretty glitzy leaflets, cost in the region of £350,000.  I have no idea whether that figure is true or false, perhaps it is a minimum, but I think everyone will agree it was an expensive campaign.  However, fundamentally that is not really the point I am making here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am questioning the propriety, if not indeed the legality, of a Government information service pushing a purely party political case.  This was a purely party political case.  The fact that other parties joined themselves, as it were, with the Government in pushing the Single European Act does not take from the partisan nature of the case being made. It was a party political case; and the arguments used, as in, for example, <i>The Irish Times</i> of Monday, 25 May, in a one-third page advertisment published by the Government Information Services, comprising ten points, were extremely tendentious indeed &mdash; in short, propaganda and, arguably misinformation.  The GIS might have been more properly called the GMIS in this case.  Public funds were misused to present this case and I submit that the service transgressed its proper role and that this is a most serious matter. It took place with the tacit approval of the other parties.  In fact, this was one of its more sinister aspects, that we had a tacit collusion of the other parties in this propaganda campaign and there was no <Col N="660" /> substantial protest from the media.  Why should there be?  The national broadcasting service had already been intimidated and the consequence of that intimidation was to be seen quite perceptibly in the altered balance of coverage in the days that followed the meeting in Merrion Street of the RTE executives and the &ldquo;irresponsible Ministers&rdquo;&mdash; I am being informed by the Cathaoirleach, because she ruled that I could not raise this question on the Adjournment because there was no Minister responsible. I can only conclude that the two Ministers who met the RTE executives were irresponsible Ministers.  That having been so, the Government in effect having intimidated the national broadcasting service, we were then left with the printed media to protect our liberites.  But, human nature being what is is, why should the printed media squeal when they were being so lavishly funded?  I am sorry to say this.  I am a great admirer of the Irish press &mdash; with a small &ldquo;p&rdquo;&mdash; but it would have been too much to expect that they would have bitten the hand that fed them &mdash; altogether a most dangerous situation.</P>
    <P>I submit that the Government had no mandate to misappropriate public funds in this way, no mandate whatsoever.  The Single European Act was not an issue in the general election.  I think commonsense and justice would both require us to assent to the idea that, once the Supreme Court made the decision which necessitated a referendum, then, in the interim, as it were, between the Supreme Court's decision and the people's verdict, on the subject matter of this referendum the Government's duty was to stand back from this decision of the people and to give fair play to the yes and no sides.  The Government had no reason or no right to pre-empt the outcome or to presume that the outcome would be 70 to 30 or 90 to ten or whatever the case might be.  The people are supreme where a referendum is in question and while a referendum is being decided.  The Government violated that supremacy by taking a partisan stance.</P>
    <P>I cannot pretend that the comparative <Col N="661" /> research I have done in this matter is exhaustive but I have been doing some work on it and I have come up with some very interesting comparative cases.  In the United States of America it seems to be a very clearly established principle, tested through various court cases, that where a state or a municipality is involved in sponsoring a change in the state and municipal law, in that case the courts have decided on more than one occasion that, while the governing authority, state or municipality, as the case may be, have every right to present information on the matter which is at issue in the referendum, they have no right whatsoever to be advocates of a partisan stance on that issue.</P>
    <P>Here, of course, the Americans have a proper concern for the First Amendment, which not only guarantees freedom of expression to the individual, and therefore negatively protects him against the suffocating influence of state opinion, but the First Amendment is also very properly afraid that if you give these powers to governments, where you have a whole colluding, if you like, alignment of parties, there is a very real danger that that government may well, at a future stage perhaps, use these powers to perpetuate itself in office.  I could quote for the Minister cases from the North Eastern Law Reports of the United States where, quite clearly, to take a random example, the law laid down that in one case, <i>Anderson v.  the City of Boston,</i> a municipality has no authority to appropriate funds for the purpose of taking action to influence the result of a referendum proposed to be submitted to the people at a State election. There are quite interesting parallels here.  The court lays down that the outcome cannot be pre-empted, especially with the expenditure of public funds.</P>
    <P>To move nearer home, in 1975 the United Kingdom Government, as the House will be aware, had a referendum which really was about the question of approving or reapproving the terms which had been negotiated.  If I may I will quote from a compendium of English legal cases called <i>Public Law</i> 1975.  Here again a Government information unit <Col N="662" /> was set up, but the Government had decided that enough was known about the matter and enough was being said about the matter by other agencies in the whole forum of public opinion that it was not proper for the Government itself to enter the arena and to take a partisan stance.  Moreover &mdash; and this was something which did not happen in our referendum &mdash; the Government took care that every household should receive at public expense a single document explaining each of the opposing views on the referendum.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that we have here in these two western democracies a proper concern for the propriety of a government maintaining their distance where the people have to make a decision.  Alas, when we return home, we have not observed that distance ourselves.  But &mdash; and I come to another context, our own historical context &mdash; what makes this issue very grave again is that this is the first time, as far as I can establish, that the Government Information Services have misbehaved in such a way.  In 1972, in the great debate on our entry into the EC, while there were advertisements from An Bord Bainne and the Pigs and Bacon Commission which, by the way, caused adverse comment among the anti-entry people, there certainly was no use of the Government Information Services. Neither was there in 1979, on the amendment which dealt with university representation and with adoption, except that, because there was a postal strike at the time, a certain minimum amount of information was presented.  Finally, the Government Information Services were not used either in the case of the pro-life referendum or in the case of the divorce referendum.</P>
    <P>Therefore, this is an unenviable first. We are seeing a dangerous new departure. Newspaper space is being bought with taxpayers' money, including taxpayers opposed to the amendment, with the result, if not the intent, of drowning out the voice of dissidents with their own money.  That is the cynical gist of the matter.  The main Opposition parties have connived at this exercise.  The whole <Col N="663" /> thing is a salutary lesson in the fragility of truth and justice in a democracy and how frighteningly quickly they can become casualties of Government propaganda.</P>
    <P>This is no mere academic debate.  If something like this occurs again, I hope fervently that the courts will have an opportunity to pronounce on its propriety and to pronounce moreover on whether those responsible should be liable to surcharge for the misuse of public funds.  Go raibh maith agat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>To refresh the Senator's memory and the Seanad's memory of the 1972 referendum campaign, I ran that campaign on behalf of our party; Deputy FitzGerald ran it on behalf of the Fine Gael Party.  During that campaign for accession, in which we secured 83 per cent of the vote, there was literature of a similar kind made available from public sources advocating our very strong case for entry into Europe and accession to the European Community Treaties on the basis of Ireland's national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to mention that in order to establish that there was no precedent involved in what happened recently.  What happened recently was in direct line of succession to the attitude by the Government at that stage in 1972, when in the Department of Foreign Affairs and throughout the whole Government apparatus at that time we felt so strongly about the need for Ireland to be within the European Community, a confidence and a decision that have been justified since, that we participated very strongly in securing an 83 per cent result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We adopted exactly the same procedure on this occasion.  I want to emphasise that to the Seanad and to Senator <Col N="664" /> Murphy.  We in the Department of Foreign Affairs &mdash; that is why I am dealing with this matter &mdash; prepared similar type information literature.  There were similar type advertisements in newspapers. We believe that was essential in the national interest now as it was then.  That has been the consistent stance since 1972 resulting in the successful referendum result then and a successful referendum result recently.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly also that the Irish people, leaving aside what I have just said, should not be in any way subjected to dictatorship by a minority, that there is a majority point of view that has to be put in a reasonable and balanced manner. If the literature issued by my Department, which I stand over fully on behalf of the Government, or any other literature issued by the Government is examined closely, it is unbiased literature, unbiased publicity, stating the positive national advantages to be gained by our continuation and intensification of our involvement within the European Community for which the Irish people opted by an 83 per cent vote in 1982.  That again was approved by a 70 per cent vote recently.</P>
    <P>These figures in terms of public support cannot be denied.  I do not believe that the Irish people are susceptible to propaganda and I would not dream of trying to in any way influence them in that way because I know that would be counterproductive. In so far as there was any propaganda excess &mdash; I do not want to go into the details of it because it is all water under the bridge; I like to see elections gone and on to next business &mdash; but I will give, as a practising politician, a value judgment on propaganda excess.  In so far as there was any propaganda excess during the recent referendum campaign, that propaganda excess lay fairly and squarely at the feet of the people who advocated &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  Some of their unattributed posters were disgraceful and reminded me of excesses of a very antidemocratic kind, both in regard to politicians and to their behaviour.  I will go no more into it than that: that the basic poster in their campaign was a poster that <Col N="665" /> lent discredit to the political profession, that if the politicians say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; then vote &ldquo;no&rdquo;&mdash; an unattributed poster which is a key poster right through the whole theme.  When I examine the sort of people, ranging from the extreme right with their zealatory religious, zealatory extremeism, to the extreme left of Communist extremeism, with an odd sensible person like Senator Murphy thrown in, when I see that sort of hotch-potch presented as an alternative advocacy to what was basically and is a sensible case, I think it is important that the sensible consensus middle case be presented to Irish people.</P>
    <P>I suppose we can all complain about our political leaders and our political parties, but I do not think the combined wisdom in this respect of the political leaders of the Fianna Fáil Party, of the Fine Gael Party, of the Progressive Democrats and of the Labour Party can be discounted in as facile a manner as Senator Murphy suggests or as Senator Ryan suggests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that he may say that is an <i>argumentum ad persona</i> but when you consider the parties and the personnel they represent throughout the country it gives a presentation of reason and commonsense.  I feel that that reason and commonsense were reflected in the public endorsement of the situation.</P>
      <P>Coming back to the terms of Senator Murphy's question, one is driven to the conclusion that there is an obligation &mdash; and I want to be very serious about this &mdash; on the State and on the Government acting on behalf of the State to give the case of the reasonable person.  The results in 1972 and in 1987 show that the reasonable person within the Irish public wants us to remain involved in the European scene from the industrial, commercial, agricultural, tourism, cultural and, you name it, points of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other issues that were being dragged into this matter, such as the morality and military issues, were extraneous <Col N="666" /> issues that had no relevance whatever. Of course, when Sellafield was introduced you had the end product of stupidity. The Sellafield power plant in Britain has nothing whatever to do with our involvement within Europe.  Whatever we can do about that &mdash; and it is very little, as we know from today's newspapers &mdash; can only be done within the context of the European Community.</P>
    <P>The amount of hot air dishonesty that was generated during this campaign on behalf of people advocating a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote was something I have never seen over a long number of years in public life.  I can understand the sort of attitude that was generated in 1972 in opposition to entering Europe, but now we have been totally involved in Europe for 15 years.  We are part of the institutions, part of the decision-making process, major recipients from it &mdash; and I leave that deliberately low on the order of priority &mdash; and overall plus benefactors from it and are enabled to continue in that position to a greater extent by reason of the single internal market and everything that flows from it in the way of transfer of funds back to us.  I do not want to go over the debate that took place, but the sort of argument against all that was so negative, so self-destructive, so defeatist, so small, so antagonistic to everything that I believe our people are capable of, that I certainly felt very strongly about the matter and my only criticism of the campaign for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote is that it was too restrained. With regard to the Government literature that was issued in leaflet form, through newspapers and in any other manner, in my view our whole campaign was too restrained.  I thought we leaned over backwards in fairness to allow all of these people to express a point of view and probably it was good for Irish democracy that we allowed that.</P>

      <P>The Supreme Court decided that it should be by way of referendum and we acknowledge that process and in all humility we allowed these people to proceed with their case.  It was only in the latter weeks of the campaign that we decided that the case being made against our entry into Europe was full of misstatements, misinformation, disinformation, compiled by a hotch-potch of people who actually said outside churches that &ldquo;I saw that Our Blessed Lady advocates &lsquo;no&rsquo;,&rdquo; and that was being said side by side with people who were advocating a blantant &ldquo;no&rdquo; on the basis of totally left wing arguments &mdash; it reminded me of the old circular theory of politics, where you had the extreme Left and the extreme Right meeting each other at the bottom of the circle which enabled very strange people to join together in a common endeavour against the ordinary, decent instincts of the Irish people.  The ordinary, decent instincts of the Irish people from day one in this matter were for continuing membership of a Community to which they had committed themselves back in 1972 and that this Single European Act was a logical extension of that commitment, and it so proved itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point at this stage in Senator Murphy or anybody else in the Seanad suggesting that in any way the people were propagandised into this effort.  The people decided for themselves. Whatever effect election material of one kind or another, for or against <Col N="668" /> ratifying the Single European Act had was, in my humble view, simply marginal.</P>
    <P>What the State did was legitimate: we decided that the misinformation and disinformation being purveyed by people of the extreme Right and the extreme Left for their own illicit interests should not be allowed to continue and that it was important that the silent majority be heard.  We decided, as a Government representing the four major political parties in the State to represent a view of the silent majority and to put their rational case to the Irish people in the form of literature that I stand over now, and will stand over, as being literature which I carefully supervised personally, even though the ultimate cost is borne by the Stationary Office.  I claim a supervisory position and that is why I am answering this case.  I challenge any member of the Seanad here to read any item of the literature emanating from the Department of Foreign Affairs.  It is legitimate literature setting out the rational balanced case for our membership and is the point of view represented by the great silent majority of the Irish people.  They voted 83 per cent for it in 1982.  They voted 70 per cent to 30 per cent recently.</P>
    <P>That is the sort of pragmatic expression that is important.  That is government by the majority for the majority.  That is not dictatorship by the minority, whether it is represented by Senator Murphy, Senator Ryan, or other minority people in this House or outside this House.  Whether of the extreme Right or the extreme Left, these people are entitled to make their point; but they must be acknowledged and recognised as representatives of a very small minority in our community.</P>
