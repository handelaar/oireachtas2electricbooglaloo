      <P>I have notice from Senator Nuala Fennell that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The severe underfunding of the Council for the Status of Women which represents 250,000 women and 55 affiliated organisations.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Donie Cassidy of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Government to restore Lough Sheelin Lake to its former pollution free state.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator John Connor of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to reveal his attitude to the proposal of the Western Health Board to confirm the size of Roscommon County Hospital at 100 acute surgical-medical beds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Fennell, Cassidy and Connor as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Fennell's motion and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.  Senators Cassidy and Connor <Col N="1152" /> may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>I accept the Order of Business but could the Leader of the House inform us whether it is intended to complete Second Stage of the Video Recordings Bill today because some of us who want to make contributions may not be able to do so during the time afforded.  I hope he will agree that Second Stage should not be completed today.  Otherwise I accept the Order of Business and I thank the Leader of the House for item No. 1.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that I should express delight at the appointment of Catherine McGuinness as the chairperson&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have a very mundane question.  Are we continuing from 1.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. or is there an adjournment? In other words are five hours or four hours being allocated for the Video Recordings Bill?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he has noticed item No. 11 on the Order Paper, which has gone down in the past two days.  Have the Government any intention of abolishing the death penalty and have they any intention of giving Government time in the Seanad for this Bill.  There is a real problem about this Bill because it was raised by the last Government and it was talked out by them with a slightly ambiguous pose on the death penalty.  I would like to know whether the Government <Col N="1153" /> will give us time to debate the abolition of the death penalty or whether they will take a stand for or against it.  I do not want to see this on the Order Paper for five years with nothing happening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the announcement by the Minister for the Environment last week of the transferring of the Local Loans Fund from public to private funding could I ask the Leader of the House if time will be allocated for the House to discuss this?  This is a vital matter particularly for those people who are earning less than £10,000 a year who are now told they will have to go to the private sector for funding. This can be very serious as interest rates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not know what way to respond to <Col N="1154" /> Senator Cregan's request for a debate on the Local Loans Fund because we debated the Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Bill in the Seanad yesterday.

      <P>I will notify the Whips at lunchtime on the situation regarding tomorrow.  We will not be giving Government time to item No. 11.  Thirteen Bills have been introduced during this session of the Seanad, the largest number of Bills introduced in any election year.  This equals the greatest number of Bills ever introduced in the Seanad in a year.  We will continue to introduce Bills and it is not intended that item No. 11 will be given Government time.</P>
      <P>Senator Ferris asked about item No. 4. It is intended that sufficient time will be given to Second Stage of the Video Recordings Bill to give everybody an opportunity to discuss it.  However, if the debate breaks down today we can extend it to some other day.  We can break from 6 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. if that is the wish of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That, notwithstanding Standing Order 41, the following arrangements shall apply to the debate on a non-Government motion in the names of Senators whose group does not exceed three members &mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the time allowed for the debate shall not exceed one and a half hours;</P>
      <P>(ii)  the speech of the proposer shall not exceed 20 minutes and he (or some other Senator authorised by him who has not already spoken) shall be entitled to ten minutes for a speech in reply;</P>
      <P>the speech of each other Senator shall not exceed ten minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At their last meeting the Committee on Procedures and Privileges decided that Labour Senators should be given an entitlement to non-Government time, Private Members' Time, but that in view of their small numbers this entitlement should be halved to one and a half hours. <Col N="1156" /> Without this motion a debate on a Labour Party motion would automatically be entitled, under Standing Order No. 41, to the full three hours.  This was not the intention.  The purpose of this motion is to regularise the position and to adapt the relevant Standing Order accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Leader of the House and the other group leaders in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for the facility they have afforded the Labour Party to participate in Private Members' Time in this House.  I accept the conditions laid down as being fair and I want to thank the Members on both sides of the House for facilitating us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with this motion but it is a dangerous precedent to barge through Standing Orders for the sake of one party in the House.  Suppose one Member of the Fianna Fáil Party in this House defected to the Progressive Democrats, God forbid that it might happen&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;would it be appropriate to give that single Member of the Fianna Fáil Party, because he represents a larger party in the Dáil than the Labour Party, Private Members' Time?  What we have got to decide is what criteria we use. We have Standing Orders and we are ignoring Standing Orders by passing this motion.

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Air Navigation and Transport Bill, 1987:" RHead="Second Stage">
    <Title>Air Navigation and Transport Bill, 1987: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport (Mr. Lyons) Denis Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport (Mr. Lyons)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Air Navigation and Transport Bill, 1987, was initiated in Seanad Éireann on 1 October 1987 for the purpose of facilitating its early consideration by both Houses of the Oireachtas and, hopefully, enactment into law before the end of this year.</P>
      <P>The Bill gives a clear indication of public policy to promote the greatest possible security and safety of civil aviation in the country and aims to provide a firm legal base for implementing that policy.  The Bill is the outcome of a thorough review of the Air Navigation and Transport Acts, 1936 to 1986 in the light of experience both here and abroad, and it makes a wide range of robust &mdash; but nevertheless necessary &mdash; new provisions designed to safeguard Irish civil aviation in the years ahead.  Ireland's airspace and airports are as secure and safe as the best in the world and, with the enactment and full implementation of the Bill they should remain so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, of course, no room for complacency where the security or safety of civil aviation is concerned.  I can, therefore, assure the House that the Minister for Tourism and Transport and I will vigorously pursue the attainment of even higher standards wherever possible &mdash; and take prompt action where proper standards are not being met &mdash; and that, <Col N="1158" /> notwithstanding the severe difficulties facing the Exchequer in the foreseeable future, adequate financial resources will continue to be made available for the updating and re-equipment of air navigation facilities in the country on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>As Senators are aware, Irish civil aviation has developed enormously over the past decade, with ever-increasing numbers of persons travelling into and out of the country by air, with the entry of new air carriers and with the increasing variety in the range of air services to and from the country.  For example, only three years ago, some four million air passengers passed through Irish airports. It is expected that in 1987 the figure will be 5 million.  Of these some three and a half million will pass through Dublin Airport alone.  Those are record figures, no doubt boosted by the Government's <i>Ireland in 87</i> tourism programme which reduced access costs for tourists.  I expect these records to be greatly exceeded as a result of the Government's five year development programme for tourism which is now in preparation.  The completion of the European Communities internal market in air transport in 1992 should further increase the volume and range of air services between Ireland and other countries and, we hope, also open up worthwhile new business opportunities abroad for Irish airlines.</P>
    <P>I must say I was disappointed at the failure of the EC Transport Council to agree, in June last, the first steps towards this 1992 deadline.  I am hopeful that the obstacles to progress, the principal one being the Gibraltar question, can be removed by the end of the year if these measures are formally adopted at the forthcoming EC Transport Council in December.  The liberalisation which we are all hoping for could make a vital impact on the 1988 tourist season.</P>
    <P>We obviously need to maximise the benefit to Ireland from all of these developments and we must, therefore, continue to be resolute in safeguarding the interests of air travellers in Irish airspace and on Irish aircraft wherever they may be.  Our civil aviation law must be <Col N="1159" /> fully capable of serving those objectives. The Bill is specifically designed to achieve that.</P>
    <P>The Bill, therefore, substantially updates and strengthens the existing Air Navigation and Transport Acts, 1936 to 1986.  While a comprehensive explanatory and financial memorandum was published with the Bill, it might be helpful to Senators' consideration of the Bill if I briefly outline its main provisions in 12 separate categories.  I should mention that copies of both documents were supplied, on publication, to all Irish airport and aircraft operators, none of whom has made representations on the Bill.</P>
    <P>Briefly, the Bill obliges aerodrome operators and all others doing business at aerodromes to comply with security and safety requirements and gives the Minister for Tourism and Transport specific power to specify and enforce security and safety requirements at aerodromes and in relation to aircraft, sections 5 to 9 and 12 to 16.</P>
    <P>The Bill prohibits &mdash; and provides severe penalties for &mdash; activities which could endanger or disrupt aviation: having certain dangerous articles in aerodromes, aircraft or air navigation installations without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, sections 11 and 17; giving of any false alarm which interferes with the operation of any aerodrome, aircraft, or air navigation installation in the State, section 41; impersonation of &ldquo;authorised officers&rdquo; or &ldquo;authorised persons&rdquo; appointed to perform a variety of inspectoral and other duties under the Air Navigation and Transport Acts, secetion 40.</P>
    <P>The Bill empowers the Minister for Tourism and Transport to prohibit or restrict dumping near aerodromes, so as to obviate danger, etc., to aviation from flocks of birds, section 21.</P>
    <P>The Bill extends the scope of aerodrome by-laws to deal with illegal car parking by providing for the wheel-clamping or removal, etc., of the illegally parked vehicles, section 24; and provides extensive, but necessary, powers of search, etc. of persons and vehicles on <Col N="1160" /> aerodromes, to prevent crime etc., section 31; and enables the Minister for Tourism and Transport to make by-laws for all civil aerodromes and not only for Cork, Dublin and Shannon Airports, as at present, section 25.</P>
    <P>The Bill substantially increases maximum penalties for all offences under the Air Navigation and Transport Acts to deter would-be offenders.  It is proposed to raise these fines from £5-£1,000 to £1,000-£5,000, with or without a term of imprisonment as the court may deem appropriate in the cirsumstances. Details of these are given in pages 7 and 8 of the explanatory and financial memorandum to the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill safeguards the interests of all persons using aerodromes who suffer injury, etc. by requiring all aerodromes to be insured against all public liabilities while in operation or prohibiting the operation of aerodromes if not so insured, section 10.</P>
    <P>The Bill safeguards Exchequer investment in aerodromes against breach of conditions subject to which assistance was given, section 28.  It also secures payment of aerodrome etc. charges due, including cost of dealing with abandoned aircraft, section 30.</P>
    <P>The Bill enables the Minister for Tourism and Transport to decide earlier, within 14 days or less, on airline tariff proposals than present law allows, 21 days wait, section 47.</P>
    <P>The Bill allows fees to be charged for Ministerial authorisation of air services by order, section 46, so as to cover administration costs.  Fees are already chargeable for Ministerial authorisation of air services otherwise than by order.  A total of £10,000 is expected to be recouped for such costs in 1988.</P>
    <P>The Bill enables the Minister for Tourism and Transport to control use etc., of aerodromes, aircraft etc. for dealing with national or other emergencies, section 20.</P>
    <P>The Bill enables the State to ratify a number of protocols to International Civil Aviation Conventions, Parts III and IV of the Bill.  I shall return to these later.</P>
    <P>Civil aviation needs concerted action <Col N="1161" /> between States for its growth and more so for its protection against terrorism which, unfortunately, has assumed an international character.  The formulation and development of international civil aviation security policy and practice has been a major preoccupation both of individual states and of the various international civil aviation organisations, including the International Civil Aviation Organisation and the European Civil Aviation Conference.  Ireland, through my Department, participates fully in the activities of these organisations and through them has had an input into the development of current international standards and practices which, I need hardly add, are implemented to the fullest degree at our own airports.</P>
    <P>In discharging our responsibilities for the security of civil aviation in the State the Minister and I have available to us the valuable advice and assistance of the National Civil Aviation Security Committee, who operate under our aegis.  The committee is chaired by a senior official of my Department and comprises also other representatives of my Department and representatives of the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Justice, Defence, the Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces, Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta and the Irish Airline Pilots Association.</P>
    <P>The committee advise the Government and the civil aviation industry on aviation security policy.  They co-ordinate the various interests involved and are responsible for ensuring that internationally agreed and accepted security measures are implemented at all airports in the State.  These measures, and their application at each airport are subjected to ongoing review and assessment by the committee whose decisions and recommendations are implemented through my Department.  The committee are also responsible for ensuring that suitable machinery is in place to facilitate prompt decision-making and action in the event of a hijacking or other aviation related terrorist activity requiring decision at Government level.</P>
    <P>The committee meet regularly and <Col N="1162" /> have been particularly effective in strengthening security measures at all airports in the country and ensure that procedures and practices conform to the highest standards of international practice. The National Civil Aviation Security Committee fully endorse the provisions of the Bill to promote the greatest possible security and safety of civil aviation in the country.</P>
    <P>In relation to offences against civil aviation generally, Senators may be aware that international law in this regard is governed by the Conventions of the Hague, Tokyo and Montreal which provide a régime of prosecution or extradition for the perpetration of acts of violence against international civil aviation. Ireland is a party to these conventions &mdash; following enactment of the necessary legislation in 1973 and 1975 &mdash; and has participated actively in the preparation, within the forum of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, of a new international legal instrument which will extend the system of extradition or prosecution under the existing conventions to cover unlawful acts of violence at airports serving international civil aviation.  This new instrument is expected to be approved by a diplomatic conference of states in early 1988 and we hope to bring forward the necessary legislation for its early ratification thereafter.</P>
    <P>International civil aviation also has an important humanitarian and a commercial dimension for which the Bill makes provision.  Following the shooting down by USSR military aircraft of a Korean Airlines 747 in USSR airspace on 1 September 1983, an Extraordinary Session of the Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation was convened at Montreal in 1984, at which a protocol to amend the convention was adopted.  That protocol, which has been fully supported by Ireland, obliges contracting states to the convention to refrain from the use of weapons against civil aviation in flight but does not prejudice the right of states to shoot down <Col N="1163" /> aircraft when acting legitimately in self-defence. Early ratification by Ireland is, therefore, most desirable in order to secure sufficient ratifications &mdash; 102 &mdash; to bring it into force at an early date.  New legislation is required to enable Ireland to ratify the protocol and sections 36 to 38 of the Bill provide accordingly.  So far, over 30 states &mdash; including seven EC states &mdash; have ratified that protocol.  The seven EC states are Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Spain.</P>
    <P>The commercial dimension of international civil aviation is specifically catered for by the 1929 Warsaw Convention, as developed over the years, which provides a standardised international code to govern the documents of carriage, and the liability of carriers for loss or damage in the carriage by air of persons and their baggage and cargo. Ireland and over 100 other states are party to the convention.  The Warsaw Convention was amended by The Hague Protocol in 1955, notably to increase from about £7,500 to about £15,000 the limit &mdash; expressed in Poincaré Gold Francs &mdash; on a carrier's liability for death or injury to a passenger.  The Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1959, gave effect in Irish law to The Hague Protocol.</P>
    <P>Growing dissatisfaction with the liability limits of the Warsaw Convention &mdash; as expressed in the outdated Poincaré Gold Francs &mdash; developed in the following decade and culminated in the drawing up of four protocols to the convention in Montreal in 1975.  The main purpose of the protocols was to substitute special drawing rights of the international Monetary Fund for Poincaré Gold Francs in the Warsaw Convention, The Hague Protocol, and in the 1971 Guatemala City Protocol.  Each of the 1975 protocols must be ratified by 30 states before it can come into force.</P>
    <P>The 1971 Guatemala City Protocol provided for an increase in that liability limit to about £90,000 &mdash; with provision for increases of about £10,000 in the fifth <Col N="1164" /> and tenth years after it comes into force &mdash; and allowed states to establish a supplementary fund to provide extra compensation if they wished to do so.  This protocol has not yet come into force and, as worded, could only do so when it had been ratified by at least 30 states on the condition that the total international scheduled air traffic of the airlines of five states which have ratified it represents at least 40 per cent of the total international scheduled air traffic of the airlines of the member states of the International Civil Aviation Organisation.  In effect, this meant that ratification by the United States of America would ordinarily be required to bring the protocol into force. However, the 1975 Montreal Protocol No. 3 expressly provided that its own ratification by a state would automatically mean ratification of the 1971 Guatemala City Protocol.</P>
    <P>I understand that the US Administration is now moving towards seeking the approval of the US Senate for the four 1975 Montreal Protocols.  Montreal Protocol No. 1 substitutes special drawing rights for Poincaré Gold Francs in the original Warsaw Convention while Montreal Protocol No. 2 makes a similar substitution in the Warsaw Convention as amended by The Hague Protocol. Twenty states &mdash; including seven EC states, namely, Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the UK &mdash; have already ratified both Montreal Protocols Nos. 1 and 2.</P>
    <P>Montreal Protocol No. 3 substitutes special drawing rights for Poincaré Gold Francs in the Warsaw Convention as amended by both The Hague and Guatemala City Protocols.  Eight states &mdash; including four EC states, namely, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and the UK &mdash; have already ratified Montreal Protocol No. 3.</P>
    <P>Montreal Protocol No. 4 relates mainly to the updating of the system for recording carriage of cargo by providing an option for the use of &ldquo;means&rdquo; other than an air waybill, prescribed in the convention as it stands, as a record of the carriage of cargo &mdash; if the consignor <Col N="1165" /> agrees &mdash; to take account of the growing computerisation of the business of carriers and consignors of cargo.  The protocol also provides for the substitution of the special drawing rights to express the liability limits for cargo and operates a strict liability system for cargo, with a certain limited number of specified defences open to the carrier.  The defences are: (a) inherent defect, quality or vice of the cargo; (b) defective packaging of the cargo performed by a person other than the carrier or his servants or agents; (c) an act of war or an armed conflict; and (d) an act of public authority carried out in connection with the entry, exit or transit of the cargo.  Eleven states &mdash; including five EC states, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the UK &mdash; have ratified the Montreal Protocol No. 4.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reminded of a famous statement made in County Clare by a former President.  Several years after being a guest somewhere else he came back and said: &ldquo;As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted.&rdquo;  I was not rudely interrupted but nevertheless we were interrupted somewhat.  I was speaking about the various protocols and conventions.</P>
      <P>The text of the four 1975 Montreal Protocols is set out in the First Schedule to the Bill and the text of the 1971 Guatemala City Protocol &mdash; to which Protocol No. 3 relates &mdash; has been deposited in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in Ireland recognise that there may be outdated elements in the Warsaw Convention but we consider that the basic convention should be upheld and, where possible, improved.  The purpose of the convention is to provide stability in civil air transport worldwide.  The advantages of the systems are the certainty of the liability limits for air transport in the 100 world States.  The carriers have definite knowledge as to their insurance requirements, and the passengers and persons sending goods by air have knowledge of <Col N="1166" /> the liability limits.  Both passengers and senders of goods are also assured of a quicker settlement of claims than by settling through litigation.</P>
    <P>The possibility of getting 100 States to draw up and adhere to a new convention on the same subject is very remote. Accordingly, Ireland, in conjunction with most other European States, is committed in principle to upholding and developing the Warsaw Convention.</P>
    <P>Ireland has given a commitment in aviation related international fora that it would initiate steps as soon as possible to ratify the Montreal Protocols.  There had been a &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo; attitude to the ratification process for several years throughout Europe in anticipation of ratification by the US.  However, as the efforts to ratify by the US Administration did not materialise most of European States decided that they would commit themselves to ratification.  They hoped that, with the assistance of some other world States apart from the US, it would be possible to reach the required 30 ratifications and, accordingly, give effect to the Montreal Protocols.  Most of the European States are now preparing or have prepared the necessary legislation for ratification.  It is essential that Ireland keeps in step.  Part III of the Bill provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>It should be pointed out that the limit of liability for death or injury to a passenger which all Irish air carriers are required to apply in practice is about £90,000, the same basic limit as is provided in Montreal Protocol No. 3. However, there is an obvious need for legislation to copperfasten that limit for all concerned.</P>
    <P>Thus, enactment of the Bill will enable the State to meet its international obligations by ratifying the protocols in question to a number of International Civil Aviation Conventions designed to foster civil aviation throughout the world and, at the same time, safeguard &mdash; and hopefully enhance &mdash; the security and safety of civil aviation in the State.  For those reasons, I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Deputy <Col N="1167" /> Lyons, Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport, my county council colleague, to the House.  Secondly, I welcome this Bill.  As the Minister stated the Bill is the result of long deliberations initiated by the previous Minister Deputy Mitchell.  The Fine Gael Party will support it.</P>
      <P>Obviously it is a very technical Bill dealing with the safety aspect of aerodromes etc., but at the same time it is imperative to realise that it affects every passenger travelling on the world airlines. In recent times there has been a vast increase in the numbers of people travelling. The Minister said the number passing through Irish airports has increased from some four million three years ago to a projected figure of over five million in 1987.  This is an indication of the importance of this legislation.  It is vital to ensure that the highest safety standards operate both on and off aircraft and in particular in the vicinity of aerodromes. Accordingly it is necessary to support the measures put before us this morning.</P>
      <P>When air transport was developing at a serious level 20 and 30 years ago they did not have the problems we have of international terrorism and international hijacking etc. which have increased out of all proportion in recent years.  Accordingly it is vitally important that every possible measure is taken to ensure that these problems are kept at a minimum level.  Therefore, I welcome all sections of the Bill dealing with this matter to ensure that every effort will be made to have the maximum security level at aerodromes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now deal specifically with some of the Minister's comments this morning. He stated it was necessary to ensure that the Irish authorities participate fully with international authorities in ensuring the maximum safety levels for passengers and for aircraft.  I fully agree with this. He further stated that civil aviation needs concerted action between States for its growth.  It is very important that we continue our involvement with the International Civil Aviation Authority and the European Civil Aviation Conference.  I <Col N="1168" /> believe that good work has come about as a result of our involvement with those two groups.  The Minister mentioned that he consults with the National Civil Aviation Security Committee which comprises representatives of the Departments of Tourism and Transport, Foreign Affairs, Justice and Defence, the Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces, Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta and the Irish Airline Pilots' Association.  Obviously, we must ensure that there is a consensus before any of the measures in the Bill are implemented.  I am sure that the bodies referred to are fully supportive of the legislation brought forward by the Minister.</P>
    <P>None of us doubts that Irish safety levels are up to the highest international standards. Despite that, we must ensure that these standards not only remain at their present high level but improve if at all possible.  From time to time airline passengers are slightly turned off by the implementation of some of the safety measures.  In fact, I was listening to a radio programme yesterday which gave the results of an international survey of air travellers and the main points made by those who frequently use the airlines concerned lack of comfort and an overemphasis on safety and on security.  While I can see their view point we must ensure that security measures continue to be implemented.  It would take only one major accident or mistake to have everybody crying out about lack of security and the need to increase it.  We are on the right road in proposing that the security measures be tightened and that is the line we must continue on.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the important humanitarian and commercial dimension for which the Bill makes provision.  That is also very important.  The Warsaw Convention adopted in 1929 governs the liability of carriers.  Although the convention was admittedly updated since then, the limits on a carriers liability would certainly not be sufficient to deal with what can occur today.  The liability increased from £7,500 to about £15,000 but I do not think it would be sufficient to meet today's demands.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1169" /> At the end of his speech the Minister referred to the fact that the liability limit for death or injury to a passenger on all Irish air carriers is presently about £90,000 which is in agreement with the 1971 Guatemala City Protocol.  He stated that there was an obvious need for legislation to copperfasten this £90,000 limit and I certainly agree with him.  That is why the passage of this Bill is very important.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the response of the aviation authorities to the shooting down of the Korean airline in 1983.  They adopted the Montreal Protocol which obliges contracting states to the convention to refrain from using weapons against civil aviation in flight but does not prejudice the right of the State to shoot down aircraft when acting legitimately in self defence.  This is very important but you wonder from time to time how seriously do the more authoritarian states take a Protocol.  It would be very satisfactory if there were more power to ensure that such action could not be repeated.  Unfortunately, I feel we will hear more about such incidents in the years ahead.  In dealing with countries where the values and respect for democratic systems are not very high, it is only to be expected that we will run into more problems similar to those which we meet in 1983.  However, there are no measures we can take to ensure that tragedies like this will not occur again.  Perhaps the Montreal Protocol of 1984 will, at least, ensure that should a similar dreadful happening occur we will be able to say it was in absolute contradiction of an international law and act accordingly.</P>
    <P>Section 24 deals with unlawful parking at our national airports.  It is important to ensure that the authorities at those airports are in full control of the situation on the ground and have full knowledge of all parking within the vicinity thereof. It is proposed to extend the powers presently operating in the State aerodromes to the non-State aerodromes. The three major State aerodromes are at Cork, Dublin and Shannon.  There has been an increase in the number of minor <Col N="1170" /> aerodromes in operation within the State. Therefore it is important to ensure that the powers to deal with difficulties are extended to the non-State aerodromes.</P>
    <P>Section 10 deals with the insurance aspect of the aerodromes.  This is very important because of the numbers passing through the aerodromes on an annual basis.  It is vital to insist that proper insurance liability exists in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister said Ireland was committed to upholding and developing the Warsaw Convention.  The development of the Warsaw Convention is the most important aspect of that statement because undoubtedly the original 1929 convention does not go far enough.  The development of this convention will go hand in hand with the ratification of the Montreal Protocol.  As most European states are preparing to have these protocols implemented, it is necessary for us to do so and obviously I support that fully.  I hope that as a result air transport will become safe not just on a technical level but also safe against the scourge of terrorism in the air which unfortunately has increased to levels unknown in previous years.</P>
    <P>I hope the enactment of this Bill will show the European Communities that we in Ireland are playing our part fully in trying to ensure that international air transport is as safe as possible.  I hope the countries which have not as yet initiated legislation to ensure the passing of the Montreal Protocol will take cognisance of the fact that countries such as Ireland are beginning to do so.  The full implementation of the Montreal Protocol by the majority of European states will help to ensure that our air travellers will be more secure in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  The previous speaker covered many of the basic points and there is no point in going over them again as we have a great deal of legislation to get through today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I full agree with the various points the Minister raised in the Bill.  The 1929 convention is a long way back.  I agree with the Minister that the Irish airlines and <Col N="1171" /> Irish airports have the best standards in the world.  We all know the great reputation of Aer Lingus, our national airline. They are the envy of many airlines all over the world.  Aer Lingus have enhanced the reputation not alone of airlines and airports but of Ireland itself.  It was very fitting for the Minister to open his remarks referring to the safety of our Irish airports and airlines.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note the enormous volume of air passengers that passes through our airports.  An increase of 25 per cent in traffic over the past three years in recessionary times is, indeed, a magnificent pointer to the potential for the future of our airlines and airports. We have a population of three million people.  The increase in traffic from four million passengers three years ago to five million passengers this year or next year is a fantastic achievement especially when one considers that Manchester airport, probably the greatest holiday airport in the UK, had seven and a half million passengers.  This speaks very favourably for the numbers who will use the airports in future.</P>
    <P>A basic plank of the Government's strategy is that tourism is one of the major areas where we can offer a service to the rest of the world, and be better at it than most.  The Irish have a great name all over the world and have made great ambassadors when given the opportunity. They went to the top of their fields in many different categories.  It is from that very base that our airports will play a magnificent part in the future because, as the song says, &ldquo;those who go out can also come back&rdquo;.  They go out and return by air.  The legislation, although brief, is extremely important in various different ways.  I welcome it and hope it has a fairly quick passage through the House this morning.</P>
    <P>Section 21 is designed to eliminate the severe danger and disruption to air navigation caused by flocks of birds going to dumps etc.  No dumps should be sited within the vicinity of an aerodrome.  Birds congregate at dumps and this is extremely dangerous to aircraft.  At what distance <Col N="1172" /> from an airport does the Minister propose to site a dump?  Is it a mile and half, two miles or three miles?  Aircraft are very large nowadays.  Knock airport has brought home to many people the planning requirements of airports for landing a Boeing 747 and all the various aircraft that are required to bring passengers in and out of airports.  A two mile radius at least would be needed particularly in an airport taking in big aircraft like the 747s &mdash; Shannon, Dublin or Cork.</P>
    <P>Now that we have a fourth airport &mdash; and I see a great future for it &mdash; I would like to ask the Minister is it envisaged that Connaught Regional Airport will be included in this Bill in any way.  Is there a difference between State-owned airports and commercial airports?  Because they all take passengers in and out of their airspace, it is important to be safe at all airports.  There was one bad air crash because birds flew into the engines of an aircraft in the past five years.</P>
    <P>Section 24 deals with the unlawful parking of vehicles at airports and refers to Dublin, Cork and Shannon.  I would like to know why Knock is not included in that.  If it could be included it should be, because it is a developing airport and it is an airport that will play a major part in the future for the west of Ireland.  The greatest tourist attraction in the world is religion.  Knock is important to the people of Ireland, and hopefully to the people of America, Europe and all over the world.  In the future it will become as important as Lourdes is.  When you consider Lourdes with over 560 hotels and Fatima with terrific pilgrimage flights and their great importance to the economy of Portugal, Knock will have a lot to offer from the use of the airport for pilgrimages.  It has a massive repeat business and it will be expanding and expanding all the time.  Regarding the car parking facilities and the car parking undertakings that have to be given, unlawful parking is an unacceptable source of danger for persons using aerodromes and disrupts the proper functioning of the aerodromes.  We know the dangers there are in car parking and we know the problems there are in car parking <Col N="1173" /> in the cities.  We know how difficult it is to man these car parks and to make them safe from all sorts of vandals even though there is supposed to be terrific security and restrictions all over the place.</P>
    <P>In relation to the fines of £5 to £1,000, we need to look at that again because £1,000 is totally inadequate for some of the breaches that I visualise under this section.  Breach of ministerial order, £200: is that to be increased to £1,000 or to £50,000?  I am at sea.  The Minister said fines will be increased from £5 to £1,000 and then from £1,000 to £50,000.  For unlawfully flying an aircraft without insurance a fine of £1,000 is totally unacceptable, or even a fine of £50,000.  No one can do a more dangerous thing than fly an aircraft without insurance especially if there were five passengers on it.  It is a small amount when you see later in the Bill £90,000 as the limit for a passenger carried on an aircraft.  You know how far £90,000 would go if a person had a mortgage on his house, an overdraft for his car and three or four in family.  I am appalled to learn that £90,000 is the cover, because we see justifiable higher insurance claims.  For someone to fly an aircraft unlawfully and with six passengers and to have a penalty of only £50,000 is appalling.</P>
    <P>We have references to a breach of ministerial regulations about certificate of insurance, obstruction of authorised officers requiring entry on land, and dangerous flying of aircraft.  Someone could take to the air without having approval from the tower.  Is there a fine of only £1,000 for that, or is there a fine of £50,000 which would be more suitable? It goes on to list unlawful interference, obstruction etc. in regard to apparatus in the facility of the airport.  That is a very important section.  We would like the Minister to expand on it.  The rest of the Bill deals with international protocol which has to be welcomed.  It is a magnificent achievement if 100 countries can get together and agree on any one issue, especially a very important issue such as terrorism.  No one can condone terrorism; it is the enemy of the people of <Col N="1174" /> the world.  I welcome the Bill and I look forward to its speedy passage through this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this Bill.  It is a tremendous achievement as far as it goes.  To get 100 countries to agree on the colour of the paint is a magnificent achievement, never mind getting something written down which people actually sign.  I appreciate what the Minister said: to try to change that or to get a new arrangement is not on.</P>
      <P>I welcome the main thrust of the proposed Act.  A number of things are causing me slight confusion.  It is very important to have a definition of an aerodrome. When we discussed the custom and excise Bill recently I asked: what is an airport and when is an airport not an airport?  I have had some involvement in this area.  I happen to know that there are 56 airstrips in the State.</P>
      <P>I would welcome a list of the aerodromes. It would be useful to have for this discussion.</P>
      <P>I listened to Senator Cassidy talk about Knock airport and asking would it be extended.  My understanding of section 24 or 25, whichever is the appropriate one, was that these regulations could be extended to Knock or any of the other ones.  All we are doing in that section saying that the regulations which are required for State airfields or aerodromes could also and should be extended to other aerodromes.  Do I take it from that, that they will be extended to other aerodromes? It is important to get cleared.</P>
      <P>I have a special interest in Knock because I was the one who arranged the very first flight into it.  I am delighted to see it is proving to be a successful airport. The support and help of the officials of the Department at that time were greatly appreciated in part of a fund raising effort.  The very necessary drawing together of regulations will make the whole area somewhat clearer.  I do not think anybody will oppose this Bill.  No reasonable person could oppose the provisions of the Bill.  I will raise some questions and make some comments which I hope the Minister would respond to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1175" /> The first question I want to raise follows on from what Senator Cassidy was saying about flying without insurance.  I know it is somewhat peripheral to the Bill but the requirements for insurance are very stringent, as they should be.  I have some sympathy with the point raised by Senator Cassidy that the fines seem low on the basis of the amount of damage that could be done and the potential for harm.  There could be cases where companies could handle a larger fine and should pay it.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister explain why, if I want to take somebody, say the Leader of the House, and go flying, I do not need insurance.  I do not understand that.  If every car on the road has to have insurance why should every aircraft not require insurance?  I have heard the argument that planes do not tend to fall out of the sky on top of people but there is more and more leisure flying and there was a case within the last month where a plane nearly fell out of the sky on top of people.  I am not trying to learn everything from a single incident.  Even though the risk is very small and therefore the premiums should not be very high it should be considered by the Minister and the requirement for insurance should be extended to private and leisure time flying as well.</P>
    <P>On the section of the Bill which relates to the regulations required for an aerodrome, I know there are some smaller licensed airfields which are not fully complying with the terms of their licences.  I am talking about the requirements for fire cover.  I have been involved in instances where planes have landed in licensed airfields where there have been no fire arrangements which should have been there by virtue of their licence.  The reason I raise this is because in section 6 there are important requirements being built in.  Are we going to police those? How will they be policed?  Can we be assured that they will be policed in a way that will prove to be effective?  There are many airports, particularly Waterford, Sligo and Galway, which act absolutely <Col N="1176" /> correctly and are providing an important service.  I presume they are not aerodromes under this Bill.  Maybe they are but I think they are just licensed airfields. I am talking about much smaller ones than that, where there are licences.  I would ask that it be done for the sake of protecting the paying passenger but also we should look at people who are involved in flying for other reasons.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 10 and the need for insurance policy for public liability, I would ask that it should be considered as something that private, foreign or leisure time flyers should also have to have.  We would not be talking about a very high premium because the risk of hitting a third party would be slim.  What about the third party in the aeroplane?  If it is the aeroplane owner who is piloting the plane and there is somebody with him or her, what kind of cover extends to that person if any?  I do not think there is any at the moment.</P>
    <P>I have a problem with section 10 (3). There may be a good reason for it.  I ask the Minister to explain it in his reply.  It is required that a licence will be deemed to be revoked if insurance lapses.  It should not be an offence for an aircraft operator to operate a commercial flight to such an aerodrome until and unless the Minister has promulgated the fact of its licence having lapsed.  In other words, if I am operating an advertised, commercial flight from aerodrome A to aerodrome B and the insurance on aerodrome B has lapsed and I have no way of knowing that, it seems that I could be a victim of circumstances totally outside my control. I agree that where insurance lapses the licence should lapse as well but there should be some requirement on the Minister to make it known by way of statement. There should be some way of communicating that information.</P>
    <P>Section 22 deals with the investigation of accidents.  I agree that section 22 should be wide ranging.  It says it is to cover any event or circumstances likely to threaten the safety of any aircraft or any person.  That seems very wide ranging. Is this an investigation after the event?  If that is the case I could understand <Col N="1177" /> the need for it to be wide ranging so that we would not be restricted in what would need to be investigated, but perhaps, in response, the Minister might make that point clear to me.  I agree that the whole area of the investigation of accidents should be wide and broad.</P>
    <P>There is need for a confidential incident reporting system which is used in other countries.  I am sure the Minister and his officials are aware of the system of reporing either in the UK or the US. It is called CHIRP.  I think that is the confidential human incident reporting process.  It allows for the suggestion box idea where pilots who have been involved in dangerous circumstances can report it. I read in the newspapers recently about pilots dozing off on long night flights.  If that happened in a commercial aircraft the pilot would feel troubled about the problems it could create: it could lead to an accident but he might, by virtue of human nature, not be prepared to report that he or she almost fell asleep on the flight.</P>
    <P>There are ways in which this kind of information could be brought to our attention. There is a danger that pilots can doze off on long flights or that in the running of the operation there could be built-in problems we might never get to hear about.  For people to make straight complaints or to make information available to us, may threaten their job security if they have to speak about their own firm or their own activities.  We need to look very carefully at this area to provide a confidential incident reporting system like the CHIRP system.  These things could be brought to the notice of aircraft operators who would then see that pilots or other crew are in danger of falling asleep or have been working for too long and so on.  These systems have worked in other countries.  Aviation personnel should be made aware of what is happening.</P>
    <P>Why do the Department not establish and publish maximum requirements for crew hours and minimum rest periods?  I am sure there is a very good reason for this but it is something I have never <Col N="1178" /> understood.  On the various air navigation orders certain requirements are sought but there should be a set of operating procedures which would be required by the State.  The position at the moment is that carriers have their own set of operational procedures which have to be approved by the Department.  The Department should have certain minimum requirements.  I know the operators of aircraft must include the duty hours and the rest periods which must be approved by the Department.  The different crews from different companies and different operators are operating different requirements.  It is time we pulled this together.  So much has been done in this Bill to pull different activities together but if we do not want a pilot working in straight stretches longer than a certain number of hours then we should say that is a condition for all companies.</P>
    <P>There is another area which has to do with the safety regulations.  I am aware that the cabin crews requirment in commercial aircraft has to do with the safety element of it.  In other words, cabin crews are needed if there has to be an emergency evacuation of the plane or whatever. At the same time, although the operations manual of the different operators has to carry minimum acceptable requirements on the role and hours of work etc. of pilots, there is no protection for the cabin crew.  In other words, the cabin crew could work a 24 hour period and in the event of an incident they are in many ways more crucial than the pilot in terms of what is happening to the passengers and if any difficulties arise.  We should consider looking at the number of hours they work in any one stretch.  I am not talking about glamour or conditions of service.  I am talking here purely of safety.  To sum up that section, even though cabin crews are required under safety regulations there is no maximum requirement in terms of hours worked. We might look at that.</P>
    <P>In section 19 there is a phrase which suggests that the proceedings may be held in private or otherwise.  I accept that. There are times when in the interests of public confidence an investigation might <Col N="1179" /> be heard in private.  I would make one suggestion to the Minister, the wisdom of which he might accept.  Instead of saying that proceedings might be held confidentially, could we add to that that proceedings, or part thereof, might be held in confidence?  In other words, there might be an investigation which it would be in our interest to have in public in the same way as legal proceedings take place, but there might be part of those proceedings which we might prefer to have in private. To allow that to happen we might add to that section that part of the proceedings might be declared confidential.  I would throw that at the Minister and hope that he would respond positively to it.  It is a reasonable approach to the problem.</P>
    <P>Section 30 refers to the detention of an aircraft because its previous owner may not have paid aerodrome charges.  I need to be convinced that that is a fair way of going about it.  If I, in good faith, buy an aircraft from a party and do not realise that there are debts to be discharged on the particular aircraft, and I am running a commercial flight and I arrive at a particular airport and suddenly my aircraft is seized because the previous owner did not pay costs that were incurred through flying that aircraft into the same aerodrome, this is unfair.  There is a civil debt there.  It is a civil liability and it should be pursued in that way.  It seems to me somewhat unfair that somebody who is totally and utterly innocent should suffer. Not only would he or she suffer but the company &mdash; and it could well be a fledgling company &mdash; could suffer and suffer very badly at that point.  It should be processed as a civil debt.  Maybe the Minister would come back to me on that.</P>
    <P>Section 31, on the powers of detention is very wide-ranging.  I am glad it states that in the case of detention or arrest they would have to hand the person over immediately to the Garda.  I agree that these particular people could seek the name, address, business, luggage etc. of suspected persons.  I agree with that completely. In his reply could the Minister explain who the authorised officers here would include?  I suspect it means people <Col N="1180" /> like customs officers, airport police and so on but I would like to have it spelled out for my own information because I would not like it to be any Tom, Dick or Harry.  If we are talking about private security firms <i>et cetera</i> I would certainly want to hear it.  I would not like us to be flinging powers to people over whom we have no control or who have not accountability. They should be people of accountability.  I do not think I should be able to hire somebody as part of a security operation at the airport and then have this person with no qualifications whatsoever with these wide-ranging powers. That would be dangerous and I would like the Minister to come back to that.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the question of air fares.  Deregulation is very topical at the moment.  This allows people to fly everywhere and there is no doubt that fares have come down.  I would make a number of points on this and I hope the Minister will take them on board.  First, I agree with the requirement to reduce the time in which a Minister has to respond to an application for a reduced air fare from 21 to 14 days.  That is acceptable but because it has been reduced could I say to the Minister that there is nothing as annoying as aircraft operators advertising fares which will come into operation next week after the Minister has approved them.  That is absolutely contemptuous.  I would prefer the Minister to drop that section if that can continue.</P>
    <P>I am a great pressure lobbyist and I agree with the whole idea of lobbying and putting pressure on people but there are certain requirements which we need to build into it.  If the Minister has authority to decide on it, he should exercise the authority.  It is misleading advertising to say, &ldquo;as and from 1 December we will be able to fly you to London for £5 return when the Minister has approved it&rdquo;.  That is wrong and incorrect.  All the air carriers have done this and even those from whom we might expect better have done this over the past year.  So this is a case where the Minister should put the boot in because it is wrong that people can come here from other countries and tell us how <Col N="1181" /> to run our business and, in a sense, put the State aside.  This is what I see they have done.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister this very thorny question: are some low air fares, in fact, below cost selling?  I would like to get a response on that.  We have discussed below cost selling and we have come to the conclusion that the consumer does not win on below cost selling.  I feel this about the deregulation of air fares.  I am not wearing my anti-privatisation hat when I make this comment.  I am making it purely from a consumer's point of view. I believe that airlines should have to prove to the Minister that the fare which they intend charging is an economic and realistic fare on the basis of the cost of providing that seat.  I want to give the reason for this.  It is not that I want to deprive people of cheap travel, far from it, but I have looked at what has happened in the US.  What has happened there is this: when deregulation came into operation ten years ago fares went down to rock bottom.</P>
    <P>We are having a precise rerun of it here in Ireland at the moment.  The fares dropped and that is good for the consumer. It is bad for the small company, for this reason &mdash; the large company can afford to take a loss on low cost fares until such time as the small company goes out of business.  They have now reached a stage in the United States where there are five or six huge operators and the smaller companies have all gone to the wall.  Consequently low cost flying is a thing of the past in the US.  In other words, deregulation has eventually led to a higher cost of flying after a period when the fares did go down.  I ask the Minister to take that on board.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we are very much exposed to the huge multinational foreign airline operator who could come in here and operate cheaply.  Let us take the Dublin-London route which is certainly in the top three most lucrative airline routes in Europe, if not in the world.  If somebody wanting to break into that route, a huge multinational with billions of pounds behind them, they could get working in a deregulated situation to run that flight <Col N="1182" /> tomorrow morning and they could run it at such a low cost, taking a loss on it, that they would wipe out the smaller competition. I remember hearing the chief officer of Aer Lingus talking last year about the need for Aer Lingus to build a very close working relationship or to tie itself in with some of the larger European groups.  I see at the moment that two of the big British companies &mdash; I think it is British Airways and British Caledonian &mdash; have joined forces, having the same idea in mind.  What I am afraid of is that we are going down the road to creating four, five or half a dozen huge international airline companies who will have a total and absolute monopoly and will wipe out whatever good we are already getting out of deregulation so that our last position will be worse than our first. I would like a logical movement in that area.</P>
    <P>I have indicated what has happened in the US.  It is the customer who has suffered because of monopolies.  There is a worse service now in the US than there was ten years ago, to the extent that in the recent past the US Government has had to force by regulation some airlines to change their timetables.  The situation has occurred in the US at the moment, with the stacking up of aircraft over various airports and consequent delays in take-offs and landings that companies have advertised flights from a &ldquo;chalks off, chalks on&rdquo; time that have been not only totally and utterly unrealistic, but unattainable. They have said: &ldquo;We will fly you from A to B and you will leave at 10 o'clock and arrive at 11.30&rdquo; and the Government have had to step in and say: &ldquo;That is not possible&rdquo;.  In other words, they have had to stop them advertising in that way.  That is part of what happens when we move down the road of deregulation. I would ask the Minister to take a fairly firm hand in the question of advertising control and of planned deregulation.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the London-Dublin route is the most lucrative one available to us at the moment and one of the top three most lucrative in Europe, if not further afield.  At present, we have three <Col N="1183" /> British Airlines &mdash; British Airways, Danair and Virgin &mdash; flying against two Irish &mdash; 3 to 2 &mdash; out of Dublin, Dublin-London. How many more are we going to allow to move in here?  I am asking a question here.  All the UK operators want to get into the Dublin-London operation. Are we going to allow them in or are we going to make sure that we have control of that particular situation?  This is Thatcher's idea of free and equal competition &mdash; let everybody run everything.  That would allow the large company with large resources to wipe out the Irish operators. We had better just take that on board and remember it.</P>
    <P>For instance, when we were looking for somebody to fly out to Knock, we had this situation.  The Minister and I know that some of the companies who were approached to do that were asking that you would subsidise on a &ldquo;per seat&rdquo; basis the flight from Knock to London.  That flight is now being worked as a commercial profit making operation.  Now other people want to get in on the act.  I am just saying that it is going to be a lucrative London route out of Ireland. We need regulations to deal with that kind of area because deregulation has short term gains for the consumer, has long term losses for the consumer, for the company and for the country.  That should be taken into account.  The Irish carriers have the huge majority of the Dublin-London traffic.  Many of the big UK operators &mdash; this sounds racist but is not meant to be, I am talking about the whole area of employment in the Irish situation &mdash; want to get a slice of that action.  I am just appealing to the Minister to make sure that we do not open it up to a level where we are knifing ourselves in the back.</P>
    <P>There is another point that arises, namely, the number of UK carriers who operate UK registered aircraft based in Ireland.  I have a difficulty with this.  It is like the old flags of convenience in the shipping industry.  Those who are basing themselves in Ireland and operating from Ireland should be registered in Ireland.  I want to hear the arguments against that. <Col N="1184" /> I certainly know it is something which Thatcher would not be too keen on on the other side.  I am not even sure if that is allowable under British legislation, if an Irish operator could operate from Britain with an Irish registered aircraft. It certainly would not be popular over there.  I have some difficulty with it.  We have not enough jobs.  There are many young pilots without jobs in this country at the moment.  If we have UK operators operating UK registered aircraft with UK pilots, that is employment and industry for our people which we are losing.  I would like the Minister to look at that.</P>
    <P>Do they require permission for UK registered, Irish based operations?  What is our contact with them?  What control do we have over that operation?  Do they need the Minister's permission?  That is the main point I want to make.</P>
    <P>I am raising questions that worry me, things that I think should be looked at, and I would hate them to be taken as a criticism of the Bill the Minister put in front of us.  It is a fine Bill and I make these suggestions in good faith, hoping that he can adopt some of them.  I have no doubt that I am not completely right in all the points I have made.  I have not done enough research on it, but I do hope that the Minister will take what I have offered in good faith and will respond to it.  If he considers it wise to make amendments or that changes should be made, I have no doubt that he will do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to extend a very sincere welcome to this Bill and to compliment the Minister, not only on introducing the Bill but on the very full and open explanatory memorandum that he has provided to facilitate the Members who are considering this legislation.  I would say that the Air Navigation and Transport Bill, 1987 is one of the most important pieces of legislation to come before the House in a long while.  It has indeed had a long gestation period because back in 1976 while I had the honour of being President of the European Commission for Transport, I organised the first hearing on air navigation in <Col N="1185" /> the European Parliament which attracted a very full participation not only from the national carriers in the Community but from the major insurance companies and all the people involved in inter-city transport.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides a very comprehensive review and qualification of the legislation which impinges on people who use air transport &mdash; the passengers &mdash; and also regulations for those people who are in the transportation business.  Transport has traditionally been one of the most understated industries in this country.  As a matter of fact, transport is responsible for 17 per cent of the GNP in the entire European Community and I am sure the same kind of proportion applies right across the developed world.  I am particularly happy with the treatment that the Department and the Minister have given to this very important subject and while we have been waiting for a long time for this legislation, I would hope that the House will be able to give it a very thorough investigation and examination.</P>
      <P>The Bill lays down specific obligations on the airport operators and I am sure in that instance it applies to Aer Rianta, a semi-State body.  They do a remarkable job but they get very little attention.  The management are first class.  However, that does not mean I agree with their <i>modus operandi.</i>  For instance, the prices they charge the general travelling public for parking facilities are close to a rip-off especially since they do not accept any responsibility for damage to or insurance on public property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the range of duty free shops, I see no valid reason why Aer Rianta, a semi-State organisation, should charge rent for space in a duty free shop three, four, five or ten times higher than the rent per square foot obtainable in a high street, in Grafton Street, or any street in Dublin.  Goods are advertised on public hoardings as duty free but they fail to indicate, in fairness to the public, that the mark up on most of those goods is from 300 per cent to perhaps 1,000 per cent.  I am sure a distiller would get £1 per bottle of whiskey if he is very lucky. He certainly would not get more than <Col N="1186" /> £1.50 per bottle.  Yet in a duty free shop, where the State add nothing at all to the price, the same bottle of whiskey can cost £7, £8 or £9.  One can get a bottle of Irish whiskey in a duty free shop in London for £2 a bottle less than in Dublin and in some of the European airports for £1 a bottle less.  If you go to the Third World, Africa or the Far East, you can get a bottle of duty free Irish whiskey for £2 per bottle.  It is nonsense that a semi-State organisation should be organising a rip-off.  They have the trade and they have the throughput.  I ask the Minister if he would be kind enough to look at the operation of Aer Rianta and ask them to justify their outrageously high charges. They charge people rents of £30,000, £40,000, £50,000 and £60,000 for a kiosk which is ten or 20 feet wide and this means that the costs of the services have to go up.</P>
    <P>The main reason for this Bill is to try to deal with the problem of security on transportation.  Section 27, which I think is one of the most important sections in the Bill, sets out the penalties.  I would like to see section 41 included in section 27 (2).  A person who creates a false alarm or who makes a nuisance call, for example, a bomb scare, and thereby inconveniences an operator and thousands of passengers should have a mandatory prison sentence or a manatory custodial sentence in a mental institution imposed on him.  I would like the Minister to consider on Committee Stage the possibility of introducing this.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is because I am a farmer that section 21 is of particular interest to me. I readily accept that every effort should be made to eliminate the danger caused by birds, seagulls, crows or whatever, and it is important that dumps should be sited away from main runways.  However, this danger would apply seasonally on lands which are being farmed for cereals in the spring, during the ploughing season and again during the harvest.  If the transport authorities decided that land should be frozen, what compensation would be given to a farmer?  There should be considerable compensation if a farmer is <Col N="1187" /> forced to keep his valuable land in grass all the time.</P>
    <P>I recognise that this is a very important Bill.  A lot of work has gone into it and I look forward to a very strong and intensive Committee Stage.  While there is nothing contentious in the Bill, there are many areas where we need to ensure that the organisation and the industry are treated equally.</P>
    <P>On the question of regulations, I would like the Minister to let the House know whether or not it would be possible at this stage to encompass in the terms of the legislation regulations that will look after the provincial airports on the Aran Islands, Waterford, Farranfore and Oranmore in Galway.  Each one of those regional airports is reporting increased business every year.  It would be very appropriate if the regulations were to apply to those airports as well.</P>
    <P>I would also like to acknowledge the kindness of the Leader of the House in facilitating me to make those few remarks.  I compliment the Minister on this very valuable legislation and look forward to a very full Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay the House very long on this legislation. However, there are some points I would like to make.  I welcome the Minister to the House, particularly when he is bringing in a Bill of this nature which is intended to make passengers more aware of the safety that is needed in air travel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Air travel has increased enormously during the past number of years.  Irrespective of what has been said by other Senators, deregulation has played a major part in this increase in traffic.  For a number of years there seemed to be a reluctance on the part of our national airline, Aer Lingus, to allow competition into many areas and, in particular, the cross-channel area.  Competition did come in and thankfully Aer Lingus have been able to respond to that competition. Because they have been able to respond, prices have come down significantly and because prices have come down significantly, air traffic has increased.  In a <Col N="1188" /> way this is a two edged sword in that it has made it possible for more people to leave Ireland and go across to England for holidays, shopping or whatever, and at the same time it has played a major part in again allowing Irish people who are living in England, in particular, to come back to Ireland on holidays.  There was a time from the mid-seventies to the mid-eighties when it was much cheaper for people in England to go to sunny countries for their holidays rather than come back to Ireland.  The situation has reversed itself because fares have come down.  There is a greater availability of fares and a greater availability of flight times.</P>
    <P>The main object of this Bill is to ensure the safety of people who travel.  This is very necessary.  Of course one of the problems with this increase in air traffic is that airports which were suitable for catering for smaller numbers are now expected to cater for much larger numbers. This is creating major problems especially because of the huge amount of people who are travelling on charter flights and the increased number of aircraft which are coming in and out of the country.</P>
    <P>One of the problems of this increase which has not been addressed so far is that because of large numbers of people and the big public houses in these airports, unfortunately there seems to be too much drinking going on.  Drink definitely plays a major part in creating hassle at airports and on airplanes.  There should be some protocol in the operation of airport drinking facilities.  A number of people who go to airports are under stress because they are not used to flying.  They take a certain amount of alcohol and they become over-stressed and this can create problems for other passengers on the plane and the cabin staff and it does not help the safe operation of aircraft.</P>
    <P>The increased numbers of passengers going through airports creates its own problems.  However, hopefully we will be able to increase the facilities at our airports and Aer Rianta will have the money to increase the facilities to deal with the increasing number of travellers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1189" /> Mention has been made of the duty free shops operated by Aer Rianta.  I agree with the comments made by Senator McDonald, in particular, on this. There seems to be an element of rip-off in some of these shops.  Even though the shops are operating on a duty free basis there is absolutely no doubt that profit margins seem to be very high.  It may be that the profit margins are not extremely high but that the cost of renting space in these shops is very high.  This might be the reason prices are so high.</P>
    <P>People should take no notice of the advertisement for duty free goods at airports. It is now possible for visitors to claim back VAT on items purchased in Ireland.  They can get VAT back on items which are bought in ordinary shops throughout the country.  There is a very good probability that, if they buy in the ordinary retail shops down town and claim their VAT back at the point of exit, they will find that the advantage is with the shops down town and not with the duty free shops at the airport.</P>
    <P>The question of safety in terms of operation is one that we have to address ourselves to, not alone with regard to the airline operators and aerodromes but equally with regard to air traffic control. It would appear that there are increasing pressures on air traffic controllers throughout the world because of the huge increase in air traffic.  Because of the stress these air traffic controllers are under at major aerodromes, there is an increasing probability that at some stage there could be a major air disaster, especially at airports where the stacking of planes goes on on a regular basis. Stacking is happening more and more at the major airports throughout the world. Indeed, it happens on occasion at Dublin Airport when there are delays coming into the airport because of increased traffic.  This did not happen before.</P>
    <P>Safety at airports is of paramount importance.  I do not think anybody should criticise the fact they might be inconvenienced going into an airport if they have to have their baggage checked, or if they have to undergo a body check.  It is absolutely necessary that these checks <Col N="1190" /> should be carried out.  Too often in the past not alone have minor pieces of equipment that could be used to hijack a plane been brought aboard, but Uzi machine guns, hand grenades and so forth have been brought aboard also.  I never worry about being checked going into an airport and I do no think anybody else should criticise the fact there is security. The more security there is in an airport, the more secure the passengers will be when they get on board.</P>
    <P>On the question of security, one of the airports I am not entirely satisfied about using is Luton Airport.  Luton Airport seems to be used increasingly by more and more Irish passengers.  It is a staging point for British forces who are going out to the Middle East and the Far East and for the wives and families of those soldiers who are going out to visit them. Because of this it is an airport in which security should be maximised.  I am never too happy about using that airport because of the lack of security.  Passengers can walk in and out without having their bags checked.  That should not happen.</P>
    <P>The debate has broadened out and there are a number of items that I am a bit worried about.  Many people bring back ornamental knives from abroad.  I have never seen an ornamental knife or any type of knife being checked at a European aerodrome.  They should always be checked in and given to the cabin crew for transportation in a special box or place in the cabin.  This aspect of safety should be looked at very carefully.</P>
    <P>Section 22 deals with the clarification of the definition of an &ldquo;accident&rdquo; for investigation.  It says: &ldquo;...`accident' includes any event or circumstance likely to threaten the safety of an aircraft or any person&rdquo;.  In cases where small aircraft or helicopters using an airport, because of lack of checking out with the controls at the airport, come within 100 yards, 300 yards or 600 yards of a passenger carrying airline, not alone should they be investigated but they should be prosecuted in every case unless the mistake is not theirs.  In most cases it has been found that the fault was that of the operator of <Col N="1191" /> the small plane who thought he was using the aerodrome in a safe manner.</P>
    <P>The question of the nominated aerodromes is important.  I am glad the Minister said the specified aerodromes can be widened out to include aerodromes other than those in Shannon, Cork and Dublin. There has been an increase in the number of small aerodromes around the country. Generally these aerodromes are operated in a very safe manner.  Some of them may not be in the safest of places.  One particular aerodrome has a main road on one side of it and a railway line on the other side.  I do not think that in future people should be allowed to set up aerodromes in places like that.  Smaller aerodromes are an essential feature of modern air traffic.  They are being used more and more as feeders for the main aerodromes and they will play a more important part in the increasing use of airlines.  Therefore, the requirements of smaller aerodromes should be strictly adhered to and strict rules should have to be adopted by the people who operate them.</P>
    <P>The prohibition or restriction on the use of land adjacent to aerodromes was raised by Senator McDonald.  It is a tricky problem.  One of the problems people who run airports have is that they want to build the airport close enough to the centres of the population so that people will not have to travel long distances. Nevertheless they cannot bring the aerodromes into areas where farms and buildings would have to be sanitised.  You cannot sanitise hundreds of acres of land just for the purpose of helping out in the development of an airport.</P>
    <P>There is no real control over parking at Cork, Dublin or Shannon airports.  On the way into Dublin Airport there are two people in a security cabin who, generally speaking, wave the cars on.  Other than at times when there has been a scare I have very rarely seen a car stopped.  The cars go into the carpark.  There is absolutely no check on them.  The cars are left in the carpark which is within 20 feet of a very crowded air terminal.  That should not be allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1192" /> There would be major problems if bombs were brought into these carparks. Carparks should be placed much further away from the air terminals and where the planes are parked.  Feeder buses should be provided to bring people to and from these carparks.  I know some people do not like to walk even ten yards to get to where they want to go.  Nevertheless from a safety angle the cars should not be parked as close to air terminal buildings as they are at present.  I do not think that is a major problem but nevertheless it is a problem.</P>
    <P>I am not too sure whether I am wrong or somebody else is wrong but I got the impression that some people think 100 countries have already signed the convention on compensation.  It does not seem, from reading the Bill, the Minister's notes or the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum that this is so.  It would appear that there are very few countries which have signed it.  I would like clarification on whether the United States have signed the protocols which would allow for increased payments to be made for people who have been killed or badly injured in air crashes.  Up to now the compensation was £10,000.  This was derisory and in many cases people had to go to courts to get that amount.  I agree with the sentiments expressed that £90,000 is still not enough.  However, it is a lot better than £10,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister and some of the other speakers referred to the shooting down of private aircraft.  Mention was made of the shooting down by the USSR of a Korean airline 747 in USSR aerospace in September 1983.  The plane was in USSR territory and the pilot had been acquainted with the fact that he was in USSR territory and he did not respond to the request to get out of that territory. There is absolutely no justification for the shooting down of a civil airline.  Nevertheless it has been accepted that that civil airline, which was carrying a number of passengers, was using equipment which could not be suggested as being anything other than military spying material.  Even though I agree totally with the concept of people refraining from the use of <Col N="1193" /> weapons against civil aviation there should be a protocol which states that civil airlines should not carry equipment of a military nature because if they do, unfortunately the consequences can be disastrous for the people on board these planes.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a marvellous record in terms of our interest in the safety aspect of aviation.  I think that will continue.  This Bill will help, to a large degree, to eliminate some of the problems that have arisen during the past number of years in the safe operation of our airlines.  I commend the Minister for bringing the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is an excellent one and I congratulate the Minister and his junior Minister on bringing it before us.  There are a few points I would like to make.</P>
      <P>We have seen a vast increase in the number of people who use air transport. It has been proven that it is one of the most improved work areas in the modern world.  This is obvious from the number of people who now fly.  The improvements that have taken place in Irish air transport business during the past few years are enormous.  I take the opportunity, as the Minister did yesterday in the press; to congratulate the people involved on the work they are putting into it.</P>
      <P>There are many areas where we would readily admit that we would like to see more happening to ensure that security and safety regulations are adhered to at all costs.  The vast majority of people who fly are not fully aware of what travelling by aeroplane means.  When I fly I am very conscious of the fact that I am sitting inside something over which I do not have any control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to Senator Lanigan's last point.  I too was very disturbed at the shooting down of a civil airline in USSR air space in 1983 &mdash; if it was a Russian space area.  The definitions of &ldquo;air corridors&rdquo; and &ldquo;air space&rdquo; must be broadened.  I read a lot about that incident and I did not read that something was used to spy on another country.  I <Col N="1194" /> know that in international airlines there are constant debates and discussions and international committees have been set up.  If equipment was used to spy on another country we did not have the authority to question those who allowed that equipment to go on that plane and put at risk the lives of innocent passengers to find out something about another country.</P>
    <P>If that is the case it is right and proper to ask questions of the international authorities. It is appalling that countries are prepared to blow a plane out of the sky if something on that plane is spying on them.  I could not agree that the answer to that is to eliminate it.  If there are international authorities and places where we can ask these questions, that is where they should be asked.  I am sure that aircraft carrying this equipment can be investigated.  To take innocent lives is diabolical.</P>
    <P>There are areas where we have free competition.  Since that has been implemented we have seen a massive improvement and a massive decrease in the price of fares.  Many Senators have referred to that.  Many people come into our country not alone through our excellent airline, Aer Lingus, but also through other airlines giving them an equally excellent service.  Ryanair, for instance, are a local company.  I congratulate them on their achievements over the past 12 months and the amount of business that they took from other airlines.</P>
    <P>Airlines from other countries are allowed into our country, and rightly so. I am not objecting to the fact that British Airways are allowed to use Dan-Air and are now very much involved in taking many passengers out of our country to other lands.  Ryanair are trying to compete. Senator O'Toole made a vital point when he said some of the big companies could stifle smaller companies.  Aer Arann has already been stifled.  It went to the wall about two years ago.  That company tried to improve the service.</P>
    <P>Ryanair still have not got a facility they are entitled to.  I would like to know if the Minister and the Department are constantly asking the British authorities <Col N="1195" /> why Ryanair cannot fly direct from Cork to Luton.  It is appalling that the flight must land in Dublin, turn around and go back out the runway and up again.  That is despicable.  People trying to compete against excellent airlines such as Aer Lingus got every facility down through the years from the State, such as enormous amounts of moneys and capital grants with no payment back to the State. When will we ask the British authorities to please allow them to fly direct into Luton Airport from Cork?  It is most unfair to that airline.  There is no incentive for anybody else to open up another business and provide more competition. I would like to know why they are not getting the facility.</P>
    <P>Why are we not asking Dan-Air or British Airlines to land in Dublin before coming to Cork?  Air France, for instance who have a very old licence, decided two years ago that they wanted to fly direct from Paris to Cork.  They made no apology. In an agreement reached between Aer Lingus and Air France, Air France decided to come into Cork on Sundays because they found business was improving. I am not saying they should not be allowed to do that, but I am asking why our people who want to compete, who are providing excellent work &mdash; it is the one area that has been positive as regards creating work in our society over the last 12 months &mdash; are not getting the same facility from other countries.  Why are we not asking other countries to allow our people to have fair competition?  Why are Aer Lingus not allowed flights out of Heathrow to Amsterdam or to any other country?  Are they not allowed do so, or are they being stifled from doing so? Senator O'Toole referred to that and I know Aer Lingus are seeking that facility.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus are an excellent company. We can be very proud of them.  I feel very comfortable when I am sitting in an Aer Lingus aircraft or any Irish aircraft. There is a very comfortable atmosphere and an impression of an ease and no particular rush.  I recognise also that the staffing of the Aer Lingus and Ryanair <Col N="1196" /> aircraft is excellent.  I am aware, because I have travelled with other companies, that there is an impression of ease.  We do not want to lose that.  We do not want to give an impression that we are in a hurry.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Aer Lingus on their new achievement in the purchase of the Boeing 737/300S and I know another one will be on the way in two weeks' time. There is an air of confidence again which is good for the country generally and it shows that we are not looking backwards. Aer Lingus are prepared to come up with the finance directly out of their own funding.</P>
    <P>About three or four years ago we had arguments about Aer Lingus cutting back on air flights out of Cork because of lack of business.  Dan-Air and British Airways come in and we found there was more business and more competition. The Minister was involved as a Deputy at the time in the long arguments with Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta about facilities generally and about the type of aircraft needed to get people out of the southern region.  They purchased small commuter aircraft.  I am not saying small commuter aircraft are not as good as others but I wonder if it was realistic thinking at the time.  Something like £9 million was spent at that time on small commuter aircraft which were made in Belfast.</P>
    <P>In 1982, less than five years ago, they were saying there was no concern about the lengthening of runways, no concern about the need for bigger aircraft.  There was no concern shown about extra business because the extra business would not be there.  This came from the main management of Aer Lingus at a meeting with Oireachtas members, at which no concern was shown about the cutting back of services.  In a short period of time, even though there was no great improvement generally in our country, air travel has vastly improved.  It was felt by Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus that in the Shannon and Cork airports there was no need for any improvement, there was no need for any extension, the smaller aircraft would operate to bring passengers <Col N="1197" /> to the bigger aircraft, in other words from Cork to Dublin, where they would join the bigger aircraft.</P>
    <P>Suddenly, because of other air companies coming in, strong emphasis was put on improvements.  I have no objection to that.  It shows that even in our airline companies there was no broad-minded or long term thinking at that time.  We should keep our options open. This is why I say the Department should recognise that the companies who are trying very hard to get flights into other airports should get every help possible.</P>
    <P>I welcome the idea of holiday companies using other airports.  This winter in Cork we will have over four hour flights to Las Palmas, but unfortunately it is Spanish airlines who will be doing this.  I have been in Dublin Airport on many Sundays, but I was not aware that Aer Lingus were a very busy company on Sundays.  Why are our local travel agents not considering using the local airlines to run these flights from Cork Airport on Sundays or from Shannon Airport? Flights go from Shannon in the winter time.  People are using them and they are quite busy.  Even in bad times many people are taking winter breaks.  We must be realistic and recognise that.  If we have 100 people flying out of Cork on Sunday I would like very much to see Aer Lingus aircraft used.  If an Aer Lingus aircraft is lying idle or not working to its full capacity on a Sunday, why are we using Spanish airlines?  Why are we not asking our local companies to use local airlines and local aircraft?  I resent that very much.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years Aer Rianta have made massive progress.  They made a profit of £11.4 million, for the first time ever, last year.  They made £500,000 the year before.  Up to a few years ago they were not making money; in fact, they were losing money.  I know there was constant pressure on the previous Government &mdash; and the Minister was very much involved &mdash; for holding back the allocation of £1 for an extension of the runway in Cork by 1,000 yards.  The <Col N="1198" /> extension at Dublin Airport of a runway will cost about £43 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a reduced amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is at a reduced amount in Dublin, why were Aer Rianta not asked to use some of the £11.4 million they made last year in Cork?  I am not saying the new runway is not needed in Dublin Airport; it is.  Senator Lanigan pointed out that there is a build-up over Dublin and a new runway is needed.  That runway will not start for some time because of arguments about removing roadways and housing.  Why was there so much commotion and so much argument at the sime when Aer Rianta had made £11.4 million in one year, thanks to good management, not alone in Dublin but in Shannon and in Cork in particular?  I congratulate them on that.</P>
      <P>When one looks at the prices at which they are able to sell goods it is no wonder that they can make £11.4 million.  I am very much involved in a particular trade and I know that a particular bottle of spirits can be purchased from a local distillery at a certain price with no duty, no taxes and no VAT.  When I see an increase of 600 per cent, that is a bit too much.</P>
      <P>We introduced a Bill some time ago to ban &ldquo;no smoking&rdquo; and &ldquo;no drinking&rdquo; signs.  Yet when you go into our airports, before you get to the duty free area at all you see signs: &ldquo;Do not forget to buy duty free.  We will give you a bottle at such a price.&rdquo;  Not only that, but they will also give a bottle for nothing if you purchase something else.  It is easy for them when they are paying only £1 for it.  That is not very good for our young people or for the image of our airports.  I would not like the impression to be given that we are trying to do this to sell something else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lanigan was right in saying if you look realistically at the cost of goods in airports and compare the cost in our towns or villages &mdash; and in particular a village like Blarney which is doing very well &mdash; they are dearer.  The Minister is aware that in Blarney there are signs all over the place indicating that you can get your duty and VAT back.  At airports <Col N="1199" /> nothing like that is emphasised.  Have Aer Lingus or Aer Rianta the right to say they are entitled to charge so much per square foot for something they are selling that belongs to a semi-State body?  We must ask the private sector to do everything possible to get people into our country in order that costs can be reduced.  In our semi-State structures where the costs are increasing the impression is that they can do what they like because nobody will question them.</P>
    <P>I had an experience in a particular airport where the emphasis was put very strongly on making sure you bought at that airport.  It is only right if you are leaving Ireland that you should buy in Ireland before you go.  That is very good selling.  They should not tell people: &ldquo;You are better off to buy here because it will cost you more in another airport on the way back, or you will not be able to get it on the way back.&rdquo;  I resent that. It is not good for air travellers generally.</P>
    <P>An argument has been made concerning less duty free goods.  When people come here the first thing they see is what our airports are like.  How do our costs compare with other airports?  Staff at our airports are our ambassadors to our visitors who are vital to us as a country.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to extra safety measures.  We should have extra customs officers.  Every facility possible should be given to help people with their baggage. Aer Lingus are excellent as regards baggage. When baggage is lost they are very helpful.  We need to keep pressure on people who are availing of State money and getting every facility possible.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Aer Rianta in the service they are giving but serious questions arise as to whether they are putting more emphasis on what they can gain from passengers or than what they can do for them.  Our prime products are on sale in Airports.  Our diamond, glass and other products made here are on show in our airports.  I welcome the Bill and I wish it well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport (Mr. Lyons) Denis Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport (Mr. Lyons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I <Col N="1200" /> hope in the next few minutes to reply to some of the points raised by Senators.  I would like to thank them for their support for the Bill and I welcome their contributions which indicated the deep and detailed knowledge and concern Senators have in this area.</P>
      <P>Senator Bradford's supportive contribution makes time available for me to deal with questions raised by others. Senator Cassidy dealt with the Connaught Regional Airport and he was in some doubt about the security position also mentioned by other Senators.  There is a local security committee at Connaught Regional Airport comprising the airport board and the airline, which is Ryanair and the Garda Síochána.  This committee reports to the National Civil Aviation Security Committee.</P>
      <P>The development of Connaught Airport was mentioned.  Everybody should be aware of the supportive role of the Minister and the Government for the airport and for airlines wishing to serve that airport, as instanced by Ryanair serving Luton, Birmingham, Manchester and with plans for other destinations.  The Minister will at all times consider favourably applications from other airlines wishing to serve Connaught whether on a scheduled or chartered basis.</P>
      <P>There is a wide and varied view on the prohibition or restriction of dumping near airports.  The experience of people travelling to other airports, where they might not have land as freely available to them, is that one can see crops growing between runways.  The circumstances of each airport must be the deciding factor in permitting dumping near airports. There is no excuse for it at airports.  That must be disallowed.</P>
      <P>Senator Cassidy suggested a two mile free zone.  It can be considered.  This Bill applies to all civil airports including the three State airports and Connaught airport. There was some doubt early in the debate about where this Bill applies and to what airports it applies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of penalties was raised by a number of Senators.  The Bill provides that the present fines of £5 to £1,000 will be increased to £1,000 at District Court <Col N="1201" /> level, and to £50,000 at Circuit Court level.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole raised many points.  I will deal with them as quickly as I can. For the purposes of the Bill, &ldquo;aerodrome&rdquo; means all aerodromes licensed or authorised under the Air Navigation and Transport Acts.  That should be clear. That does not include military aerodromes under the aegis of the Minister for Defence.  A list of the licensed aerodromes can be supplied to the Senator if he wants it, or any other Senator.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole inquired about the position regarding aircraft insurance which was raised also by other Senators. The requirements governing leisure flying are under consideration and the Senators' comments are noted and will be considered in that context.  Authorised scheduled and charter flights must be appropriately insured before they can take off.  This is departmental policy.</P>
    <P>We will be keeping the insurance position of every aerodrome under constant review.  Section 10 requires aerodrome operators to give the Minister a copy of the insurance certificate which will indicate its period of validity.  I am acknowledging the seriousness with which Members consider the aspects of insurance.  Investigation of accidents must be as wide as possible and this is the case in practice.  All section 22 of the Bill does is to make it clear legally that the investigation of accidents is all-embracing. Security measures are designed to operate at all airports but specifically at centres through which international air services operate, for instance, Cork, Dublin, Shannon, which are State airports and Connaught, Waterford and Carrickfin in County Donegal.  All airports to which international regular air services operate and have local securities with these will report to the Department on their standards etc.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole suggested that there should be a confidential system for persons to draw attention to security and safety deficiencies without endangering their own jobs.  Such a suggestion has been made in the past in respect of both pilots and air traffic controllers and I will <Col N="1202" /> be pleased to look at procedures in this area.  Senator O'Toole also asked whether section 19 allowed the court to hear part of the proceedings as well as the whole of the proceedings in camera. The short answer to that is yes.  Each airline must prepare an Operations Manual, subject to clearance by the Department of Tourism and Transport, setting out rest periods for cabin crews and general operating requirements in line with international standards.  There must be flexibility for airlines to allow for events but not to create danger in allowing any flexibilities.  For example, delays in aircraft take-off would extend cabin time without endangering anybody.</P>
    <P>A number of other questions were raised.  The last Senator I dealt with was Senator O'Toole.  A number of questions have been raised by various Senators so, when I reply, if I do not mention the Senator's name it means that the question has been raised by more than one.</P>
    <P>Below-cost selling was raised and I would be concerned about that.  The Department have not received any complaints in that regard from either the airlines or the users.  I should say, however, that it is a function of my Department to monitor the finances of Irish airlines and to ensure ongoing financial viability.  So far there are no concerns in that regard.</P>
    <P>I note also Senators' concern about the Dublin-London route and the number of carriers.  Our proposals for liberalisation in Europe including routes to the UK are designed to ensure that there is a steady and planned liberalisation without overhasty expansion.</P>
    <P>Regarding the use of foreign aircraft in Ireland, this is a reflection of the growing trend towards the leasing of aircraft. Guinness Peat Aviation is a world leader in this market which provides both aircraft on the Irish register and crews to foreign airlines.  Similarly on a regional basis there may be foreign aircraft being used in this country.</P>
    <P>I should add that Aer Lingus have a successful subsidiary which recruits aircraft personnel for foreign airlines and I believe that we are a net exporter of these services.  That is something of which we <Col N="1203" /> should all be proud, and justifiably proud.</P>
    <P>Sales and advertising of fares with small print stuck in somewhere was of concern to some Senators.  There are cases where, for competitive reasons, airlines proceed with the sale and advertising of expected new fares but normally such advertisements specify that approval has been sought and is awaited. That is the important thing.  Airlines run the risk that they themselves would have to compensate passengers who bought tickets on the basis of expected new tariffs which were not subsequently approved.  They could be on slippery ground there.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald and other Senators dealt with disruption from birds, and dumps, and so on, and I think I have covered that already to some extent.  On section 41 of the Bill he mentioned that the fines and imprisonment for false alarms at airports should be looked at. He rightly linked sections 27 and 41.  As I have already mentioned, the fines are being raised from £5 to £1,000 at a lower court level and &mdash; or six months' imprisonment, and at the higher court level up to £50,000 and/or three years' imprisonment. It is within the jurisdiction of the courts to apply these.</P>
    <P>Duty-free was also mentioned.  That is basically a matter for the Minister for Finance.  I will make Senators' comments on that available to the proper quarter.</P>
    <P>Over-drinking at airports is another matter which Senators raised.  Of course, cabin crews and security staff at airports are increasingly aware of the danger of passengers having too much intoxicating liquor at airports and there have been many cases of passengers being refused boarding because of this.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan mentioned protocols to the Warsaw Convention which the US had not ratified.  The US were moving towards ratification of the protocols but there is now likely to be a further short delay.  All the documentation is ready in the Department of Transport but the appointment of a new Secretary of Transportation is awaited.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1204" /> I am sure that will not delay anything unduly.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan mentioned air traffic controllers.  I recognise the hard work and valuable contribution made by air traffic controllers employed by my Department to the smooth and efficient working of civil aviation and airspace.  I am sure Senators would agree with those sentiments.</P>
    <P>I am also particularly disappointed that Ryanair have not been allowed to fly directly from Cork to Luton.  They have to touch down in Dublin and it is costing them £1,000 to burn some rubber on the tarmac and they must do the same coming back.  It is a ludicrous situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure the Senator and the Seanad that my Cabinet colleague, Deputy Wilson, has been pressing since last May to allow Ryanair to operate Cork-Luton-Shannon and Luton-Dublin-Manchester.  The Minister has written to his UK counterpart on several occasions and has raised the matter at European Council level with the Council of Transport Ministers, but so far the UK are still demanding a high price in return for allowing services over these routes to proceed.  The issue is still being pressed.  It could also be resolved in the context of the EC package to liberalise European air transport.  I am hopeful that this will be adopted by the end of the year and that this ludicrous situation will be a thing of the past.  I am satisfied that there is a role for the medium and small airline in Europe where there is liberalisation of routes and there are access opportunities.</P>
      <P>Senator Cregan and other Senators referred to the 1983 shooting down of the aircraft with the loss of so many passengers. We all agree that this was appalling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will finish by saying to Senators that all the suggestions made by them in the course of the Bill on Second Stage will be considered in the light of the constructive and informative manner in which Members made their contributions so <Col N="1205" /> comprehensively.  They will all be considered by the Minister, Deputy Wilson, and officials in the Department.</P>

  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Video Recordings Bill, 1987:" RHead="Second Stage">
    <Title>Video Recordings Bill, 1987: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to recommend the Video Recordings Bill, 1987, to the House.  It is a measure which is needed urgently and I am confident that it will receive wide support in the House.</P>
      <P>Video films are a comparatively new phenomenon.  Since the start of this decade, however, they have enjoyed an amazing growth in popularity.  Video recorders are now commonplace in homes and the number of outlets for video films continues to grow at a great rate.  There are thousands of video film titles available, and the number is being added to at the rate of approximately 1,000 new titles each year.  Most of the video films are unobjectionable in their portrayal of comedy, adventure, sport, education, etc.</P>
      <P>There are some video films available, however, that are thoroughly objectionable. They depict extreme and graphic violence or unhibited pornography. The extremely violent films have attracted the name &ldquo;video nasties&rdquo;. They depict the most stomach-turning and ghastly violence.  The pornographic ones depict sex in a totally objectionable manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not mention the titles of the most violent films.  They are well enough known.  The problem is that while films of this nature are totally uninhibited in their depiction of violence, they are also realistic.  They cannot but have an effect on impressionable minds.  I would stress that I do not confine the term impressionable <Col N="1206" /> minds to young people only.  These films depict what are ghastly crimes in a way that can invite imitation by adults as well as by children.</P>
    <P>Films of this kind can have an adverse effect on the viewers but, as it is now generally accepted, they can also result in crimes against other innocent people. Apart from that, they tend to increase the general tolerance of what ought to be unacceptable.  If people frequently see extremely violent films, some of them will come to regard this type of violence as the norm.  The danger is that the more impressionable of them will imitate in real life what they see in the video world.</P>
    <P>As I have said already, the pornographic films are totally objectionable in what they portray.  Anybody who has not seen these films cannot imagine the depths of degradation to which they stoop.  Much of the material could only be described as degrading of human nature generally but all of it is degrading and offensive as far as women are concerned.</P>
    <P>It might be appropriate here to relate the proposals in this Bill to the two other areas where censorship applies, that is, books and films.  Up to the end of the seventies books and cinema films were two of the most popular forms of entertainment. In the eighties the video recorder has become an equally popular form of entertainment.  We have had for a long time control over the material available in books and the material which could be shown in cinema films.  The two forms of censorship &mdash; censorship of publications and censorship of films &mdash; have been in place practically since the founding of the State.  Yet the new powerful medium, video film, has no specific form of control.</P>
    <P>As is stated in the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum some controls are in place in relation to the importation and the showing of some video films. These controls, however, are peripheral to the general video films scene.  The key point is that there is no law at present relating specifically to the supply of video films.  This is a totally anomalous position having regard to the controls that exist in relation to publications and cinema films. <Col N="1207" /> It is a situation that has to be put right and the Bill now before the House will put it right.  The Bill will put in place a system of control in relation to video films.  It will, as set out in the long title, make provision for the control and regulation of the supply and importation of video recordings.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should now set out the key points of the control system envisaged in the Bill.  All new video films will have to be submitted to the film censor for certification before they may be supplied. The film censor will decide on the basis of criteria set out in the Bill whether or not he will allow the supply of any particular video film.  If he does not give a certificate he will make a prohibition order and the film may not be supplied. That is, it may not be sold, rented, etc. Should a person be dissatisfied with the decision of the censor not to grant a certificate he may appeal to the Censorship of Films Appeal Board.</P>
    <P>The film censor will also have power to decide whether certain video films already on the market should be prohibited. There are certain well known titles of an objectionable nature on the market and when the Bill becomes law the film censor will be able to examine these as a matter of priority.  If he decides on the basis of the criteria in the Bill that they should not continue to be supplied he may make a prohibition order.  Once he makes a prohibition order any further sale, rental, etc. of the title will be illegal. Again there will be the possibility of an appeal to the Censorship of Films Appeal Board in relation to prohibition orders of this nature.</P>
    <P>I think it appropriate at this stage to say a few words about the criteria set out in the Bill for the refusal of a supply certificate and the making of a prohibition order.  These criteria have been drafted on the basis of existing legislation and what is considered to be required in today's world.  They include obscene or indecent matter, a category which appears in existing legislation on cinema films and publications.  They also include material that would be likely to cause <Col N="1208" /> persons to commit crime or which would be likely to stir up hatred on grounds of race, nationality and religion.  Finally, the criteria refer to material that depicts acts of gross violence or cruelty, including mutilation and torture, towards humans or animals.  This type of material does appear in video films.  It is necessary that it be referred to specifically in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with objectionable films I now turn to the vast numbers of inoffensive titles already on the market. These titles will be phased into the control system over the first few years of the operation of the Act.  After a number of years the requirement will be that all video films on the market, apart from those exempt under the Act, should have been examined by the film censor and he will either have granted a certificate or made a prohibition order in each case.  A system of mandatory labelling will ensure that the public and the garda will have readily available information as to the certificate granted by the film censor. Any film which should have been submitted to the censor and was not submitted will not, of course, have received a supply certificate and its supply will be illegal.  Untitled films will be caught by the control system in this way.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains a prohibition against the exhibition, apart from in a private capacity, of video films that have either been prohibited or have not been certificated.  This type of provision is necessary as without it objectionable films could be shown in clubs and clubs could be established specifically for that purpose.  Under the Bill it will also be possible for officers of Customs and Excise to detain any prohibited title which is being imported and to refer any video film which it is felt might be obscene to the film censor.</P>
    <P>It will be an offence to supply in any manner a video film which has not been certificated or which has been prohibited. Supply has been defined in the Bill to cover such things as sale, rent, etc.  It will be possible for the courts to impose heavy penalties on anybody who is convicted of committing an offence under the Act. These penalties may be monetary and <Col N="1209" /> they may also include imprisonment.  The size of the monetary fines and the possibility of imprisonment are an indication of how seriously I regard any offences under the Act.</P>
    <P>There are a number of points that are not covered in the Bill to which I wish to refer.  There has been an amount of pressure from various sources that a system of classifying video films should be introduced as is the case in Britain.  A system of classification involves dividing films into groups by reference to the age of the viewer.  For example, a film could be passed by the film censor as being suitable for supply only to those over the age of 16 years.</P>
    <P>The arguments in favour of classification are that the classification system enables an offence to be created in relation to supply of the film to persons below the stated age.  It also informs the purchaser or renter of the film of the category of person for whom the film is suitable.</P>
    <P>The main arguments against a classification system are as follows.  Classification provides for an offence in relation to the supply of the film to persons below a given age.  It does not, however, achieve the main objective which is to prevent the viewing of the film by persons below that age.  Having regard to the nature of video films and the relative ease of copying, classification could turn out to be pointless.  You may control the age of the person to whom the film is supplied but you will not be able to control the age of the person who views it.  Either an older person will rent or buy the film and show it to younger people, or the film will be in the home and will be seen by children when the parents are not there.</P>
    <P>It should also be remembered that a classification system would be very expensive compared with the system proposed in the Bill.  It would necessitate the viewing in full of all films by the censor and his staff.  As I have said, this is the system that is in operation in the UK. That system cost almost £1.1 million to operate last year and necessitated the employment of 53 staff.  Those figures cover both cinema film and video film <Col N="1210" /> censorship.  They compare with projected figures for our combined video and cinema film censorship of approximately ten people and an annual expenditure of about £300,000.  I should also mention that a classification system would result in delay in achieving control over the video films already on the market.  I think it is also relevant that the British system of classification would be particularly unsuitable to our circumstances since it includes a category which allows for supply only through sex shops.</P>
    <P>On balance I am satisfied that a classification system should not be provided for and that the only decision which the censor should have to make is whether the film be allowed for supply or not.  It has also been urged that all retail outlets for the sale or hire of video films should be licensed and local authorities have been mentioned in this context.</P>
    <P>The argument adduced in favour of licensing suppliers is that a licensing system would result in a more effective control on the supply of video films.  It is claimed that this is so because nobody could supply films without a licence and that the licence could be withdrawn in the event of the licensee being convicted of supplying prohibited or uncertificated films.</P>
    <P>The idea of licensing suppliers is also put forward as a means of combating breaches of copyright law and what is commonly called video piracy.  Senators will readily understand, however, that the area of commercial property is totally separate from the issues being addressed in this Bill and is outside its scope.  Incidentally, Senators are probably aware that there is legislation in the copyright area before the Dáil at present.</P>
    <P>The other side of the coin is that a licensing system would be extremely difficult to administer and would give rise to substantial extra costs.  In addition, it would be difficult to frame a provision which would provide the necessary criteria or guidelines for granting a licence.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I am of the view that it has not been established that a system of licensing suppliers is necessary to control the supply of video films.  That control <Col N="1211" /> can be achieved through heavy penalties on persons convicted of supplying prohibited video films.  I want to say a few words now about pornographic films specifically.  There may be a difference of opinion as to whether the supply of pornographic films should be prohibited totally, or whether the prohibition should apply only to supply to persons under 18 years.  The major argument in favour of confining the prohibition of pornographic films to those over 18 years is that adults should be free to decide what they wish to see unless it is clearly harmful.  Pornography can be distinguished in this regard from extremely violent video films.</P>
    <P>The following are the arguments in support of a total ban on the supply of video films which the censor finds to be pornographic.  Present day legislation in relation to censorship of publications provides for a total prohibition on the sale of banned books, including those banned on the grounds of being indecent.  Similarly there is a total ban on the public exhibition of banned films, including those banned on the grounds of being indecent.  Accordingly, should video film legislation not provide for a total ban on the supply of pornographic films it would be out of line with existing censorship legislation and, putting it at its lowest, this would provide grounds for demands for extension of the legislation into these other areas.  Senators will appreciate, I am sure, that it would be quite inappropriate to hang, as it were, a fundamental review of all censorship law on the back of this measure and that it is preferable to keep the approach to videos in line with the general approach in this regard.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the main argument in favour of a total ban is the very nature of the video itself.  It seems to me unrealistic to assume that certain videos could be supplied to, say over 18 year olds in this country in circumstances which would ensure that they would not be seen by younger persons.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned that the position in the UK is different.  There is a <Col N="1212" /> category of video which can be supplied to persons over 18 years in the context of sex shops.  On balance I am satisfied that young persons in our community are likely to be able to view pornographic films unless there is total prohibition on their supply.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied also that many people are not aware of the extremely offensive nature of some of the pornographic films available.  As I have said already, these films are totally uninhibited and totally explicit in what they portray.  I cannot imagine that any strong argument can be made for their being available to any particular group.  The material in them is obscene and they are particularly offensive and degrading to women.</P>
    <P>In this regard I would like to refer to the 1986 report of the United States Attorney General's Commission on Pornography. The commission found that pornography is harmful to viewers.  It is significant that the finding of the commission in 1986 is different from the findings of a commission in 1970 which did not conclude that any harm ensued from pornography.  The 1986 report of the commission is a very impressive document and was based on a widespread programme of research.  I consider its findings very significant.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances I have no hesitation in including pornography in the Bill and in dealing with it by way of a total prohibition on supply.  I am satisfied that that is the proper course and is in accordance with current informed thinking on the topic.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned already that the work to be done under the Bill will fall to the film censor.  You may ask why the film censor?  The answer is simple &mdash; the film censor is experienced in this area and is the most appropriate person to undertake the work.  His office will, of course, have to be strengthened both from the point of view of administrative and clerical staff and examiners or assistant censors who will assist him in examining films.  Extra equipment will be needed also.  Video recorders and screens and office machinery including computers will be purchased.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1213" /> All in all I estimate that the extra cost of running the video control system, over and above the cost of the current cinema control system, will be about £200,000 per annum.  The extra work will not result in any extra net expense to the State, however, as the cost of the operation will be recouped by the charging of fees in respect of the examination of video films. Senators will notice that there is a provision in the Bill which requires the operation to be self-financing, but no more than that.  This is in line with similar situations in other areas &mdash; I might just mention cinema film censorship and land registration.  By way of comment, however, I should like to say that in framing the provisions of the Bill I have been conscious of the need to avoid very expensive options which would have to be paid for by the legitimate video trade.</P>
    <P>Before finishing I want to refer to two sections of the Bill specifically.  Section 22 proposes an amendment to section 3 of the Censorship of Films Act, 1923. The purpose of the proposed amendment is to ensure that the Censorship of Films Appeal Board will have both male and female members in future.  The current membership of the board comprises seven men and two women but there is no legal requirement at present that both sexes be represented on the board.</P>
    <P>The second section to which I wish to refer is section 21.  That section provides for the official censor and the appeal board, in each year beginning with the year 1988, preparing reports on their work in the previous year.  The year 1988 has been included in the section in the expectation that the Bill will be enacted by the end of this year.  Should that not prove to be the case the reference to 1988 will be changed to 1989 by way of amendment.</P>
    <P>Although I have referred to some specific provisions of the Bill, Senators will appreciate that my remarks at this stage are of a general nature and deal with the principles underpinning the Bill and the key provisions which implement them. There are a number of sections in the Bill which I have not dealt with.  These will, of course, be dealt with on Committee <Col N="1214" /> Stage when detailed consideration will be given to all sections of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier I expect wide support for the Bill.  There should be general agreement on the need for a control system in relation to video films.  There may be differences of opinion, however, on the best method of control to install and, also, on details of the scheme set out in the Bill.  I look forward to having an open and informative debate on the topic and I assure all Members that I will give careful consideration to all views expressed during the debate.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I welcome the introduction of the Video Recordings Bill.  I welcome the fact that the Bill has been initiated in the Seanad in order to enact the legislation as quickly as possible.  I welcome also the Minister for Justice's remarks when he said he will look at all the various submissions to improve the Bill.  During the course of the debate the Minister will find that Senators are concerned with a number of areas in particular. Senators are concerned with the wording of various sections and the need to include items which are excluded at present.</P>
      <P>It would appear from one of the themes running through the Minister's speech that he is more concerned with the financial impact the inclusion of licensing or classification will have on his Department than in trying to improve the content of the legislation.  Indiscriminate and unlawful people are selling videos from vans throughout Ireland.  I submit that in addition there is a high level of video piracy which is adding an enormous burden to the legitimate video industry. It has also an enormous influence on the minds of many of our young people.  We should be concerned about the social cost rather than the financial cost of the legislation. The video industry in a submission to the Department made the Minister aware that they are prepared to shoulder some of the cost of implementing this legislation effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of people involved in the legitimate video industry in Ireland is significant <Col N="1215" /> and about 7,000 video titles have been imported.  The Department of Finance receive a significant amount of finance in the form of VAT from the distribution and sale of videos, and this should not be ignored when considering the cost of implementing various sections in this Bill.  In fact, the annual VAT and PRSI contributions of the industry amount to about £7 million.</P>
    <P>When you consider the number of people who are estimated to be involved in the illegal pirate trade in 1986 figures as well, you will see that there is a loss of about £3.5 million to the economy in terms of VAT and PRSI contributions. There is also a loss to the legitimate employment of people in the industry by the fact that there is about £4 million of business being done by distribution and £10 million in the retail area in the illegal pirate trading of video equipment and video recordings.</P>
    <P>The impact of video nasties on children cannot be overstated.  The rampant corruption of attitudes and minds, particularly in urban areas and in the lower socio-economic areas, is very worrying at the moment.  It is indefensible that any society should tolerate this for so long. There is indiscriminate piracy of unsuitable video films taking place in these areas at the moment.  The law would seem to be powerless regarding the confiscation of these films and even arresting people for destroying young minds with such filth.  The Minister is adopting a very cumbersome procedure by which this indiscriminate piracy of video films can be outlawed in this Bill.  The cumbersome procedure of confiscation of goods will be difficult to implement if one must seek permission from the court initially in order to carry out a warrant, or to have a house searched and the equipment confiscated. It is very necessary that the Garda should have immediate powers of confiscation if suspicion is aroused that indiscriminate pornographic material is being shown in various locations in an urban area.  I am not suggesting that it is confined to urban areas.  The pattern and <Col N="1216" /> surveys indicate that the lower socioeconomic areas seem to be the areas where there is a tremendous amount of illegal piracy of video recordings.</P>
    <P>The ultimate responsibility, of course, lies with the parents or guardians of the young people involved in this activity.  In fact, I submit that it is not solely confined to young people either.  Supposedly well matured adults get tremendous enjoyment out of this filth as well.  To prevent children from acquiring the material in the first place is obviously the responsibility of parents or guardians.  The Minister has an enormous problem in that he does not want to interfere with the rights of individuals in their own homes and also from the point of view of the common good in outlawing undesirable material from being shown in any dwelling as well.  There is a general laxity and irresponsibility on the part of some parents in looking after the constructive, moral welfare of their children.  It is something that has been getting worse gradually over the years.  That is why this legislation is so important and so urgent.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that blue movies, as they are known, lead to crimes of abuse of human beings and to an increased level of incest, rape and sexual violence outside the home.  It is well tabulated in the Department.  In fact, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights yesterday added their voice to protest against the enormous level of child abuse that is taking place in our society at the moment.  The Eastern Health Board, in particular, have 1,040 cases of sexual abuse of children.  I have no doubt that the environment of illegal piracy of video recordings contributes something towards that development and it should be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the United States Commission on Pornography. Substantial study has been carried out in the United States.  Various studies in the Republic of Ireland show that the incidence of rape has increased dramatically since the Fifties, when it was about 10 per annum, to about 200 per annum in 1982.  Unprecedented brutality is taking place in individual cases.  Various sources <Col N="1217" /> speak of the true rape level being two, three or even many times the reported level.  It is probably very much understated in the statistics.</P>
    <P>Additionally, as I have stated, incest has become established as a widespread social problem.  I know from my contacts with the teaching profession that they are very much concerned about the condition of some children who come to schools and the inability of health boards to deal effectively with the level of incest that is unreported and is definitely taking place in society.  Senators seem to think it is confined to the larger cities.  It is happening in every large town and, indeed, in large villages.</P>
    <P>Every Senator in this House should be concerned about the unreported but tremendous downgrading of our social problems that has been taking place over the past few years in particular.  Various conferences, like the Garda conference in the Department in 1986 &mdash; the Annual Conference of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors &mdash; were told that a specific video film had led to a sexual assault case in which the woman died of horrific injuries.  A health spokesman, the assistant secretary of the Department of Health in Dublin, singled out pornography as a cause of sexual assaults on women and girls.  The move the Minister is making in this Bill to outlaw pornography is a correct approach.  It will be very difficult to supervise and enforce these regulations because of the underground nature of the activity that is taking place at the moment in relation to video recordings.</P>
    <P>It is very important that the Minister should consider the inclusion of a licensing system in order to ensure that the Department are aware of the exact people who are dealing with video recordings and those who are not.  Failure to register importers, distributors or retailers means losing control of the situation immediately.  The need for registration is critical in this Bill.  First, it gives the authorities a record of who is dealing in the videos.  This is essential because there are about 600 retail outlets in the Republic.  These do not include the <Col N="1218" /> people I spoke about earlier, such as those in the mobile vans and those trading from their homes.</P>
    <P>Anyone has the right to apply for either import or retail registration at a suggested cost, by the video industry, of £1,000 per importer or £150 per retailer, which would make the scheme self-financing. In considering the argument about cost, the fact that the video industry, and in particular the Video Alliance of Ireland, are prepared to suggest a contribution of that enormous amount, particularly for the importation of video recording equipment, is a measure of the constructive nature of their submissions to the Department in order to outlaw this unsatisfactory development.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not include any provision for classification.  The Film Censor will either allow a title to be in or out.  This is not sufficient.  A grading system should be part of the certification for any video film passed for viewing.  At a minimum, it is suggested that this should be below 18 years, or over 18 years, or banned altogether.  It would be an offence in that case to supply an over 18 film to anyone under that age.  Classification would serve as a guideline to both retailers and parents or adults as to the contents of the video.  Films are made which are suitable for adult viewing, but not for children of 12 years of age.  Non-classification of passed films does not take this into account and will ultimately lower the threshold of what material should be passed.  This would limit legal choice of film titles available but it would serve to nurture the aforementioned underground and illegal market.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about wording in the Bill, namely, the phrase in subsections (3) and (6), paragraph 1 &mdash;&ldquo;unfit for general viewing&rdquo;.  In cinematic terms, general viewing implies films that are suitable for any age.  This could have the effect of reducing availability and choice to a dramatically restrictive level and create an unrealistic pressure on the office of the Film Censor.  Home video cassettes could be banned while the films <Col N="1219" /> could still be seen on general release in the cinema.</P>
    <P>I submit it is tremendously important that we have a classification system so that we may have some control on the type of equipment and material being submitted for viewing.  In the course of his remarks the Minister referred to the certification of &ldquo;pirated&rdquo; tapes.  There is no provision in the Bill excluding the Film Censor from giving an official Government certificate to an illegal operator if this material is submitted for reviewing. There could be a situation where material illegally imported into this country and being viewed illegally could be stamped by the Film Censor without his knowing it.</P>
    <P>The situation could arise where a Government certificate would certify the illegal product.  The Bill needs to be tightened to ensure that this does not happen and the way it can be tightened is by registration.  This would ensure that the censor would know who has the right to legally import the genuine article, or who has not.  I reiterate that the legal video industry in this country is one which employs about 2,000 people.  It has an annual turnover of £28 million.  It is an industry that is growing but it has been growing out of hand because of the tremendous amount of piracy of equipment over the past few years.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to the remarks made in relation to the Copyright Act of 1963. I understand there are proposals before the Dáil at present in relation to this matter.  At present the video market represents about 50 per cent of the industry. The maximum penalty for any article is £5 and in this day and age it is completely outdated.  This should be increased immediately to a more realistic level.  It is vital from an enforcement viewpoint that the penalties should be substantially increased to a level of about £5,000, with mandatory imprisonment for a second offence.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about coming to grips with the copyright material we have to be serious about the impositions we are prepared to put into law in relation to the <Col N="1220" /> Copyright Act.  Speaking in terms of £5 up to a maximum £100 is completely a farce.  It is only making a joke of the seriousness of this particular piracy that is taking place.  The present definition covers all past forms of film delivery.  The difficulty with this definition, however, lies in its inability to protect new forms of delivery through ever-evolving technology; for example, compact disc videos.  This is something that the Bill will have to face up to.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to keep pace with technology.  As technology is continuously improving the enforcement procedures are going to be even more difficult to put into operation, with people gradually finding new ways of erasing material, copying material and pirating it.  Technology in the United States, in particular, in this area has found its way to Europe and to Ireland. It has shown the significant contribution that technology is making to the expansion of piracy in the video industry.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to express my serious concern to the Minister.  I was disturbed to learn of a recent newspaper report in Dublin which stated that teenagers are being lured to engage in the manufacture of video nasties.  In lower socio-economic groups and where there is high unemployment unfortunate young people are vulnerable to this type of activity.  The person responsible for the exploitation of these young people should not be spared in law.  I hope the necessary provisions are included in this Bill to deal adequately with the upsurge of this type of modern film-making.  The Minister has come out very strongly against this sort of activity.  He mentioned on television in the course of an interview that the full rigours of the law will be imposed on these particular culprits, who are using and abusing the characters of young people in order to lure them into financial gain.  This is dispicable in the modern world.</P>
    <P>The Bill must include powers of registration and classification and give the Garda enough power to enable them to deal with the enormous problems that exist, particularly in the lower socioeconomic <Col N="1221" /> groups in our society, where, because of the high level of unemployment and the low level of unemployment assistance, young people are seeking ways in which they can get their hands on any source of finance.  I would hate to see a society developing where the thin edge of the wedge, as it were, is being applied here.  The Minister has a responsibility to stamp it out.</P>
    <P>If the Minister listens carefully to the arguments being put forward for registration and classification, and acts on them, the video industry will grow and the piracy of video recording material will be eliminated to the benefit of the younger people in society who are being led up the garden path, as it were, by the people I have mentioned.  I welcome the Bill and I look forward on Committee Stage to assisting the Minister in improving it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to welcome this Bill.  It was necessary to introduce it as soon as possible.  In recent years video films have become a very popular medium of entertainment.  Thousands of video films must have been released in Ireland over the past few years and the vast majority are harmless.  However, there are some films that are so violent or pornographic that they are a danger to those who see them.  Those films fall into two groups &mdash; the extremely violent films known as video nasties, and the pornographic films which depict explicit sexual scenes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Video Recordings Bill is to ensure that no obscene video films are allowed on the market in the future and that those already on the market are prohibited.  There has been extensive research on whether the viewing of violent or pornographic films cause harm.  An informal group of parliamentarians promoted a research project on violent video films in the United Kingdom in 1983.  In the foreward of a book published about the project, Video Violence and Children, Lord Coggan, former Archbishop of Canterbury, wrote that they were very harmful to children. He said the case is overwhelmingly made that video nasties are seen by a surprisingly <Col N="1222" /> large percentage of the young and that the effect of many of them is alarmingly harmful, that a video containing a combination of violence and sex is a potential mental and moral health hazard of a kind we have not experienced before.  In the United States the Attorney General's commission on pornography which reported in 1986 concluded that pornography is harmful.</P>
    <P>There is a Video Recording Act in England for the control and supply of video films.  The censorship authority in England may ban the supply of some films and may limit the supply of others through a classification system.  In that English Act there are six classifications. First, there is the classification &mdash; films suitable for all.  Classification No. two relates to films particularly suitable for children; No. three, general viewing but some scenes may be unsuitable for children; No. four, suitable for persons of 15 years and over, not to be supplied to any person under that age; No. five, suitable for persons of 18 years and over, not to be supplied to any person under that age. Then there are films that can be shown in licensed sex shops to persons not less than 18 years of age.  I do not think that system would work in Ireland.</P>
    <P>If we introduced a system here which allowed pornographic films to be seen by persons over 18 years old, it would be completely ineffective.  Such videos would definitely be seen by people under 18 years.  It is important that we ban the pornographic films completely to save our young people from seeing them.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable publicity from time to time about the availability of extremely violent video films or pornographic video films.  There have been claims that some violent films have led to crimes being committed by the people who saw them.  Other comments relate to the fact that frequent viewing of obscene videos or very violent films causes dulling of the viewers' sensitivity in relation to violence or pornography.</P>
    <P>The Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism issued a report on video nasties in June 1986.  They said legislation should be introduced as a <Col N="1223" /> matter of urgency to accept the international coding system for classifying video recordings for audience suitability. This would have the effect of making any trade in unlicensed material, such as video nasties, unlawful.  This would be an important step in meeting the demand that the most objectionable video nasties should be banned.</P>
    <P>The Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism said that the terms of reference of the film censor should be extended to enable him to consider any appeal against the classification of any video recording.  If the film censor considers that a classification is unsuitable he should be empowered to alter it. Additional censors should be appointed to deal with this work.  There should be a mix of male and female censors.  If necessary, temporary arrangements should be made to deal with any initial large number of referrals to the censor. Any retail outlet for the sale or hire of video recordings should be licensed.  This function should be carried out by the local authorities.  The legislation should provide for heavy penalties, including imprisonment, for anyone trading in unclassified video recordings.  As I said, these are recomendations in the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism report which was issued in June 1986.</P>
    <P>Our Minister for Justice has introduced this very necessary Bill.  There is great demand for it.  The real purpose of the Bill is to prohibit the supply of video films which are unfit for general viewing because of conduciveness to crime and incitement on the grounds of race, nationality, or religion, or of obscenity that is pornographic, indecency or gross violence.  Our party gave a commitment in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and in our justice and criminal law reform that we would introduce legislation.  Now it is here before the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that no new films may be released on the market without being passed by the film censor and that the film censor may make a prohibition order in respect of obscene films already <Col N="1224" /> on the market.  I also notice that there will be heavy penalties for persons supplying new video films without getting a supply certificate from the film censor.  There will also be a fine for those who continue to supply films in respect of which a prohibition order has been made.</P>
    <P>There is a clear need for the powers proposed in this Bill.  We had power to control the content of cinema films and publications since the foundation of the State.  It is anomalous that we have not had power to control the contents of video films or publications.  Many public representatives, groups active in youth welfare, and parents have spoken out in recent years against the obscene films that are freely available.  People who have occasion to view them have expressed shock and deep concern at the horrific content of films such as &ldquo;Driller Killer&rdquo; and &ldquo;I Spit on Your Grave&rdquo;.  The contents of those films cannot do anyone any good.  The likelihood is that they have a serious adverse effect on some viewers. There can be no argument but that films of this nature should be prohibited.</P>
    <P>As well as extremely violent films there are a considerable number of pornographic films in circulation.  Those films cannot be of any benefit to the viewers and must be a serious threat to the moral attitudes of some people who view them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I congratulate the Minister for Justice on having introduced it.  It was very necessary to have the Bill introduced as soon as possible especially in view of the fact that, because since the State was formed films have been subject to censorship, video films should also be subject to censorship.  It is a very opportune time to introduce the Bill to ensure young people will not view films which are quite unsuitable for them. I congratulate the Minister on introducing the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the issues where liberals like myself are confronted with their own liberalism and very often try to duck.  I have no problems in principle with the stated intent of this Bill.  I have read too much, I have seen a little and I am too much aware of what is going <Col N="1225" /> on in the world to be able to stand up and espouse a no censorship cause.</P>
      <P>With certain spectacular exceptions, which would always exist, our censorship rules in the areas of books and films work reasonably well at this stage.  They do not by and large exclude any material anybody would argue was of reasonable merit and tend to move towards the side of liberalism in terms of what is allowed to be sold and to be displayed in the cinemas.</P>
      <P>There are people with far longer and far better established liberal credentials than mine who take exception to some films.  I notice the Minister was careful not to mention the names of these films and I do not particularly want to either because I do not have the influence the Minister has.  I do not want to add anything to the notoriety of some of these films since there will be a large hiatus between now and the time the legislation will be in force.  However, there have been exceptions.  In some cases I have taken different views from some people on some of the films that have been passed by the censor in recent times.</P>
      <P>I do not have a video recorder but recently I visited a member of my family and we decided we would like to watch a film.  I visited a video recording rental premises and it was a difficult enough exercise to find a film that I had heard of because most of them seem to be totally independent of the cinema and of a faint tinge of blue.  I do not think they were particularly harmful or pornographic. However, I selected a film and while I was waiting for it to be wrapped I saw a black folder on the counter which I presumed to be a price list.  I thumbed through it and it turned out to be the under the counter range of videos available. Senator Robb is asking me for the address of the shop.  They were not video nasties but they were clearly exploitative in intent.  The words inside the cover were, &ldquo;porno for pleasure&rdquo;.  This happened in a big video rental shop in Dublin and confirmed what I had suspected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the magazines available in shops&mdash; and this is a problem we might address later on &mdash; which deal in the general video <Col N="1226" /> industry there is a section devoted to what they call &ldquo;adult videos&rdquo;.  In one review the reviewer marks the videos on a scale of one to five on the basis of what he calls his lustometer.  I do not say this in any way to provide cheap headlines or anything, but because the attitudes and the values that underlie that particular industry are essentially exploitative, degrading and, in particular, degrading of women.</P>
    <P>Sadly there is a new industry building up &mdash; I do not know the extent to which it has entered the video market yet &mdash; which relates to the exploitation of children. In some ways this deserves specific reference in a Bill like this.  I know it is implied in it.  There is a particular revulsion shared by people with a range of views and attitudes against the whole issue of censorship.  One issue we are all agreed on is that any exploitation of children in the area pornography is a particularly appalling offence against children.  Why it is done is a separate issue.  I could make a long speech about income constraints, etc., but the exploitation of children in the area of pornography is particularly offensive.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I accept there is a problem.  We must remember what the problem is.  The problem is not what used to be the historical justification of censorship: people who portray themselves are masqueraded as artists with a urge to express themselves at this stage.  There may well be pornographic films made by people who have good credentials in the area of film making, as there may well be books many people would view as pornographic.  The difficulty with pornography is that society's view of what pornography is varies from generation to generation.  Not long ago there was an attempt to ban <i>Lady Chatterly's Lover</i> in Britain.  It is now on sale in this country and I do not think anybody would even bother submitting it to the Censorship of Publications Board because nobody believes any more that <i>Lady Chatterly's Lover</i> is particularly pornographic.  Perhaps some people do.  I have got mail which suggests that the country began to go downhill once the Minister's predecessor, <Col N="1227" /> Deputy Lenihan, liberalised the laws on both literature and films.  I do not share that view.  There is a difficulty there.</P>
    <P>The problem with the video industry is that it is now relatively easy to make videos.  It is easy to make offensive, violent, corrupting productions.  There is a small scale equipment involved, a small scale of studios involved and ease of editing, if these people even bother with such niceities as editing.  There is easy access to the equipment.  In the old days making a film involved access to fairly considerable ranges of equipment which involved lighting and so on.  A lot of this can be bypassed now.  At the core of the problem is that it is now relatively easy to make videos that apparently have limitless demand.  For expenditure of perhaps £400,000 or £500,000, vast sums of money are there for the taking and obviously only the maker of the video will make anything.  Nobody imagines that the misfortunate wretches who participate in these videos will get anything other than a miserable few pounds.</P>
    <P>What we are regulating is the commercial exploitation element of this.  If there were not a fast buck, and as a friend of mine says big bucks, to be made out of this, there would be very little in the area of pornography available in any area of human consumption, if I can use that phrase.  We want to keep the two things separate.  Ultimately the problem is the capacity to make money out of something and what we have to prevent is people making money out of human degradation. That is extremely important.</P>
    <P>The fact that videos are relatively cheap to make is also something that has provided all sorts of extraordinary benefits.  One example that crossed my mind was when the club from my home town recently won the county championship for the first time in nearly 50 years, somebody produced a professional video on the match which is on sale for £20.  That could never have been done in the days before video recorders were developed.  Therefore, it is something that produces all sorts of benefits.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1228" /> I am very glad the Minister has tried very hard in this Bill to distinguish between the video nasties and the video recordings that are making all sorts of things available to people in family life, in film making at local level on a small scale, in education, in training, in marketing, in industry, and so on.  He has tried to make distinctions so that the people who are doing all the things with video recorders that would not have been possible with the previous techniques of film making are not burdened down with a series of regulations that would make life almost impossible for them.  I am very glad about that, and I am glad the Bill recognises the extent to which video recorders are almost a part of family life at this stage, a part of people's weddings, etc.</P>
    <P>However, like any exception it can be exploited.  What I am talking about is what I referred to earlier: with the opportunity to make cheap films comes exploitation. It is important that it is not just exploitation of the consumer that is involved.  There is the equally offensive exploitation of the people who have to participate in these films.  It is reasonable to suggest that if men or women are in a position where they feel they must or should participate in the sort of productions that masquerade as entertainment in this area, they are being exploited as is the viewer, or the consumer. There is a case to be made that, to the extent that it is possible to be controlled, those who make videos like that an those who supply or distribute them should be seen to be committing a crime.  That many represent no more than society's intent.</P>
    <P>The Minister said there is a borderline. However, society is unanimous that those who make exploitative, gross, violent films are offending against society.  This is a legitimate area where society could say that to make films like that is a crime, or to make films like that with an intent to sell for commercial purposes is a crime. Of course most of these videos are being made outside the country at this stage.</P>
    <P>If there is a demand for such productions in this country and if we manage <Col N="1229" /> to regulate the importation of such videos, we may find a small industry mushrooming here to replace the diet from outside the country.  Therefore, there is a case to be made that, apart from supply and distribution, the making of those films which involve exploitation of other people deserves to be considered an offence in itself.</P>
    <P>Another exploitation is the exploitation of freedom that is involved in something like this.  In the days when we did not accept freedom of expression and freedom of opinion as a natural democratic right, it was difficult to circulate pornography.  It is no coincidence that there is an absence of pornography in most, though not all in recent times, repressive regimes.</P>
    <P>One of the things most people notice about Eastern Europe and China is the virtual absence of pornography.  I do not believe that is because they have developed a more virtuous race, even though my politics might appear to some people to be orientated in that direction. I use the word &ldquo;appear&rdquo; because I know where my politics are orientated.  It does make clear that there is a relationship between pornography and freedom and that a free society will always have difficulty in dealing with the limits of freedom of expression and that one of the areas of freedom of expression has to do with those areas of life which are seen to impinge on pornography.  Sport does not impinge on the area of pornography although if you look at the prosecutions in Glasgow at present you begin to wonder. There are areas of life which are seen to represent values which have to be protected.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister and all the Members here at present are male it is important that men should accept the fact that they are the overwhelming consumers of pornography. All men have an obligation to reflect on the culture, the values and the attitudes they often display more in all male company than they do when perhaps they feel more inhibited.  It is not an industry which is equally consumed by both sexes.  It is by and large a male orientated, male dominated and male <Col N="1230" /> financed industry.  For that reason men in particular have to be extremely sensitive about their own attitudes and their often implied attitudes towards women and to the values they hold when they talk about women.</P>
    <P>There is still much to be done about the way all of us think about women, the attitudes we display to them and the slightly exploitative attitude many of us display.  I am not in any way claiming moral superiority in this.  I am addressing it as a man to other men.  We are the consumers of pornography.  The whole industry is directed towards us and there must be something in the attitudes of men generally which has left that commercial demand there.</P>
    <P>Because of the extraordinary profits that are to be made and the extraordinary explosion in the home video area, it is clear that there is a need to regulate the video industry.  I do not think there is any doubt about that.  There is a need to regulate access to videos and the production of those videos.  Most of us may be protected from these through this legislation but it will not necessarily guarantee that children and women will not be exploited in the making of them, even if it is only for an underground market.  It should not simply be the people who supply the videos who commit an offence but if we can identify who makes them, that should be an offence in itself as well.  We all agree in principle about regulation but the question arises as to how.</P>
    <P>The Minister described the video nasties in his press conference and he invited anybody who did not believe him to view one.  I was prepared to take the Minister's word for it because I have no desire to see these films.  I find that sort of violence extremely difficult to take and I find a considerable amount of what is acceptable in the cinema extremely difficult to take.  I do not think any of us have any problem in relation to video nasties.  They are clearly intent on exploiting cruelty, violence, human dismemberment, etc. There is no artistic freedom or other basis for justifying the display, sale or supply <Col N="1231" /> of those videos.</P>
    <P>The difficulty arises when we get into what is called pornography in the broader sense of the word.  One man's pornography literally can mean another man's work of art.  That is the history of society and it is a permanent tension. There is no point in saying that because there is tension we can, therefore, ignore the problem.  Pornography exists in many different areas and it is not right that it should be available to children in many cases and, in some cases, adults.</P>
    <P>I accept the conclusions of the United States Attorney General's commission that pornography does do harm.  I have always been amazed at the extent to which liberals, in particular, go in trying to pretend the opposite.  It is not something that most men can argue about. Pornography does have an effect on attitudes to women, on attitudes to sexual morality and it does have effects in terms of a gradual cushioning of people towards their sensitivity to cruelty and violence.</P>
    <P>I am not sure people learn from videos how to do things they would not otherwise not have done.  I totally accept that any continuous exposure to cruelty and violence of the explicit and realistic kind that is now available must gradually brutalise people and must gradually desensitise their attitude towards violence. Anyone who has lived in Northern Ireland will accept that many people in Northern Ireland have begun, because of a familiarity with violence, to lose their sensitivity, their sense of outrage and their feeling that this is cruel and awful. It may not necessarily be equally true, but it is clearly related that exposure to this sort of material has a degrading and desensitising effect on people.  That cannot be good for society.  I do not know whether or not it leads to people committing sexual offences, but I am prepared to believe it does.  There can be no doubt that it reduces sensitivity and underpins, if not exaggerates, some of the values that are less savoury in men, the macho aggression, tough guy image.</P>
    <P>The other difficulty I have identified is related to the first one.  Apart from <Col N="1232" /> defining pornography you have to define how you are going to regulate it.  These two difficulties are related.  One way of doing this is to give a very broad definition and include everything on the grounds that if there are some accidential casualties along the way at least society will have been protected from something insidious and something damaging.</P>
    <P>What the US Attorney General's commission, to which both I and the Minister referred, said is true but I want to counsel caution.  I am certain that, given the environment and the context of the United States, the definition of pornography a US congressman or a US lawyer would use would be different from the definition of pornography many Members of this House or the other House would use.  We can never be sure, unless we go through the long list of films, books or magazines that they are talking about, that we are talking about the same thing.  What they would call pornography would probably be far more extreme than what we would call pornography.  We are left with a dilemma and, like any dilemma, we have to solve it for ourselves.  No external agency will solve it for us.</P>
    <P>I want to mention three films that I have seen by way of example.  The first film is &ldquo;The Killing Fields&rdquo;, the second &ldquo;Blue Velvet&rdquo; and the third &ldquo;Betty Blue&rdquo;.  All three films received considerable critical acclaim.  &ldquo;The Killing Fields&rdquo; contains some of the most horrific scenes I have ever seen.  Yet I would absolutely and categorically defend the merits of that film.  I would not like my children to see that film.  I would refuse to allow them to see it but I would defend the quality and the merit of it as an essay in what happened in Kampuchea or, as it was then, Cambodia.  It is brutalising in its effect.  One comes out of the film absolutely drained and exhausted.  Is that film pornographic or is it the sort of film that is suitable to be distributed through a video shop?  That is the sort of issue we have to address.</P>
    <P>The second film, &ldquo;Blue Velvet,&rdquo; is a far more controversial film because it involves considerable violence towards women.  It is a good film because it raises <Col N="1233" /> worthwhile issues about male attitudes and values and about the relationship between men and women.  Again I would not like my children to see it, but I would not be prepared to believe it is pornographic.</P>
    <P>The third film, &ldquo;Betty Blue,&rdquo; has been quite a success.  It is a superb film.  It also has a considerable amount of quite explicit scenes of sexual activity.  I am not revealing any secrets here.  This has been well discussed in the newspapers.  Like most public representatives I do not see as many films as I would like to.  However I have succeeded in catching up on films from time to time through video recordings. It is one way for people who cannot get to a cinema to catch up on good films.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to those three films in terms of the way the Bill has defined the problem.  The only difficulty I have is in this area.  They are all superb films and they are all available through the cinema. I want to clear up whether it is the Minister's intent in this legislation that films available in the cinema could not or should not in some or many cases be available as video recordings for the reasons he has stated.  I do not think my children should see these three films.  I do not think children of 12, 13 or 14 years should see them.  I am not sure whether children of 15, 16, 17 or 18 years should see them.  The only people who could possibly decide whether children of 15 or 16 years should see films like these are the parents.  I do not believe anybody else in society could determine that.  A film like that seen in a family environment where what was contained in it would be talked about between the children and their parents would not only not necessarily be harmful, but it could be good.  It could generate communication between parents and their children which could be very healthy and very good for both parents and children.  All the films contain things that I would not like children to have access to.  I will come back to that later on.</P>
    <P>Part of the problem of defining pornography is that you have to try to read the mind of the maker.  The real underlying <Col N="1234" /> question involved in pornography is the intent of the person who makes the film.  I am not saying that should be the exclusive criterion for judging the quality or merit of a film and whether it should be available.  One criterion that is true is that, where the intent is to degrade or to undermine anybody, the film should not be available.  I have no objection to the banning of films which are made with a simple commercial intent to sell something on the basis of sex, or violence, or both.  There is no basic principle or freedom of expression involved.  There is no new, original or dissenting idea contained in it.  It is an exploitation of our tolerance by certain individuals to make money.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that we do not want X cinemas mushrooming here as they have in Britain.  We are not suffering anything by being deprived of the sort of films shown in those cinemas.  We do not need a censorship regime which allows those films in.  I do not see any value which is threatened by banning those sorts of films and I do not see any value which would be advanced by making them available.  We do not need those films; we have enough problems.  We should realise that the absence of access to those films will not for one second guarantee that the demand will disappear.</P>
    <P>I am amazed at the remoteness of the locations of some video clubs.  Mobile video clubs travel around some of the most remote parts of rural Ireland.  I do not know what they are selling but they seem to be available everywhere.  I do not think that involves nasty people deciding to go out and corrupt people.  I believe there is a demand for that material and the demand will not go away because the material becomes more restrictive or less available.  There is a problem there.  I do not believe that the proposals of the video association will in any way regulate that demand but we would not want to fool ourselves into thinking that the demand will go away simply and solely because we will prevent the official channels using them.</P>
    <P>That is why I have a difficulty, not with <Col N="1235" /> the intent of the Bill, but with the detail of it.  It is a detail I would like to clear up now.  I would classify a film like &ldquo;Rambo&rdquo; as being utterly and totally pornographic because it is there for two reasons and both of them are referred to in the Bill. One reason is to glorify violence and the second is to incite hatred against another race, in this case the Vietnamese people. I want to say in passing for the record that &ldquo;Rambo&rdquo; was Ronald Reagan's favourite movie but that is not the reason I formed that impression of it.  I formed that impression because I detest the use and exploitation of violence.</P>
    <P>We as a society have got our sights a little bit wrong about pornography because we do not give the same emphasis to pornographic violence as we do to pornographic sex.  I would argue that pornographic violence is far more likely to damage young people, to offend their sensitivities and to damage them emotionally than would a lot of what is described as pornographic sex.  This Bill is extremely worthwhile in its emphasis on the cruelty and violent aspects of video films that should not be tolerated in our society.</P>
    <P>A television programme like &ldquo;Dallas&rdquo; which is extremely popular has a capacity to corrupt and deprave because of the implied lack of values that underlines that programme.  There are no nude scenes in this programme but there is an attitude of exploitation of women, an attitude on sexual morality and an attitude on very important human values which is totally a moral and, because it is available in a non-censorious way, the sort of value that it implies can begin to seep through to people's lives.  I would not like my children to watch &ldquo;Dallas&rdquo;. It has an implied set of values which I find quite offensive.  I do not believe it should be banned.  I am not saying that. What I am saying is that all of us have different attitudes to pornography and, therefore, we have a difficulty in deciding where the boundary lies.</P>
    <P>My problem, therefore, is not with the objective of the Bill; it is with some of <Col N="1236" /> the wording.  I may not have a major problem with this.  I have no intention of opposing the Bill.  I have a problem with the wording and perhaps the Minister could clarify this for me.  Is it the intent or is it the Minister's understanding that films which are currently available for display in the cinemas will not be available for supply as videos?  That is the nub of the problem.  Our film censorship procedures work quite well.  The boundary line between what is permitted and what is not is reasonable.  We can all have exceptions but the boundary works quite well.  We have available to us virtually all of the worthwhile films that are made, along with a considerable amount of rubbish, some of which is close to being pornographic and so on, but we have a reasonably effective system.  That, of course, depends on the person who is appointed as film censor and depends on the appeal board as well.  Given that we have reasonably sensible people, like the Minister, appointing these people we are not going to have Family Solidarity taking over the Censorship of Films Appeal Board or becoming the film censor either. We are not going to have problems like that.</P>
    <P>What I wonder about is the phrase &ldquo;unfit for general viewing&rdquo;.  Does that mean general viewing as in the general context of films which are available for general viewing, or does it mean that the censor is to look through the number of criteria there and if it offends fundamentally against one of those criteria it is, therefore, unfit for viewing?  I accept the general view of the Minister that the complexities of age regulations are far too difficult to be justified.  All you can do in an area like this is to be quite certain that the absolutely offensive is excluded and, after that, leave it to parents to regulate what their children are doing.  I do not think you can try to take the place of parents.  What deserves to be excluded is what all of us identify as being revolting. What also deserves to be excluded is that which is quite clearly made with the intent of being sold simply because if its sexual content and its explicit violent content.  I quite accept that, but what <Col N="1237" /> bothers me is the putting together of the phrase &ldquo;unfit for general viewing&rdquo; in section 3.</P>
    <P>I have a letter from a particular interest group which suggests that most of what is going on in the cinemas at present would tend to deprave or corrupt.  Other people would feel that most of what goes on in cinemas is quite harmless.  Many people feel that many of the plays shown in Dublin tend to corrupt or deprave.  I do not.  I think we are long beyond the day when a stage show of a kind that is seen in Dublin corrupts or depraves anybody.  The censor's view is that he has to adjudicate on whether something is unfit for general viewing.  Is that because he thinks something in it would corrupt or deprave a ten year old child or an adult?  If the Minister were to explain what is on view here, we would have far less difficulties or at least I would have far less difficulties with this Bill.</P>
    <P>My own view is that the Bill would be greatly improved if written into it was a simple proviso that the censor cannot refuse a supply certificate to any film approved for distribution to the cinemas in this country; in other words, the provisions of all of this Bill would apply to videos which are not certified as being fit for display whetever the age restriction in cinemas.  That would only be a small number of the videos available, but it would ensure that those films on video, which are backed by reasonably competent distribution networks and produced by and large by reasonably competent film-makers and film companies, would not in any way be excluded as videos and be available in the cinemas. I know that will include films that are not suitable for children but the alternative is to have two standards, one of which presumes that parents will not regulate what their children see and the other which presumes that because they are only available in cinemas children will not see them.  I do not think that will work.  If it is not made clear that we are applying a cut-off point, which is what is available in the cinemas &mdash; and since the whole job is being done by the same person there will be no problems with consistency &mdash; we will run into all sorts <Col N="1238" /> of administrative problems later on.</P>
    <P>A simple proviso added to the Bill that no film which is acceptable to the censor for display in a cinema &mdash; and that decision should be taken by the censor simply on its merits as a film for display in the cinema &mdash; should be refused a supply certificate.  The censor could then concentrate his mind on the amounts of rubbish and second-rate pornography swamping the video shops which have no artistic merit whatsoever and which, incidentally, by and large, would not survive more than two days in the cinema because no sensible cinema going person would bother going to see them.  There is a fair amount of evidence that some of the occasional soft pornography that passes through the censor's office does not survive more than a couple of days in our cinemas.  I do not think there would be any problem if that were to be made clear so that we would have consistent standards.</P>
    <P>I do not think we can balance society's rights in such a way that we decide to regulate video recordings in a way which is excessively protective of children.  If you do that, you will simply drive a whole area of activity underground.  There has to be a reasonable balance between this and people's needs.  If it was made clear that we were talking about films which were not permitted to be displayed in cinemas we would not have any problems. I accept the Minister's view that to impose a 15 to 18 age limit on grading for the huge number of videos on the market would be an impossible task.  It is a difficult enough task as it stands.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I congratulate and compliment the Minister on it.  It is long overdue and I ask the Minister to consider some of the difficulties where satellite TV is either here or is about to arrive.  I was sitting down one night drinking a drop of whiskey before I went to sleep and turned a film on in our local satellite channel and it was so extraordinary that I spent the night laughing at it.  I have yet to see such an imaginative way of filling an hour and a half with different sexual positions masquerading as a film.</P>

      <P>The film did not put me to sleep but it did not keep me awake either.  I am happy with the Bill, provided we can tidy up some of the definitions in it.  I do not want us to believe we can go back to what were called &ldquo;the good old days&rdquo; when, in the words of a former Member of the other House &ldquo;before television we had no sex in this country&rdquo;. The human suffering that resulted from previous Irish attitudes to sexuality are nothing that we should joke about but anybody who reads John McGahern, Joyce or Patrick Kavanagh will have a pretty good idea of how people suffered in what were regarded as the old days of innocence.  They were not old days of innocence.  They were old days of ignorance and people unaware of their own sexuality, unable to talk about it, unable to express their own feelings of guilt about the whole thing, were no great asset to this country and we were no great asset to ourselves.  There is no way of going back to that attitude.  What we will have to do is deal with the way we are now and we have a right to be protected from gross exploitation.  That, I am sure, is the Minister's intent.  The only argument I might have with him is whether his intent as he has stated it can be met without some amendments at a later stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too would like to welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister on bringing it before the House.  In recent years there has been a growing public concern about some of the video works which are being openly supplied to young people and which are being exhibited in the presence of young people.  The expression &ldquo;video nasties&rdquo; has become part of our everyday language and the total lack of any legal restrictions on the supply of videos has become a source of grave concern to parents, teachers and everybody concerned with the well-being of our young people and the development of our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1240" /> Many eminent psychiatrists have linked the increase in certain types of crime to the availability of video nasties. For example, the increase in child sexual abuse in recent years is not surprising given the large number of videos now freely available.  Indeed, the increase in the incidence of rape and ther acts of violence is equally unsurprising and for the same reason.  Moreover, the constant exposure to scenes of violence does influence attitudes and values.  Although the fourth report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights, published last year, stated that there was no proof of a definite link between the availability of video nasties and the increase in the number of serious sexual crimes against women the fact is that, if acts of rape and torture are presented on film as being normal, it may be that such videos will be copied in real life.  Our society is already affected enough by crime without permitting the availability of video nasties.</P>
    <P>In addition, we must be concerned about the quality of life in our society and respect each and every individual member of our society, especially children. They are entitled to the fullest legislative protection from the danger of these videos just as much as they are entitled to protection from all other evils in our society.  Although videos are a comparatively recent development and are now as common as radios and televisions, there has been little attempt to set out guidelines to deal with them, not that videos have no uses &mdash; or course they have &mdash; but the point is that we must regulate the abuses.  This is what this Bill proposes to do.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions, Fianna Fáil, in Opposition, raised this problem with growing concern and pledged legislative action on return to office.  The Minister has now honoured that promise and I welcome the general thrust of this Bill. At this stage, it is not appropriate for me to refer in depth to the details of the measures proposed.  However, I will make one observation.  In section 3 of the Bill &mdash; the section which deals with the certification of video works &mdash; only one <Col N="1241" /> distinction is made between videos: whether they are acceptable or unacceptable for general viewing.  However, videos which may be suitable for adult viewing are often unsuitable for children. Under this Bill, it is the official censor who decides what videos are acceptable for general viewing.</P>
    <P>It could be argued that the censor should have clear powers to classify videos according to suitability for different age groups.  This is only a minor reservation and it is offered with the desire to strengthen the Bill.  The Bill will fill a vacuum which has been in existence for far too long.  This Bill is a most welcome piece of legislation and should command the support of all parties in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Senators in welcoming this legislation. Most Senators and people in public life are very pleased that the Bill has been introduced.  We recognise that the Minister and those who assisted him in drafting the Bill had a very difficult task because it is a fairly wide area to cover. There are many areas of the whole video business that can be abused and it is very difficult to have a fool-proof detection system.  Most of us are aware of this. Different sections of the community are concerned about one aspect or another and the harmful results to young viewers, and so on.  There are many different areas where we have different concerns.  It will be difficult to police and to have effective control even after the legislation is enacted.  Sometimes I am in an area where I can get a number of channels.  I am sure they are available all over the country.  In some of the channels, there are late programmes and late viewing, some of which would come into the category of meriting examination by the censor.  In those areas I do not know what can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now subject to films, videos and television programmes from outside the country and outside our control.  It is a very big question.  This is a welcome start and undoubtedly the legislation now being introduced will be supervised and updated on a regular basis.  It is an area that has been neglected and I would put <Col N="1242" /> down the neglect &mdash; if that is not too strong a word to use &mdash; to the fact that it is so difficult to have full control.  It is easy to buy a video outside the country and put it in your pocket and, whether you are travelling across the frontier or in an aeroplane it is almost impossible to control the use of it.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with those who are in the legitimate video business, producing good sound video copy here in the State. They have no sustain themselves and sustain their business.  They too have a major problem.  This Bill will give some encouragement to those people because the State does not turn a blind eye completely to all abuses.  I hope this is a start and will make all of us a bit more aware of the seriousness of the whole business.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the video recording business is that videos are very expensive. That tends to encourage those involved in copying videos.  I questioned this recently and I was told that a big part of the cost of videos goes towards paying the performing rights association.  I would like another opportunity to question how legal this is.  We are forced to pay a contribution towards that association which is based outside the jurisdiction.  I have long standing experience and I have never fully accepted that we are part of it here.  I know the performing rights association, initially based in the UK, has an office here.  It is a big organisation and one that is not very easy to understand. I doubt that the £10 or a very large portion of the cost of the video goes towards the performer or the artist.  There is a big rip-off somewhere.</P>
    <P>As we are now getting involved in the control of videos it is opportune that we should all take an interest in the cost of videos, the cost to the general public and what makes up that cost.  We should be aware of the amount included in the cost which represents the performers' and the artists' fees for making the video in the first instance.  The portion of costs going to the performing rights association is a grey area and has got to be looked at.  It would help the whole video industry if we tidied up the question of the cost of the videos.  If the video film sale price to <Col N="1243" /> the public here was reasonable and if we were not paying such a large amount towards a performing rights association which might or might not be justified, that would also be a contribution towards making a healthier industry here.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to support the Bill.  I hope we will continue to have more supervision of the whole video business and the type of films, and that we will have machinery to watch and control it.  I hope we will update the legislation on a regular basis.</P>

      <P>While I would say normally, on the introduction of a Bill, &ldquo;I welcome it&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am glad it is here&rdquo; or whatever, I have to say I regret that legislation like this is necessary in our society.  It is very sad that there is such exploitation and that videos called video nasties or video films which exploit women and show depraved sex and violence are such a very big money spinner and are such a problem in western society generally.</P>
      <P>I am reminded of the publicity surrounding the introduction of a similar Bill in Westminister some time ago when a decision was taken that some of the video nasties would be shown to some of the legislators.  It was on record that they could not stick them.  Most of them had to leave.  They could not sit through what was being shown.  I am not suggesting that we should put on a show for Senators and TDs here to see exactly what we are talking about but I question whether some of my colleagues fully understand what we are dealing with.  Some time recently when we were discussing restricting or prohibiting these videos, one legislator spoke about a video nasty being a late night showing on RTE where a singer had a pint of Guinness in one hand and a cigar in the other and he thought that was a video nasty.  Similarly he suggested that when RTE show documentary films of Africa they show women undressed on top.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that perhaps not everybody has a very clear idea of exactly what we are talking about.  We are talking about <Col N="1244" /> a grim, nasty trade in despicable films which corrupt and have been known to influence people's behaviour.  I speak as a parent.  With the exception of one documentary from RTE which dealt with the subject of video nasties, I have not actually looked at them or looked at any true blue movies or videos.  I have not had the time or the interest.</P>
    <P>As a parent of three young people, I have had moments of concern over the years.  My youngest one told me she was going to a video party in somebody's house and she would not be back until 1 a.m. or so.  As a parent you are caught in a dilemma because into your mind comes the thought of all the horrible videos a young person could have rented out for a night.  Perhaps their parents are away and they are giving a treat to all their friends.  That causes me some concern. One then is put in the position of doing the kind of censoring I would not do.  I do not think most parents would like to check out what their children see and who rented it out.  It would be much better if parents knew that young people could not rent or buy videos of a thoroughly undesirable nature.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I still accept that the ultimate responsibility lies with the parent where there are young impressionable teenagers, or even younger than teenagers involved.  Whatever legislation or regulations we introduce it does not take the onus from the parents to be aware of what kind of videos their young people are looking at.  This legislation has drawn a great deal of interest.  Of course, there have been demands for legislation like this for quite some time.  For the first time, when I knew this Bill was coming in, I read the 10th Report of the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism.  That report on the control of video nasties, which was brought out one and a half years ago, is very helpful and I am quite sure was helpful to the Minister and his officials.  The recommendations they made in that report were not followed in the Bill.  Interest in it from all kinds of groups has been quite intensive and great lobbying has gone on for at least a couple of months; greater lobbying <Col N="1245" /> than I have experienced on most other legislation.</P>
    <P>On the one hand we have the groups who want to ban and prohibit with great abandonment and who were rather gleefully looking forward to this legislation in the hope that it would censor videos away and beyond what might be needed and, on the other hand, we had submissions and representations from organisations like the Irish Housewives' Association, who are genuinely concerned for children, and others like the group called CASE &mdash; Campaign Against Sexual Exploitation &mdash; who are concerned about women.  We have, in this instance, a most unexpected coalition of interests who are watching this Bill and will be interested in its passage through both Houses.</P>
    <P>Perhaps at this point I should say that I am tempermentally opposed to censorship for adults.  Indeed, I regret very much that this year we saw the censorship and withdrawal of a serious book called <i>The Joy of Sex</i> which was taken off our shelves.  It was a victim of censorship and unfairly so.  I would prefer if we were living in a society where we could see less rather than more censorship.  I accept the reality and I realise this Bill is not being brought forward on a whim.  The objective of course should be that adults could make mature decisions for themselves on what they would read or watch on television, or how much they would drink, or what they would purchase in a video.  In both the prohibiting and controlling of films or videos we have to ask who is to decide what has to be prohibited for all Irish people or what has to be regulated for which group?  What training insights or wisdoms does that person who is to do the examination and censorship have?  I have no reason to doubt that our film censor is a very reasonable man but I would like to know what are his personal guidelines apart from the broad grounds laid down in section 3 (1), of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Having stated my view in general on censorship, I accept that there is public demand for intervention.  We have seen in the past five or six years an incredible growth in the video industry.  I am sure it is a conservative figure to say that there <Col N="1246" /> are about 500 outlets and 200,000 video machines.  This has led to the circulation of videos of a distressing and damaging nature.  Many of them are sadistic, violent and perverted and should certainly not be seen by young people.  It is very likely that the increase in reports of child abuse is related to such images.</P>
    <P>The figures for the increase in child abuse and the sexual abuse of children published today which were released to the Joint Committee on Women's Rights of which I am a member show that in 1986 475 cases were reported as against 240 cases the previous year.  That is a very dramatic increase.  It has been increasingly very substantially each year for the past three years.  I feel it is related somehow to the number of videos in circulation and their use.  I do not think this is so entirely but that it is related.  In this context I refer to the report of the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism.  When they were examining this matter they called in many people who were experienced and had great competence in the area of determining how much the behaviour of adults is influenced by what they read or what they see.  I quote from paragraph 66, page 18 of that report.  The Assistant Secretary in the Department of Health &mdash; Dr. Robins, advised the committee that he was completely:</P>
    <P>...misrepresented and taken out of context on the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme dealing with video nasties. He has taken this matter up with RTE, but despite two letters he has not had any response.  He is satisfied that video nasties can have a detrimental effect on young persons.  In an opening address to a Seminar on Child Sexual Abuse at the National Institute for Higher Education, Glasnevin on 18th January, 1986, Dr. Robins stated that persons concerned about child sexual abuse must give more attention to pornography. Professionals who have to deal with the victims of sexual assaults, whether these victims are women or children, sometimes find that the perpetrators <Col N="1247" /> have been incited by pornography in its various forms.  This is particularly true of some of the more violent and repulsive cases of sexual attack.  Pornography, particularly in video form, appears to be far too readily available at the moment and it is clearly necessary to review the law in this area.</P>
    <P>He goes on to give statistics on the number of child sexual abuse cases which are dated compared to what I have given. It is doubtful that anyone could seriously argue in favour of allowing video nasties to continue to be as available as they are. They are extremely violent films, by all accounts, depicting killing and appalling mutilations and ought not to be allowed to continue in circulation.  Much of the same applies to sexual pornography.</P>
    <P>However, I question how this Bill can be implemented and have the desired effect because the trade in video nasties and pornographic videos is by its very nature an under the counter operation. In this context I know of one distributor who has a code word for his blue videos: &ldquo;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&rdquo; or something like that.  When his men customers come in on a Sunday morning they give the code and he supplies them with these pornographic films.  I do not know whether they are really all that harmful but certainly he has his own coding and his customers know it.  It exists at the moment.  We need to change our copyright laws.  This case has been made to us absolutely conclusively in the lobbying and the campaign brought to bear on all legislators.</P>
    <P>I know this proposal was put to the Department prior to the Bill being drafted and I suggest it is a very valid proposal.  I suspect this Bill could fill the coffers of the pirate video industry because the legislation will not affect them.  This has to be taken seriously and it is not good enough to say: &ldquo;That is a matter for a different Department.  It has nothing to do with us and you will have to come back another time for that.&rdquo;  It has to be taken on board however it is <Col N="1248" /> done.  Many speakers will make proposals during this debate to improve the Bill. That is the whole purpose of parliament. We want legislation that is not merely window dressing but effective for the purposes intended.</P>
    <P>There are many contradictions in the Bill.  It provides for no system of classifying video films; yet films on cinema release must be submitted to the film censor who can grade them into four release categories of general, children under 12 accompanied by an adult, over 16s and over 18s, or ban them totally as well as requiring cuts to be made where he deems this necessary.  This is appropriate and right and it is the way it should be done.  We want this standard to be applied uniformly to the legislation now before us.</P>
    <P>I will give an example of this contradiction. In an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 15 October Ray Comiskey highlights where he says:</P>
    <P>There are other contradictions.  The Bill provides for no system of classifying video films.</P>
    <P>...This creates two alternatives, both ludicrous.  Take, for example director Alan Parker's, &ldquo;Angel Heart&rdquo;, due to be shown at the Dublin Film Festival and then going on commercial release in the cinema here.  It caused a furore in America because of certain sexual scenes and the way they were treated in the film.  The Irish censor has passed it with an Over 18s certificate.</P>
    <P>If and when it comes out on video, the censor will have to decide whether to give it a certificate declaring it to be &ldquo;fit for general viewing&rdquo;.  Should he do so, it will mean that a film limited for cinema release will have no such restriction as a video.  If he bans it, the film could still be seen by over 18s in the cinema while still being unavailable &mdash; at least legally &mdash; as a video.  With the illegal network thriving, the ban will merely give the video further attractiveness for exploitation by that trade.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1249" /> That is just one example of what will happen if we do not have a system of classification in this Bill.  It makes a case for proper classification.  I hope the Minister, Deputy Collins, will be open to amendments to rid the Bill of such contradictory aspects and anomalies. Indeed, there will be numerous amendments needed as this Bill makes its way through this House and the Dáil but there will be a consensus on the areas Senator Hogan, other Senators and I have highlighted, that is, the registration of retail outlets.  This will give the authorities a record of who is dealing in videos.  A further effect would be that the retailer would have to pay a sum of money to be licensed and this would finance the scheme.  There is a need for classification of videos as is the case with cinema films and increased penalties for those who offend.</P>
    <P>We have to realise that in almost all cases these films depict women in the most degrading manner as sex objects and as objects for sexual exploitation. Many people perceive this to be something that concerns women only.  It is distressing and upsetting for women to see other women used and abused in this manner.  I suggest it does not just dehumanise women; it certainly dehumanises men also.  We are all victims, men and women, in situations like this.</P>
    <P>Finally, I hope this Bill will be amended.  Certainly our party spokes-person will be putting down amendments &mdash; and I will be speaking on them &mdash; to enable us to confront the real problems caused by video nasties in society today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fortunate that the Leas-Chathaoirleach left when he did because I was going to suggest from the state he seemed to be in that what he needed most of all this afternoon was a good stimulating video.  However, that obviously does not apply to the Acting Chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As other Senators have said we must be careful to acknowledge what the video industry is capable of doing for us.  We have entered into a whole new era of <Col N="1250" /> communication and of presentation, and that is no bad thing.  The video industry and videos in general have tremendous potential for entertainment, education, awareness raising and for stimulating us for all types of constructive and creative activity.  We must not lose sight of that.</P>
    <P>Having said that we must also be realistic.  Senator Fennell adverted to this when she suggested that it might be impossible to achieve the aims of this commendable Bill.  I agree with her entirely.  In fact, it will always be a case of shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted.  It is asking the impossible to imagine that we can ban the production of this type of video, ban completely its illegal importation or, once imported, ban the possibility of its being viewed. We have only to think of the case in Britain where the Government have gone to extraordinary lengths to prevent &ldquo;Spy-catcher&rdquo; coming into the country which, as I understand it, is now being widely read.  It can even be obtained in Northern Ireland.  Whether that is via the southern route I am not absolutely certain.  Therefore, there is another dimension to this whole problem, that is, our own awareness and our own education.  We should try to promote constructive debate among school children and young people at school or university on the impact of the media on the one hand and on what comes across in the videos.</P>
    <P>In addition to legislation there will have to be a gigantic public relations exercise, a gigantic increase in awareness so that people themselves will have less need to see this type of video presentation.  If this is successful people are less likely to want to see this type of video and less likely to have access to it because public opinion begins to become so offended by what is on show.  How should we go about that?  Certainly there has not been enough emphasis on media studies in the process of our education.  For the past 30 years or so we have had television and yet there has not been sufficient discussion among young people on its effects and its implications for good and bad, or causing confusion.</P>
    <P>We have also got to see this in the <Col N="1251" /> context of satellite television which has been mentioned.  There is no way we can now prevent these images coming into our parlour or our drawing room and whatever has been produced will be available. It is a question of how we react to it.  Do we reject as individuals and collectively as communities and as families what is on offer, or do we see in it something constructive, something good and therefore something to be latched on to?  This can be done, as I say, by discussions in schools, universities, community groups.  The whole new concept of community education has suffered set backs due to cuts both here and in the North of Ireland.  We should try to get young people to see why this type of presentation of the human experience is sordid and can be quite evil.</P>
    <P>I do not use that word &ldquo;evil&rdquo; lightly or without consideration.  Any psychiatrist will tell you that images are important.  It is out of images that we create our attitudes and it is out of attitudes that come our actions.  Putting it on the level which everyone understands and particularly in the context of our Irish history, our attitudes are inevitably to a large degree responsible for their actions.  It is no good condemning a violent action if you are not prepared to look at your own attitude to see if it has not been in part responsible for stimulating the action out of resentment of the attitude.</P>
    <P>To go a step further back, you have the images which create the attitudes. How are these images derived?  Were they derived in the wholesome full experience of the development of the whole human being, or were they derived from some obsessional, narrow, introspective attempt to gain a fragment of living, a very morbid fragment, and to try to grip it as though it were the whole. We must attack these video nasties because of the nasty images they leave, out of which nasty attitudes come, and from which actions which are inevitably violent, if the image originally was a morbid image, will result.  Therefore, you can have images which will be life threatening or life affirming.  In the Bill, we are <Col N="1252" /> really concerned with the life threatening images.  For that reason I support it at least as a step, as a signpost, as a warning, if you like, to society at large although, as I have said, I would have grave reservations about its likely effect if it is taken in isolation.</P>
    <P>Once again I refer to the great and glorious Litter Bill which has long since been put into the waste paper basket and which was passed here with much aplomb in 1982.  Ireland probably is dirtier today than it was then.  We must beware lest this Bill, despite the best of intentions and genuine concern, should suffer the same fate and in ten years from now the country will be littered with video nasties. It will require a combined effort of many ministries, not least the Department of Education, to try to get people to come to terms with what is happeneing or what could happen to them.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget that morbid images can be psychologically very damaging. You can have the ruminating effect where people cannot get rid of the images.  That becomes a secondary problem and the person becomes a psychological cripple as a result.  The most disturbing thing, of course, is the emphasis on sadism and the destructive effect it has on the psyche of the person and the fragmentation it creates in the collective to which that person is related.  Everyone can accept that the exploitation of children is evil.  I do not think one can have any compromise on that aspect whatsoever.</P>
    <P>I support this Bill.  It has been well constructed.  The Minister has put his case very succinctly in his presentation to us today.  Different Senators will have different reasons for supporting it.  In supporting the Bill we must not overlook the fact that we are not attacking the video industry.  We are attacking the morbid aspects of it and the exploitation of what can be produced on video.  In the first instance we are trying to control abuses and eliminate them gradually but we will not eliminate them if we are concerned only about the passing of an Act of Parliament.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusCullimore" hpid="Mr. Cullimore Mr. Cullimore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullimore</NameTxt>
      <P>In bringing this Bill before the House the Minister for Justice is addressing a very pressing need in today's society.  Very few, except perhaps those who profit by the sales of video nasties and pornographic videos, would disagree with this.  The exercise of the power of censorship must be treated with the utmost care, respect and integrity and must be seen to be so.  Censorship can be seen as an instrument of good or evil. This legislation must retain the delicate balance of effectiveness and credibility. It must be seen to be fair if it is to retain credibility.  It must be clear and firm in its application if it is to be effective.</P>
      <P>The main objective of this Bill is to stop explicitly violent and-or pornographic films being available for viewing especially by young people.  Under section 3 all video films will have to be submitted for a certificate of supply. After a certain date it will not be legal to release any new films without getting such a certificate.  The films already on the market will gradually be dealt with over a period unless they have already been dealt with by the making of a prohibition order.  The approach taken in the Bill is to ban completely the sale of indecent or obscene video films.  This is in contrast with the system of classification used in Britain where under the Video Recordings Act, 1984, the censorship authority may ban the supply of some films and may limit the supply of others to a classification system.</P>
      <P>The problem with the classification system is that once the video films have passed into circulation, there is no way of controlling who will gain viewing access to them.  Given the problem we are dealing with I support the Minister's approach to this aspect of the Bill.  An estimated 6,000 to 7,000 video titles are available on the market today.  It is calculated that somewhere in the order of 1,000 titles will be added to this each year.  These numbers are large and the need for action is urgent.  In the interest of expediency I support section 6 which gives the film censor power to make a prohibition against obscene video films already in circulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1254" /> The Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism issued a report entitled Controls on Video Nasties in June 1986.  It recommended that all retail outlets for the sale or hire of video recordings should be licensed.  This Bill chooses not to take up this recommendation. In the final analysis this legislation will stand or fall on its success in ridding us of these obscene videos. Without some form of control of outlets, the success of the Bill may be limited. Obscene videos could be imported illegally and distributed under the counter. This may be difficult to control without some form of licensing.  I would urge the Minister to consider this.</P>
    <P>As stated earlier, a system of censorship must be seen to have credibility, acceptability and fairness among the public at large.  I accept that there is a system of appeal to the Censorship of Films Appeal Board which comprises nine members.  However, I urge that a committee be formed consisting of 12 selected members of the public reflecting the various strands of Irish life.  The committee members should review a small number of randomly selected certified and banned titles and submit an annual report to the Minister on their findings.</P>
    <P>In general I welcome the measures taken by the Minister in this legislation. I urge the Minister to consider the matters I have raised, particularly the licensing of premises.  While I understand and respect the Minister's wish to make the legislation self-financing, we must succeed in keeping these repugnant videos out of the hands of the young.  Disasters such as the Hungerford massacre bring home to us the depths of depravity which can be reached.  It was very probably due to the influence of these repugnant videos.  Let us hope we are not too late to prevent such horrific scenes as Hungerford suffered.  I wish this legislation a speedy passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether I am unique in this House if I say I have never seen a video nasty.  I spoke to a number of people today who have an interest in this Bill and asked whether they had ever seen a video nasty and most <Col N="1255" /> of them said that they had seen pieces and they had heard about them.  I regret to a certain extent that the Minister was not able to show to Members of both Houses some examples of the type of videos which are the subject of this legislation. I say this not in any vicarious sense, or any desire to be amused, or otherwise, but simply because for most ordinary people video nasties are things they simply do not come across in their normal life.</P>
      <P>Very many of us do not have videos, do not have the time to watch videos and certainly going down to seedy shops and finding video nasties to bring home and watch do not fall within the normal purview of our life experience.  Fortunately, as with many other things, most of us do not have first hand experience of the drug scene or of other social excesses.  I say in all seriousness that I would be interested if the Minister's office could make available to Members of the Oireachtas some examples of the type of evil which this legislation is intended to deal with.</P>
      <P>At the outset, like a number of other speakers, I am always wary of any legislation which proposes some form of censorship. All of us certainly of my generation and the Minister's generation &mdash; we were around university at the end of the bad days of censorship &mdash; remember not only the examples of censorship, books which could not be purchased, films which were cut, films which were not allowed in, but also the atmosphere engendered by the presence of censorship in Ireland.  Censorship extended to people not being allowed to speak at meetings in universities because their political views offended those of the establishment. They were regarded as being dangerous in some way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was not a particularly healthy time or a healthy atmosphere.  By and large most fair minded people would accept that our moves towards a much more liberal regime have been handled with great commonsense and great sensitivity over the years.  There are not the abuses <Col N="1256" /> which one can see in some other countries. By and large we have shown ourselves to be a people capable of handling the freedom which the absence of censorship implies.  That is why I am wary of this Bill.  I am slow because I have seen in other countries in the past decade or so how a new type of moral self-rightousness can ride roughshod over the rights of other people.  It can engender a witchhunt type mentality which can very easily creep into a society with consequences which are divisive, unpleasant and unnecessary and which are at their deepest an affront to basic rights of freedom.</P>
    <P>I do not think this Bill will do anything like that.  Nonetheless, the principle of censorship is one which should cause us to look carefully at what exactly is being done to see that the provisions are not capable of abuse.  That is why we must be able to tease out the implications of what is being set in place on Committee Stage.  That is why I look forward to that stage of the Bill.  I suspect the Minister believes that the Bill as it stands is not the last word on what needs to be done. I am sure he is as conscious of the dangers of excessive censorship as I am and, indeed, as many people are.</P>
    <P>Having said all that &mdash; and not having first hand experience of this phenomenon &mdash; there is no doubt that there is a very serious problem and that legislation is called for.  We have reports, some of which have been already referred to, of a number of important groupings coming to the problem from different angles all of whom conclude that there is a problem. Amongst these we have the Fourth Report of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights dealing with this problem. That committee were very much aware of the alarm among many members of the public at the proliferation of what are now properly called video nasties.</P>
    <P>The committee claimed that the easy availability of these videos featuring explicit scenes of sex and violence was causing widespread concern.  The concern was especially felt at the way in which these videos depict women in a <Col N="1257" /> degrading and dehumanising way and portrayed them frequently at the receiving end of the most brutal and sadistic treatment.  This committee argued that there was no proof of a definite link between the availability of video nasties and the increase in serious sexual crimes against women.  They argued that it was reasonable to infer that the portrayal of women as sex objects did condition the minds of those who watched video nasties to regard women as objects of men to be dominated and abused by them for their own pleasure and gratification.</P>
    <P>This committee report pointed out that legislation in Britain provides for a general classification and labelling system for videos and that the authorities there were satisfied that this has resulted in the effective control of the type of objectionable material that is freely available in this country.  For once, in a matter of this sort, an Oireachtas committee were arguing that on a question like this we should take an example from the way in which the particular problem was tackled in Britain.  The members of the joint committee, as the Minister is well aware, added their voices to those who are calling upon the Government to face up to what the Minister has faced up to in this Bill, that is, to introduce restrictions on the way in which videos are imported, sold and distributed in the country.</P>
    <P>We have the Tenth Report of the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism.  In that report the members of the committee spoke with a man who has a great experience in this matter, the then film censor, Mr. Frank Hall.  Mr. Hall could certainly not be accused of being a prudish censor or somebody who was not aware of artistic values in films and in theatre.  Mr. Hall felt, from his experience, that there was a clear need for controls on the availability of videos.  He felt that the main criteria in examining videos, and in seeing whether or not they were fit for general viewing and distribution, was not necessarily to look to individual segments, or individual instances, or episodes in a particular video, but to look at the overall purpose.  If the overall purpose of these <Col N="1258" /> videos was to excite sexual violence, such a film should either be banned or have the appropriate cuts made.</P>
    <P>People have spoken at some length on the various recommendations of that Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism.  It was one of the more active committees in the life of the last Oireachtas.  While I have the Minister here on this subject &mdash; and even in these stringent times &mdash; I make a plea to him to use his good offices in Government to see if a number of the more useful committees could be set up again.  Not all committees were useful, but the Minister and I had the honour of serving together as Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the EC committee during the lifetime of the last Oireachtas.  There were a number of committees but it was probably the best of all of them in the lifetime of the Oireachtas.  It was the most hardworking and the one which produced the most detailed and thought out reports.</P>
    <P>There were a number of other committees. The one on crime, lawlessness and vandalism was one which in the lifetime of the last Oireachtas, highlighted quite a number of important social issues. They examined the evidence and established an interface between the Oireachtas and the wider public and the concerns of the wider public.  Even if we were to look at the work they did on the whole question of video nasties, there is a very strong case to be made for the restoration of this committee and a number of others at present.  I hope the Minister will agree with me on that and that his voice in Cabinet may be raised on the matter.  That committee looked at the licensing of retail outlets, the controls on the availability and the origin of these videos.  They also proposed a number of penalties which, they felt, would be appropriate.  I need not to go into that because that is all on the record now.</P>
    <P>During the course of my research on this Bill I thought it appropriate to talk to people who care for those people who are the direct object of sexual attack.  The Rape Crisis Centre which, in spite of the unreasonable fears of some people and the unreasoned fears of others &mdash; the <Col N="1259" /> irrational fears of others &mdash; are an organisation who have done a very great deal over the past number of years.  They have done a great deal in terms of sheer compassionate work in counselling, comforting and helping women who are the subject of these sort of attacks.  It is something which they do, I am told, with great skill and sensitivity.  They have also done a tremendous job in heightening the awareness of the general public on the whole question of sexual violence in our society.  In heightening awareness they may not always have done it in a way which found favour with everybody. They may, on occasion, have used language which some people have found too explicit.  Nonetheless, I take very seriously the views of the people who run the Rape Crisis Centre.  They have very strong views, indeed, on this particular problem.</P>
    <P>The Information and Education Officer of the Rape Crisis Centre has pointed out how disturbed they are about the widespread availability of videos which portray sexually violent and pornographic material.  They are perturbed for the following reasons.  First, they argue that there are no legal or statutary controls on the importation, sale or distribution of such videos.  Videos which contain highly pornographic and sexually violent and degrading acts are being viewed by children and teenagers as well as adults, on an ever increasing scale in this country.  The centre argue that regular exposure to videos which portray women as nothing but sex objects is very likely to have a negative effect on children and teenagers, in that it suggests to them that such sexual activity is normal and acceptable.</P>
    <P>They argue that exposing children to pornographic or sexually violent material is a form of child sexual abuse, since children do not have the cognitive ability or maturity to understand the sexual behaviour which they are viewing.  In addition, in the case of both children and adults the viewing of gang rapes, sexual humiliation, gross and sadistic physical violence undoubtedly has the effect of <Col N="1260" /> increasing tolerance to participating in such behaviour and in people's attitudes to such behaviour.  They argue that it quite likely has the effect of increasing the level of tolerance of such behaviour in real life situations.  I do not have any doubts about that conclusion.</P>
    <P>We have seen, in other countries, and in our own country in recent years, a coarsening of attitudes and acceptance in some quarters of such behaviour as normal.  We can see it reflected almost in subconscious attitudes by educated people who should know better.  There is no doubt from the experience of other countries that, where there is the regular showing of this type of video nasties and where they are part of the regular diet of young people, the general quality of life is coarsened to a degree which is unsustainable and which should not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>Again quoting a further authority on this &mdash; a very relevant authority, the Council for the Status of Women &mdash; at their annual conference last year on 12 April 1986 an emergency resolution was passed on the subject, so great was the sense of concern:</P>
    <P>The Council for the Status of Women is seriously alarmed at the widespread availability of &ldquo;video nasties&rdquo; in this country.  Pornographic, often extremely violent, films seem to be readily accessible, even to young children.  The Council believes that this could be a contributory factor in the growing incidence of rape and other forms of violence against women and children.</P>
    <P>They called on the Government as a matter of urgency to plan legal control over the importation and distribution of video nasties in consultation with women's organisations, all of which the Minister has done with great speed.</P>
    <P>The groups I have quoted are not, perhaps, the usual groups.  I have not quoted from churches.  I know that there is great concern in all the churches about the phenomenon and great concern amongst youth leaders, attached to the churches.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1261" /> I have not quoted from the teachers' organisations, all of which have taken a view on this and have made their views known on the whole question.  I have not quoted from the various parents' organisations. One could go right down the list of organisations who have felt it necessary to make public their fears, their apprehensions and their great disquiet at the current situation.</P>
    <P>I have quoted from organisations who would normally be seen in the forefront of the liberal movement, those who would, perhaps, be most concerned by what they would see as an encroachment on civil rights or liberties, such as the Rape Crisis Centre, the Council for the Status of Women, Women's Rights Committee, and so on.  I have done that deliberately because I believe there are very few pieces of legislation which have come before the Houses of the Oireachtas in recent years which have such a widespread broadly based range of support behind the very principle of what this Bill is trying to attain.  I am sure there are others in the House who would quote from other points of the liberal, conservative spectrum in favour of the same legislation.  It makes a change to have a Bill of this sort where there is such widespread agreement right across the spectrum as to what has to be attained.</P>
    <P>There are a number of organisations and people who feel that the legislation may be somewhat inadequate.  I want to quote from two of those.  This Bill will come to life on Committee Stage when we can try to tease out some of the points which have been made.  All of us have listened to and spoken with the Irish Videogram Alliance who have certain strong reservations about the Bill.  The Irish Videogram Alliance feel that the Bill in its present status will hurt the legitimate video industry in Ireland and that it will also help to increase the already large illegal or pirate video network. The Videogram Alliance suggested two amendments.  I am sure the Minister is familiar with the contents of them but I would like to look at them briefly.  They are two amendments to the Bill which they hope will tighten copyright <Col N="1262" /> legislation and clarify what they see as the vague censorship regulation.</P>
    <P>First, the Irish Videogram Alliance want to see the registration of all retailers and importers.  The Alliance proposed a self-financing scheme in which retailers would pay a £150 registration fee every year and importers would pay £1,000 registration fee each year.  This registration would not restrict trade.  Anyone could apply as, for example, street traders do.  The only requirement for registration would be payment of the fee and compliance with the censorship and copyright laws.</P>
    <P>If, according to the alliance, a retailer or an importer broke the law, the licence would be revoked and his right to trade would be permanently withdrawn.  With this registration plan, the film censor would know who has the right to legally trade in videos.  They argue that it is a difficult task when outlets are materialising in a variety of forms such as supermarkets, people's houses and in mobile vans.  The alliance feel that the censor will then accept films from registered retailers and importers only thereby alleviating the possibility of an official Government certificate being granted to an illegal product.  This is something which we may need to tease out on the Committee Stage.  I am not sure if I fully subscribe to everything in it.</P>
    <P>The Videogram Alliance also call for a system of classification for videos.  The Bill proposes a system whereby a video is either in or out.  With this system there are no guidelines for either retailers or parents as to the suitability of a title for the different age groups in the family. Section 6 of the Bill states that the film censor may prohibit a video if the work is unfit for general viewing.  They argue that general viewing in the cinema means suitable for those under 12 years.  With this restrictive &ldquo;in&rdquo; or &ldquo;out&rdquo; according to general viewing standards, the film censor will be under pressure to lower the threshold of allowability to such an extent that only such films as &ldquo;Bambi&rdquo; and &ldquo;Snow White&rdquo; will be allowed on video.</P>
    <P>They argue again that the demand for <Col N="1263" /> more advanced and intelligent videos will increase dramatically and, because the legitimate video industry will be unable to meet this demand due to legislation, the underground network for videos which will be able to thwart this restriction will flourish.</P>
    <P>That is the fear of the Irish Videogram Alliance.  They call for classification of videos according to the UK video recording Act of 1984 which has various classifications, UC, Universal, all particularly suitable for children; U, Universal, suitable for all; PG, Parental Guidance; General Viewing but some scenes may be unsuitable for young children; 15, suitable for persons of 15 and over but not to be supplied to any person below that age; and 18 suitable for persons of 18 years and over but not to be supplied to any person below that age; lastly, Restricted 18, to be supplied only in licensed sex shops to persons of more than 18 years.  The last category does not apply here.  I do not know whether the Government have as part of their programme the intention to establish licensed sex shops.  I think there are other priorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Videogram Alliance argue very strongly that a system of classification would be a useful provision in this Bill.  On the face of it, while I do not share their views as to the probability of our viewing being restricted to &ldquo;Bambi&rdquo; or &ldquo;Snow White&rdquo;, our experience of film censors over the past number of years has been one of great maturity, liberality, commonsense and sensitivity. Nonetheless, there is the germ of a very real case in what they are saying.  Perhaps we can look on Committee and Report Stages at the possibility of some sort of classification of videos.  It probably would be much more difficult to operate.  It could involve a great deal more work.  It means putting a more elaborate law into place.  All that is true.  It is something on which I do not have final or definite views <Col N="1264" /> but I would like to see that matter discussed on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>There is one further reference I will make on the Bill.  Perhaps it is the one hostile view of the Bill that I have seen. It is a well argued, cogent and very hostile view of the Bill which came from Ray Comiskey in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 15 October entitled &ldquo;A bad Bill which will only make things worse&rdquo;.  He said the problem of the Bill is that the desired result is unlikely to be achieved.  He argues that this is because the trade in video nasties and pornographic videos is, by its very nature, and under the counter operation, and we have an illegal trade in videos which is already believed by the legitimate industry to have captured about one-third of the overall market.  He says that &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; in this case does not automatically mean video nasties and pornography. It refers to the growing, sophisticated trade in video piracy &mdash; the illegal copying and trading of legitimate video material &mdash; but it also means that there exists an extensive illegal network which is capable of handling video nasties and pornography.  He claims it will continue to handle it even after the Bill becomes law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He takes as his example a film called &ldquo;Angel Heart&rdquo;.  He argues that if and when &ldquo;Angel Heart&rdquo; comes out on video the censor will have to decide whether to give it a certificate declaring it to be fit for general viewing.  Should he do so, it will mean that a film limited for cinema release would have no such restrictions as a video.  If he bans it, the film could still be seen by over-18s in the cinemas while still being unavailable, at least legally as a video.  He argues that with the illegal network thriving, the ban will merely give the video further attractiveness for exploitation by the trade.  He argues that this &ldquo;either/or&rdquo; situation &mdash; total ban or total freedom &mdash; puts the censor in a impossibly contradictory position. He argues also that it will put him under pressure from groups of all shades of opinion.  Especially, he argues, the entrenched, well organised groups, most of whom seem to be at the conservative end of the spectrum, almost certainly will <Col N="1265" /> mobilise their support to put very strong pressure on the censor to operate in a restrictive and censorious way.</P>
    <P>He also argues that the Bill requires, among other things, a register of banned titles to be compiled.  He quotes one source involved in the fight against the illegal video trade which says that roughly 80 per cent of blue movies are untitled. How do you implement the banning of these?  That is a question which the Minister will be able to answer in his summing up.  He argues also that the Bill provides that the cost of doing all this will be met by charging, in effect, what he calls censorship fees.  Since the aim is to combat video nasties and pornographic tapes, this could have the effect of charging the legitimate industry to control material which the industry does not handle.</P>
    <P>These are some of the points made by Ray Comiskey in his article in <i>The Irish Times.</i>  In researching this Bill and in seeing what had been said by various people, his was the only strong voice raised in opposition to the Bill.  He is not opposed to the principle of the Bill but he feels it will not achieve the results intended for the reasons just quoted, that the &ldquo;either or&rdquo; category of censorship will, he believes, result either in a very restrictive range of material being available, will result in censorship from the conservative end of the spectrum and could do great damage.  He also argues that the clasification is not workable.</P>
    <P>It is rare to have a Bill coming into this House which commands such widespread support in principle.  It is a Bill which unites, across the political spectrum, virtually all shades of political and social opinion.  The effects of the video nasties in coarsening our society and attitudes, in inciting people to violence against women and in becoming a form of psychlogical sexual abuse are widely accepted.  It is a problem which other countries will have to face up to.  The Government have acted expeditiously. They have the full support of all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>Doubts have been raised about the possibility of a censorship mentality <Col N="1266" /> creeping into this country, of this legislation being used as a weapon by those who resent many of the changes and new freedoms in our society and of this Bill being used by people in a way which this Minister does not intend it to be used &mdash; and in which most of us who support it do not intend it to be used.  This is something which needs to be guarded against.</P>
    <P>This Bill will benefit from very detailed scrutiny on Committee Stage.  While I welcome Second Stage unreservedly I look forward even more to Committee Stage and to teasing out these problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this Bill.  Since the first suggestion that the Bill would be brought before the House I have heard nothing but praise from practically every section of the community of the Minister. People were getting frightened at the availability to all ages of what have now become known as video nasties which portray violence and pornography degrading to women &mdash; something that was alien in this country.  The vast majority of people are in favour of this Bill.  There will always be some people to say the Minister, the Government or the people who support it have censorship minds.  There will always be people who favour freedom to read and view as they see fit.</P>
      <P>It could possibly be used as an argument at some stage when this Bill is either going through here or the other House to suggest that censorship should only apply to people under 18 years of age.  If the Minister was persuaded that the ban would apply only to youngsters under 18 years of age, the whole Bill would be meaningless.  I am certain it will be suggested to the Minister that the Bill should be amended to that effect.  Once there is availability of videos it is likely that they will fall into the hands of those who should not view them.  Children could be greatly affected by these videos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke recently to a man in a video shop &mdash; I am not sure whether he was the owner or the manager &mdash; about video nasties.  He said he would rather not stock <Col N="1267" /> them and he agreed that they were doing harm.  He said he would rather be in any other business than handling those kinds of things but he said: &ldquo;The others are doing it.  My opposition are handling these.  Therefore, I must do the same thing&rdquo;.  He thought it was an argument. I did not think it was a very good one, but that was his argument.  He said he would welcome legislation that would ensure that these videos would not be on display on anybody's shelf or anybody's counter.  If that is true &mdash; and I was inclined to believe this man who is in the business of selling videos &mdash; this Bill is not before its time.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister has given great thought and attention to how the law will be implemented when this Bill is passed. I look forward to the day when the Bill leaves this House, goes to the other House, is signed by the President and is enforced by the authorities.  The very nature of this type of business seems to suggest that much of it is under the counter. The law will have to be enforced very strictly to ensure that this does not happen and that those videos are not made available in any form.</P>
    <P>Video entertainment has become quite popular.  It is big business at present. There are excellent films available and it would be a pity to deny anybody the chance to see them.  But as always, other types of films are also available.  Most videos are harmless and provide great entertainment.  If the availability of these other types of videos to people of all ages is allowed to continue for much longer it will be a poor reflection on our society.</P>
    <P>The Government and the Minister have a duty and a very strong obligation to look after the well-being of the people. These videos can incite people to violence. At one stage it was suggested that the man who committed the massacre in Hungerford in England had been influenced by videos.  The Minister has a very strong obligation to introduce this Bill and to see that it is enforced.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill and I believe he has the goodwill of everybody.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the excellent presentation put before us.  He has readily admitted that it is not going to be easy to regulate this industry.  I like to watch a good video. During my leisure time I like to sit at home and watch a good mystery.  I visit video shops.  I do not think this is a small business.  It is a very big business.  I do not know whether it is a very popular business.  I have not met many people who have done exceptionally well out of it.  I know of one person in my city who seems to be doing very well.</P>
      <P>It is very easy to copy videos.  It is not easy to compare videos with books or films over which there is some control because you could have 100 videos and you might not see them.  A retailer could make 100 copies of ten very nasty videos and nobody might know he had done it. That is where I see the problem.</P>
      <P>I have seen a video nasty and it was not nice to watch.  I watched this video at home.  I have seven children and I was worried because the video was in my home overnight.  I was up extra early the next morning to make sure that it was taken away so that the children would not see it.  My family range in age from 24 years to nine years but I was afraid that any of them might see it.</P>
      <P>It is a big worry and I do not blame anybody for the suggestions they have made.  However, I am a realist and I realise it is not going to be easy to control videos.  There are many excellent films available.  I deal with a person in a video shop who likes to run a good business. When I go into his shop he seems to be running a very good business.  He advises me and tells me what kind of show I should see because he knows the kind of shows I like to look at.  Perhaps he is doing the same for people who think the other way.  I cannot say realistically that people do not think the other way because they do.  It is a fact of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are opportunities for these people to copy up to date films with actors such as Clint Eastwood, Jack Nicholson, etc.  If a video shop does not have a certain film one week the following week it <Col N="1269" /> could have five or six copies.  I do not know whether the owner of a video shop has a right to do that, but it is done anyway.  I do not think we can control that.  Could we really say to a shop owner that he has no right to have ten copies of a particular film?  All these people have copying machines.</P>
    <P>Warner Brothers are a video company. If they supply a film for distribution on the Irish market who then supplies the film to a person in a shop?  It is very debatable whether we can say to a person that he has no right to have ten copies of a film because he only bought one or two copies from the distributor.  The Bill does not cater for this.  It only says that all new films put before the censorship board or the censor should be recognised as to whether they should be available to over 18s, over 16s or over 15s.  Can films be brought into this country without the censor ever seeing them?  That is what we must look at.  We can have all the controls in the world but you would not see ten videos in the back of a car.  Videos are not the same as big rolls of film, books or other publications.</P>
    <P>It is hard for us to be realistic in trying to solve the problem of video nasties.  It is a big job.  We must try to influence the people involved in the industry.  People involved in the business in other countries naturally have different regulations and different rules from the ones we have.</P>
    <P>I am a publican.  I have seen young men and middle-aged men who are idle watching videos at 9 o'clock, 10 o'clock and 11 o'clock in the morning.  That is hard to believe.  I never thought I would see that.  I know men 40 and 45 years old who go into video shops three and four times a day because they have nothing else to do.  People can get into a rut and into such a state that they can be brainwashed into watching films all day. I am not saying this is true of every person.  I am talking about working class areas where young people of 16 years, 17 years or 18 years watch too many videos. Naturally I would like to see them doing something else but how can I say to them that they should not be doing this when <Col N="1270" /> I cannot even get work for them?</P>
    <P>It is obvious that they watch a certain number of video nasties.  How can we explain video nasties?  Does a video nasty show a woman or does it show people doing things we would much prefer not to see them doing?  Is a video nasty a very bad horror film, a film that I would not want to look at or would not want my children to look at or a film about Vietnam? I have seen films about Vietnam and I certainly would not like children to look at them.  However, children do look at them because their parents buy them and when they find them they put them into the video machine.</P>
    <P>There is much excellent material available that children can look at.  Children know what they like to watch.  Without being too nosey I always try to find out from children what videos or films they like to watch.  The general impression is that they like to see a good comedy.  They like to see Eddie Murphy.  He is a black guy who plays a cop in comedies and they love to watch him.  That is the type of film children mostly talk about.  I do not hear them talking about Sylvester Stallone and other actors like him.  They do not seem to take much notice of films like that.  I know most children like to see a good comedy or a film which makes them laugh.</P>
    <P>I do not think all is wrong and I would not like to think all is right either. However, I am worried that it is not going to be easy to get on top of the problem. I would admit it if it was.  If there is going to be censorship and the censor is going to have the say in what types of films we watch, this will create a black market.  A black economy will be created.  There will be more under the counter films and this will become big business for many people.  As the previous speaker said, the man who is being honest about it will lose business because another man will sell something under the counter.  This is what will happen.  We have to take the good with the bad.  If we ask the people who provide the films to the public for their help, 99 per cent might help and 1 per cent might not.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned licences.  This <Col N="1271" /> could create an awkward situation. Licensing can be done without.  If licences were introduced people would be very conscious that they would be under the jurisdiction of a court rather than a local authority.  It would be somewhat similar to a publican's licence.  A publican is always conscious of the fact that his licence can be endorsed.  If it is endorsed once, he is worried that it can happen a second time and he makes sure it does not happen.</P>
    <P>I am not saying this is the only avenue, or that it is the only answer.  The courts have enough to do already.  If licences are introduced they should not cost too much because that cost will only be passed on to the customer.  If the courts issue the licences a uniformed person could go into a shop to check that the licence is there.  Irish people are very conscious of when they have something that some other person does not have.  If a shop owner has his licence hanging up and he has a film or a video nasty that he should not have the number of his licence can be quoted.  That is some type of control.</P>
    <P>People would be conscious that the State has recognised that this is an area where there has to be some control.  I do not want complete control.  On Committee Stage I will argue about what we should be doing.  If the store is to get involved I would like it stated which people are recognised to provide films. There are video shops on every corner. In my city they are within 30 yards of each other.  I do not know how well they are doing.  If we want to have control we will have to start with the people who are providing the videos.</P>
    <P>I do not think the film censor can solve the problem.  He can define the types of films the Irish people can look at.  I like to go to the cinema and I cannot say I am being wronged by the censor at this time. Videos can fit in your pocket and are getting smaller.  Video tapes are going to be replaced by discs.  We need to help of the people who want to make a decent living out of this business.  I hope we can broaden that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1272" /> As a publican I understand what it means to have a licence.  Every September I pay £55 for my licence for the year.  I like to have that and I am not small minded.  Every publican is the same.  Licences for the film or video business should be issued by a court clerk rather than a town clerk.  Who listens to local authorities?  Local authorities cannot even collect 50 per cent of the local charges.</P>

      <P>If the courts issue the licences it could be a winner.  We might be able to win on that but we certainly would not win if prohibitive orders were made that only certain films could be shown.  Videos are so small that it is not going to be easy to control them.  I have seen a video nasty and I would not want to show it to somebody else.  I make no bones about that.  This video is around and it is terrible.</P>
      <P>At this time in all societies 18 year old children can watch very violent and very frightening films.  At the same time 15 year old children can watch very sexy films which discriminate against the opposite sex.  This should be reconsidered. There are seven men and two women on the censorship board and perhaps there should be some change there.</P>
      <P>Children of 18 years can watch very violent and frightening films but in many cases 15-year-olds can watch worse films which discriminate against women.  I do not think even 18-year-olds should be allowed to watch films like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This will not be an easy problem to solve.  It will not be easy for the Minister because it is a handy operation and it is a very big business.  A lot of money is being made out of it by some people.  I do not know about all the people and I would be telling lies if I said otherwise.  I <Col N="1273" /> know one or two people who are involved in the video trade in Cork and I do not think they would be in a hurry to close their doors.  More luck to them if they are in good businesses.</P>
    <P>The Minister should get these people on his side.  He should tell them that if they do not carry out their businesses properly he will take away their licences and they will not have the right to open.</P>
    <P>I know that many of these people can operate in the black market but they will not do as well.  Many people have gone into this in a big way.  They have put a lot of money into copying machines.</P>
    <P>Is there a lot of money in this business? Are people making a lot of money out of it or are there too many people now involved for some people to make much out of it?  It is obvious that some people are making a lot of money out of it because many people and many big companies, particularly in the States, are getting very involved in it.</P>
    <P>We need to help each other.  There can be a massive black market in this and under the counter problems in this business. To stop that the people who are already there should be legalised.  They should be licensed but if they do not work properly their licence should be taken away.</P>

      <P>More than 50 per cent of that is in pirated sales and pirated business.  That is very serious because a lot of revenue is being lost by the State, the film companies who make the videos and the people and artists who work on <Col N="1274" /> the videos.  I am talking basically about the entertainment videos which are bought every week by masses of teenagers. What can the Ministers do to stop the piracy and the copying of videos that is losing an enormous amount of revenue to the State?</P>
      <P>Anyone who works in the film world knows that you lose a certain quality and anything that is anyway good in relation to the colour scheme in fifth generation recorded video.  I know the Minister has great experience of this from the entertainment world.  I have seen many videos and I know straight away when I look at them whether or not they are fifth generation recorded videos.  To a lay person a fifth generation recorded video is a video that wavers on the top.  A video that wavers on the very top is a pirated video because no studio would record a fifth from a fifth.  There is 40 per cent duty on the manufacture of videos plus 25 per cent VAT.  Most of those videos sell for around £15.  Some of them are much more expensive.  Assuming that they sell for £15, that is a lot of revenue, £4 per video.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are bought in masses by the youth week in week out.  The spend their money on entertainment, drink and clothes while the hard pressed person who has to pay a mortgage, pay for his car or whatever, have nothing to spend.  These are people who have money to spend every week and these are the people we have to go after.  That is one point I wanted to make.  Many speakers made the point that there is under the counter selling of these blue movie videos.  It is crazy to say it is not happening.  I know per cent of the business of most of these video outlets is selling under the counter or leasing and renting every week for £1, £1.50 or £2 per day.  You can get these movies under the counter.  That is happening. With all the safeguards built in to the Bill that you can imagine, with all the restrictions in it the problem is: will the Garda be able to enforce it?  There must be penalties.  Not alone is it happening in the cities.  It is happening in the smallest villages in Ireland.  Years ago <Col N="1275" /> any medium sized town of 5,000 plus had a record store.  Now every town or village with a population of over 500 has a video outlet.  It is a far bigger industry than the record business ever was on the music scene.</P>
    <P>I am talking about entertainment and this is a colossal business.  There is a £25 million turnover every year here.  That is a very conservative figure.  There are people in the industry who would say it is nearer to £40 million than it is to £25 million.  I commend the Minister and the Government for introducing the Bill so promptly on their return to Government. I will do anything I can as a Member of the Oireachtas to improve the situation as it exists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I will be a little bit more cautious in my approach to the Bill.  Not that I do not welcome the sentiments I have heard over the monitor being expressed by many Senators which I think are serious, appropriate and in the best interest of the citizens of the country.  I believe the Minister's approach follows a similar line.  I welcome and applaud the Minister's concern with the wellbeing of the citizens of this State but I am not sure on a philosophic basis whether or not this Bill is quite the correct approach.  I am, however, quite certain that it will go through and therefore I will be seeking to table some small amendments which I hope will be given consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I am a little nervous of this Bill is, first of all, that our experience of censorship in this country has largely been one that demonstrates the impracticality of censorship and the slightly ludricrous areas into which censorship can bring us.  Indeed, I recall with a certain grim humour the appalling debates in this very House with regard to book censorship when Professor McGuinness, for example, launched a devastating, idiotic attack upon a work that is now regarded as one of the very good works of Irish literature.  I speak of <i>The Tailor and Ansty.</i>  I do not think any of us wish to go back to that and it is important <Col N="1276" /> that we look at the experience of book censorship because it may reveal to us some of the problems that are involved with censorship in general.</P>
    <P>With regard to the operation of book censorship, which I also greatly regret.  I recognise that this is not the time for me to launch into an attack on book censorship, but I do think certain lessons can be drawn.  One is that if you establish some methodology of censorship you must also establish a person, or a group of persons, to whom you as citizens are willing to surrender your right to decide, to discriminate on your behalf with regard to the material that is fit for you to watch or to read.  That is a principle with which I am unhappy.  It is not that I believe the Minister wishes to abuse this power but it has so clearly been abused in other jurisdictions in this century and certainly demonstrably in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>If I look back towards the example of book censorship or film censorship, which is even closer to the video industry, it is clear that people were appointed who lacked this capacity to discriminate.  The most obscene book ever published in this country was the <i>Index of Prohibited Publications.</i> It showed one thing perfectly clearly and that was that the persons who composed that board were incapable of discriminating between Plato on the one hand and <i>The Porno Screw Colourbook No. 4</i> on the other, Aristotle on the one hand and <i>Bumbiters Annual.</i>  These are the most laughable.  I see the Minister is laughing, and I rather enjoyed reading this myself because I thought, what idiotic publications.  The point I essentially what kind of mind was incapable of discriminating between trash and rubbish on one category and works of philosophic and scientific interest on the other.  That worries me.</P>
    <P>It also worries me slightly if one accepts the arguments that these films and videos have a detrimental effect on the psychology of the human being then who is going to protect the censors.  How long are they going to remain in office?  How can we guarantee their balance and sanity <Col N="1277" /> if we really believe that censorship will have this devastating impact.  I am not quite sure that it does have this impact. I do not believe that the case has been made although I do accept that very distressing and objectionable things are frequently photographed and reproduced on film, things that would upset, sicken and horrify me.  But then are we going to censor King Lear, violence against human beings, &ldquo;out, vile jelly&rdquo;, as Lear's eye is plucked out of its socket and stamped into the ground?  We are already censoring things in film in a way that is quite regrettable.</P>
    <P>I speak, for example, of a film that has been censored recently and clearly would be censored if it came out as video. It is an excellent film called &ldquo;Working Girls&rdquo;.  This film has some images that would be disturbing to comfortable middle class people because it shows the involvement of comfortable middle class people in the exploitation of women through prostitution.  It is precisely because those images are disturbing that it gets banned.  Is this going to be banned so that even people who wish to view this important work in their own homes are deprived of even doing that?  I would be very concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not want to pillory the Irish.  I do not really think we are any worse than most others.  I look, for example, in the pop music scene at the fact that a video by George Michael was banned by many of the British stations.  I am not suggesting that pop music is a very important philosophic medium but it did communicate an important message with which most people would agree and that is (1) &ldquo;sex is good&rdquo; and (2) that &ldquo;sex is best one to one&rdquo;.  There is a clear message which is important in health terms these days about monogamy, about safety in sexual matters.  Yet because of the prurience of the minds of those who watched it this video was effectively banned.  In the age of AIDS it seems that we could do worse than allow access to this kind of material.</P>
    <P>I would hate to think that this Bill was part of a process whereby we were moving into an even more sex negative <Col N="1278" /> age.  I think that would be most regrettable. I was involved in the importation of a video which would, under this Bill, undoubtedly be banned.  I would in future circumstances feel a moral compulsion to reintroduce this video into the country and I urge the Minister to consider this matter most carefully because the video of which I speak was a video that we brought in as part of an education programme from the United States of America on the problem of the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.  The Minister is, of course, aware of the fact that the gay community in this country spearheaded the education programme about AIDS in such a way that the rates of infection in the gay community and the profile of the infection, are quite different from most other European countries. That is because we saturated the community with information of this type.</P>
    <P>The film was in a number of sections: discussions of the political impact, discussions of the disease, and so on, and a very important section on safe sexual techniques.  Some of this material might be revolting to some people; it might be quite erotic to others but it was a very effective transmission of ideas which could be subject to censorship and clearly, under the provisions here, would be subject to censorship because, apart from anything else, all the acts portrayed in the film although safe are still criminal in this jurisdiction.  The operation of this Bill could limit access to information that could save lives.  That would certainly worry me very considerably.</P>
    <P>I also note that there has been a very extensive lobbying campaign by members of the industry concerned.  It does really seem that there is more of a kind of mercantile flavour to this morality than people readily acknowledge.  There is clear self interest.  That is fine.  But I think we should have it out in the open. I think we should know this.  I think we should not confuse it with an absolute morality which I do not really believe it represents.  I believe it represents commercial self interest and there is a legitimate place for that in our society.  I have nothing against it but I think we should <Col N="1279" /> be very careful about thinking that this is straightforward morality of an acceptable type.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about sexuality first and I will say something now about violence. I am simply trying to redress the balance because most of the speeches seemed to be so negative in terms of sexuality. Everybody was rather accepting that people were against violence and did not say very much about it.  I think that is, perhaps, understandable.  But even here I would have to say &mdash; and I return to my image of King Lear &mdash; that there are moments when violence although shocking does, in fact, tell a most humane message.  I speak having just yesterday afternoon seen a very important Israeli film called &ldquo;Avanti Populo&rdquo; which was a most striking and compassionate plea for humanity and understanding and used actors both from Egypt and from Israel. The message of that film was compassionate, heart warming and humanitarian but some of the images in it were images of extraordinary violence.  Would that be banned?</P>
    <P>I turn to section 6 of the Bill which deals with the criteria.  Here is where I think the problem really probably lies because we are told that these items will be banned if the viewing of such a film would be likely to cause persons to commit crimes whether by inciting or encouraging them to do so or by indicating or suggesting ways of doing so or of avoiding detection.  Again, the general sentiment underlying that is one that we all share in general but, once you look at the particular application of it, some problems it seems to me arise.  Are we, for example, going to ban cops and robbers films?  Has &ldquo;The Rise and Fall of Legs Diamond&rdquo; finally bitten the dust?  &ldquo;The Great Train Robbery&rdquo;?  You could under these provisions easily come into a ludicrous area.  Even leaving that aside, this is precisely the provision that would cover the safe sex film of which I spoke because there is no doubt whatever that this will be covered by this section.  Homosexuality, any form of sexual contact between males regardless of their age, <Col N="1280" /> regardless of their vulnerability or anything else, is covered by the criminal code.  Any portrayal of it would be banned.  What about &ldquo;Maurice&rdquo; this distinguished film just released based on a novel by one of the greatest 20th century novelists, E. M. Foster?  The censor would have the power to ban this film on the grounds that it displayed illegal sexual activities.  Section 6 (1) (a) (ii) says that if &ldquo;the viewing of it would be likely to stir up hatred against any group of persons in the State on account of their race, nationality or religion&rdquo;.  The sentiment is one with which one agrees, but can this Bill actually prevent hatred?  Is it really going to be effective?  I am afraid I cannot believe it will.  I do not think legislation makes people good.  Taking on trust, however, his ethical position that it will make them good, I propose at this point to insert an amendment seeking to include incitement to hatred against persons on the grounds of race, nationality, religion and sexual orientation.</P>
    <P>I say this &mdash; and I hope what I have had to say has not been too rambling &mdash; in the light of the fact that I have been up all night at a fire which destroyed the Hirschfeld Centre in Fownes Street.  It is not known whether this was accidental or malicious.  I cannot help recalling an instance seven or eight years ago when I was nearly blown to pieces in a bomb attack on that Hirschfeld Community Centre.  Luckily with the use of our own resources and with the expediency of the fire brigade we managed to get out from this attack.  I know how negative images can incite to hatred and I strongly urge the Minister to consider the possibility of including some clause there.  Paragraph (iii) says that such works would be banned by the censor if they would tend, by reason of the inclusion of any obscene or indecent matter, to deprave or corrupt persons who might view it.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to get directly to the source of information which would lead somebody to conclude that such material actually does deprave or corrupt.  I accept that there are international reports which appear to be on different sides of this. My conclusion, having read a number of <Col N="1281" /> reports, is that there is very little to suggest that obscene or indecent matter seriously depraves or corrupts those who might view it.  This is what is normally known as pornography I suppose, from the Greek meaning the writing of prostitutes and the intention of this erotic or obscene material is to create excitation in the mind of the viewer.  In other words, to be perfectly blunt about it they are an aid to masturbation.  They are used as such all over the sophisticated world.</P>
    <P>I will not comment on this practice except to say that the distinguished social observer, Professor Kinsey, said that 99 per cent of men masturbate and the other 1 per cent were liars.  I think it is clear that whatever moral position one may take on this subject masturbation is the safest form of sex possible.  It may not be quite such a seriously depraving or corrupting thing as was thought in the Victorian period.</P>

      <P>The Senator represents the 1 per cent who were liars.</P>
      <P>The final section is where such a work depicts acts of gross violence or cruelty including mutilation and torture towards humans or animals, and with these sentiments I could not agree more wholeheartedly, particularly having in the last few weeks been a partial witness to an outbreak of cruelty in the streets of Dublin in which a bull terrier was set upon an unfortunate straying cat and that cat was almost torn to pieces.  I do not know whether a video of this activity was seen but there has been a rash of reports of this kind of incident in the newspapers. Perhaps there is a certain copy cat element in it.  I do not know.  It is a filthy, disgusting and degrading thing on which to embark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would say the same about so called snuff movies in which people are victimised sexually, tortured, humiliated and eventually apparently killed.  Of course, this is a most abominable practice.  I wonder why it is not possible to stamp this kind of thing out at source.  I am sure the Minister will agree with me that there <Col N="1282" /> should be some attempt at real international investigation to find in co-operation with other countries the source of this material and where the actual crime was committed.</P>
    <P>Murder is a crime in every jurisdiction. If murders are being committed in order to provide sexual gratification for people I would have no hesitation in saying are corrupt, I would like to see them followed to their source and the people fully prosecuted.</P>
    <P>In what I hope has not been too rambling a speech I hope I have raised some issues which the Minister will be able to examine.  I hope he will accept that I am interested in the philosophic basis on which the Bill is drafted.  I agree with the sentiments by and large which I believe motivated the Bill but I have a number of reservations about the way in which it will operate and I shall be tabling some amendments.</P>

      <P>It is worth playing again. I welcome the Bill and I think it is overdue. As Senator Manning said this Bill will be teased out and come alive on Committee Stage.  For that reason I do not have too much to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Manning said there was a suggestion of a licence fee of £150 for dealers and £1,000 for distributors or importers.  I would not like to think that there would be a £150 licence fee for dealers without some form of grading.  I <Col N="1283" /> appeal to the Minister to go for a smaller licence fee and if necessary a form of grading.  In most small towns now there are two or three video dealers and it would be a hardship on them to charge £150 when a dealer in a city with a big population had a turnover of ten times as much.  I would be more interested in a nominal licence fee which would compel the local dealer to be registered thereby bringing him under control.  There should be something in the licence as there is in a publican's licence where there is a fine and an endorsement for the first offence, a bigger fine and endorsement for the second offence, and after the third offence you lose the licence.</P>
    <P>This licensing system should be graded so that the people who are operating on a bigger scale would be asked to carry the burden.  A £1,000 fine is small for an importer who has a big volume of business.  I should like the licensing fees to be looked at again.</P>
    <P>In relation to the large quantities of video films coming into the country which are now of the order of tens of thousands it will be hard to control them.  If the same criteria and film censors are applied there is no hope of controlling the large numbers of films that there are in existence. More people would have to be employed in the film board and then you would face the difficulties of recruitment in the Civil Service where you cannot employ them.  Film censors at present are handling films in terms of hundreds.  The videos would be in tens of thousands.  It is going to be difficult to control them. A £1,000 fine would mean nothing to importers.  Anybody bringing in nasties &mdash; be they violence or sex films &mdash; would make up the price of the fine with a few of them.  There should be a bigger licence imposed on importers and a smaller licence on the retailers.  If you take retailers in towns like Abbeyfeale or Killarney where there are small populations with three or four dealers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have representatives <Col N="1284" /> both from Killarney and Abbeyfeale present.  I would like to see the licence of the smaller dealer at a lower cost.  I would like the Minister to apply criteria similar to those in the publican's licence, for the first offence a fine and an endorsement and eventually the loss of the licence.  The fact that people would lose the licence would be a far greater deterrent and hardship on them than a fine because they could make up the fine very easily.</P>
      <P>I shall make further points on Committee Stage but there is one point I should like to add now.  Senator Manning spoke about the committees that were set up.  He mentioned a lot of them that were not re-established, for example, the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to use his influence to have the Joint Committee on Small Businesses re-established.  This committee did great work.  The collapse of the H. Williams supermarkets might not have happened if the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987, had been enacted in time. That Bill was on the shelf since 1982 and our Government were responsible for that.  I will give credit where it is due and I give credit to the Minister, Deputy Reynolds, for introducing it.  I am sure when that Bill is enacted we will not have collapses such as this one and we will not have the people walking away overnight. I know this is not relevant to this Bill, but I take this opportunity to ask the Minister to use his influence in Cabinet to get that committee re-established since the precedent was set by Senator Manning.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A Chathaoirligh, I would like to thank Members of the Seanad for their contribution to this debate.  It has been a most interesting debate and quite a <Col N="1285" /> number of points of principle and points of detail have been referred to.  I will, of course, give further consideration to all of these points between now and Committee Stage.  In the meantime, however, there are a number of comments I can make in addition to those in my opening speech.</P>
    <P>Senator Hogan and other speakers following him welcomed the Bill.  I had expected that there would be a general welcome for the Bill.  Accordingly, we are not debating whether there should be a control system &mdash; that is agreed &mdash; but what system should be set up.</P>
    <P>Senator Hogan raised a number of specific points and I will comment on some of them and at the same time assuring the Senator and all other speakers that I will think about all the points made between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>This Bill involves restrictions on people's conduct.  At the same time, the provisions in the Bill are needed as a protection for the public generally.  I have been conscious in the drafting of the Bill of the inherent conflict between these two points and of the need to strike a proper balance between them.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a system of control on the supply of video films.  This system is needed to remove objectionable material from the market and to prevent any further such material from coming onto the market.  There have been widespread demands for controls of this nature and I am totally satisfied that a control system is needed.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that the Bill does not go far enough.  For instance, a gift of a recording of a prohibited video work from one individual to another is not an offence under the Bill.  Neither is it an offence to possess a recording of a prohibited video work provided that it is not for the purpose of supply.  I consider that providing for offences in the latter two cases would certainly be tilting the balance too far.  Many people would have recordings of prohibited video works prior to the Bill coming into operation and also it would be extremely difficult to enforce a provision that made possession <Col N="1286" /> or a gift among two individuals an offence.</P>
    <P>The main reason for not bringing these types of situation within the ambit of the Bill, however, is that I consider that to do so would be an excessive encroachment on people's lives.  Similarly to give the Garda power to enter premises on their own responsibility without a search warrant would be a great encroachment on the right to privacy in respect of people's premises.  Incidentally, a search warrant is necessary in the case of books under the Censorship of Publications Acts.</P>
    <P>Senator McEllistrim referred to some very important reports, and also Senator Maurice Manning, for example, the report of the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism which dealt with the control of video nasties, the U.S. report on pornography and the report in the United Kingdom which was quoted as well.  These important reports all support the case for control.  That support was on the basis that pornography and violence on the screen harms the viewers and leads to crimes, particularly by impressionable watchers, and that some video films should be banned therefore.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan agreed that there should not be a system of classification based on age.  However he expressed concern with the wording on which the censor with make his decision.  I will study this point. The intention in drafting the Bill was that any cinema film which had received a cinema certificate would get a supply certificate as a video film.  One consequence of this is that parents must supervise video films that their children watch.  It has been said it would be an unrealistic task to classify on age grounds.  Accordingly, parents must exercise their parental responsibility.</P>
    <P>Senator Paddy McGowan referred to the complexity of the Bill and the amount of work undertaken in its drafting.  I confirm that the Senator's comments, and other similar comments, are quite accurate, a great deal of hard work went into the drafting of the Bill and all of the work is not reflected in the Bill.  Other control systems were examined and rejected.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1287" /> Also I want to assure the House that there has been considerable consultation in the course of the drafting of the Bill. The Irish Videogram Association have had several meetings with my officials. They have outlined their views on the video films market and, indeed, they submitted a detailed memorandum on the subject of the control of videograms last January.  Their views have been examined thoroughly in the drafting of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The film censor has been consulted also about the proposed system of control. Naturally enough, he has considerable expertise in this area through his experience in dealing with cinema films and with the distributors of those films.  Also he is the person who will be examining the films under the proposed system and accordingly his views as to how the job should be done are extremely important. As there is a system of control in operation in Britain already, their 1984 Act has been studied.  There have been consultations with the British Videogram Association, with officials in the Home Office who were involved in the drafting of their Bill and with the British Board of Film Classification who deal with the classification of video films under the British systems.</P>
    <P>Apart from consultations, a considerable amount of material on video films and on censorship generally has been studied in the Department.  This includes, of course, the tenth report of the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism entitled controls on video nasties.  Senator Ryan mentioned one point in relation to material on cable television systems and material broadcast by satellite.  Material available on television is primarily a matter for our Oireachtas colleague, the Minister for Communications, Deputy Burke.  I have already been in touch with him about the position of television.</P>
    <P>All cable television system in operation in this country are wireless telegraphy and are licensed under the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, and section 2 of that Act prohibits the sending <Col N="1288" /> by wireless telegraphy of any message or communication of an indecent, obscene or offensive character.  In addition, regulation 10 (c) of the regulations governing the issue of cable television licence contains the following, and I quote:</P>
    <P>A licensee shall not use or allow to be used the wires forming part of the station (cable system) for any purposes other than the relay to the service points of the programmes the relay of which is authorised by the licence.</P>
    <P>Under the schedule to the regulations the Minister specifies the programme services which may be relayed on the system.</P>
    <P>There is no control on what a private individual with a satellite dish can receive.  In the case of satellite services, it needs to be borne in mind that what is transmitted is a matter for the legislation and control exercised by the country of origin.  Thus, for example, all of the English language satellite services originating in the UK are indirectly governed by the UK Cable Broadcasting Act, 1984, which essentially lays down the same standard for video services as applies to the ITV services particularly with regard to requirements in the field of decency and good taste.  Furthermore both the EC and the Council of Europe are currently preparing legally binding instruments concerning trans-frontier broadcasting with a view to ensuring that all programmes broadcast, including satellite channels, meet some basic minimum requirements.  Both of these instruments will have sections which prohibit pornography and which, for example, will require safeguards to be exercised in the level of violence on television.</P>
    <P>As stated in this debate, a system involving registration of suppliers and classification would be much more expensive than the system proposed in the Bill.  The smaller cost is not the reason for opting for the system in the Bill. However, I am satisfied that the system in the Bill is the best system.  I have examined the other systems and found them wanting or unnecessary.  The penalties in the Bill control supply and there <Col N="1289" /> is no need for registration.  Incidentally, I should mention that there will be no extra net cost to the Exchequer no matter what system is established.  The video industry will have to meet any extra costs.</P>
    <P>In the course of her remarks Senator Fennell referred to people who thought they saw a video nasty on RTE.  She is perfectly right in saying that they did not. RTE would not screen anything remotely resembling a video nasty.  What is clear is that some people do not know what a video nasty is.  That is their good fortune. These films are disgusting and people who have not seen them would find it hard to credit how vile they are.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I might say in reply to Senator Manning at this stage that having regard to what he said, and that he has not seen a video nasty, I am quite sure there are a number of people in this House who have not seen video nasties or who have not seen hard pornography films.  I will say to him that if they have time and if they want to see what exactly we are talking about, it will only take five or ten minutes of their time because I presume they will have seen more than enough if they can spare that five or ten minutes. They will be available to anyone who wants to see them by contacting my office in the Department of Justice.  It will only take five or ten minutes.  I am sure you will not have any intention of going beyond that.</P>
    <P>Senators Fennell and Manning referred to articles on the Bill in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 15 and 16 October by Ray Comiskey.  I was amazed at the contents of the statements made in those two articles in relation to the Bill.  Indeed, I arranged to have a letter delivered to <i>The Irish Times</i> on the afternoon of 16 October refuting point by point the major statements in the article which I regarded as unfounded.  The letter or its existence has not up to now been published.  I find it disappointing that <i>The Irish Times</i> have not seen fit to publish the letter to date. There was nothing in it which ought to have been censored on any yardstick. The letter pointed out, among other things, that those responsible for the articles <Col N="1290" /> were, of course, entitled to their opinion as to whether the Bill would be effective but that, in fact, there was no evidence whatsoever to establish that their opinion that it would not was correct.</P>
    <P>I set out the reasons which satisfied me as Minister for Justice that the Bill would work.  The available evidence points to the Video Recordings Bill being an effective Bill and to the objective of the Bill being achieved, that is, that no obscene videos would be allowed on to the market in the future and that those already on the market would be prohibited.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that <i>The Irish Times</i> did not see fit to publish the letter delivered by me on 16 October, given that they gave extensive coverage to one particular viewpoint in the two articles published on 15 and 16 October.</P>
    <P>Senator Robb put his remarks on this Bill in a wide context and I agree with him that we must attack video nasties because of the images they portray and the consequences of those images.  He expressed the hope that the Bill would not prove of little use as happened with some Acts.  I can assure the House that I am determined that this Bill will be effective and I will ensure that the controls proposed in it will be enforced.</P>
    <P>Senator Cullimore said the Bill may not succeed if it does not provide for registration of suppliers.  My view is that the Bill as drafted provides for heavy penalties including imprisonment and that those penalties will prove effective. Incidentally the British legislation does not provide for registration and that does not limit its effectiveness.</P>
    <P>Senator Maurice Manning asked a specific question about untitled blue movies: will they be controlled by the Bill.  The answer is very definitely yes, they will be controlled.  They will not get a supply certificate and therefore their supply will be illegal.  Anybody who supplies them will be prosecuted and will be subject to the penalties in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Hanafin that people were very concerned at the availability of certain video films.  I have received many requests to tackle the <Col N="1291" /> problem quickly.  These requests came from a wide spectrum of society.  I share their concern and accordingly I was determined to bring this Bill before the Houses of the Oireachtas as quickly as possible.  Everything I have heard this evening has reassured me that it was necessary and that the priority I attached to the Bill was justified.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Cregan that there is a big and a difficult job to be done. Nevertheless I am satisfied that the Bill provides the framework within which that job can be done.  As I said earlier an amount of work and study went into the drafting of this Bill.  The experience of other countries was studied and we learned from their success and from their mistakes.  One of these mistakes relates to labelling of videos.  Our provision whereby labels will be available only from the film censor is tighter than the controls elsewhere.  I am satisfied that it provides the answer to one specific problem mentined by Senator Cregan during the course of his contribution.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly and others, too, raised the question of copyright.  This is a matter primarily for our Oireachtas colleague, Deputy Albert Reynolds, Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The House will know that on 14 October last he restored to the Order Paper the legislation which is necessary to ensure that we will be able to deal effectively with this problem.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy referred to the various representations.  In drafting the Bill every effort was made to examine the many and differing points of view which exist in relation in particular to the details of the control system which should be established. I will give further consideration to the representations he referred to.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris referred to the system of censorship already in operation and said that we should learn from our experience of those systems.  I would like to ensure the Senator that the existing systems have been studied in the context of the drafting of the Bill.  Basically that study indicated that all in all those systems have worked reasonably well.  This Bill, therefore, follows the broad outline <Col N="1292" /> of the existing systems, that is, the banning of material on the basis of stated criteria, the initial decision to be made by a censoring authority and that decision being appealable to an appeal authority.</P>
    <P>The question has been raised about the provision in the Bill providing for the making of a prohibition order in respect of a video film if the viewing of it would be likely to cause persons to commit crimes, whether by inciting or encouraging them to do so or by indicating or suggesting ways of doing so or of avoiding detection. The comment has been made that this provision could be used in the future to restrict the depiction of sexual or political crime.  I regard this particular provision in the Bill as being totally justified and I do not see any reason why it should be changed.  Video films which portray in detail how particular crimes could be committed could be used as a method of instruction in how to commit those crimes and I believe that this should not be allowed.  As regards sexual or political crime it is not for this Bill to decide what should be crimes in those particular areas.  The Bill will deal with the situation in relation to crime as it is defined elsewhere. If a particular action is defined in another legislation as a crime then it is a crime.  That is the end of the matter as far as this Bill is concerned.</P>
    <P>I hope I have dealt with all of the points raised by the Senators.  I feel that the real discussion on this Bill, in the words of Senator Manning, will be during the course of the Committee Stage.  I have quite an open mind on any amendments that will be proposed to the House.  I will welcome discussion on any amendments and they will be treated with the respect they should be treated with.  If I can be convinced of the need for any such amendments I will willingly accept them.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Senator J. O'Toole on 28 October, 1987:</P>
    <P>Larger classes, less pupil teacher contact, a worsened pupil teacher ratio, thousands of redundant teachers, later recognition and diagnosis of learning problems, no prospects for those at present in colleges of education, and a damaged school administration structure being the inevitable and regressive consequences of the Minister for Education's proposals as outlined in Department of Education circular 20/87 are unacceptable to Seanad Éireann which now calls for the immediate withdrawal of the circular.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in the House last week, the Labour Party have no problem in supporting in full this Private Members' Motion on the consequences of the Government's cutback in primary education.  I reject out of hand the Government amendment which has been put down to the motion.  If we frame everything we do in Government on the basis that we are conscious of the grave state of our economic and social life and recognising the Government's determination to pursue a fiscal policy, obviously the Minister will have failed at Cabinet to get what would be priority funding, particularly in the area of primary education.  Regarding the well-known, infamous circular which the Minister has circulated to all schools, my party in another place will be calling for its withdrawal on the basis that it will create widespread problems for those people involved in education, particularly at the primary level.  I am not just being political about this.  Everybody in the country is now concerned about the consequences of the circular which the Minister has issued.  I should like to refer to <i>The Irish Independent</i>, Tuesday, 3 November, 1987, which says that a bishop has entered into the campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister liked dealing with the religious institutions when in Opposition. They have now, unfortunately, turned on her and they have suggested that they will urge people to visit her at her clinics &mdash; and I am sure she has enough of people doing so already.  The parents' associations will be visiting the Minister at her clinics as, indeed, will the Bishop of Cork, according to the newspaper article of yesterday.  The Reverend Dr. Michael Murphy said that if the Minister did not <Col N="1295" /> change her plans the consequences for our children and for the teaching profession would be too serious to contemplate. That is a very strong statement from a bishop.  When he was speaking at the celebration to mark the national school in Macroom he said that the class sizes were already creating discipline problems and making it difficult for teachers to attend to the special needs of weaker pupils.</P>
    <P>We are all concerned about the damage that may be done to disadvantaged pupils, particularly at primary level, and to the weaker section of pupils.  The Minister annoyed me by linking the amendment with the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  In that programme the Minister recognised the importance of the educational system in the promotion of equity in society.  She said she would ensure the implementation of whatever adjustments were necessary in that sector because of financial considerations so that the burden of adjustment would not fall on the disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>We, in the Labour Party, contend that exactly the opposite will arise following the Minister's circular and we are saying this on the basis of the Estimates as published. In the total area of education we have a reduction of £86 million in our budget and more than half of that cutback will affect the primary education area. There is a reduction of £42.7 million which in primary education is a reduction of 10 per cent over last year's funding. This is not dealing with problems of a reduction in the capital projects which the Minister has also initiated in her published Estimates.  She has reduced the capital programme from £96 million to £54 million which is a drop of 44 per cent over last year's figures.  I am saying all this in the knowledge that the Minister &mdash; and quite an able spokesperson she was for the Fianna Fáil Party at the time &mdash; when in Opposition took it on herself to campaign in the Houses of the Oireachtas and throughout the country and in meetings with teachers and others to actually put on the record her attitude <Col N="1296" /> towards a previous Government regarding their lack of funding in the whole area of education.  It can be embarrassing to listen to the contradiction in terms nowadays.</P>
    <P>In the area of job losses it is estimated and predicted that there will be some 2,000 jobs lost in the educational area following the Minister's estimate.  There is an area of disagreement between the professional teaching organisations and the Minister.  They have said 2,000, the Minister has said 1,200.  It is obvious that apart from the area of disagreement about the figures, that when the students have finished their training and come on the market expecting to get teaching posts next year, the figure of 2,000 job losses or people without jobs will certainly be exceeded.</P>
    <P>Looking realistically at the specific cuts the Minister has itemised, we consider that there will be a dramatic increase in class sizes resulting in classes, at times, of well over 40 pupils.  Specific provision for administrative principals will be removed.  There will be at least three to six pupils extra in every class.  If we relate that to any of the schools in my constituency &mdash; in Cashel, Golden, Thomas-town or Tipperary &mdash; depending on which school I pick and depending on the number of teachers there will be increased class sizes.  There will also be losses of teachers.  This is contrary to everything that the Minister advocated in Opposition.  In 1983 the Minister said that Dáil Éireann would condemn the Government for the present chaos and confusion in the school transport scheme inflicting hardship on many thousands of families.  In 1985 the Minister said she deplored the major cutbacks in education and finances which have led to excessive increases in the size of classes, the unemployment of large number of teachers and many other serious problems in our schools.  The Minister called on the Government to make full and adequate provision for education.  On 4 March 1986 the Minister said in Dáil Éireann that that House condemned the arbitrary and precipitate decision of the Government to close down Carysfort College, I do <Col N="1297" /> not hear you saying a word about it at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that immediate action should be taken to ensure that this great and valuable institution be retained as an integral part of our higher education system with a specific role in teachers' education.  What are we going to do with the teachers who will be educated next year when they come onstream?  We will not have jobs for them.  On 15 April 1986 the Minister said that the Dáil, in view of the deep and widespread anxiety of the parents and pupils in regard to the holding of the school examinations that year, called on the Government to arrange for an immediate appointment of an independent mediator in the dispute with teachers.  On 4 June 1986 the Minister condemned the recent excessive increases in third level fees of VEC colleges. This motion is dealing with primary education, so I will not go into other comments.  Comments were made by some of the Minister's colleagues &mdash; whom I will not name but they are on the record of the other House &mdash; in the whole area of teacher class sizes.  There is no doubt in any of our minds that once you start increasing the numbers of pupils whom teachers are expected to teach, look after and discipline, education will suffer and the disadvantaged in our educational system will suffer most.  I am contending also that the figures published are a complete contradiction of everything that the Minister ever said in Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1985 the total amount estimated for building, equipping and furnishing national schools was almost £34 million. In 1986 it was £33 million.  In 1987 it was £30 million.  Next year it will be £15 million.  In other words, now 50 per cent less is being allocated than was allocated in 1985, when the Minister commented that the figure then was not enough.  The first provision for capital and equipment funding in 1987 under the present Ministry <Col N="1298" /> showed a drop of 10 per cent on the previous Government's allocations.  The Minister was critical of that.  She criticised the 10 per cent, considering it to be totally inadequate.  It is important for me to find out that the reduction in 1988 over the previous figures will be about 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>The capital grants towards operating national schools in 1985 were £13 million. In 1986 they were £14 million.  In 1987 they were £14.5 million and in 1988 the Minister has decreased them to £14.4 million, a drop of 1 per cent.  Teachers, pupils, parents, clerics and bishops are expressing concern.  We, as a responsible group in this House are calling on the Minister to have a rethink.  The members of the Minister's own party have said other things in this House regarding education. Senator Mullooly, made a very considered and responsible contribution on this motion last week when he stated the realities as he saw them as a teacher with experience, in the knowledge that the Estimates that were published would not be sufficient to do the job as he saw it should be done.</P>
    <P>We realise there are funding problems in the Department as well as in other Departments.  If the Government are not prepared to face their responsibility about ensuring that the money due to the various Departments, particularly the Department of Finance, is not collected from the people who owe it, then what hope have we of ensuring that there are sufficient funds available to the Government to carry out the work they have been elected to do, particularly in the area of primary education?  Even in the most stringent budget situations it must have priority with any Minister or any Government.  Knowing the Minister's tenacity, I had hoped she would have done better than this at Cabinet.</P>
    <P>I am also suggesting that the total capital and revenue losses in this year's budget exceed the amount of money that could easily have been collected by people who owe it to the State.  It has been confirmed by the Minister for Finance that money in excess of this year's cutbacks is still due to the State.  What do we owe our people out there?  We owe <Col N="1299" /> them at least the honesty to say that we failed as a Government to collect the money that was due in order to deliver the service.  That justifies in some way our attitude to the primary sector in education which is one of the disadvantaged areas in education.  The attitude seems to be that it is no longer a priority because we are unable to collect the kind of money due to us in order to deliver the service.  We are failing in our responsibility to the young generation of people to whom we all had a commitment.  The numbers are increasing everyday.  In 1980 the number in education was 540,000.  In 1987 it was 560,000.  The numbers in the special primary schools have gone up from 8,168 to 8,471.  There is an increasing demand in that sector.  How can we have cutbacks when the need is greater and the demands on the teachers are greater?  If we expect the teachers to respond we must show them that we have given them some priority in the allocation of what is recognised by everybody to be scarce resources.</P>
    <P>I support the motion in full.  My party will be calling on the Minister in another place to withdraw this circular.  It is creating chaos in the educational sector.</P>

      <P>I regret that I could not be here last week, but I did take the opportunity of getting all the transcripts of what transpired during the course of the proceedings.  I found them most interesting and most constructive.  Before I formally speak, I would ask Senator Ferris to convey to the learned bishop of whom he spoke that he would be most welcome to my home any Saturday.  I keep open house from 8 in the morning till 12 at night.  I look forward to seeing him.</P>
      <P>In replying to this debate, there are two main considerations I wish to discuss. The first of these is the bearing which the general financial situation has in relation to the measures proposed.  The second is a consideration of what is involved for schools and pupils in the pupil/teacher ratio changes.</P>
      <P>In regard to the first of these &mdash; the general financial situation &mdash; I would like to begin with what I said in Dáil Éireann recently, namely, that in different circumstances, these measures would not have been introduced.  I want to make that plain.  There is absolutely no need for me to come here and to try to describe them as educationally advanced measures. I am quite up front about that.  I see no reason to say otherwise.</P>
      <P>Some of these circumstances I referred to in my contribution to the recent debate in Dáil Éireann on the general Estimates for 1988.  I think it is no harm at all to repeat some of the points I made then. People have a habit of looking at the measures which need to be taken in particular areas entirely separately from the general financial situation which gives rise to them.  Clearly, it is much easier to attack measures to effect savings and to highlight the inevitable sacrifices which are part and parcel of any measure of savings if the basic situation giving rise to the need for such savings is ignored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1301" /> A first point is the general financial position.  As I stated in Dáil Éireann, the current budget deficit &mdash; as a percentage of GNP grew from 4.4 per cent in 1976 to 8.5 per cent in 1986.  In the same period, the national debt increased almost seven fold, and now stands at £25 billion pounds.  It is difficult for most people to comprehend fully figures of this magnitude.  It is equivalent to a debt of over £7,000 in respect of every person in the land or of around £20,000 in respect of every person gainfully employed.  The most immediately palpable effect of this is in the annual cost of paying the interest. At £2,000 million per annum this is equivalent to almost the entire present yield from PAYE and it is being added to each year.  Something had simply got to be done to stop this development and action has been taken in the measures introduced in March of this year and now in the production of the estimates for next year.  It is the first time ever that the Estimates, the budgetary arrangements and the allocation of moneys to various Government Departments have been available so early to the various agencies. It is an enormous advantage in the planning process.</P>
    <P>Some people who accept that something had got to be done to bring down public expenditure nevertheless object to any of the savings needed being made in the education area, or in any other particular area.  It is said that our young people represent the future of our country. Nobody will quarrel with that statement. It is when it comes to putting it into practice in a very difficult financial situation where funds are restricted that the disagreements arise.</P>
    <P>The social services in the areas of health, education and social welfare represent, between them, in the current year, 65 per cent of gross expenditure on non-capital supply services.  The three of those together represent 65 per cent.  It is inevitable that any significant curtailment of public expenditure would have to involve cuts in these areas.  Inevitably, also, any such cuts would be met by the objection that the health of the community <Col N="1302" /> was being endangered, that the proper education of our young people was being denied or that the poor were being made to suffer.  On the social welfare front, the Minister for Social Welfare has pointed out that the Government, in pursuance of their announced policy of protecting the weaker sections of the community in any cuts, have in fact budgeted for an increase in the social welfare provision.  In the health area, the Minister for Health is pursuing a careful policy of rationalising our health services.  In the general circumstances I have outlined, funding for education has to make its contribution.</P>
    <P>It is not enough to suggest, as was suggested here last week, that the money to fund social services including education could be found quite simply if all sectors of the community paid their full tax liability or paid more than is currently demanded of them.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> indicates clearly the Government's commitment to reform of taxation.  Nevertheless, it is illusory to think that there are untapped hundreds of millions available to the Government almost &ldquo;for the asking&rdquo;.  There have been many estimations in the past of what additional yields &mdash; again in hundreds of millions &mdash; could be got from farmers, or from the self-employed, or from business firms if only the Government applied themselves to the task.  These are highly speculative suggestions, generally reflecting the interest group the speaker represents, and are an entirely unrealistic approach to our current difficulties.</P>
    <P>Suffice it for me to say that the Government have applied themselves with vigour to the collection of outstanding taxes.  Many Senators who represent, as we all do, a constituency or community, have had people in the past number of weeks in your constituency saying: &ldquo;The Revenue are hounding me; the sheriffs are after me; can you do A, B, C or D?&rdquo;  We have all had those cases in our business.  It is ironic that we are trying to do that and now the feedback is coming to us saying we must not do it.  I understand <Col N="1303" /> that because it is part of the representative nature of the democratic process, but it is a fact that we are doing it.  Most Senators in their clinics or meetings with their constituents, would have found that.</P>
    <P>That being said, it is worth dwelling on what is, in fact, being spent on education. Figures and facts might seem to bore when they are put in statistical form, but it is worth bearing in mind &mdash; because I want to put on the record of the House the actual money spent on education &mdash; that no less than 6.5 per cent will go on education.</P>
    <P>Before 1979, we are spending less than 5 per cent on education.  In 1986, 16½ per cent of net Exchequer expenditure on non-capital services was spent on education services.  In 1988, even with the savings measures proposed, 18 per cent of such expenditure will go on education services.  In other words, out of every £100 which the Exchequer will spend in 1988 £18 will be spent on paying for the education system.  With the many other demands on the public purse, we simply cannot afford to divert a larger slice of our resources to Education.</P>

I intend to do so in the terms which I have outlined <Col N="1304" /> and will not accept dictation as to the type of words I should use.</P>
      <P>The point was made here last week that our expenditure per head of the population is significantly lower on education than in a number of other European countries.  This overlooks the basic fact as stated in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, that GNP per head of population here is only X of that of the EC countries generally.  It is easy to be selective in using statistics.  It is, of course, even further below the more well-off countries.  Again, a big factor in this is our dependency ratio, the ratio of total population to the working population. This is significantly higher than many of our European neighbours.  This is particularly relevant in regard to education.</P>
      <P>Our high dependency ratios is mainly due to the fact that family size in Ireland is large in comparison with European countries.  This means that we have, proportionately, a much larger population of children and young people for whom education has to be provided.  In fact, close to one million of our population of just under 3½ million, or between one in three to four people in our population, is a child or young person attending school or college.</P>

      <P>I regret that I had to leave the House.  Please excuse me.  We were talking about the plight of big families and the number of people in Ireland in education.  Both our lower <i>per capita</i> GNP and our higher dependency ratio impose an enormous burden on us in providing education services for our young population.  Nevertheless, as 6.5 per cent of our GNP and at 18 per cent of non-capital Government spending, we are as good as most advanced European countries and ahead of many.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This reflects itself in the actual levels of expenditure on education services.  In 1988, we will be spending £1,129 million <Col N="1305" /> on current services.  This may seem like a reduction of 2.8 per cent on the 1987 provision.  However, because January 1988 begins with a bank holiday and a weekend, a pay issue for national teachers which would normally fall in 1988 will be a charge on 1987.  This means we need about £37 million less to pay the same salaries in 1988 as in 1987.  When account is taken of this one factor, the £1,129 million to be spent in 1988 is a decrease of less than 1 per cent on what was provided for 1987 but in fact a small increase of 0.4 per cent over the outturn now being projected for 1987.  I do not think this has generally been adverted to or appreciated.</P>
    <P>If I could turn now to the measures in hand to effect a saving in education spending, I would like to refer to the composition of the primary education budget in the present year.  This is as follows:</P>

    </table>
    <P>This gives a total of £466 million.  It will be noted that teachers' salaries and allowances comprise 75 per cent.  If pensions are added as a cost relating to employing teachers, the pay and pensions bill amounts to over 80 per cent of expenditure, leaving all other expenditure including other pay provisions to come from the balance of less than 20 per cent. I know that some people will claim that this is because not enough money is allocated to expenditures other than pay and pensions.  Nevertheless, in view of the very heavy cost to the public purse of the education services generally, it would not be reasonable to expect that this situation should be changed by spending further large sums on these other areas.</P>
    <P>Might I say at this point that, as funds <Col N="1306" /> are limited, there is much to be said for the option that is represented in the relative percentages of spending on pay and pensions on the one hand and on other headings on the other.  If our resources are less than we would wish, it is better to have spent them on ensuring a high quality of teacher in our schools.  There are other educational systems which, perhaps, have placed less esteem on their teachers.  It is not an adequate consolation for a lowered quality of teaching if more generous provision is made for non-teacher costs.  I say this because there is currently creeping into this whole debate an aspect which I do not wish at all to contribute to because of the genuine high regard in which I hold teachers and will continue to hold them.  I refer to what I might call an insidious element by some section of the population of wishing to apportion to teachers some sort of idea that they should decide to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the savings to be accounted for.  I heard such a view expressed on a radio programme after 5 o'clock and I thought what a crazy turn of events the whole debate is taking.  That is why I wish to take the point there.</P>
    <P>Because, in our situation, so high a proportion of total spending goes on pay and pensions the proportionately smaller segment of non-teacher expenditures cannot sustain reductions in funding of an order large enough, <i>in toto</i>, to yield the savings that are necessary.  There will be some reduction in the costs of running colleges of education, particularly because of the phasing out of Carysfort College.  It has been necessary, in the coming year, severely to restrict the capital allocation.  However, any lesser amounts than have been provided would be insufficient to maintain the colleges of education and the capital programme must have enough money to meet commitments. Managerial bodies have made strong pleas in regard to the level of grants for operating costs of schools and it is impossible to contemplate any reduction in the grant rate.  Relatively little of the savings to be effected on school transport are likely to be met from primary school transport.  The &ldquo;other <Col N="1307" /> costs&rdquo; comprise grants towards the cost of school books for necessitous pupils, the special educational projects for disadvantaged areas, the costs of child care assistants in schools for the handicapped and of caretakers and clerical assistants in ordinary schools, the costs associated with providing in-service courses for teachers and for assisting teachers' centres throughout the country and various minor expenditures in the form of incidental expenses and miscellaneous grants.  These expenditures could not reasonably be further curtailed and, even if they were, the sums realised thereby would not be substantial.  I am making this point because people often &mdash; and quite rightly: I appreciate the trouble they take &mdash; write to you or meet you and make a suggestion about how savings could be affected in one or other area of education.  Quite genuinely they would have thought through the idea.  Mostly these suggestions would be in writing. I always ask someone to look at these suggestions and see if there is anything in them, if a saving could be made in the area referred to.  Invariably I have found, often going through such suggestions and looking at them very carefully that they would not yield any savings.  Occasionally there would be one or two points worth considering but mostly they would be entirely irrelevant and would not be sustainable in the light of the type of savings that we are looking for.  In saying that I do not wish in any way to stifle the creative ideas that people have or the points they make.</P>
    <P>Because of the circumstances I have outlined, there was no alternative but to consider a significant reduction in pay costs and, practically speaking, this could only be done by reducing numbers in the teaching force.  This, as the House knows, is being done through two measures, the increase from 35 to 38 in the number of pupils required per teacher and the withdrawal of specific provision in the schedule of average enrolments in respect of non-teaching or administrative principals.</P>
    <P>The increase from 35 to 38 does not <Col N="1308" /> necessarily mean an extra three pupils in every class nor does it mean that the pupil-teacher ratio goes from 35 to 38.  I hope you do not think I am labouring this point but so many erroneous ideas and so many misconceptions have grown up that I do intend to emphasise it.  The pupil-teacher ratio is in fact currently 26.8 to 1.  This is expected to increase to 29.1 following implementation of the measures.  The pupil-teacher ratio means what it says, namely, the total number of pupils divided by the total number of teachers.</P>
    <P>This, however, is not the same as average class size.  Currently, average class size is approximately 30.5.  When the measures proposed have gone into effect, average class size will rise to approximately 33.</P>
    <P>The difference between pupil-teacher ratio and average class size resides in the numbers of remedial teachers, of concessionary posts in disadvantaged areas and of teachers of special schools and classes.  These are included in calculating pupil-teacher ratio but not in calculating class size.  But the difference between the two figures does illustrate the extent to which we have allocated the available teaching force to remedial posts, to posts in disadvantaged areas and to special education.</P>
    <P>Overall, it is estimated that the measures will result in 1,800 posts becoming surplus.  The teachers holding these posts may, in the general case, opt to have their names places on panels for redeployment. It is expected that some 500 teachers will be redeployed through vacancies arising in the normal way either through retirements, through teachers leaving the service other than through redundancy and through other adjustments arising from the operation of the career breaks scheme.  This will leave an estimated 1,300 teachers who it is envisaged will apply and be accepted on the basis of the voluntary redundancy scheme.</P>
    <P>I would like to explain further the operation of the measures.  In regard to the number of pupils being increased by three &mdash; from 35 to 38 &mdash; for each teacher, this does not mean that the pupil-teacher <Col N="1309" /> ratio is going from 35 to 38.  What I have explained about average class size shows this.  Some of the reasons why average class size is different from the 35 to 38 pupils needed per teacher lies in the position at the beginning of the schedule of average enrolments for appointments.  If there were strictly a 35 to 1 ratio, say, then the principal teacher would count as the first teacher.  However this is not so and the first assistant &mdash; who is therefore the second teacher &mdash; is currently appointed at an enrolment of 33 &mdash; or 36 as it will be after 1 January.  Thus class size in a two-teacher school with an enrolment of 36 is 18 to 1.  This feature of the first point on the appointments schedule moderates the class size in smaller schools.  In larger schools class size approaches 35 to 1 at present and will approach 38 to 1 from next January.  But when we hear talk of classes of 50 resulting from the new measures, it is useful to bear in mind that an additional number not exceeding 38 will entitle a school to another teacher.</P>
    <P>The reason why we hear of very large classes is in fact the choices schools make for organisational reasons.  For example, a school with 300 pupils will, under the new schedule, have eight teachers &mdash; a principal and seven assistants.  This gives an average class size of 37 to 38.  In such a school, if, say, there happen to be 45 pupils in 4th standard, it is open to the school to group a number of these pupils with either 3rd standard or 5th standard. This is a common situation in all small schools.  For example one-, two-, three-and four-teacher schools, which comprise up to 2,000 out of 3,300 national schools, must combine standards and do as a matter of course.  However, the 300-pupil school in my example may prefer to leave all 45 4th standard pupils in one class rather than divide the group.  This is a practice from which my Department have in the past tried to dissuade schools and it is the chief reason for the existence of over-large classes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many Members who are finding this fascinating and I intend to speak on it.  At any rate, it means that the new schedule need not lead to the over-large classes that have been alleged if schools are willing to give due consideration to matters of organisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of smaller schools, most of them will not experience any change in numbers in class.  Thus currently the third teacher in a 3-teacher schools is retained on an enrolment of 65. Under the new schedule, an enrolment of 71 will be required.  Thus three-teacher schools with enrolments of less than 71 will become two-teacher schools. However, under the existing schedule, the requirement for appointing a fourth teacher is 105.  Thus all the three-teacher schools with enrolments between 71 and 104 will experience no change whatsoever. Similarly, the retention figure for six teachers will go up from 175 to 190 and six-teacher schools with between 175 and 189 pupils will become five-teacher. However, as the requirement for appointing a seventh teacher under the existing schedule is 210, six-teacher schools with enrolments between 190 and 209 will experience no change.</P>
      <P>Of course, all larger schools will lose one teacher and very large schools more than one.  But, again, this will be proportional to the new measures increasing the appointment requirement by approximately one-twelfth &mdash; from 35 to 38. Thus, as a consequence of this particular measure, large schools will lose approximately one post in 12.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason why the reduction will be greater in large schools is the additional measure affecting the administrative principals.  Without this measure, it would have been necessary to introduce a sharper increase in enrolment requirements from the increase decided, namely, from 35 to 38.  It was, in the circumstances, preferable to withdraw the concession in the existing schedule which facilities a school organisation <Col N="1311" /> which frees the principal of a large school from teaching duties.  The new regulation does not forbid a school so to organise classes that the principal continues to be free of class duties.  It does, however, withdraw the facilitating concession, as I have said, and leaves the school with the choice of whether the principal will remain administrative, non-teaching with the consequence that class sizes will be bigger.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that this measure will not be welcome to principals, it must be noted that large schools also have vice-principal teachers and, generally, in schools of eight teachers or more, one or more teachers with posts of responsibilities. In many very large schools, there continue to be employed clerical assistants as secretaries; despite the fact that recruitment under that scheme has been terminated, phasing out is a very slow process and in many schools they have availed of the SES scheme to employ both caretakers and school secretaries on an annual basis.  I am confident that the existence of these facilities will enable principals of large schools to make satisfactory arrangements in regard to the necessary administrative and clerical duties in their schools.</P>
    <P>In the earlier part of this debate last week, Senator O'Toole listed many schools which would lose posts.  At this point, my comment would be that it would be a matter of surprise if a measure to reduce numbers did not have some such effect.  He also made much of the situation in north Dublin.  Many of the schools in that area are large.  It would, again, not be a matter of surprise if such large schools were to lose more than one post.  I suspect, however, that in some such instances the kind of down-turn in enrolments which is a feature of housing areas of a certain age is a factor.  In other words, some of the schools in his sample might have been going to lose posts in any event, due to a down-turn in enrolments, even without the introduction of the new schedule.</P>
    <P>Finally, he regarded this as striking particularly at disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1312" /> What he means here, I think, is the effect I have already described of the measures on large schools, particularly in view of the non-teaching principal measure. However, not all large schools are in disadvantaged areas nor are all schools in disadvantaged areas large.  Moreover, remedial teaching posts tend to be more commonly placed in schools in disadvantaged areas.  I cannot agree with his discounting of the fact that neither remedial posts nor the concessionary posts for disadvantaged area schools as such are being reduced in numbers.</P>
    <P>The most I can say to Senator O'Toole at this point is that, if the figure of 1,800 posts proves to be an underestimate and if there are particular situations of unusual difficulty, I would be prepared to look at individual cases on their merits.</P>

      <P>Indeed when I met with Senator O'Toole and his union this morning at a very full and discursive meeting I made that very same point.</P>
      <P>My last point would be to situate the present measures in the context of developments in pupil-teacher numbers over a period.  This began with a revision of certain appointment figures in 1960. Under the 1960 arrangements, an enrolment of 245 was required to retain a 5th assistant teacher and 465 to retain a 10th assistant.  The new figures from January next will be 190 and 380, respectively.  In 1960, an additional 45 pupils was required for each additional teacher.</P>
      <P>Over the years since then, regular revisions of the schedule have been made.  However, of particular interest is the 1974 revision from which I propose to quote a few examples and compare them with the figures from January, 1988.  This 1974 remains until 1978.  When we hear comments or remarks that we are back to the hungry thirties&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is worth remarking that talking about the hungry thirties and bringing in such a figure is quite unnecessarily <Col N="1314" /> scaremongering.  The statistics for assistants are as follow: The appointment, the retention, the appointment and the retention and you have the speeches in front of you.</P>

    <P>This schedule continued in operation until 1978.  Two points may be made about this.  First, if our situation as a nation living beyond its means indicates that we must get back to one where we provide ourselves with services only at a level we can afford, then the situation schools were in in the mid-seventies is not far from being a true reflection of what we can currently afford in fact.  If we are all honest and cast our minds back to the mid to late seventies &mdash; and I do not fault any particular Government; I fault all political figures in this &mdash; it was maybe at that point that we started to go wrong.  Secondly, it will be said that the present curriculum cannot be taught if class sizes increase.  This curriculum was introduced in schools in 1971 and the enrolment schedule now being introduced is, at almost every point, far more favourable than that which obtained in 1971 when the new curriculum was introduced.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, much is often made of the more favourable position in relation to the pupil-teacher ratio obtaining in other European countries.  If it is borne in mind that most of these countries are wealthier than we are &mdash; we cannot deny that &mdash; then the remarks I made at the beginning still stand.  The proportion of GNP we are spending on education is high and we, as a Government, have made up our mind that the current economic situation just cannot be allowed to continue.  The fact that we have addressed it in the 1987 Estimates and in the budget and now continue to address it in this motion does not rule out that we are conscious of the various measures which have had to be taken in the various Government Departments so that we could come to grips with the economic situation.</P>
    <P>My purpose &mdash; and I am very glad of the occasion of the debate here in the House tonight &mdash; in coming here was first to thank the proposer of the motion and the proposer of the amendment for giving me the opportunity of coming to the Seanad and for placing on record the facts of the case.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, the economic situation dictates the measures and the positions which we have had to take on various issues.  I am concerned, as Minister for Education, and will continue to be concerned that the provision we make &mdash; and it is a hefty provision &mdash; for the running of the educational services in this country will continue at the very high level it obtains.  I put on record, as I have always done, my appreciation of the continuing high quality of teachers we have in our schools.  When we look across <Col N="1315" /> the water and we see the type of teaching that is operating there we are very lucky. I know we cannot underestimate the benefit of our teachers in our schools.  I thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh for the courtesy of allowing me to speak and the House for hearing me.</P>

The circular in question is deplorable and its effects are potentially very damaging. We believe that the most vulnerable in the educational system will be the ones who will suffer most.  We also believe that in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> the unions were sold a pup by the Government.  No sooner was the ink dry than the Estimates appeared with the inevitable large-scale job losses included in them.</P>
      <P>We believe &mdash; and I am merely stating the position now because this will be the subject of a major motion in the other House and, hopefully, in this House at a later stage &mdash; that the unions and the Government should renegotiate the wage settlement element so that money can be fred from salaries to services.  Our priority is the safeguarding of the services especially in primary schools.  We believe this priority is shared by many people including many of those who would benefit from the wage increase.  We will formally be proposing this in the other House.  I want to give notice to the House this evening that it is on that basis we are supporting the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened with great interest to the <Col N="1316" /> Minister's speech.  I listened to it as somebody who understands, and who understood over the past four or five years, the nature of the problems facing our economy and facing this country.  It is difficult to sit and listen &mdash; in spite of the very nice remarks of the Minister to me &mdash; to a speech which was a mixture of patronising and lecturing which was given as if the past four years did not exist.  I welcome the conversion of the Minister but deplore the heavy-handed way in which she is going about implementing her policy.  It is difficult to sit through a speech like that and remember the slogans, the taunts and the jibes of the past four years when there was a better way and when there was no problem. However, I leave the content of that to my colleague Senator Kennedy.</P>

      <P>I would like to support this motion that Seanad Éireann rejects the proposals contained in circular 20/87 from the Department of Education and calls for the immediate withdrawal of this circular by the Minister for Education because, as the motion has indicated, the implementation of these proposals will have the following inevitable and damaging consequences: (1) larger classes, (2) less pupil-teacher contact, (3) a worsened pupil-teacher ratio, (4) thousands of redundant teachers, (5) later recognition and diagnosis of learning problems, (6) no prospects for those in colleges of education and (7) a damaged school administration structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Circular 20/87 and the 1988 Estimates for primary education represent a vicious and unprecedented attack by this Minister for Education and by this Administration on the primary school system, with a staggering decrease of £43 million in the allocation for primary schools. There will be a 50 per cent reduction in the allocation for primary school buildings, reduced from £30 million in 1987 to a mere £15 million in 1988, and a massive disimprovement in the pupil-teacher ratio.  Thousands of teachers will go on redeployment panels so that in a matter of two years about two thousand teachers <Col N="1317" /> will be wasted out of the educational system.</P>
    <P>Even under existing conditions we have the largest classes in western Europe and the worst pupil-teacher ratio. We have a pupil-teacher ratio of approximately 27.1 as compared with 10.6 for Denmark, 15.2 for Italy, 21.1 for England, 21.9 for West Germany and 23.4 for Northern Ireland.  This Government and this Minister for Education who came into power with a commitment to reduce class sizes are proposing to penalise the children of Ireland in every school, to bludgeon down the numbers actually teaching thereby making our primary classrooms the most crowded and chaotic in the western world.  As well as that, schools with more than eight teachers will lose their non-teaching administrative principal who will be required to go back to the classroom leaving the school without guidance, supervision, care and direction. This drastic and intolerable situation which would result from the implementation of circular 20/87 is summed up in a statement issued from Tom Honan, President of the Irish National Teachers Organisation on 13 October 1987 when he said and I quote:</P>
    <P>A massive reduction in the number of primary teachers and a swingeing cut in the moneys for the building and maintenance of primary schools represents the worst attack on the educational service since the hungry thirties.</P>
    <P>That was from the President of the INTO, not from any opposition politician in this House.  All this comes from a Minister for Education who said on 8 April 1987 and I quote:</P>
    <P>I propose to give a particular priority to primary education.  The primary focus of any education authority or any Education Department must be on first level.</P>
    <P>The same Minister said on the same day in the Dáil and I quote: &ldquo;I am not a woman of empty promises.&rdquo;  I think her speech here tonight epitomises the type of lady we have in the Minister for Education. <Col N="1318" /> This is the lady who for four and a half years, as education spokesperson for Fianna Fáil, opposed all and every measure taken by Fine Gael Ministers to improve the efficiency and the logic of the educational sector.</P>
    <P>Never was there I believe, such a betrayal of trust.  Never was there such a cynical misuse of democracy as the performance of Deputy O'Rourke before and after the General Election of February 1987.  It is now clear that the children, parents and teachers of Ireland have no champion at the Cabinet table and that the special protection given to the young people of Ireland and their parents by successive Fine Gael Ministers in Government was indeed caring and resolute.</P>
    <P>Recent surveys conducted by the INTO indicate that the revised staffing formula proposed by the Minister for Education will mean that practically every parish in the country will lose at least one teacher.  Every school with 11 teachers or more will lose at least two teachers.  This considerable loss of teachers will result in tens of thousands of children being placed in classes well in excess of 40 pupils.  The results of a survey on the effect of the Minister's proposals reveals that 179 teachers will lose their jobs in the North Dublin area.  This area is bounded by Santry on the south to Balbriggan on the north, Blanchardstown on the west and Howth on the east.  If the Minister's proposals are implemented, one in eight of the teachers in the Dublin North area will be losing their jobs and 14,000 children in 320 classes will be in classes of more than 40 pupils, and many of them in classes of more than 45 pupils.</P>

      <P>The survey concludes and I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This increase in class size will have a damaging effect on the education of all the children involved but, in particular, it will have implications for children in schools in disadvantaged <Col N="1319" /> areas such as Darndale and Ballymun where every class will be affected by the new appointment schedule.  In the larger schools if the Minister's proposals to suppress the post of Administrative Principals were implemented school discipline, parent/teacher contact, school administration and the overall organisation of the school would be seriously affected and would make the implementation of the primary school curriculum next to impossible. Some Church of Ireland schools and other minority religion schools would be wiped out.</P>
    <P>In the Limerick city area which has approximately 49 schools and 500 teachers, 72 teacher posts will be lost in 31 schools, 55 of these teachers from 1 January 1988.  In the course of an interview on the &ldquo;Day by Day&rdquo; programme on RTE radio following the announcement of the Education Estimates, the Minister for Education referred to the highly taxing and stressful nature of teaching. These comments are in sharp contrast with the damaging effects of her proposals to increase class size, to reduce the number of national teachers, to abolish effectively the post of non teaching administrative principal in many schools and to cut in half the provision for primary school buildings.</P>
    <P>Michael Drew, the vice-president of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation speaking at the conferring of the B. Ed. graduates at St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, on 16 October 1987 said:</P>
    <P>The Minister, as a former teacher, will realise that larger classes will automatically make the task of teaching children more taxing and stressful.  The revised schedule will result in an increase in the number of children in every classroom in almost every school in the country.  Larger schools of 10 teachers and over will lose at least 2 teachers and schools with 20 teachers or more will lose up to 4 teachers. Teachers, parents and management are shocked by the severity of the proposed increase in class size.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1320" /> For all these reasons I support the motion that Seanad Éireann rejects the proposals contained in circular 20/87 and calls for the immediate withdrawal of these proposals which would have such damaging consequences for primary education.  Go raibh maith agat.</P>

      <P>We must face up to the fact that we have a financial problem with which we must to grips.  It is the old story: no matter what one side does the other side could do it better.  The end result must be to get our finances right.  All the emphasis here, unfortunately, seems to be on the job losses, not on the higher motives.  I am not convinced that we are talking from the higher motives or worry about our children.  The words that are continually coming forward are &ldquo;job losses&rdquo; which means that we really have a vested interest.  We have to talk about the interest of the country as a whole. Therefore cutbacks have to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past 20 years largely under Fianna Fáil Governments, but indeed <Col N="1321" /> under all Governments, we had a revolution in education.  We had many advances in secondary schools, primary schools, free school transport, technical colleges, regional colleges and so on.</P>
    <P>It is a sad indictment of our educational system that, according to experts, today we have more children illiterate than we had 20 years ago.  We have more children roaming the streets uneducated and uncontrollable than we had 20 years ago. Unfortunately, despite the fact that we thought that by having a good educational system we would be able to provide employment, for some reason we are not able to provide the employment we should be providing.  I believe that 99.9 per cent of the teachers are very dedicated and hardworking.  They will answer the call of patriotism to take three extra pupils into their class.  That is all we are asking them to do, to cater for three extra pupils in primary schools.</P>

      <P>When she was introducing those little cuts she thought very carefully and she did not make the weakest suffer. There is no cutback for the underprivileged or the neglected.  There is no cutback for the remedial teachers.  I do not agree with Senator O'Toole that roughly 10 per cent or one in ten would need remedial teaching.  That is not a fact; not in rural Ireland.  There is no way that 10 per cent of our children in rural Ireland are in need of remedial treatment in the classroom.  We have a very caring Minister, a very understanding Minister, and one who thought hard and fast before she made her decisions.  We are not crippling the weaker sections.  We are helping them by keeping the same number of teachers to deal with those classes.</P>

      <P>As a national teacher who is on leave of absence I feel I can speak <Col N="1324" /> on this subject with a degree of knowledge and also a degree of detachment and objectivity now that I am no longer facing the daily stress of the classroom.</P>
      <P>In 1981 corporal punishment was abolished in our schools and since that time national teaching has become a much more stressful occupation.  Up to now no proper effective sanction has been put in the place of corporal punishment.  The number of disruptive children in our schools is increasing.  The emotionally disturbed child who does not benefit from remedial education would not benefit from the special schools.  There is really no place to send that child under the present system.</P>
      <P>There is a suspension procedure which is cumbersome and does not deal with the child quickly and effectively.  These children are kept on in the classrooms and teachers do the best they can in those situations.  To compound that problem now we have this untoward increase in the pupil-teacher ratio.  The disadvantaged pupils have been dealt with but I believe that there is another factor here, that is, the gifted children.  In order to give special time to the gifted children the pupil-teacher ratio needs to be reduced.  Any nation who does not give its full resources and its full help to its gifted children will suffer thereby.</P>
      <P>With regard to this redundancy package which is on offer to teachers, and for which no provision has been made in the Estimates, one wonders whether as some reports say, the Government will raid the Central Bank, or whether at the Ogra Fáil Conference next weekend we will be informed of a package of privatisation of semi-State bodies to fund it.  One wonders where all that money will come from.  As a teacher I believe this will have a profoundly bad effect on teaching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion I say to my colleagues on the other side of the House &mdash; and I do not seek to score any cheap political point here &mdash; that behind all the bravado, the bluster and all the tricking around with figures they must, when they troop through the lobby tonight to vote against this motion, feel a sense of shame and a sense of guilt about what they are doing <Col N="1325" /> to a generation of young Irish children and to our teachers who are facing so much stress.  Teachers now have their own voluntary invalidity scheme.</P>
    <P>The Government can say quietly to themselves that these teachers who will be exposed to so much stress will have their invalidity pension scheme to fall back on.  There are 2,000 teachers out there to take their places.  That is my brief comment and I thank Senator O'Toole for facilitating me.</P>

      <P>As the only speeches that were made on the motion came from this side of the House I do not have a lot of summing up to do on what happened on the other side of the House.  There is one thing that I am absolutely clear about.  I am absolutely clear that my colleagues on the Fianna Fáil side of the House have been absolutely misled, whether deliberately or otherwise, on the effects of these cuts.  I got to know Senator Farrell since I joined this House and I know him to be a man of integrity. I know there is no way he would have said what he said if he did not believe it. However, what he said was untrue.  There will be no job losses in the sense that teachers who are in full time employment at present will not be out of work.  We have never said so.  There is no shilling involved in this for teachers' pockets and let it go on the record.  Some of my colleagues on the Fianna Fáil side have another view.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Minister's position and her long speech on the gross national product and the <i>per capita</i> spending on Education in this country compared with other European countries which Senator Farrell said were the facts, I want to give the Minister's own response in November 1985 on precisely the same point.  Deputy O'Rourke, Opposition spokesperson on Education said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1326" /> The Minister gave the figures for the proportion of GDP spent on education. That is irrelevant to our position. The figures given by the Minister referred to another time.  Is the Minister satisfied that Ireland occupies the lowest rung of the ladder in regard to <i>per capita</i> spending on education?  It is the lowest in Europe.</P>
    <P>That was the position that Deputy O'Rourke took in Opposition.  As Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke seeks to give a different argument tonight.  I think that is unfair, misleading and unacceptable.  It is also right to read into the record what she said about Fianna Fáil:</P>
    <P>What will Fianna Fáil do is the question asked in debates time and time again?  If Fianna Fáil were in power what would they do?  The Government asked how we would go about doing what we say we want done.  I will tell the House exactly what we will do. Fianna Fáil in Government will work towards a reversal of the pupil-teacher ratio until it is brought back and improved.</P>
    <P>That is the position that the Minister took in Opposition.  Furthermore in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto of 1987 was the following statement:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will reduce the pupil teacher ratio initially at primary school levels.</P>
    <P>These are the facts I put in front of you &mdash; not open to discussion, not open to argument, taken from documents and the Fianna Fáil manifesto.  That is the position we stand on.  There is no question but that the Senators have been misled if they believe otherwise.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of it not affecting the disadvantaged, I want to reiterate what I said last week, every school in Finglas, Darndale, Ballymun, Corduff will lose teachers.  That is the fact of the matter.  If the Minister can stand up on hearing that and say the disadvantaged will not suffer, then she seems to be operating a line of logic that is totally incomprehensible to anybody else.  I see the <Col N="1327" /> Minister of State looks somewhat bemused.  I ask the Minister of State on his weekend at home to drive up the road to Athenry, which is right beside him, and he will find that of the 24 teaching jobs there will go.  That is the position in rural Ireland.  There is a view that we are only talking about north Dublin.  Go further afield and look at Counties Mayo and Galway.  I see Senator Cassidy shaking his head but they will lose 11 jobs in Castlepollard.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to a meeting which we had with her this morning and I would like to respond to it.  The figures I gave here last week, were the results of the survey in the Dublin area and this would leave around 2,500 jobs being wasted to primary education in Ireland. In applying the figures to rural Ireland&mdash; the west coast where the Minister said they would have least effect &mdash; we will have approximately a 10 per cent drop. It means, in effect, that the numbers of teaching jobs suppressed will certainly be over 2,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have told the Minister we will sit down and discuss our figures.  The Minister referred to a sample we took but we are not taking any samples, we are going school by school.  It is a total population survey.  There is nothing to hide.  If our figures are wrong they are there for the Department to investigate.  We have offered to sit down with the Department and discuss the figures on a county-by-county or school-by-school basis.  Let us compare our results with the Minister's. Let us get the facts straight and clear.  If we are wrong I will stand up in this House and say so.  I am absolutely confident that we are not wrong.  There are no mistakes <Col N="1328" /> in our figures as we are judging on a day-to-day basis.</P>
    <P>One of the great difficulties in this whole business is the lack of honesty of response.  I do not blame Members who have to live with these changes.  I do not wish that any Member on the Government side should have to stand up here and try to defend them.  I do not blame the Minister who finds the first eight pages of her script more relevant to the Estimates debate because it has nothing to do with education.  There may be valid arguments but have nothing to do with the motion I put forward.  The Minister should not have been allowed to make that speech but at the moment I am not in the Chair and I have no control over that.</P>
    <P>We explained to the Minister this morning the impact that these cuts would make.  On the first point, the new schedule on numbers, the Minister told us in the media on radio, television and newspapers a fortnight ago that there would be 1,300 jobs wasted to the system is now saying the figure is 1,800.  That is a difference of 500.  She is also saying that 500 more of those jobs will be taken back into the system.  That could be right: I do not know because we cannot go that far down the line.  I want to make it clear to people that 500 being taken back in are being taken in under the new schedules and to compare like with like there will be 1,800 fewer teachers for the same number of pupils.  That is the fact of the matter which is not adverted to at all.  To those who ask casually what is three extra in a classroom, I would ask that they take three extra kids into their house for a week and come back and talk to me about it.  Multiply that by 13 and you have some idea what it is like on a daily working basis.  People think it is somewhat easier on teachers to deal with extra pupils but that is not the case.  What time will be available for parent-teacher contact? There will be no time.</P>
    <P>This Minister has failed at Cabinet table to deliver to education, and particularly to primary education.  She has created devastation.  Were the facts ever explained to the Cabinet?  I do not believe <Col N="1329" /> they would have take these measures if they knew the facts.  We have been trying to find out the effects of these cuts and measures on primary education for the past four months and we have failed to do so.  We have failed to find out the effect of a proposed redundancy package. The Department are not aware of the full facts.  The Department are not aware of who it will apply to.  The Department cannot tell me that there are 800 temporary teachers in primary schools at present who could be out of jobs on 1 January if the Minister were to impose this on 1 January and to say that temporary teachers should be the first out in order to make a space.  The Department do not know this.  They cannot say if principal teachers will be offered the redundancy terms.</P>
    <P>They cannot say because they have not heard from the Department of Finance, according to the Minister.  The Department of Education have to wait to be told by the Department of Finance how much they are going to have in the Estimates for next year.  They now have to go back to the Department of Finance and ask &ldquo;how do we spend the money?&rdquo;  This Minister has ceased to govern.  This Minister has ceased to look after education. The Department of Education is not being run by the Minister for Education, whoever else is doing it.  It is an utter travesty.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry spoke on education cutbacks on RTE radio last Friday week at 5 p.m. He said:</P>
    <P>Let me say on teachers generally, there are huge numbers, hundreds of teachers in supernumerary jobs that do not have classrooms, that do not have full time jobs, at the moment just sitting there getting paid.  Is anybody going to suggest they should be left so?</P>
    <P>If there are people sitting around and not doing their work, chuck them out.  The teacher unions will be the first to support them.  We have not the space in education for people who are not going their jobs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1330" /> That situation does not exist.  It is supposed to advert to the position of administrative principals who are supposed to be part of the discipline and structure within a school.  If there is a problem within a classroom they are supposed to be available to deal with problem children. They are supposed to be available to counsel children with difficulties.  They are supposed to be available to administer the schools.  They are supposed to be available to support and to advise staff. They are supposed to be available for the implementation of the curriculum.  They are supposed to be available to parents and to let them know what is going on in the school.  They are supposed to be able to plan and implement remediation strategies.</P>
    <P>These are some of the jobs they have to do, and they do not have any chance to do otherwise.  If they have a minute to spare during the day, that is unusual, It shows a total lack of understanding by the Government of what is happening in primary education.  I would like to take the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke and the Minister for Finance into a number of primary school classes for a couple of weeks and let them see what life is really like on the other side of the table.  The idea of trying to divide equal numbers of pupils into classes is not on.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education do not know the effects of the proposed cutbacks in terms of revision and whether they will apply to temporary teachers or otherwise.  They do not know whether the administrative principles will be left cope with schools.  The Minister for Education made the extraordinary statement that the Department management accept there is an eight year backlog in the building programme.  The Minister claimed that, by halfing the amount of money available, in some way she can shorten the backlog.  If it takes eight years at present, with half the amount of money, it will take 16 years in the future.  People at school at present who are waiting for improvements in their schools will be sending their own kids to school before <Col N="1331" /> there is any sign of money being spent on the place.</P>
    <P>The Department cannot answer questions on redundancy and early retirement. On the question of the primary curriculum review which the Minister set up and which we welcomed and people were appointed to it.  It is unfortunate that the INTO had to withdraw from that because it was a totally hypocritical, irrelevant exercise in the light of what the Minister intends to do &mdash; to devastate primary education.  There are no job losses.  This case is for education, for educational service, for the sake of the investment made over generations by teachers, Ministers, departmental secretaries. The Minister's forebears and the <Col N="1332" /> forebears of the Minister of State at the Department of Education worked hard in the area.  We have invested years of intellectual capacity and serious commitment in education.  It is incredible that any Member of this House could walk into the lobby and vote against this motion.  A vote against this motion is a vote against the education service and against those who are least well off.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for giving me time to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I have been seeking this debate since before the recess.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House and wish her well. She has a very difficult job and it is not easy at this time to be in Government.</P>
      <P>The Government are not only disregarding the needs of women but are treating them and their organisations with utter disdain.  Since Fianna Fáil came into Government and hacked and slashed at the many structures that had been put in place for women in the previous four years they have created a great sense of anger among women throughout the country.  The Taoiseach did a grave disservice to the Minister of State by so casually giving her the responsibility for the Council for the Status of Women. This was done by way of answer to a parliamentary question and could not have been anything but an afterthought. It is very regrettable that women are not to have the understanding, concern and support they got from the Coalition Government but are to be subjected to the cavalier treatment now being handed out to them by the Minister and her colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that the Taoiseach did the Minister of State such a great disservice in the manner in which he treated her.  No one yet knows what the parameters of her responsibilities are, what role she plays or what funding she is responsible for.  It is a dreadful waste of a good and capable politician and an experienced Minister. I, like many others, have a great deal of regard for the Minister of State and know her commitment to women's rights which was demonstrated so clearly in her years as chairperson of the Oireachtas Joint <Col N="1334" /> Committee on Women's Rights.  No one could doubt her personal commitment and her own understanding of the expectations and the need of Irish women. However, I must address the Minister of State now, not in her personal capacity but in her capacity as Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, with responsibility for the Council for the Status of Women.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister for understanding and openness to the issue of the funding being allocated for the coming year to the council.  The funding as listed in the Book of Estimates for the coming year stands at £90,000.  This is the sole and only funding being given directly to this women's umbrella group at a time when the lack of a special Government section such as we had in the last Government is being felt very severely.  I do not want the Minister of State to say that in real terms she is maintaining and even improving the budget for the council on past years.  This is not a valid claim.  It is not valid because the work load, the output, the postage expenses and the numberous demands on the council's staff have multiplied greatly.  This is because they are now carrying on a great deal of the work that had been done by the women's affairs section which had a very extensive staff.</P>
    <P>Just because a Taoiseach decides he is not continuing the Government section for women's affairs does not mean that the needs and expectations that section dealt with should cease to exist.  They do not, and they existed long before I came to office as the first Minister of State for Women's Affairs.  It is not good enough to fund the Council for the Status of Women, which represents 60 women's organisations and 250,000 women, in a way that only allows them to tick over. Many of the delegates to the council seriously fear they will be the next organisation to be annexed to some Government Department as is the fate of the Health Education Bureau, An Foras Forbartha and the National Social Service Board.</P>
    <P>This organisation, the Council for the Status of Women, is the only conduit for <Col N="1335" /> women now for information, representation and educational needs.  What is to happen to all the crisis groups over which my section had discretionary funding in the past four years?  These ranged from the Rape Crisis Centre &mdash; which exists, and there are centres throughout the country who depended heavily on the funding I gave them &mdash; to the AIM group which gives a free service to people with marriage difficulties and Women's Aid. The important work they do must continue to be funded.  As this Department is not a funding Department there is nowhere they can now go.</P>
    <P>In the past four years my office succeeded in financing a variety of small groups, many on a once-off basis.  This was a lifeline to organisations, small or big, like the Widows' Association, Gingerbread, or small groups such as the Darndale Women's Group or the Tallaght Adult Education Group.  The money now at the disposal of the Council for the Status of Women will not stretch to these groups.  In fact, it will not even pay the postage on the many information booklets which were produced by the Women's Affairs section and have been transferred over to the council offices. It will not stretch to the very essential monitoring of the UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women.  It is, sadly, unable to meet the everyday needs of its delegate groups.</P>
    <P>In this context accommodation problems have become so great that the meeting room used by groups for meeting in the city centre has now become an office. I suggest to the Minister for State that perhaps she would visit the council's offices and see how difficult their work has become.  The knock-on effect of this accommodation problem has meant that their affiliate groups have to turn to hotels or other halls on a commercial basis for their regular meetings, AGMs or seminars, all of which were held previously in the main hall of the council's offices.  I have to question the commitment for a women's house or centre, as my section was negotiating for them with the Office <Col N="1336" /> of Public Works prior to the election.  I would suggest the Minister for State and, indeed, the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke &mdash; both of whom are capable women &mdash; are being very badly let down by their male colleagues in office.</P>
    <P>The suggestion was made by both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce that all Government Departments were receptive to and supportive of issues relating to women.  Did that mean that all special events or positive action programmes could be scrapped? I wonder was the Minister for State or, indeed, Deputy O'Rourke consulted before Deputy Reynolds scrapped, so ungenerously and unceremoniously, the successful Women in Enterprise programme? If the Minister for State was consulted, what did she say?  Her male colleagues claim that such positive action measures are no longer needed.  I feel it is not necessary to tell a long-time politician like the Minister for State that all Departments of State are men's affairs.  Departments and issues of special interest to women do not get the profile or the priority that in many cases they deserve.</P>
    <P>I must take this opportunity to inform the Minister for State of the general difficulties the Government programme of cutbacks is having on many women, particularly women in the lower socioeconomic grouping.  I will give the Minister for State some instances.  We no longer have St. James' Hospital with a maternity unit which had such an excellent record in its maternity services. Although it has dealt with one of the highest numbers of women from a low socio-economic background, it had the lowest perinatal mortality rate in Ireland, if not, indeed, in Europe.  Because of its size it gave women great privacy.  It gave women, who normally would not have a high level of comfort, a relative luxury for the length of time they were in hospital having a baby.  One of the worrying aspects, apart from the fact that these mothers now have to go to the Coombe Hospital, is that the midwifery service that was so excellently available in St. <Col N="1337" /> James' seems to have disappeared. Nobody knows where the midwives who worked in that unit now are.  Nobody can find out whether they have been absorbed into general nursing in St. James', or if they have left.  It would be regrettable, indeed, if either happened.  They are going to lose very valuable skills of midwifery which, I believe, is a diminishing skill.</P>
    <P>Looking at the other three main maternity hospitals, we now see a policy where mothers are being discharged as soon as 48 hours after birth.  This is happening in Holles Street, the Coombe and the Rotunda.  This also includes single mothers who would have the degree of support and assistance of their husbands and families.  This has meant that babies cannot get their PKU test done at that time.  This is very serious because this test, as well as the BCG vaccination, is preventative medicine at its best.  It is not valid to say that the mothers are asked and do respond when it is suggested that they come back for the PKU test because many of the mothers would not be aware of the importance of this test.</P>
    <P>Added to this, in the Dublin area we have the closing down of the ante-natal clinics and the health centres in suburban areas.  Tallaght, which has the same population as Limerick, now has no ante-natal clinic whatsoever.  These were an enormous improvement for women, particularly poor women living in built-up areas, because the hospital personnel, in effect, came out to them.  This meant that women were monitored regularly. The personnel dealing with them could identify problems in advance, such as postnatal depression.  All of this has led to an outrageous waiting time for ante-natal visits due to the fact that women are coming in from suburban areas and the number of births that were being catered for at St. James's now have to be accommodated in the other hospitals. While we accept that this Government have got to make cutbacks and to restrict services in areas of the public service, one has to question how, for instance, they can have opted to effect pay increases for civil servants at the expense of poor <Col N="1338" /> women and their babies.</P>
    <P>The maternity hospital in Lough-linstown is the latest hospital at risk.  If this is taken away there will be no facility for maternity services between Holles Street and Wexford.  This will leave a vast area of north Wicklow without the very good facilities that now exist in Lough-linstown.</P>
    <P>These are all issues that are valid and important to women and affect them very closely.  They are issues that are not being highlighted in the media and are not being brought forward to Government. I am taking the opportunity while the Minister of State is here to put these cases to her.  I must stress at this time the severe burden that many women are carrying in their homes, in their communities, in the maternity hospitals, in the care of the aged and in voluntary community care &mdash; all due to the severe cutbacks in Government spending and also through unemployment and redundancies.  This was borne out particularly today when we read the NESC report which was published yesterday.  The NESC in a comment on the report prepared by Miss Síle O'Connor said, &ldquo;Care in the community and family will not simply happen&rdquo;.  They noted that families, for instance, may require access to services such as nursing, meals on wheels, home help and other services if they are to sustain care for dependent relatives in their homes and communities.  But public health nursing is under the increasing pressure, the report notes.  Home helps who provide meals and other services for people who are ill or incapaciated are available only to a minority.  They said there is also marked under-provision of day centres, day hospitals and geriatric assessment units. Services for the physically and mentally handicapped have developed little since the start of this decade, the report says.</P>
    <P>That catalogue of difficulties that many women are experiencing at the moment will, I hope, be noted by the Minister of State who is a mother.  She is aware of the difficulties and problems of women in the community.  Women have become accustomed, in the last Administration, to having an advocate in Government <Col N="1339" /> and a special section dealing with their queries, their representations and the need for information.  It was a section that promoted positive action and influenced policies and the thinking of our State and semi-State bodies.  I appeal to the Minister of State, knowing her awareness and understanding of the issues of women, to take on the role of advocate for women and to put some pressure on her colleagues.  Without it, women and women's organisations will continue to go by the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, my reply this evening will be based on and confined to the terms of the motion before the Seanad, which is concerned specifically with the severe under-funding of the Council for the Status of Women.  Secondly, I wish to say that one of my responsibilities as a Minister of State is for the co-ordination of Government policy in all areas of Government and that includes the area of women's rights.  Those matters which the Senator brought to my attention in relation to the health policy will be passed by me, in that capacity as Minister with responsibility for co-ordinating Government policy on women's rights, to my colleague, Dr. Rory O'Hanlon.  I have not doubt that between myself and himself, we can come to some arrangements to ensure that the kind of difficulties that are being experienced at the moment will at least be investigated thoroughly and, hopefully, we may be in a position to eradicate or certainly alleviate some of the problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion before the Seanad this evening is critical of the funding for the Council for the Status of Women.  The position in relation to Government financing of the council is that the amount allocated was £88,000 in 1986 when Senator Fennell was Minister of State for Women's Affairs.  A sum of £88,000 was also provided in 1987 and there is £90,000 included in the Estimates for the Public Services for 1988 for the finances of the council.  In fact then there has been no reduction in that grant despite the fact <Col N="1340" /> that economic realities constrain the Government to reduce public expenditure wherever possible and that there have, of necessity, been substantial reductions in expenditure in other areas. The position for 1988 must be set in the context of the overall reductions of £485 million that have had to be made in the 1988 Estimates.</P>
    <P>The position as regards 1987 is interesting. By the time this Government assumed office on 10 March 1987 the expenditure already incurred by Senator Fennell, as Minister of State, under the appropriate subhead for 1987, this year, amounted to just under £28,000.  If spending had continued for the remainder of 1987 at the same rate as in this brief period of months approximately £150,000 would have gone on promotion and information, and to support and development activities and grants other than to the Council for the Status of Women.  This would have left a very small amount available to the council had the Minister of State been returned to office.</P>
    <P>As Senator Fennell feels so strongly that the council is underfunded it is only reasonable to ask why the council did not get a larger share of the total provision in the appropriate subhead for each of the four-and-a-half years in which she was Minister of State for Women's Affairs and had considerable discretionary control of the money in the subhead for her office.  For example, the position for 1986 is that she as Minister of State for Women's Affairs decided that the council should have £88,000 of the total provision of £189,000 and that she herself would decide on the allocation of the remaining £101,000 to such support and development projects and activities as she chose to assist.</P>
    <P>On any objective criteria some of the causes and activities she chose to assist deserved support if the means were available but what I cannot understand is that if she feels that the council with a grant level of £88,000 in 1987 and £90,000 proposed for next year, is seriously underfunded, why did she not raise that grant significantly &mdash; indeed double it &mdash; when it was in her power to do so?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1341" /> On the question of grants to organisations other than the council active in the area of women's affairs, the position is that such organisations will no longer be in receipt of public funds through the Department of the Taoiseach.  I would like to make it quite clear, however, that those organisations carrying out particularly important work will still be eligible to apply for assistance to the health boards, to the Department of Social Welfare under their grants to voluntary bodies scheme, and to the Combat Poverty Agency.</P>
    <P>I accept that the council and a number of its member organisations could use additional funds productively.  The fact is that the Government simply do not have the option of generally increasing the levels of funding available to interest groups, however important their aims and however worthwhile the work they do.  No area of activity is immune from economic realities.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Women in Business Enterprise Campaign, the Government believe that from time to time there will be a need for short term, intensive positive action programmes such as this.  The campaign was never intended to last indefinitely but to help bring about a change in attitude among women towards business careers and to ensure that the various State enterprise development programmes were being targeted at women as well as men.  The campaign has proved to be a success as evidenced by the fact that the take-up by women of grants available under the IDA's Small Industries Programme has increased from 3 per cent of the total in 1983 to 21 per cent in the first half of 1987.  The Government are satisfied, therefore, that it has served its purpose and need not be <Col N="1342" /> continued as a separate programme for women.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> the Government have set out their overall strategy for regenerating the economy.  In pursuit of that policy very difficult decisions have had to be taken on reduced funding for a range of policies and agencies but the Government have striven to carry out this necessary course of action with equity and fairness.</P>
    <P>In tandem, however, with a strict fiscal approach the Government are set on improving social equity in our society so that we do move closer to achieving equality of opportunity.  The Taoiseach has in fact assigned each Minister a special responsibility for women's affairs so that progress can be brought about on a broad policy front.  When the budgetary situation improves it will be possible to consider how increased funding might best be committed towards the realisation of equal opportunities.</P>

      <P>I wish to make the point that the Minister of State &mdash; and she did explain that she was replying to the motion as it was &mdash; has missed the actual point I was making, that is, that the resources that were in the office that I occupied contributed to personnel, information and funds.  Therefore, it was not necessary to fund the council as extensively as they need now.  It is true to say that they have doubled their workload because there is not the assistance or the resources, the postage, or the organisation that was carried by the Office of Women's Affairs over the last four years. I think that is an important point for the Minister to keep in mind.</P>
