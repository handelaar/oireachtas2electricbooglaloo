      <P>I have notice from Senator Brian O'Shea that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House to-day, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>When funds will be made available to build the new national school at Portlaw, County Waterford.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Patrick McGowan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The bias in the selection of panels and speakers in studio audiences by RTE in current affairs programmes.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Donie Cassidy of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Government to restore Lough Sheelin Lake to its former pollution free state.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators O'Shea and Cassidy as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator O'Shea's motion and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. or earlier if the business is concluded. Senator Cassidy may give notice for another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret I have to rule the matter raised <Col N="574" /> by Senator McGowan as not suitable for discussion on the ground of lack of ministerial responsibility.  I want to remind Senators that written notice has to be given of the matters again or else they will lapse.</P>

      <P>Before the Order of Business would you permit me to propose a vote of sympathy to the widow of the late Mick Lipper who served as a Member of the Oireachtas?  In addition he served on the city council in Limerick for many years and was Lord Mayor of his native city.  He was accepted by all of us as an excellent sportsman.  It is appropriate that, before we start our formal business this House of the Oireachtas should extend its sympathy through you, A Leas-Chathaoirligh, to his widow and family on his recent and unexpected death which created much sorrow for those of us who were associated with Mick.  It would be appropriate for the House to extend its sympathy to his widow.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business I would like to join with Senator Ferris in the message of condolence to the wife and family of Mick Lipper.  The first time I met Mick Lipper was on a sporting field.  I never thought I would see him in Dáil Éireann and I never thought at the time that I would be in Seanad Éireann.  Mick epitomised what was best in Limerick and what was best in sport.  He epitomised what was best in politics and what was best in family.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="575" /> The Order of Business today is Items Nos. 1 and 2.  Unfortunately, due to a mix up, the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Bill, 1987, will be No. 3 on the Order of Business today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is listed under Bills in Progress and Business Ordered.  I mentioned last week that this Bill would be taken.  I apologise to the House for the fact that it is not on the Order Paper as such but it is No. 3 on the Order of Business today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some problem about this but I would be agreeable for my own group to take Second Stage of the oil pollution Bill today only if speeches are confined to one speaker from each group because the notice is a bit short.  Also on the Order of Business, has the Leader of the House come to any arrangement to have Item No. 34 on the Order Paper debated.  Can he give us time next week for a full debate on the Estimates and on the financial programme of the Government?  Last week there was very strong support for this from this side of the House and Members felt it strange that the same Government who asked for a four day debate in the Dáil should on the other hand refuse a debate in this House.  It is only reasonable that we should have this debate next week.  Next week would be preferable to this week because it is likely that many of the detailed cuts will be spelled out in the other House this week and we will have a fair idea of what to base our speeches on.  I make a very strong request to the Leader of the House to have a full scale debate on the Book of Estimates.</P>

      <P>I also lend my voice to what Senator Manning said.  We find it absolutely extraordinary that the position, as articulated by the Taoiseach, is that he wished to have a debate on the Estimates so that Members of the Oireachtas in particular would be well aware of what is happening and what the Government's plans are and their effects on the population as a whole.  This is being discussed at length in the other House this week and for some reason the Leader of the Government party in this House seems to be unprepared, or unwilling, or afraid to face a long discussion on the Government's economic policies and their effects.  I wish him to respond to that point.</P>

      <P>Could I ask a question of the Leader of the House?  Before the adjournment for the summer recess we asked the Minister for the Marine about the regulations for a free port in Cork.  A promise was given at that time by the Minister that the regulations would be finalised by the beginning of October but nothing is forthcoming at this time.  This is of urgent importance to the regions of Cork and Kerry.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour group I would like also to lend our support to the call for a full debate on the Estimates in this House.  The devastation <Col N="577" /> being caused to public sector employment and to services to the public generally has to be dealt with if this House is to have any relevance in the eyes of the electorate.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the House gave me an undertaking late in the last session that the Labour Party would be given an opportunity to raise matters in Private Members' time.  We have a specific motion down, No. 29 on the Order Paper, relating to the consequences for local authority employees for pension purposes and for lump sum purposes if they go on short time working or if there are lay-offs.  No time has been allocated to the Labour Party since the House sat and I ask the Leader of the House to tell us when time will be made available to the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>I want to add my voice to that of my colleagues in again requesting a discussion on the Estimates.  While I am speaking on the Order of Business may I associate myself with remarks about the late Mick Lipper?  I had no personal acquaintance with him but I have a distinct recollection of a time when a voluntary organisation &mdash; the Simon Community with which I am involved &mdash; were suffering great public hostility in Limerick.  He was extremely brave and virtually alone in his insistence on defending the rights of homeless people in Limerick. For that reason I would like to put my tribute on record.</P>

      <P>Speaking on the Order of Business I meant to associate the Fine Gael group with the vote of sympathy. The late Mick Lipper was a very good friend of mine on the governing body of University college, Dublin, and, as the Leader of the House said, he represented what was best in the tradition of public service in Limerick.  Fine Gael would like to be associated with the expression of sympathy.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Shea mentioned an undertaking given to the Labour group that they would have time. The Committee on Procedure and Privileges are meeting this afternoon.  I can guarantee Senator O'Shea that, even though there is not a Labour group in terms of numbers in the House, we will be allowing them to have their say.  I will not say anything further except that there is a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges this afternoon and the Labour group will be allowed a certain amount of time which they are not entitled to under the rules of the House. Most of the people who spoke asked for a debate on the Estimates and on what is going to happen.  Last week, if anyone listened which apparently they did not, I said &ldquo;at this time&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Before we proceed with the amendments to the Report Stage of the Abattoirs Bill, 1987, I would like to remind Senators that the proposer of an amendment has the right to reply on that amendment but no other Senator may speak more than once to each <Col N="581" /> amendment.  Where two or more amendments are discussed together the right of reply rests with the mover of the first amendment.  Now we take Government amendment No. 1.  Government Amendment No. 6 is consequential on amendment No. 1 and the amendment to amendment No. 1 is related.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, to delete lines 6 to 13 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;which is used for the occasional slaughter of a pig, or for the slaughter of an animal which has been injured by accident and the slaughter of which is necessary to prevent its suffering and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  such pig, or such injured animal, is maintained for farming purposes on such farm by its occupier, and</P>
      <P>(b)  the meat from such pig or such injured animal is intended for consumption only by the residents on such farm:</P>
      <P>Provided that, for the purposes of this Act, the onus of proving that &mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the conditions specified at paragraphs (a) and (b) of this definition are complied with, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  an animal (other than a pig) which is slaughtered is an animal which has been injured by accident,</P>
      <P>shall lie on the person seeking the benefit of such proof;&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage I indicated that I would be bringing forward these two amendments. Amendment No. 6 is consequential on amendment No. 1.  On amendment No. 1, basically this restriction of the home slaughtering concession confining it to the killing of a pig or an injured animal to prevent suffering arises from the trade's claim that serious abuse could result otherwise.  I accept the trade's concern in the matter and that the concession, as it stood, needed some <Col N="582" /> tightening up.  The facility to kill a pig for its bacon on one's own farm without being subject to the Bill's controls reflects a farming tradition in this country.  I could not, however, agree to the amendment proposed by Senator Ferris, Harte and O'Shea which seeks to extend such facility to lambs also.  The trade too would not welcome such an extension.</P>
      <P>To formally make provision for the slaughter of lambs on farms would offer far greater scope for abuse to unscrupulous individuals than does or will the killing of a pig, essentially because a lamb is a fresh meat product.  Already the Department of Agriculture and Food have had reports of sheep carcases of dubious origin reaching city markets. Additionally I feel that the payment of a veterinary inspection fee of 55p per animal will scarcely deter a farmer from having his sheep slaughtered in a licensed abattoir.  Indeed, in the long term it might be necessary to move in that direction with pigs also.  In other words, should it be found after a reasonable period of the Act's operation that the whole slaughtering concession is being abused, the Minister of the day would have the power under section 2 (3) (c) of the Bill to redefine an abattoir.  Amendment No. 6 will ensure that the farmer exercising the home slaughtering concession of the pig or an injured animal would not be required to have the meat of such animals stamped with a health mark.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I need your guidance because while I have no problem whatsoever with the Minister's amendment to the Bill at this stage, what I want to find out is do I have to await the passing of the Minister's amendment to move my amendment to his amendment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To insert &ldquo;lamb&rdquo; after &ldquo;pig&rdquo; wheresoever it occurs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="583" /> The Minister disappointed me when he referred to my amendment in the middle of moving his own.  I wanted to check the debating procedure by which I would have an opportunity to move an amendment to his amendment.  I have no objection whatsoever to and indeed, I welcome the Government amendment outlined by the Minister and thank him for having met the concern in the trade about likely abuses that could have occurred and have occurred as a result of unauthorised slaughtering of animals for human consumption. It is as a result of the trade interest in this and our own interest on all sides of the House that we accept that there have to be restrictions on the slaughtering of animals for home consumption in what would normally be considered a non-abattoir situation.</P>
    <P>Last week, when we were debating the tradition of killing a pig, it was pointed out that in other parts of the country it is also traditional to kill a lamb and there was concern on both sides of the House that the word &ldquo;lamb&rdquo; should be inserted as well as &ldquo;pig&rdquo;.  In the case of bovine animals unless they were injured and it was required for humanitarian reasons, slaughter would not normally be allowed. I want to take issue with the Minister in that I never suggested for a moment that more than a lamb would be included in my amendment.  It does not say &ldquo;lambs&rdquo;. I am aware of certain areas in the country where there is widespread killing of lambs at farm level and these lambs afterwards find their way onto the market.  For that reason I included an amendment to suggest &ldquo;a lamb&rdquo;.  The Minister as somebody with a lot of knowledge in this area, coming from a professional background in the industry and with his brief of responsibility for food in particular must be aware of the fact that there are farmers who legitimately kill a lamb for their own purpose and their own use and their own private consumption.  If the Minister allowed this amendment after &ldquo;pig&rdquo; and also allowed a lamb to be killed, all other animals would be subjected to the rigours of this Abattoirs Bill and he would certainly have the support of the trade <Col N="584" /> and of ordinary farmers who will now feel restricted in that they will be unable legitimately to kill a lamb for their own purposes as they do this very day.  If we are not reasonable in passing legislation which will be operable on the ground, it will be open to abuse and contempt by people we would hope would be supportive of what the Minister is trying to do in bringing forward a Bill controlling the proper killing of animals for human consumption.</P>
    <P>I formally move my amendment to the Minister's amendment to &ldquo;lamb&rdquo;, not &ldquo;lambs&rdquo;, a provision which could be abused, and the rest of the section would remain the same.  That would also apply where the word &ldquo;pig&rdquo; occurs in any other part of this Bill.  That may mean that the Minister would want to amend the Bill on the next Stage and the next Stage available will be in the Dáil.  Forgive me if I have not included an amendment to all other sections that mention the word &ldquo;pig&rdquo;.  I though using these words &ldquo;wheresoever it occurs&rdquo; would have covered it.  I now realise after consultation that it would not necessarily cover any section except this specific section.  I formally request the Minister to consider inserting &ldquo;lamb&rdquo; and that will not be open to abuse.  In last week's debate the Minister will find support for this contention from all sides of the House &mdash; Senator Connor and Senator Hussey who reflect different views from different constituencies.  I think it is not unreasonable.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment moved by Senator Ferris.  The concession, I believe, is relatively small because in his introductory remarks today the Minister said he is allowing the killing of a pig because it is a tradition on farms.  There is also a tradition on farms for killing a lamb or at least it has become a very well established practice in more recent times, I admit, since the introduction of deep freezing on farms.  Most farmhouses have the facility of deep freezing and since lamb is fresh meat it goes into that place for keeping.  The Minister should not be intransigent on <Col N="585" /> this point.  Senator Ferris has been careful to say &ldquo;lamb&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;lambs&rdquo; and for that reason we see this as being an eminently reasonable thing to ask.  We feel the Minister should concede the point.</P>

      <P>I cannot concede this point for the reasons which I have outlined and they are essentially the trade are against it &mdash; that is No. 1.  As a concession, because of the tradition of killing pigs and because that is a cured product and could not find its way onto the market as readily and would not be open to abuse we confined home slaughtering to a pig or an injured animal to prevent suffering. As I said, for the reasons outlined, I cannot concede the point.</P>

      <P>These amendments also arise from the Committee Stage debate. The House will recall that I accepted the principle of Senator Ferris' Committee Stage amendment to section 13 of the Bill.  Here Senator Ferris proposed in lieu of the two months extension of the licence on the death of a licence holder to extend its validity until its normal expiry.  I mentioned then that to avoid a situation where that amendment might act to the disadvantage of some, where the licence was within two months of expiry, it would be best to cover both eventualities.  Accordingly amendment No. 2 will do that in the case of an abattoir licence while amendment No. 5 makes similar provision in relation to knackery licences.</P>

This is along the lines of what I suggested in a previous amendment but it is better in that it takes account of the eventuality which the Minister has outlined which could discriminate against the holder of a licence, particularly the widow of a licence holder.  This is a better amendment and gives the best of two words, so to speak.  I welcome it and the trade will welcome the fact that the Minister has conceded the principle involved in what I was trying to do on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 12, line 16, after &ldquo;many&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;subject to <i>subsection (2)&rdquo;.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will deal with amendment No. 4 first because amendment No. 3 is consequential on it.  If amendment No. 4 is agreed and accepted I hope the Minister will concede amendment No. 3.  I am not sure if the order of the debate will allow <Col N="587" /> me to do it that way because it is difficult to speak about amendment No. 3, about inserting after &ldquo;may&rdquo; the words &ldquo;subject to subsection (2)&rdquo;.  It is only a presumption that the next amendment will be approved and that that wording will come into play.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting an intermediary body or intermediate period of time which would elapse between the decision of somebody to revoke a licence and the constitutional and legal right of the licensee to go into a circuit court to claim discrimination or otherwise  against the authorised officer.  I am trying to overcome the difficulty the trade will experience if we leave the legislation as it is. In a spirit of co-operation following the Minister's efforts in this regard I am suggesting that there should be another appeals forum.  I am suggesting these words but they may not necessarily suit the Minister.  I am making the case that it is appropriate that, before we go down the road of legalities and into a circuit court, another intermediate period will elapse which will allow the licensee a forum in which he could discuss with the authority responsible for the granting of the licence &mdash; in this case the county council &mdash; circumstances surrounding the decision of the authorised officer to revoke his licence.</P>
    <P>I am not removing from the Minister any of his rights of powers under the Act. I am not removing the licensee's powers and legal rights under the Constitution to go to court in that eventuality, but I am suggesting an intermediate period.  I am also putting a period of time on it which would make it imperative that it would not be left to drag on.  If the authorised officer was correct in his first concern about revoking a licence, a person would not be allowed to trade indefinitely without having his case heard properly.  I am putting in a period of 30 additional days to allow time for dialogue to take place between the holder of the licence and the county council.  It is a reasonable amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows from his discussions with the trade and discussions <Col N="588" /> with his advisers in the Department and officials who have put a lot of work into this Bill over a period of two years or more that the views I am expressing in this amendment are the views expressed by the trade.  If we do not go someway towards meeting their concern about this section it will be a pity but we will lose the positive response we have from the trade at the moment.  It goes without saying that if we do not have their fullest co-operation in this legislation and in its operation we will have done a disservice to the Minister's aim of putting some order and responsibility into the area of abattoirs and the killing of animals for human consumption.</P>
    <P>This is a reasonable amendment.  I do not want to be repetitious but I am confined to speaking once on each of these amendments on Report Stage.  I am proposing amendment No. 4 which states:</P>
    <P>(2)  Pending the lodgment of an appeal under subsection (1), the applicant for, or the holder of, such a licence may appeal the refusal or revocation to an Abattoir Licence Appeals forum which shall be established for this purpose in each local authority area.  The membership of each forum shall be on a voluntary basis...</P>
    <P>It is not obligatory on any council, or any county, or any butcher in any area to avail of this if they do not need it, because it is voluntary.  The amendment goes on:</P>
    <P>...and shall not exceed seven and shall consist of members of the County Council concerned, the Irish Domestic Meat Trader's Association and the Department of Agriculture.  Each forum shall be empowered to dismiss or allow the appeal and direct the Minister accordingly.  Where this subsection is invoked, the prescribed period for the lodgment of an appeal under subsection (1) shall be extended to 30 days.</P>
    <P>What I want is an independent, voluntary forum to which butchers and the Department would have access.  If the Minister is as convinced as I am that this will rarely need to be invoked, why not have it in <Col N="589" /> place.  It would be reasonable to expect the trade to have recourse to some independent view on why they allowed themselves to get into a situation where any authorised officer would have a problem.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned that if there is not a voluntary, informal forum in place butchers who are unfortunate enough to be penalised by a licensing authority or an inspecting officer will be reluctant to look for their rights in a legal process because the ensuing publicity which would surround that appeal would be to the detriment of their business.  In that case everybody would be considered guilty whether it was proven or not.  I suggest that the Minister should allow the forum suggested in amendment No. 4 and, if amendment No. 4 is agreed, amendment No. 3, I hope, would follow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In substance these amendments are similar to those proposed to this section by Senator Ferris on Committee Stage.  I could not accept his amendments then and I cannot accept these amendments now.  As public health would be the over-riding consideration, recourse to the circuit court as proposed in the Bill is the proper way to cater for appeals on refusals or revocation of licences.  An abattoir licence appeals forum for each of the 32 local authority areas would only give rise to diverse rulings. One of the reasons responsibility for licensing of premises is being granted to the Minister under the Bill is down to the different approaches to licensing by sanitary authorities.  One could anticipate similar divergencies in the case of the suggested appeals forums.  Moreover, their constitution would prove contentious if not extremely difficult, having regard to the typical Irish situation where we have in existence three separate trade organisations &mdash; The Irish Domestic Meat Traders Association, the Irish Master Butchers Federation and the <Col N="590" /> Irish Meat Wholesalers Association. Additionally, we have the possibility of butchers on such forums being either directly or indirectly in competition with appellants.</P>
      <P>The refusal or revocation of a licence is a serious matter and the decision to do so will not be taken lightly.  As I pointed out on Committee Stage, every concession will be afforded to proprietors of unsatisfactory premises and they will get up to five years to get those premises up to standard.  Appeals to the Circuit Court will be a last resort and each case will have to receive very careful consideration before a decision is taken to refuse or revoke a licence.  Equally, the effects on public health of allowing grossly unsatisfactory premises to operate will have to be considered.  The reporting hierarchy within the Department will ensure complete objectivity in the matter of inspections of premises and ensure that all the facts are established before the application comes to the Minister for a decision.</P>
      <P>The Department's approach to licensing of premises will be: (a) to keep the premises up to licensing standard which, if it is, a licence will issue; (b) if the premises is not up to licensing standards but can through improvements be so brought, a permit as provided for under section 17 will issue.  In this connection it is important to point out that, under the terms of section 17 (3), a permit will have the same force and effect as an abattoir licence.  A premises would need to be in a very poor state not to qualify even for a permit and so it is envisaged that the number of cases arising which would not qualify for either a licence or a permit would be very small indeed.  Moreover, it would have to be conceded by everybody concerned that the protection of public health might not be served by granting either a licence or a permit in the case of premises of very poor hygienic standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A final consideration is, of course, that any intermediate type of appeal system which might be introduced for abattoirs would have to be repeated for knackeries in Part III of this Bill.  Again, in relation to knackeries, any appeal system outside <Col N="591" /> the courts could be difficult to establish in regard both to their scattered location and the different activities that take place in these premises.  For that reason I cannot accept these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister could not see way to giving this type of forum a place within the Bill.  I was at pains to ensure that all the powers the Minister was retaining to himself, which are necessary under the Public Health Act, and indeed the control of slaughtering of animals for human consumption, would remain.  I was trying to have a safety valve in between.  I accept the Minister's assurance that in the granting of licences people will have an opportunity over a period of years to get their premises up to the standard required. It is difficult to frame an amendment without being specific in some instances. I had to put in &ldquo;refusal&rdquo; or &ldquo;revocation&rdquo;. Needless to say, I am more worried about the revocation of licences because people will have an opportunity to bring their premises up to standard.  That is accepted by all of us, and accepted by the trade, as being a necessary part of the interim period between the passing of the legislation and the bringing of it into full effect.</P>
      <P>Applying for a licence and not getting one now just because the premises was not up to standard would not worry me unduly.  It is appropriate that we should be strict about the application of licences and the granting of them.  That is where the first error would be made if we were lax about them.  I welcome the Minister's assurance that we will be responsible in doing that and I think the trade want it that way as well.  I want the trade to be that they will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am worried about the revocation of licences which were granted because the premises and the people reached the required standards but suddenly, for some obscure reason, the licence is revoked.  There are usually surrounding circumstances which could right themselves next day.  If we leave the Bill as it <Col N="592" /> is, that person will have no other recourse but to go to court.  It is an unfair burden to put on the trade, to have to go to a court in order to get their rights.  I was asking for an extension of time to allow some intermediate discussions to take place to find out why the person's licence was revoked.  I have no doubt whatsoever that 99.5 times out of 100 the veterinary officer's decision to revoke would be upheld by this interim forum.  I have to legislate for all eventualities and I cannot rule out the possibility that in some areas there might be a reason, discriminatory or otherwise, a person might genuinely lose a licence and an injustice might be done.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that innocent people, as I would consider them then, should have to go to court to prove their case and the very process of proving their case will lose them customers.  For that reason I am sorry but I must press this amendment or for some assurance from the Minister that between now and the passing of this legislation in another place he and his officials will look at the strict way in which the section is written and see how difficult it is for people in the trade not to be upset about this.  Unless I can get an assurance that the Minister will favourably look at this, I will have to press formally for this amendment to be accepted by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>In a matter of this kind the protection of public health should be our main concern.  I am satisfied from what the Minister has said and the safeguards he has put into the Bill that anybody who has to appeal or whose licence has been refused or revoked will get a fair deal.  The danger I can see in this amendment is that there would be a lack of uniformity in coming to decisions.  If we have an appeals tribunal in each local authority area we will have an awful lot of problems.  First of all, there will be a lack of uniformity because there will be no set standards for each local authority area.  That is the danger I see in it.  I see also the danger of influence being used on local councillors if they were members of this appeals board or members of the <Col N="593" /> trade because they would be dealing possibly with their own friends and their own neighbours.  I am sure Senator Ferris can well understand the type of influence that would be exercised on a member of an appeals board if some of his friends or neighbours were being refused a licence or his licence was being revoked.  That is another danger that I see in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been talking for a long time about this type of legislation.  The Minister is giving sufficient time to everybody in the trade to get their act in order, get their premises straightened out and I am <Col N="594" /> sure he will not use the big stick on anybody; everybody will get a fair deal.  In the final analysis the best body to deal with it would be the court because they would have a uniform plan; they could decide without any local influence and that is very important.  For that reason I think this amendment is really not necessary.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage I mentioned that this section needed to be strengthened to remove any doubt or interpretation as to whether veterinary examiners in export meat plants and <Col N="596" /> licensed bacon plants can condemn meat under the veterinary examination regulations of this Act as the section intended.</P>
      <P>These amendments copperfasten the section and essentially we are spelling out what is meant by &ldquo;unfit for human consumption&rdquo;.  The veterinary examination regulations referred to in this section will be made on foot of section 39 of the Bill.  These regulations will take account of all diseases and conditions which are or may be harmful to the wholesomeness of meat and, as a consequence, to public health.  The regulations made under this Bill will specify clearly the precise grounds on foot of which meat of animals may be declared as unfit for human consumption and the marking, storage, destruction and disposal of such unfit meat.  This section, therefore, together with the amendments will ensure that the same criteria for condemning meat as being unfit for human consumption will apply both to domestic abattoirs and export meat plants.</P>

It is to be welcomed that the Minister is strengthening and tightening up any section of the Bill that could be open to misrepresentation or could lead to the opposite of what all of us want to get out of this legislation. Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 which deal with the fitness of meat for human consumption are welcome.  I am supportive of the Minister's efforts in that regard.  I am saying that on the basis that the Minister might have misinterpreted in some way my previous worry that an opportunity should be given to people to get in line and that they would not be discriminated against unfairly.

We should protect them and make sure there <Col N="597" /> are safeguards so that people are not allowed to put on sale meat that is not fit for human consumption.  The two amendments the Minister has introduced will give the trade the precise grounds on which meats can be condemned as unfit for human consumption.</P>

      <P>I welcome the amendment but I have one regret.  This amendment strengthens the hand of the veterinary inspector in determining the fitness of meat for human consumption. Until now the role for determining this was in the hands of the environmental health inspectors.  In this Bill the role of the environmental health inspectors in this area is eliminated.  We should not forget that this grade of officer has acquired over the years a great measure of expertise in determining the fitness of meat for human consumption.  I raised this on Second Stage.  With hindsight perhaps we should now give a little more thought and discussion to this during the progress of the Bill through this House. I find it regrettable that the role of the environmental health inspectors is being eliminated.  I do not wish to cast any aspersions on the veterinary profession but their experience in this area has not yet been established.  The experience of dealing with this type of inspection was well vested in the health inspectors.  From that point of view I find it regrettable that they will now have no role in this.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 26, line 30, to delete &ldquo;, or the variation of the fee specified therein,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have a problem in that I am finding sections which need to be amended presuming the next section will be allowed to be amended.  It makes it more difficult to be absolutely precise because the amendments are consequential on one another.  If amendment No. 10 is agreed then amendment No. 9 will become operative. In that regard I have no option but to discuss the two amendments together.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I put down an amendment which looked for indexation of the word &ldquo;fees&rdquo;.  Many a case was made by the Minister and by members on all sides of the House that that may have tied the Minister's hands too much in that if the mention of money in any part of the Bill was index-linked the Minister might find himself in difficulty and be unable to provide either a proper service or the proper level of vetinerary inspection which might be required.  I was acting on the advice of the Minister that, as a result of research by his Department, he had priced the cost of implementing the legislation and having it operable.  For that reason I had no difficulty in trying to index link the fees once he had done that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because I did not formally move my amendment to this section on Committee Stage I felt it was appropriate, now that we are talking about health levies or levies that will be used for the purpose of disease eradication, that these levies would be subject to indexation.  I am basing that argument on the knowledge that Governments, including this <Col N="599" /> Government, the previous Government and the Government before that, have used an instrument of regulation in the House of the Oireachtas to allow them to increase, and in some place double, disease eradication levies.  All sorts of reasons were given for doing that.  It is because that instrument which was used in the past that the trade are absolutely fearful that the same will happen again in future if some safety valve is not written into the legislation to stop the Minister or any future Minister from unreasonably increasing the headage payments specified in the Table in Part V of the Bill.  The fees should be index-linked otherwise people in the trade are going to be of the opinion from past experience that some future Minister will use this section to increase the levies payable.</P>
    <P>The National Animal Health Council, of which I was a member for many years and which has been abolished, had overall responsibility in advising the Minister of the day and the Department of Agriculture on the methods to be used in the scheme of compulsory eradication of tuberculosis and brucellosis.  These levies were inbuilt as part of the cost of the running of that scheme.  Recently the leader of the IFA intimated that they are now the major contributors to the funding of the scheme.  They are making a major contribution towards the scheme through these levies.  Because of that they almost want to take from the Minister his responsibility for the compulsory eradication of disease.</P>
    <P>I do not share that view.  Irrespective of the private ownership of animals, the overall health of the national herd is the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture and Food and no other voluntary organisation or farming body can take unto themselves the right to have the responsibility of deciding on the level of health of the national herd.  Not alone do they not have the right but at European level they do not have the instrument whereby they can certify to their colleagues in the European Community that the national herd has achieved a certain <Col N="600" /> disease status.  As the Minister knows from experience in regard to brucellosis we have already achieved an OBF status which only he and his veterinary surgeons at departmental level could certify.  We all have a responsibility to ensure that the national herd achieves a status which cannot be doubted by anybody in the Community in other parts of the world, including the Third World.  No matter who contributes to the funding of the scheme the overall responsibility will lie with the Minister.</P>
    <P>I agree that it is appropriate that the Government of the day should set down levies per head of animals destroyed for human consumption and that those levies should be put into an overall fund which would be used to maintain the health of the national herd.  I am conscious that this section of the Bill was abused in the past and was used as a means of increasing the take for that fund.  Even if all the money by way of levies was put into an overall kitty there still would not be enough to pay for the cost of creating a national scheme.  I have argued at various levels that the State, and indeed the consumer, have a responsibility for the herd health status, both from the point of view of internal trading for human consumption and for the export trade, because the overall national interest is at stake.</P>
    <P>I do not want the Minister to think that I do not consider that levies are necessary, because I do.  I think they are a fundamental part of the industry's contribution towards the herd health status, which is our national responsibility. However, I am extremely concerned, as are the people in the industry to whom I have spoken, that this might be used in some way in the future for increasing the levies applicable, which at present are £3.25 per head for cattle, 75p per head for pigs and 55p per head for sheep.  These amounts are accepted by everybody in the industry as reasonable and all I want to ensure is that in future they would be index-linked to any fluctuation that might occur in the money markets.  In the last couple of days we realise the fluctuations there can be in the money markets.  It <Col N="601" /> was interesting to hear experts stating publicly the policies being followed by some of the nations who have been involved in creating the jitters in the money markets.  Certainly, those policies would not be in line with my beliefs.</P>
    <P>This amendment would index-link the levies in this section.  It does not affect the licence fee, which the Minister will now be free to double or treble next year if he so desires, or if he requires it for the proper funding of the scheme.  This animal health levy should be index-linked and I hope that the Minister will concede the point I have made.  The Minister has overall responsibility for the national herd.  A person can own animals, but the health status of the animals internationally is the Minister's responsibility and it can only be verified by inspectors and officers in his Department.  It cannot be done by private vets, by IFA leaders or anybody else.  Much as they would love to run this country, they must know that the buck stops some place when it comes to the verification of the national health herd status.  I have always defended that status.  The responsibility for this rests with the Minister and not with self-appointed advisers to the Government or the Opposition, particularly when it does not affect their own bailiwick in the economic development of the community.  I am not making a case now for any particular section.  I just want to ensure fair play.  The indexation of these fees to the consumer price index is not unreasonable and I sincerely hope that the Minister concedes this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to formally second the amendment proposed by Senator Ferris.  My party's position on this is the same as that of Senator Ferris.  It goes a little wider.  I have made this point already.  This is the third time I have raised it and I hope I am not boring the House.  I hope it is within the rules of the House to make the point for the third time that our party do not believe the figures the Minister has laid down to fund this section.  It is stated here that the total amount of money collected from <Col N="602" /> inspection fees is £1.4 million.  We agree that the payment of salaries to the veterinary officers in each of the counties is an easily determined figure at £600,000. That leaves £800,000 to pay a corps of 160 veterinary surgeons; the foot soldiers going from abattoir to abattoir and from town to town implementing the regulations.</P>
      <P>I remind the Minister that spot checking by the veterinary corps under the local authority regulations at present costs £400,000 which is fully laid out in the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill.  We are increasing the workload, I would submit as a conservative figure, by at least a factor of ten.  The spot checks will finish as there must be an antemortem and a post-mortem examination of each animal slaughtered.  There is no way that the programme can be financed with £600,000 when it costs £400,000 to finance the spot checking which excluded Dublin and Cork, two very large areas. Revenue was generated in Dublin and in Cork where there are quite a number of abattoirs but the remainder were subsidised out of public funds.  If Dublin and Cork were subsidised out of the public purse in the same manner as other areas throughout the country, that figure of £400,000 would easily rise to £500,000 in my opinion.</P>
      <P>I also draw the Minister's attention, to the cost of a corps of 160 veterinary surgeons.  From our experience of local authorities, £5,000 per veterinary surgeon is a conservative figure of remuneration and the total comes to around £800,000 if my figure are correct.  Every penny of the allocation will be spent. The Bill provides that there must be the necessary back-up services.  There will be no money to pay for back-up services or for the travelling expenses of these veterinary inspectors, which may be as great or greater &mdash; I am open to correction on that point &mdash; than the actual cost of paying them their professional fees for doing the ante- and post-mortem inspections.  Another matter worries us. When we look at the Book of Estimates for 1988 we find it difficult to identify from what fund&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is within the ambit of the Bill.  I do not wish to get into an argument and I will be guided by you.  If we look at the figures of expenditure for 1988 for the Department of Agriculture and Food we find that under the heading salaries, wages and allowances to officers of that Department, the funding for veterinary inspectors at least indirectly will be down as the figures are down by 2 per cent.  The clear implication of that has to be that these fees as set out in the Bill will have to be increased drastically in 1988 to meet the real economic cost of implementing the provisions of this part of the section.  Our party disagree fundamentally with it.  We cannot accept it at this stage.  We objected on Second Stage.  It was part of our major objection on Committee Stage and it is our fundamental objection at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are precisely the same as those proposed to this section by Senator Ferris on Committee Stage.  On Committee Stage I went into great detail as to why I could not accept the amendments and I cannot find any reason now to accept them.  Essentially the measures under this Bill will have to be self financing.  The idea that you can have deferred systems or proxy systems of paying for services has had a costly and disastrous outcome for the economy.  The fees in section 23 are intended to provide a self financing basis for the local authority veterinary staff.  It will be necessary to operate the Bill's controls and it should be determined solely on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rates are the same as those currently applicable at exports plants whose <Col N="604" /> inspection fees are not linked to the consumer price index and were last increased in 1984.  Linking the fees for domestic abattoirs to the consumer price index, as suggested, would give rise to an anomalous situation between the home and export sectors.  More particularly such linkage would have no regard to actual costs.  Linking the fees to the consumer price index would only lead to a creeping bureaucracy referred to by many speakers in the debate on this Bill.</P>
    <P>If it is found necessary to increase these rates at some future stage to keep in line with costs, the regulations so proposing and as provided for in section 44 (4) will have to be approved by both this House and the Dáil, so it will not be a question of the whim of any Minister of the day. The fees will have to be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas and the Minister in introducing such regulations will have to justify with facts and figures whatever increase is sought.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister did not find it possible to accept the concept outlined in my amendment. I want to put on the record the motive for the amendment in case there is any misapprehension in anybody's mind about it.  First of all, there is, of course, a difference between licensed abattoirs in rural towns and villages and abattoirs in export plants.  I never suggested for a moment that there was not a difference. There is a difference and there will always be a difference.  Factories have a resident veterinary inspectorate on duty at all times during the periods of killing to achieve the export status and standard. That is appropriate.  This Bill deals with private abattoirs which require a different veterinary service.  There will be one co-ordinating officer with overall responsibility who will have a back-up staff to visit abattoirs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only concept accepted by the Taoiseach for increasing anybody's salary is that it be either index-linked or by agreement and usually agreement is arrived at by index-linking it to the cost of living.  If there is an increase in the veterinarians' salaries naturally it will be based on the <Col N="605" /> cost of living and the fees will automatically adjust to the cost of living to compensate the Minister for the additional costs.  That is one difference I see.  Secondly, although it is the same amendment as I had on Committee Stage the Minister will remember that, whereas the amendments were all discussed and debated together, I did not formally move the amendment to this section because one vote was taken on the debate involving all the other sections which I was trying to index-link as well.</P>
    <P>As a reasonable legislator I consider that the Minister made a good enough case, that some flexibility was required even by way of regulation for increasing income in the event of the cost of the <Col N="606" /> provisions of this Bill being above the present estimate in the Department.  That is why I allowed flexibility in the licence fees which can be adjusted up and down to recompense the Department for the cost of the provisions of the Bill.  This is a specific and deliberate amendment and was discussed in the overall context of index-linking other areas of income.  I did not formally move this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to speak on this Stage because I find myself in the unfortunate position that, because of some of the ministerial deletions or refusals to accept amendments, I have to oppose the Bill in total.  I have listened very carefully to the considered series of amendments proposed by Senator Ferris and I am worried by the rejection of some of them, particularly section 42 (3) (b) which seems to me, as a result of a ministerial consequential amendment, now effectively remove from control the private slaughtering of animals.  This worries me because this is a matter that this House has had the opportunity of discussing once before as a result of the Protection of Animals (Amendment) Bill, 1963 &mdash; the only Private Members' Bill successfully introduced by an Independent through this House.  It was introduced by Senator Professor W. B. Stanford.  He also encountered difficulty in the area of controlling precisely these situations because in section 29 he had envisaged, as the parliamentary record shows, precisely this kind of area.  Due to pressure from the industry this section of the Bill eventually fell.</P>
      <P>This is worrying.  It is particularly worrying because Professor Stanford at that time isolated clearly four legitimate interest areas: the public in general, who are covered fairly effectively by what the Minister proposes; owners or users of animals, in this case farmers, currently the law enforcing agencies.  Senator Ferris has called amendments on this to the point of a vote and they have been defeated.  But, very significantly, a fourth further interest group was isolated by Professor Stanford, and that is the rights and conditions of the animals themselves. There has been very little discussion of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="608" /> Two of the world's great religions, which are represented as minorities in this country, the Jewish people and people of the Moslem faith, recognise that the taking of life, even of an animal, has a spiritual dimension and needs to be controlled in all circumstances so that the dignity of that animal and our own dignity as human animals should be protected. This is a growing concern of the Irish people as was illustrated last week when there was an attack upon a butcher's shop in Fairview by the Animal Liberation Front, who take a very extreme point of view, but it does indicate that there is a growing concern.  This is important because the way in which we are seen to treat animals can and must have an effect upon the psychological and spiritual welfare of those involved in this process.  I view this matter with reinforced concern because, as a Senator, I am a recipient of various journals which I would not normally take.  I have here a publication called <i>Food Ireland</i> and on the back of it there is an advertisement for a machine and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am most grateful for your indulgence.  My point may be a little bit outside, and I accept your ruling, but I think the wording of the advertisement shows an attitude that can grow if we are not very careful about this delicate area <Col N="609" /> of our experience as human beings.  It is an advertisement for a certain kind of machine used in the food processing industry.  It is callous in the extreme.  It speaks of a centring bracket fitted with a centring pin which ensures that the animal remains in the correct position during evisceration so that an eviscerating spoon moves unhampered and smoothly into the bird.  I need not continue. The least fortunate aspect of this advertisement is the fact that it then degenerates into fairly jokey advertising of its product.  I simply state that as an example of the degeneration of attitude and comparison that can happen if we do not treat the death, even of an animal, with respect.  In the parallel debate that took place in 1963 Senator O'Donovan made precisely this point with reference to the Second World War and the increased technology that was available in that war for the processing of human deaths.</P>
      <P>I will conclude my remarks by expressing my gratitude to the Cathaoirleach for allowing me that margin of tolerance.  It is with the greatest regret that, because of these deficiencies in the Bill which I believe could have been largely cured by acceptance of Senator Ferris very well thought out amendments, I have to oppose the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I tried to make an addition to a Government amendment, which we accepted today, to include &ldquo;lamb&rdquo; in the list of animals that could be destroyed at home for human consumption.  My amendment was not allowed and lamb is now excluded from that list.  I am aware that lambs are killed at home for human consumption and, under the terms of this Bill, a lamb's leg will have to be broken before it can be destroyed.  That will lead to inhuman treatment of the lamb.  That is the consequence of not allowing the amendment.  I want to ensure that animals will be humanely destroyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an exclusion in the case of larger animals.  They can be destroyed without veterinary inspection, or otherwise, only in the event of one of them being injured.  The Minister excluded <Col N="610" />&ldquo;pig&rdquo; because it is a custom to kill pigs for home use.  I wanted to exclude lamb because it was also a custom to kill lamb for home use.  To comply with the wording of the Bill the lamb would have to be injured, accidentially or deliberately, before it could be killed for human consumption. That is an inadequacy in the legislation.  It does not take account of the overall thrust and operability of the Bill.  I know people kill lambs for their private use.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the revocation of a licence which is referred to in section 16.  The Minister has set down the legal procedure to be followed.  Perhaps he will clarify one point.  Where it is intended to revoke a licence a period will elapse from the service of the notice of the intention to revoke that licence.  A period of 21 days is mentioned in the Bill and the licensee will be allowed to make representations to the licensing authority within that period.  Perhaps the Minister, in his response, will clarify that matter. The trade welcome the fact that a period will elapse from the date of the service of notice of intention to revoke and the actual revocation.  The 21 days mentioned in the Bill are close enough to the period of 30 days I proposed in my amendment.  If the Minister confirms the introduction of that intermediary period in which people will have an opportunity to make their case I might be able to convince the people who will be operating this legislation that it is not unreasonable and that with the Minister's knowledge and approval they will have some recourse to dialogue and discussion, particularly with the licensing authority.  Obviously the Minister has overall responsibility in this area.  Perhaps, when replying, he will clarify that matter so that I can go back to the people with whom I have been trying to have dialogue in the course of this legislation to ensure that we still have their support. We had their support when the Bill was launched initially.  They met the Minister and his advisers and they made submissions about fundamental changes that were needed.  The Minister has not conceded any of those changes either to me <Col N="611" /> or to the House, except the one which brings animals destroyed on a farm for human consumption within the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister excluded a particular animal, the sacrificial lamb which will now have to be injured, deliberately or accidentially, before he can be killed for home consumption.  That is inoperable. I will have to convince the trade, and farmers will also have to be convinced, that they will be breaking the law if they kill a lamb for home consumption. Anyone who knows anything about rural Ireland will know that is ludicrous because it is an everyday occurrence.  I would not condone the widespread killing of lambs privately for commercial use because we would be going against the whole concept of the Bill and there would be access to unmarked meat on the market by operators who would sell it in the housing estates and elsewhere.  We would be bringing the whole legislation into contempt.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for listening to me during the past three weeks.  We tried to make relevant what was technical, complicated and perhaps, uninteresting legislation. I tried to ensure that we would continue to have the support of the trade and the industry.  Perhaps the Minister's response might bring back some of the support we may have lost in the past couple of weeks.  I had difficulty in convincing the Minister that amendments were necessary in order to make the Bill operable.  He will have a long hard road in dealing with this legislation in the other House where the numbers might not be as great as they are here and that might create some problems.  Perhaps I should not comment on the other House.</P>

      <P>We will not be opposing the final passage of the Bill in this House. We have had a good debate.  We found the Minister a little obdurate but, at the same time, he was forthcoming on a number of issues.  I was particularly pleased that last week, while not conceding on the amendment proposed, he did concede &mdash; I raise this because it is a major worry to the people in the trade, the high street butchers as I would prefer to call them &mdash; that there are very wide implications in the regulations laid down for abattoirs regarding size, location, appliances, etc.  There are very wide monetary or economic implications for the people who operate the trade on the high street and those who retail meat. Naturally we have to be thoughtful about those people.</P>
      <P>The subject of cruelty was raised by Senator Norris and I had hoped that this Bill would, if anything, improve the level of humane slaughter of animals at abattoirs. It certainly was a worry that proper humane standards were not always observed in private abattoirs where there was not proper inspection.</P>
      <P>I alone raised a point on Second Stage that did not generate any interest, that is, that I felt that some standards in our meat export plants are not humane.  I agree it is not fully germane to this Bill but there is a high percentage of ritualistic slaughter of animals in our meat export plants at present.  That is a direct consequence of our Third World contracts, particularly with Islam countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a farmer and I have not had the direct experience of seeing a ritualistic slaughter of animals but I know this method of slaughter, referred to in the 1983 Act as the Mujtahiddan slaughter or the Islamic rite, as it is more correctly called today, is rather slow and, by our standards, is cruel since the animal is not stunned prior to the ritualistic slaughter which is quite prolonged.  That is a necessary part of our contract to sell meat to those markets.  I ask the Minister to consider the question of ritualistic slaughter. The Kosher Rite method of slaughtering animals is not operated on a large scale any more but some years ago it was <Col N="613" /> used significantly in our meat exports to Israel.  We sell a lot of meat nowadays to Libya, Iran, Egypt and North Africa, the Islamic part of the world.  I cannot approve of this method of slaughter.</P>

      <P>I, too, express my thanks to the Minister for the way he has approached this legislation.  The debate we have had here over the past few weeks has helped to tease out some of the problems that affect the trade.  Those problems have been brought to our notice by people involved in the trade.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide certain standards of veterinary control and hygiene at local slaughtering premises which provide meat for the home market and which would be on a par with those already operating in the export market.  In order to do that it will be necessary for abattoirs to secure a licence from their local authorities and to get that licence certain conditions must be fulfilled and certain standards of hygiene are required in slaughtering premises.</P>

The legislation before this House will be for the betterment of the trade and that is our main concern.  Those of us who saw the horrible film on television some months ago will never forget the type of meat being dumped on the market that humans were being asked to consume.  Anything we can do in this House to correct that should be supported. The measures in this Bill will help to wipe out that illegal trading.  The main purpose of this legislation is the protection of public health and I believe the measures in this Bill will provide that protection.</P>

      <P>I welcome Senator Norris' scholarly contribution on this Stage of the Bill and I <Col N="614" /> appreciate his turn of phrase but, notwithstanding that, I concede that the extension of home slaughterings to sheep or lambs would not in any way reduce the degree of cruelty or introduce a more humane system.  We have gone out of our way in this Bill to confine traditional slaughtering or killing of animals on the farm to a pig or an injured animal to avoid suffering.  The Slaughter of Animals Act, 1935, governs the humane slaughter of animals.  The Council of Europe has in operation a convention on the slaughter of animals and the 1935 Act meets its provisions.</P>
      <P>In relation to Senator Ferris' question on the revocation of a licence, before revoking an abattoir licence pursuant to section 15 of this Bill, at least 21 days notice in writing will have to be given to the licence holder and I am sure, in the tradition of Irish public life, representations will be made to the appropriate Minister to ensure that a fair hearing is given to the licence holder. The situation would have to be very grave before the licence holder would be taken before the Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the remarks of the various Senators on the Bill and on my contributions to it.  I try to be reasonable at all times and I go out of my way to avoid any confrontation even though I do not succeed at all times.  I want to thank the various Senators for their very well-researched contributions to this Bill.  It is acceptable legislation.  The trade, the Department, the inspectors and the health boards very much appreciate the upgrading of legislation so that meat for human consumption will be of the highest possible standard both for the home market and the export market.</P>

It is extremely important that we should know precisely what is involved here because very wide-ranging powers are given in this Bill, indeed, for an important reason.  It is all the more important and significant that we who are debating this legislation should have a clear and explicit definition from the Minister as to what precisely is involved in section 1.</P>

      <P>I am utterly confused about the machinations from one Bill to the other.  There are different powers in the 1976 Act from those in the 1956 Act and in the 1977 Act from the 1984 Act.  I am particularly aware that the Garda have specific powers under the 1984 Act which are not available to customs officers.  Does this Bill give additional powers to the Garda or does it give the same powers to the other named groups as the Garda have at the moment under the 1984 Act?  We need to be specific on this before we go any further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, in reply to Senator Ryan the definition of an officer of the Customs and Excise is the same as that in section 1 of the Customs Act, 1956.  The definition covers the references to officers of Customs and Excise in the various sections of that Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Bulbulia spoke about clarification. The main purpose of the Bill is to provide additional powers for the staff of Customs and Excise in parts of the country where they operate and in the role they play, with particular emphasis on combating drug smuggling into this country.  That is the main purpose of the Bill.  I want to assure the House that there are no draconian measures being given to the officers of the Customs and Excise. We have had very vigilant membership of the Customs and Excise over the years. The Government and I are confident that the powers being transferred are reasonable and are urgently needed in order to combat drugs coming into this country and the drug epidemic that can destroy <Col N="617" /> our beautiful country and our wonderful people.  I assure the House that the Bill has been very carefully and meticulously put together and basically embodies various sections and parts of other existing law, be they Customs and Excise, Finance Bills or other legislation and enshrines them in one Bill giving these powers to the Customs and Excise officers so that, together along with the Garda, they can play their full role in combating the importation of drugs or any prohibited goods.</P>
    <P>I want to assure Senator O'Toole that no additional powers are being given to the Garda.  They already have special powers to deal with this matter.  We want to ensure that the Garda are one arm of the State and the Customs and Excise are another.  The Customs and Excise are in a very invidious position in that they can detect certain matters but, as the law stands, they cannot do anything about them.  The purpose of this Bill is to get rid of these anomalies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister's concern.  I agree completely that the Customs and Excise officers need support in this area.  A difficulty arises from what the Minister has just said.  The Garda have particular powers under the 1984 Act and various other Acts.  Those powers are subject to various checks and balances, by complaints commissions and so on.  There are ways in which the Garda are required to be answerable for the powers they have.</P>
      <P>What concerns me is that we are giving people new powers which they did not have before and which the Minister quite rightly said they may well need.  When they suspect drug carriers they must have some powers to move in on them.  Would the Minister not admit that this Bill, and this section in particular, does not contain any measure which will balance that extra power with responsibility or accountability. This is precisely the point I would like the Minister to respond to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>In his reply the Minister gave us the broad thrust of the Bill.  Certainly I have no quarrel with that and I <Col N="618" /> feel very strongly that drugs, and their importation, are an unmitigated menace and that in this State we must take every conceivable measure we can to guard against the importation of drugs.  I broadly welcome this Bill as did all the other Senators who contributed on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole spoke about guarding against abuse and said he wishes to see some system of checks and balances in place.  These are areas which concern me. In giving these extra powers to the Customs and Excise officers perhaps the Minister will say what training there will be for the Customs and Excise officers in the use of these powers.  It is important that, when such wide-ranging powers are being given to people, they should be very carefully detailed and explained to them and that possible situations can be foreseen and can be discussed so that the people can be trained and equipped to deal with them.  I am slightly concerned about this matter because when the Minister for Finance spoke at the conclusion of Second Stage, he indicated that this measure would not involve additional finance and would not be a burden on the Exchequer.  I feel strongly that proper training must be provided because we are giving very wide-ranging powers and I cannot see how that can be done without incurring additional expenditure.  I also share the concerns expressed by Senator O'Toole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the Minister for Finance and I are concerned, there will be no additional cost to the State as a result of the implementation of this Bill. I accept fully that there are checks and balances <i>vis-á-vis</i> the powers given to the Garda Síochána but under the 1984 Act they have total responsibility for the enlargement of law throughout all this island.  This is a different type of Bill in that it is specific.  It deals with the Customs and Excise people who operate in particular parts of the country.  They are not operating right across the country. They operate in specified areas and the laws under which they operate are basically effective in specified areas.  Some <Col N="619" /> sections of this Bill acknowledge that fact.</P>
      <P>I do not think we have to worry about abuse because the Customs and Excise people already have very extensive powers of search. This Bill proposes to extend those powers to cater for actual commodities, articles, or prohibited goods coming into our State.  We want to enshrine in law by name, by act and by deed, an opportunity for the Customs and Excise officers to deal with the menace of these goods coming into our country at particular points of entry, whether it be sea ports, airports, land frontiers or whatever. We want to ensure that there will be no anomaly between the powers of the Garda <i>vis-á-vis</i> the job they do right across the country and the job done by Customs and Excise people at specific points of our country, and they can do the job together in the best interests of all the people.  I want to tell the House and Senator Bulbulia that I have been assured that sufficient training will be made available under the direction of the Revenue Commissioners with the cooperation of the Department of Finance for the officers of the Customs and Excise who will be operating the new Act when it becomes law.  I assure the House also that Customs and Excise themselves, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners are constantly aware of the necessity to upgrade the methods of detection and the need for modern technology.</P>
      <P>They have constant training and retraining and have acquired the necessary facilities to enable them to discharge their duties in the best interests of the State.  I assure the House that that is the type of system that will continue whether or not this Bill is passed.  I am confident that the House will pass it.  That is the type of policy that will continue in the Revenue Commissioners Office and the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset of the discussion on this Bill we should at least be honest with each other.  I am not sure whether the Minister is aware that if you take the land frontier of this country and the extent of it, and when you consider the fact that there are 52 different airstrips and various ports around the periphery of the country, the areas where these powers would not extend are very small indeed.  I do not know where we would be talking about.  The county of Laois does not touch any county which touches the sea but that would probably be excluded.  I asked a simple question at the beginning.  Will the powers extended to customs officers under this Bill be subject to any checks, balances, investigation or complaints authority in the same way as the Garda are?  I am not trying to catch anybody out.  I want that information.  I take it from the Minister's answer that there is not.  He said it is not widely extensive.  I am saying it is widely extensive.  If that is the case we can still proceed with the Bill.  Things can be built into this Bill which, in the main, can strengthen it, if the Minister is of a mind to do that.  I am simply asking the question. We all have the same viewpoint here.  Nobody wants to facilitate customs smugglers, drugs smugglers or people who are running&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to say something but I had better not.  I would like the Minister to tell me a bit about section 2 because at the conclusion of Second Stage, the Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry, explained to us that there was nothing novel in sections 2 and 3.  It was simply an extension of powers Customs and Excise already had to a new area.  As I recall it, the Minister explained that this was specifically designed for people who were not necessarily travellers. The Customs and Excise already have all of the powers that exist here to deal with people who are travelling.  This is to deal with people who are &mdash; to use a phrase more appropriate in other contexts &mdash; found on or in the vicinity of a land frontier, or a port, or any other place and whom the Customs and Excise suspect.  That is the understanding of it. That does not get away from the fact that the powers referred to here are considerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first question I should like to ask the Minister is: where do these powers reside?  In what Act do these powers currently reside that are now being extended by this Bill?  Is it the 1956 Customs Act <Col N="622" /> or where is it?  That is the first issue.  I would like to talk a little more about a number of things I will mention them now.  Is he not worried that, apart from civil libertarian considerations about powers like those contained in section 2, the absence of legislatively based protections for the suspect in the form of a complaints procedure, in the form of regulations about how people are to be treated when they are in custody or, indeed, regulations about searching means that customs officers are liable to be the object of considerable misuse by people and perhaps litigation.  In other words, people will complain that they were improperly treated, improperly dealt with, etc.  I do not think it is proper or right for the citizen or for officers of the Customs and Excise to have powers like this without building in the sort of checks which ensure that the citizen cannot be abused and a citizen cannot accuse an officer of abusing powers in a way which can lead to damage in either direction.</P>
    <P>Can I ask specifically under subsection (1), paragraph (i) page 4, if the search of any person involves strip searching for instance?  Where is there a guarantee which is contained in the Garda Regulations that a person will never be searched by a person of the opposite sex. That is contained in the regulations about how gardaí conduct searches under the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  It is extremely important in the interests of both suspects and Customs and Excise officers that such a search should be carried out by a person of the same sex as the person being searched.  If the question of strip searching arises &mdash; I can understand why it might in the area of drug smuggling &mdash; what procedures, regulations, checks and balances are contained? I do not think anybody believes there should be an indiscriminate power to demand strip searches and, if such is to be done, it should be conducted under very well regulated conditions.</P>
    <P>Related to that is the rather peculiar power under subsection (2) that if an officer decides to search a person under this section, he may require the person to accompany him to a customs office.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="623" /> The officer of Customs and Excise could, at least in theory, insist on searching somebody in public.  I do not think that serves the objectives of the Bill or the interests of Customs and Excise officers, apart altogether from the suspect or the citizen.  When the power is there to require somebody I think the person &ldquo;shall&rdquo; require a person to accompany him.  Any citizen is entitled to feel that if he or she is under suspicion they will be searched in private.  I do not think it is a matter that should be conducted in public.</P>
    <P>They are a number of things that I will be concerned about.  The underlying concern I have is: where do these powers originate and in what legislation did they start?  Why is it that these powers can be given to one agency of the State and cannot be given to any other?  The Garda, who have a far more difficult task in which their lives are at risk in the defence of the security of the State, have got to be far more circumspect about how they use powers of search and arrest than Customs and Excise.  I would hate if we got to the stage of believing that, because we are dealing with Customs and Excise, powers in excess of those given to the Garda to deal with subversion, for instance, should be made available to them.  The problem is that this is a replication of earlier legislation and the earlier legislation was drafted at a time when, perhaps, some of these issues were not as widely talked about.  What we have now is a reproduction of something that is 30 or 40 years old &mdash; it may be even older &mdash; without thought and without reference. It is time that the same accountability was introduced when we are extending the power that has already been introduced for the Garda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important that the Minister should be able to give firm re-assurances on this section of the Bill. I am unhappy about some of the language used in the Bill.  It confers huge discretionary powers on Customs and Excise people.  While I voice that criticism I again want to restate the fact that I <Col N="624" /> admire what Customs and Excise people do.  Their purpose is a valid one.  They are involved in protecting the institutions of the State and my criticisms of this section of the Bill are in no way intended to undermine the legitimate functions of Customs and Excise people.  A phrase such as &ldquo;in the vicinity of any port or airport&rdquo;, for instance, is one that needs to be tied down.  What is meant precisely by &ldquo;in the vicinity of any port or airport&rdquo;? Do we have a radius of a particular mileage?</P>
      <P>No part of Ireland is too far from the vicinity of a port or an airport.  If you really want to stretch it, you can say that.  I understood that in relation to the Border the radius is 20 miles.  Perhaps the Minister would like to confirm that that is so.  It would be a very good idea if, in this section, we could firm up on precisely what we mean by the phrase &ldquo;in the vicinity of any port or an airport&rdquo;. There is also a reference to &ldquo;an officer of Customs and Excise who with reasonable cause suspects that a person...&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>What is &ldquo;reasonable cause&rdquo;?  I can imagine that &ldquo;reasonable cause&rdquo; would be where there was a tip-off from another agency that a person was quite likely to be carrying drugs.  That is something I can understand.  But could it be interpreted that &ldquo;reasonable cause&rdquo; meant somebody who was bearded, had a knapsack was sandalled and looked generally like what was fashionable in the sixties &mdash; one of the flower power people &mdash; and who seemed like somebody who might be engaged in drug smuggling.  That would leave an individual like that or, indeed, a person of colour open to a particular prejudice of an individual Customs and Excise officer.  I would be deeply unhappy if a phrase such as &ldquo;who with reasonable cause suspects&rdquo; could be used in the broadest possible context and could as a result undermine the civil liberties of individuals within this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who will supervise Customs and Excise people in the discharge of the functions which we propose to give them in this legislation?  Who is in charge? Where does the buck stop given that <Col N="625" /> there is in place a Garda Complaints Tribunal and that this legislation does not envisage any such body to keep the checks and balances right in relation to this legislation?  I would like re-assurances from the Minister that some body of that nature will be put in position; otherwise I think there is a possibility of abuse.  While we are debating this legislation we should bear firmly in mind a wish not to see any abuse of power.</P>
    <P>The whole area of search of the person is one that concerns me.  I was interested to hear some Senators in their Second Stage contributions make reference to the possibility of an X-ray of the individual. The Minister in his reply to Second Stage ruled out the possibility of X-ray.  I am glad about that because I could envisage a situation where a pregnant woman, for example, could be the subject of an X-ray and that would be totally unacceptable.  It is an invasion of the person that I would not like to see being employed under this section of the Bill.  I want to know if doctors will be appointed on stand-by at various ports and airports, or in the catchment area, or within a radius of ports or airports who will be specifically detailed in the same way as they are by the Garda authority in the cases of an infringement of the Intoxicating Liquors Act?  Will people be specifically mandated to come in and assist if there is to be a body search of a person who is suspected by customs officers?  Will there be statutory instruments accompanying this legislation which will spell out those sort of details? I think there ought to be.  I wonder has the Minister considered that.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to the possibility of urine tests.  There has been an increase in the degree of sophistication of tests and what they can show up.  I wonder is it envisaged that such tests will be carried out on people?  If that is the case, and it is not in the legislation, will it be in some sort of accompanying statutory instrument or regulation which will spell out the fine detail of the implementation of this section of the Bill?  I would like also specific information about strip searching.  In the context of the Second <Col N="626" /> Stage contributions I, and indeed, other Senators made references to the fact that there are people who will inject drugs; these people are called, I think, swallowers. Very often the orifices of the body might need to be examined and I want to know by whom, and where, and under what controls, and what medical personnel will be present?  I express also my concern, which has been raised by Senator Brendan Ryan, that it is necessary to state specifically that no member of the opposite sex would be involved in an intimate search of anybody suspected of the importation of drugs.  I have rolled a lot of questions into one section of the Bill and I hope the Minister will be able to give me the clarifications and reassurances I seek.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>On this section, like a number of fellow Senators, I too expressed some reservations about what I saw as an infringement of civil liberties in the whole thrust of the Bill on Second Stage.  In the specific context of this section and listening to Senator Ryan and Senator Bulbulia they seem to be suggesting that there needs to be a further system of checks and balances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a brother-in-law who is in the French customs service and who is responsible, during his career, for apprehending and searching and he has had experience of many of the things discussed on this section.  Because of my own concern about the civil liberties aspect, as articulated by colleagues, I was curious to know from his experience whether he felt the suggestions contained in this Bill would be sufficient or adequate in practice.  His response was that he was surprised that there was not such legislation in this country, particularly as Ireland is a peripheral region of the EC and, as the completion of the internal market continues apace, will be finding that more and more emphasis will be placed on the Customs and Excise service to detect the more sophisticated drug travellers who are now part and parcel of life.  He went on to say he believed that the proposals contained in the Bill did <Col N="627" /> not go far enough; that we should draw on the customs service in France, a member state of the EC for experience.  This is just a start down the road towards helping to tighten up an area which obviously is in need of being tightened up.</P>
    <P>Senator Bulbulia raised the question, for example, of the alleged prejudice or otherwise customs officers might show, using the phrase &ldquo;reasonable cause&rdquo;.  She went on to say that perhaps a person might look a particular way or their colour might in some way motivate a customs officer to search them.  It is happening every day of the week at our airports and our sea ports.  People are being stopped because customs officers, in their opinion, have reasonable cause to think they may be importing something illegally.</P>
    <P>We have all gone through customs and I would not be human if I did not admit &mdash; and I am sure it will strike a chord with other travellers &mdash; that sometimes you wonder: are they going to stop me?  There is no criterion on which to base this.  The criterion is based on the customs officers' own expertise and experience as to whether they will or will not stop people. While I accept the reservations which have been put forward by my colleagues on the other side of the House, I suggest to the Minister that, having regard to our experience of the integrity of our customs officers, we should not concern ourselves too much about whether they will carry out their jobs with honesty and integrity. I see no difficulties with the sections in this Bill at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism recommended that the powers that customs officers had should be extended and that is included in section 2 of the Bill. We must have certain safeguards.  The matters raised by Senator Bulbulia on the definitions of &ldquo;vicinity&rdquo;, and &ldquo;reasonable cause&rdquo; are areas on which we must get clear definitions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to &ldquo;the search of a person and, if he considers it necessary for that purpose, detain the person for such time <Col N="628" /> as is reasonably necessary for carrying out the search&rdquo;.  I would like to ask the Minister if there is any limit to the time a person can be detained under that section.  That is very important.  A person could be detained for longer than was necessary.  When I spoke on this section on Second Stage I asked if the Minister would consider bringing in regulations in the same way as the Minister for Justice brought in regulations with the Criminal Justice Act as it was passing through the Dáil and Seanad.  These regulations put many people at ease.</P>
    <P>Another point I want to make is in relation to the search of vehicles.  It came to the committee's attention that the customs officials had not got the necessary equipment for the searching of vehicles. We touched on this on section 1 but I have to mention it again because it is actually related to section 2.  The committee were of the view that covered bays and pits, ramps and hoists should be provided to enable vehicles to be examined. There is to no way a thorough examination can take place of a vehicle unless these facilities are available.  I ask the Minister, under the subhead which he has mentioned, if money will be provided to bring into effect the kind of equipment customs officers badly need.  Senator Bulbulia will be glad to hear that the committee considered the matter of X-raying people and vehicles as well but, due to the health hazard, did not recommend that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put on the record that I did not stand up at any point to criticise the extra powers being given to customs officers.  In fact, I do not think anybody on this side of the House did in deference to Senator Mooney.  People talked about how they would be applied. I would like to have a few points clarified; The first point is quite important.  The word &ldquo;airport&rdquo; has not been defined anywhere in the Bill.  Does the Minister see a difference between an &ldquo;airport&rdquo; and an &ldquo;airstrip&rdquo;?  That is important.  There are 52 airstrips in this country.  &ldquo;In the vicinity&rdquo; of an airstrip, land frontier and posts means the whole country.  I know the answer is that an airstrip is an airport for <Col N="629" /> legal purposes in so far as stuff can be brought in.  We are, therefore, talking about every part of Ireland.</P>
      <P>There are 52 airstrips in the free State. There is a land boundary and there are ports all around it.  If you are talking about the vicinity of those airports and those points which I have just mentioned you are talking about the whole country. That is a matter of fact.  You can shake your heads if you wish but geography is geography and I cannot do anything to change it.  I am just stating a fact.  Therefore these powers extend all around the country.  I have spoken to customs officers about this and I want to assure the Minister that customs officers, while they welcome many things in this Bill, are also afraid of their lives of it.  I want to be crudely practical about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the detention powers given under section 2 of this Bill, what does a customs officer do having detained somebody?  How is the search to take place?  Having said that I want to refer again to the point about X-rays.  Of course I agree and accept completely the damage that an X-ray can do to somebody with a particular illness and also to a person who was pregnant.  I agree that such a person should not under any circumstances be subjected to it.  However, if the Minister accepts that somebody may be strip searched and have their body cavities and body orifices searched, quite rightly, in my estimation, that is not any more of an intrusion into a person than an X-ray. that is a fact that must be stated.  Under the technology available at present, the question has been asked: what is &ldquo;reasonable cause for detention?&rdquo; If people are being detained and if they are carrying a package or a packet inside their body, an X-ray will show that up or will show something inside the body and that gives clear grounds for suspicion. Technology has developed and that must be considered if there is to be a detention power under section 2.  We must not just look at detention because a detention for a period of 36 hours or whatever does not necessarily mean that something taken in the body will be passed through the body <Col N="630" /> in that period of time.  There is a flaw here.</P>
    <P>The other area to which I want to refer is that the most sophisticated area of detection of matter inside the body is through urine testing.  The technology in this area has gone ahead by leaps and bounds and nowadays the slightest traces of substances within the body can be detected.  If somebody is to be detained for a long period, as under the intoxicating liquor legislation, that person can be required to give urine samples.  I believe this power should be included in this section.  I do not have problems with the powers.  I believe they should be somewhat more extensive but the officers should be accountable.</P>
    <P>I can tell the Minister things that worry customs officers about the question of detention.  Where is the person to be detained?  Where will the detention take place?  Under what conditions will it take place?  If somebody is to be detained for a long period, it should follow also that there should be a maximum period tied into it and that there should be checks during the period of detention.  I ask the Minister to clarify that airports are airstrips. I ask the Minister to explain in detail how this legislation will operate if the detained person is not required to subject himself or herself to a medical examination, or X-ray testing, or urine sample testing.  I would like to know how it can work.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister's Department are investigating the use of what is known in Europe as the EMIT test, a system of detection of drugs, and I want to know how that could be used under this legislation. How will we see to it that the detained person's rights are protected; that a person is treated fairly; that a person is not subjected to 24 hours continuous interrogation or subject to 24 hours continuous hassle?  That should be done.</P>
    <P>How are the doctors to be chosen?  I agree that there should be panels of doctors available in the same way as they are under the intoxicating liquor laws to give effect to this legislation.  These are some of the points that come up directly <Col N="631" /> on this section.  I ask the Minister to come clean on this issue, to indicate to me that some of these things will be taken on board in the working of this Bill and to indicate to me how we can be sure the person will be looked after.  Does he feel, for instance, that when somebody is held in detention a custodial officer should be responsible for the person's custody.</P>
    <P>I would also ask about the checks and balances which have been built into the European legislation, including, indeed, the French legislation, Senator Mooney, and the British legislation, as to how these are applied.  I want to know why we disposed of those.  We do not want people, on the one hand, to be abused, and we certainly do not want walking free people who are breaking up the system and destroying our young people through the illegal importation of drugs.  We must, therefore, find a middle line of application of this legislation when it comes to be implemented.  I would ask the Minister for a most detailed response on some of those issues.</P>

Nothing I have said in any way impugns the work that those decent, <Col N="632" /> hard-working public servants are doing.

I will give all the information that I have at my disposal.  I have gone into this in the most detailed manner, and I am satisfied with the expert officials with whom I have discussed this Bill and, after having further consultations with my senior Minister, I am quite satisfied that the powers which this House will enable to be passed on to the customs officers will be most reasonable and will be discharged in the most reasonable way, as the customs officers have discharged their duties over the years.  It is open to any Member of this House, to any Member of any House, to the public themselves, not alone to the Legislature and through the courts, to take any action they wish at any time if they are not satisfied with the operation of the law as passed by these Houses.  The only reason I say this to the Senator is that he made an allegation that I had to come clean.  I want to say that I do not have to come clean; neither do my Department nor the people I represent.  We will give you all the information possible.  There is no point in creating a situation whereby the people doing the job on behalf of the State, in detecting, first of all, the breaking of customs law in bringing in illegal goods and prohibited goods into our country, will be put on the same level as those perpetrating or committing the crime.  I want to assure the House that there is nothing to complain about and I will do my utmost to answer all the questions that have been raised.</P>

      <P>Everybody who spoke on the Second Stage of this Bill expressed support for the measures contained in it.  Those of us on this side of the House who were charged with the examination in detail of every aspect of this legislation are merely doing the job that has been entrusted to them.  I, for one, make no apology to anybody for questioning the Minister, for pulling apart the legislation, for teasing out the various ramifications of it.  I do it in a spirit of goodwill and the maximum amount of co-operation, reserving to myself and to my party the right to suggest amendment or to oppose or to put forward better ideas.  I would ask the Minister to accept that what I say in this is done in a spirit of goodwill and that in no way do I wish to cast aspersions on the customs and excise people or in any way condone the importation of drugs.  I have made my views very clear and explicit on that.  I would just ask the Minister if we could examine this legislation in a calm, rational and considered manner and not feel that anybody in particular is taking sides on the issue.</P>

I would not consider that to be a fair suggestion to make to any Minister &mdash; that he should come clean.  I do not think that is right.  It did impugn the Minister and also the officials of his Department.  I just listened there and I did not like to hear it.

I asked, on that particular point, would the Minister come clean on that issue.  That is precisely the question that I asked.  I would also like to state for the record that I can say without fear of contradiction that I have spent more of my life fighting against drug smuggling and drug abuse than anybody in this House.

      <P>I now want to assure the House and the Members here that I have no difficulty in answering any of the questions with the information that I have got or that I will get if necessary.  There is no latent motive for this Bill before this House and anybody who suggests otherwise would be misleading the House.  I have a duty to reassure the House of the situation.  I am delighted to hear of Senator O'Toole's work in combating drugs and I am confident he will be further able to enlarge his contribution in that field as a result of the passing of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan asked where do the powers reside.  The powers reside basically in the 1977-84 Misuse of Drugs Acts. Many people have made major contributions with regard to the various powers being given to the Customs and <Col N="635" /> Excise.  Already, for the past 65 years one could say at this stage, since our State was founded, and indeed prior to that, the Customs and Excise people have had extensive powers.  We are operating on Customs and Excise law that is very old and that has stood the test of time, and it has been updated in various ways over the years.  This Bill is a co-ordination of many of the Acts, and amendments of parts of them, to ensure that the most modern law will be available to help the Customs and Excise officers to co-operate in the best interests of this State in doing their own job in co-operation with the Garda and in co-operation with international Customs and Excise throughout the world.</P>
    <P>As I say, there are extensive powers of search under the various Acts as they stand.  Any travellers can be searched without warrant.  Customs and Excise people have exercised this power with care and respect over the years and I am confident that they will continue to do so. Under the Customs Act of 1876 a person may require, prior to search, to be brought before a justice or a senior officer of the Customs and Excise who, on listening to and hearing the complaint being made by the Customs and Excise officer, can then determine whether or not there will be a search.  That is there under 1876 law, as far back as that.</P>
    <P>Taking it a step further people have talked about various methods of search. It is not proposed that there will be any type of strip searching.  It is proposed that there should be the normal type of search, the normal type of investigation, the normal type of frisking in order to prove that somebody is carrying contraband or otherwise or to allay suspicion or confirm the exact position.  A female will be searched by a female officer; a male will be searched by a male officer. That is standard practice in Customs and Excise operations and that will continue. There will be no need for doctors as there are no proposals to examine the orifices of the body.</P>
    <P>We considered the position regarding <Col N="636" /> X-rays and the Minister for Finance confirmed, and I want to reaffirm to the House, that there is no danger of that being done.  That, in itself, would be medically dangerous and we are not going down that road.  Senator O'Toole mentioned that we have 52 airstrips as well as a sea boundary and a land frontier.  I agree completely that the laws of the land should prevail right across the land and, once they are passed, they must operate in any part of the land.  There is no doubt that the Customs and Excise officers are assigned to do a job in particular places, but in co-operation with the Garda. When the law is passed they also have to operate in a particular place at any particular time, based on the information available, based on communication from the Garda Síochána or the Revenue Commissioners <i>vis-á-vis</i> a certain thing happening at a certain time or being likely to happen in a certain place.  If it meant there had to be a re-allocation of resources in order to accommodate a particular situation, of course the law of the land would prevail and the Customs and Excise could be used.  This gives the State much more flexibility in our efforts to combat drugs.</P>
    <P>The Senator also questioned the difference between an airstrip and an airport and, as he said, there is no difference. Technically, they are both the same.  I think it was Senator Bulbulia who asked what we mean by &ldquo;in the vicinity of&rdquo;.  As far as we are concerned, the vicinity of an airport is the periphery of the airport, which would include a car park and all that area around it.  But commonsense must prevail.  If a Customs and Excise officer detected somebody leaving a car park at the airport, or leaving the airport without having been detected passing through, there would be nothing to stop him communicating with the Garda Síochána and co-operating with them.  If that same person pulled into the car park of an hotel in another part of the city, it would be a matter for the Garda and the Customs and Excise in co-operation to apprehend that person, communicate <Col N="637" /> with that person and investigate the situation. Commonsense will have to prevail and the law will have to be operated as the situation demands.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole mentioned also that my Department have proposals for and have under consideration the EMIT test. We have, indeed, and we have ordered a machine to make it as easy as possible to detect in a clinical way a urinal situation which would decide positively or negatively whether there were any chemical or drug particles on a person.  That would confirm the exact position.  We are proceeding down that road and hope to have that in operation soon.</P>
    <P>I have to compliment Senator Doyle. He was a member of the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism and many of the recommendations of that committee are contained in the Bill.  He raised a number of points about the period of detention. I think Senator Bulbulia also raised that point.  The period of detention is &ldquo;for ás long as is necessary&rdquo;.  We expect that to be interpreted in a commonsense fashion, for 15 minutes, half-an-hour, one hour, two hours, three hours.  Flexibility has to be given to the officers, whether it be the officers on the spot, the senior officers, or whoever decided at any given time that it was necessary to detain people for a particular period.  The customs people make up their minds fairly quickly and only detain people for as long as is necessary. While I am not an intelligence officer, or anything like that, we all know that if people are detained for a certain period of time and they are carrying certain substances, objects, commodities, drugs, or whatever, they will eventually decide to either admit they are carrying such a thing, admit they have knowledge of it or, in some cases they drop the objects they have, if they get the opportunity and move away.</P>
    <P>That has happened and we are confident that, taking the human reaction into account, taking the ability of the Customs and Excise officers into account and their record, taking the fact that they will be retrained, updated, and that all information will be available to them, <Col N="638" /> this provision will be operated in a very vigilant, careful, honourable and human fashion.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle also raised a point regarding the necessity to provide facilities for proper examination of lorries and whether or not this would be provided under the same subhead.  It would not be possible to provide it under the subhead because it would be a matter for my own Department, the Office of Public Works, but we have an ongoing programme of updating all Customs and Excise posts. There is a priority rating whereby those with most traffic are upgraded and updated with the most modern facilities, particularly on the land frontier, and that programme will continue.  I am confident that the necessary facilities and resources will be constantly maintained.  As Members of the Oireachtas we would be failing in our duty if we were not vigilant in ensuring that those resources will be made available to the Customs and Excise people.</P>
    <P>I want to cover all the points.  If there is any point I did not cover I will be only too delighted to answer it.  Senator Mooney made a very important point. I would like to compliment him on his attitude because we must recognise the key role the Customs and Excise people play.  I am delighted to see he has a connection with an international Customs and Excise group, because we have experienced in this country the most wonderful co-operation with the other international services.  I am confident that will continue, particularly within the community, and that we will all be able to cooperate in reducing the terrible difficulties created by the misuse of drugs and the illegal importation of drugs.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to ensure that this country will not be the victim of those problems, that we will not be used as a base for redistribution, or be a victim of surplus drugs or other objects in any other country that could allow criminals to take them through our frontiers, airports, seaports or whatever and destroy the whole fabric of the society of this island.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed to hear some of the points made by the Minister, I feel quite englightened by many of the points he made.  He has certainly interpreted the Bill in a different way from the way I had been looking at it.  One thing he did not make clear in his reply &mdash; and he might come back on it &mdash; is the question of the use or application of urine testing.  Under this legislation, can a detained person be required to give a urine sample?  If that is not the case, how can we use the new system?  That was my only point in raising it.  My view is that if we are going to use the EMIT system of testing, which has proven to be so successful in other countries, we need an explanation of how we can use it under this legislation.</P>
      <P>I would go much further in terms of the powers given in this Bill then the Minister.  He mentioned hotel car parks. That is the classic case.  There have been more &ldquo;busts&rdquo; in hotel car parks than anywhere else in this area.  It has always been the case that under the 1984 legislation the customs officers had to call in the Garda and, therefore, there was always a danger of a gap &mdash; of losing the suspects during that period of time.  I actually thought that under this legislation Dublin would be seen as &ldquo;in the vicinity&rdquo; of Dublin Airport.  I was worrying about whether we were going out too far.  The car park of the airport is a great problem for customs officers because until now, once the travellers got to the car park they were free of the customs authorities. The authorities were always worried about meeters and greeters getting into the car park with stuff.  I think they should be slightly more extended than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the question of co-operation between the European international customs agencies and authorities. That is quite a new thing.  It is only six months old; only six months ago the customs authorities in Europe have come up with this.  I am certain of this.  It is in a Council of Europe report which I will produce if somebody doubts my word on it.  It is something that has come up only in the last six months because until <Col N="640" /> then there were many customs authorities in countries who had bipartisan or two-way agreements with each other, where country A could give information to country B but where country A could not give information to country D.  There was not an overall agreement between customs authorities.  The European Parliament's report of last year recommended that the customs authorities around the whole of the EC &mdash; I do not accept Senator Mooney's words that we are on the periphery of the EC, I think we are part of it and that is it.</P>
    <P>The position is that information can now be made available.  The importance of this is that, if the customs officers get, for instance, information of drugs passing through, coming into Dublin Airport, they know that there is somebody carrying this in a car, but what they are trying to do is to get at the heads behind the operation.  They do not want to just lift the person with the couple of kilos of heroin, they want to know who is in charge of it.  What they want to do is to follow the passage of that person through the State or from port to airport or from port to port or whatever.  What I am worried about in this legislation is this.  It would appear, under this legislation, that as soon as the person reached the airport car park or beyond it the customs authorities would have to wait for the Garda to come in.  That is all right if there has been a pre-arrangement, but I want to be assured that that does not cause a problem of letting these people get away as it has done in the past.</P>
    <P>The Minister said this is co-ordinating legislation.  I accept it is co-ordinating legislation, but it does not clear up the mess.  The fact is that every charge sheet under section 2 would have to have the 1876 Act, the 1956 Act, the 1977 Act, the 1984 Act and now the 1987 Act included in it.  There have been cases in the Dublin area where judges have said they are not able to follow this list of charges and have asked for them to be thrown out and be taken in under the 1984 Act, which is the simplest one for the application of the law as it stands at present.  I have called for and would call <Col N="641" /> for all this to be taken under one piece of legislation; however, I know that point is slightly away from section 2 so I will not develop it.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister tell me how the urine testing operation can be conducted if under this legislation the person is not required to give a sample?  I am asking that under this legislation they should be required to give a sample.</P>
    <P>I also want to know how the operation of following suspects through the State can be carried out, how they are traced through it.  I am a member of the anti-strip searching group in Dublin at present but I believe that this is one case where, if customs officers have information that somebody is carrying in a body cavity, either as a stuffer or a swallower, suspects have to be searched.  I can assure the Minister there are people a mile and a half away from here who are living in bits because these people are walking through customs quite regularly and have got away with the ill-gotten gain many times because of the frustration of our customs service who have not been able to deal with known carriers, who have walked free.  I feel we have a responsibility here to tighten up in this area.</P>
    <P>I began my contribution talking about checks and balances.  I want the checks and balances, but I also want powers; and I think I have proved my point now.  The legislation needs more extensive application and it also needs more certain checks and authorities.  I would ask the Minister to come back to me on those points, about what happens if they are carrying something in their body and the suspect needs to be strip-searched, how the EMIT test can work if the person is not required to give a urine sample and should they not be required to do so under this legislation.  Similarly, there is the question of the extended authority.  I would ask the Minister to interpret again for me what he means by &ldquo;at or in the vicinity of an airport&rdquo;, which is in the first part of section 2.  Perhaps he would clear up those points.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole has made some of the points which I wish to <Col N="642" /> make and I will not go over the same ground.  My reaction to the Minister's reply was one of total surprise.  I would have a much more hard-line attitude on this.  I thought his response surprising. The little bit of research I have done in this area from general reading and a close examination of the report of the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism has made it clear to me at least that many people smuggling drugs inject them.  They are called swallowers or stuffers. By definition &mdash; and this is indelicate but it has to be said &mdash; the matter that has been swallowed or ingested has got to pass out through the system and no reference has been made in anything we said to defecation.  We have concentrated on urine samples.  I would like the Minister to tell me how this aspect is going to be dealt with if, as he says, there is no strip searching, no definite period of detention which would specifically allow for the elimination through the body of what was ingested.  I see a fundamental weakness in the Bill of an unwillingness to face up to one of the prime modes of carrying or importing drugs into the country and I do not understand it.</P>
      <P>The period of detention is, it appears, given the Minister's response, an area of discretion for the customs officer.  The interesting thing is that detention has been built into the British legislation but in a far more specific manner.  There, detention is allowed up to 36 hours and has to be renewed every six hours. Biology was not my strong point but I imagine there is a limit of time for an injested substance to pass through the body and come out the other end.  I am disappointed that that is not tied down in this legislation, given that the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism has indicated that this is one of the prime ways in which drugs are imported into the country.  Why do we have such looseness and such a lack of tightening up of these measures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister again if there would be regulations accompanying this piece of legislation or a statutory instrument or something which would <Col N="643" /> give a specific indication of how this legislation was to be implemented.  I am interested to hear that the vicinity of any port or airport is to be largely &ldquo;a matter of commonsense,&rdquo; which is the phrase the Minister used in reply to my query on this.  Of course I see that commonsense has to be part and parcel of any piece of legislation but I would have thought that it was necessary to be a little bit more specific in the legislation as to what the vicinity of any port or airport is. It is interesting that since we debated this Bill on Second Stage there has been a drug event in south-west Cork.  Senator Vivian O'Callaghan made references on Second Stage to the number of ports and he was almost clairvoyant in his comments, I am not sure if he was the Senator who spoke but a Senator from the Cork region &mdash; Senator Tom Fitzgerald &mdash; spoke about the many ports and inlets etc., we had and the ease of access to them and the yachts and the various incursions that could be made.  We had a ghastly example of what can happen.  Of course, the security forces and the Customs and Excise people rallied, but to my knowledge the find has not quite been made yet and that must be very worrying.  We want to guard against that type of importation of drugs that we are debating in this legislation.  I ask the Minister to comment on why there is an absence of body search.  What does he have to say about the elimination of ingested matter, the lack of a precise definition of the time span during which somebody can be detained, particularly in view of the British legislation on this matter?  Does he wish to consider accompanying regulations or a statutory instrument in relation to this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear that the legislation before us covers the meeters and greeters problem and extends the power of prison officers in that area.  A second recommendation was made by the select committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism in relation to people who swallow drugs.  So far as I know there are only two pieces of legislation under which <Col N="644" /> people can be strip searched: the Misuse of Drugs Act and the Offences Against the State Act.  That second recommendation ought to have been incorporated in this legislation.  That is why we asked so many questions earlier on. What is the position of a customs officer if a person who is passing through the customs section of Dublin Airport elects to go through the green area and when asked to stop takes something out of his pocket, puts it into his month and swallows it?  The customs officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that this person has put something into his mouth and swallowed it because he does not want it to be detected.  Are the Garda called to carry out the necessary search in situations like this, or is there some constitutional reason why we cannot give this power to the customs officers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to start an unnecessary row but it appears that what we have is an unhappy compromise where, because apparently nobody on the Government side wanted to think this through and build in the sort of safeguards that are built into the use of powers of search and in particular, detention by the Garda, we get a power of search which is circumscribed in such a way that it does not amount to a real search in the sense of what is needed to deal with the importation of drugs. According to what the Minister has said it would be a change in the powers of customs officers to allow body searches to be carried out by officers of the Customs and Excise.  It is obviously a most distasteful and unpleasant task.  It is also a most regrettable task but it is also, unfortunately, a very necessary requirement. It is the sort of delicate, sensitive, necessary requirement that can only be built into legislation that is properly balanced between the rights and necessities of protecting people from the horrors of drug abuse and the rights of the individual citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation &mdash; and indeed all the legislation in relation to the powers of the officers of Customs and Excise &mdash; does <Col N="645" /> not contain the balance of an independent complaints procedure and regulations about how people are to be looked after in custody which exist in the areas where the Garda have such powers. Because of that it appears that the necessary powers are being circumscribed.</P>
    <P>It would have been much better for the Minister and the Government to sit down and work out precisely what was needed and, having recognised that what was needed was fairly extreme, to build in precise and detailed safeguards to ensure that what was needed could be done in a fair and a balanced way.  The suggestion that searches or, as the Minister described it frisking people, will result in the detection of significant or large scale attempts to import drugs defies belief. What does a Customs and Excise officer do in the precise case Senator Doyle described?  I am very interested to hear the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Those were some very interesting comments and questions. First I want to clarify the position as regards the powers of search which the customs officers have at present.</P>
      <P>Customs officers may search without warrant any person who has entered the State by land, sea or air, the 1881, 1964 and 1968 Acts; any person suspected of an offence in relation to the exportation of goods, 1942 Act; and aircraft and ships, 1976 Act and 1964 regulations. They may search vehicles within 20 miles of the land frontier.  I want to confirm for Senator Bulbulia that there is a 20 mile zone at the Border and if customs officers are suspicious of anything there they may search <i>ad lib.</i>  They may search vehicles anywhere else in the State upon reasonable suspicion or probable cause.  Customs officers may search under warrant any house, shop, cellar, warehouse or other place under sections 204 and 205 of the 1876 Act.  They already have these powers to search travellers and people coming through customs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main thrust of this Bill, as some people have stated, is to have these powers conferred on the Customs and Excise officers so that they can deal with <Col N="646" /> meeters and greeters at places of communication, airports, seaports, land frontiers or wherever.  The general effect of section 2 is to confer officers of Customs and Excise powers similar to those already conferred on members of the Garda Síochána under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984.  These are to retain and search, without warrant, but with reasonable cause where suspicion exists, persons, vehicles, vessels or aircraft for the purposes of detecting drug smuggling at or in the vicinity of points of entry and exits from the State, including the land frontier.</P>
    <P>Every member of the Customs and Excise service engaged in the examination of passengers and goods at entry points to the country is regarded as forming part of a first line of defence against the illegal importation or exportation of drugs.  When that first line of defence is breached, subsequent action within the State is primarily a Garda matter, with customs officers providing any assistance and co-operation required.  In general the Garda are regarded as better equipped in terms of legal powers and resources to deal with the matter internally throughout the country.</P>
    <P>A number of points were made by Senators.  The urine tests are totally voluntary. They would be offered by the customs officer to the greeter, or traveller. It is a matter for that person to decide whether or not to do a voluntary test.  Obviously if they refuse the test that is an indication that they are carrying some illegal object, drug or otherwise.  It is up to the customs officer to take the necessary action to ensure that the law is operated.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole talked about the very short lived co-operation of the international Customs and Excise services. We have found that, since the European Communities Act was passed in 1972, there has been very good co-operation, perhaps it is not very systematic but there is very good co-operation between&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;international agencies to detect people constantly smuggling drugs.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to a point which I think was raised by Senator Bulbulia.  If the customs people have been alerted by another agency, the Garda or otherwise, that a known stuffer or swallower is coming through the customs action is taken to ensure that no stone is left unturned and that every facet of the law is made available to the Garda Síochána and to the Customs and Excise officers. Senator O'Toole alluded to the fact that there are people only one and a half miles from this House who are in bits from the misuse of drugs.  I recognise that.  If hardened criminals who are known to be involved in peddling or carrying drugs come through customs the Garda Síochána are alerted.  They take over and operate the Misuse of Drugs Act and use whatever resources they need in order to prove that the person is carrying drugs.</P>
      <P>Senator Bulbulia also asked if we propose to bring forward regulations.  We do not propose to bring forward any regulations. Under the Misuse of Drugs Act and the Customs and Excise Acts there are clear guidelines set down for the Garda or the Customs and Excise officers.  In this case it will be the Revenue Commissioners who will draw up clear guidelines which Customs and Excise officers will have to work to.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole and Senator Doyle expressed the view that they want the law to be strong enough so that there are no loopholes to allow people get through the net.  We have to balance that against the situation whereby we cannot violate the personal integrity or the privacy of the person.  If a Customs and Excise officer feels that people coming through, a meeter or greeter, a traveller or otherwise, has receipts or is carrying drugs on their person, if necessary the investigation would include a request to that person to remove all of their garments and, in particular, their outer garments. At no time is it contemplated that Customs and Excise officers would investigate the orifices of the body.  That is the limit we would go to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="648" /> Senator Ryan stated that the Government side of the House had not thought this Bill out and that the powers we were conferring were insufficient.  This Bill has been long thought out.  We have had expert advice.  The top officers in Customs and Excise, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance have been working on this Bill with the Minister and we are satisfied that the powers we are conferring on Customs and Excise officers are the ones already conferred on the Garda.  These powers have proved very satisfactory and we are confident that they will be a major deterrent in combating drugs coming into the country.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle made the point about a person coming in to an airport or seaport and passing through the green area.  Firstly, once people pass through a green area they automatically declare that the goods they have are legal and that the dues thereon are properly discharged.  If one is detected as having something one should not have one has automatically committed a crime by going through the green area.  That would be crime number one.</P>
    <P>Secondly, if a person swallowed something and tried to create a situation whereby it would be almost impossible for the Customs and Excise officer to proceed to prove something, then the Garda would be called.  They would take over and under the Misuse of Drugs Act they would proceed to examine, prove, prosecute and so on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Minister for a very full reply to the questions that were asked.  However, I am very unhappy because I believe there are loopholes in this legislation.  I understand that urine testing is voluntary, but I am astonished that the Minister is allowing it to be voluntary.  The Minister said he understands the problems of people.  I meet people every day who are looking at used needles, all sorts of excretions, urine and vomit from young kids who are being destroyed by drugs being brought into the country by these vandals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate what the Bill is trying to <Col N="649" /> do, and I agree with it; but we have almost reversed roles since the start of the discussion.  I was talking about the need for checks and balances but I now believe we are not giving enough powers to the Customs and Excise people.  I know this is not the most tasteful conversation to be having around tea time but we must be pragmatic about it.  If somebody walks through the customs area with a package of heroin stuffed up their back passage a urine test will not identify that.  A Customs and Excise officer does not have the authority to do a close internal body search of the person in terms of investigating body cavities to find the drugs. A person could voluntarily give a urine sample which would not identify him or her as carrying anything and in that sense they can clear themselves.  If there is a reasonable suspicion, by virtue of information supplied or whatever, that somebody is carrying drugs, then the person should be subjected to a test.  It is unfair on the people of this country who are suffering at the hands of these criminals that we are now about to enact legislation which will allow drug carriers to escape the net.</P>
    <P>The Minister can stand up and say that the Garda can be informed and the case can be taken a bit further by them.  I know that, but why should they be allowed out of the net?  We can give them the authority at the first line of defence or the first line of attack &mdash; the words we use depend on the perspective &mdash; to carry out a test if it becomes necessary.  The Minister will understand that I am not saying that this should be abused.  I would want built-in safeguards with regard to the use of these tests.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not explained to me why a detained person may not be required to submit to a medical examination or to give a urine sample and how this benefits the person who is suffering at the end of the line.  If we do not do that, the Bill will be full of loopholes; and I cannot see how it is going to meet the objectives as outlined by the Minister in his speech on Second Stage.  We are now creating further loopholes.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I am not clear <Col N="650" /> about in this area in terms of the powers of the Garda.  Is it right to say that under the 1984 Act that the Garda do have body search powers?  Could the Minister clarify the position on that, because I am not clear what the Garda can do when they become involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very pleased to hear the Minister say that there would be specific guidelines.  That takes care of my question in relation to regulations, a statutory instrument, or the spelling out of the way in which this would be implemented on the ground.  I see that the legislation clearly meets the situation of meeters and greeters but I am concerned that it does not meet the clearly outlined situation from the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism, and recognised by the Minister, of the swallowers and stuffers.</P>
      <P>We have heard lengthly explanations about urine testing and detention but the Bill seems to overlook one of the prime ways in which drugs are imported.  It may be that the Misuse of Drugs Act will take care of this when the Garda come into the picture.  I am not clear about that. Is that what the Minister is saying?  I understand that there is a power of search contained in that legislation but I do not understand why we are giving such limited powers to the Customs and Excise people when we know what the problem is and when we know that there is an appalling blight in the inner city of Dublin, and emerging in other major cities in our country, as a consequence of the importation of illegal drugs.  I cannot understand why there is not a total and complete sharp crack down on every facet which allows people to import this menace into our country.  I am not happy about it.  I never thought that I would be standing in a House of the Oireachtas advocating body searches.  If we know that the prime way of bringing in illegal drugs is by way of ingestion or stuffing, then why are we not taking clear and unequivocal steps in our legislation to meet this problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not happy with the Minister's response.  He talked about known stuffers <Col N="651" /> and swallowers and said that they would be dealt with within the powers of discretion and legislation given to the Customs and Excise people.  However, there will be other people who will not be known or who will not emerge as a consequence of a tip-off from the international network, which the Minister has alluded to, but where the instincts of a particular customs officer will indicate to him that perhaps somebody should be apprehended. I would like the Minister to give reassurances and tell me why he feels that this section of the legislation meets the problem which we know to exist and which the select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism pointed out to us in their very full and complete report.</P>

      <P>I want to say that 99.9 per cent of all people coming through customs posts create no difficulty for the people of the country or the Customs and Excise officers.  It would be our considered opinion, from the records of the Garda and the records of the Customs and Excise people who have dealt with drugs over the years, that a minimum percentage of drugs are brought through by swallowers and stuffers.  We are virtually certain of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Senator was out of the House when Senator Bulbulia alluded to a recent case.  A large volume of drugs are brought into the country by various means, but the proportion being carried by swallowers and stuffers, as far as our knowledge goes, <Col N="652" /> would be smaller than that coming in in any other way.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole, Senator Bulbulia and Senator Doyle stated that the powers in the Bill are not sufficient to deal with this situation.  Firstly, we know the rights Customs and Excise officers have.  Secondly, if they have any suspicions, they can detain people for questioning and otherwise.  If swallowers and stuffers are carrying drugs, they recognise and realise that if they are detained for a certain period it would be detrimental to their physical condition.  They will admit this, which they have done, and allow the Customs and Excise officers and the Garda to enforce the law.  We know that on many occasions prior information is given by the Garda and other Customs and Excise people that these swallowers and stuffers are on their way into the country. Of course, the Customs and Excise officers are vigilant.  Apart from their own perception or suspicion of any given situation, or if they are acting on a tip-off &mdash; and they would often be in that situation &mdash; they would, of course, have gardaí on stand-by to ensure that persons are examined thoroughly under the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, and that they are brought to justice.</P>
      <P>As a State, and in law, we must balance the rights of the individual <i>vis-á-vis</i> the needs of the community.  There is constitutional protection for the citizen and we must balance that <i>vis-á-vis</i> the powers we transfer and the needs of the community. The powers conferred on the Garda heretofore have had a large measure of success and we are confident that giving these extra powers now to Customs and Excise officers will reduce still further the opportunity and the options available to people who want to bring in drugs.</P>

      <P>Presumably it was not <Col N="653" /> in a big block and that it was various chunks.  It is the sort of substance that could not be the subject of ingestion or insertion.  What we are talking about in relation to that method of importation of drugs is, I suspect, heroin and cocaine, minute quantities of which can cause mayhem and the destruction of people and communities.  This situation already obtains in our capital city and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The Minister said, and Senator O'Toole argued the point, that a minimum percentage of drugs is brought in by swallowers and stuffers.  I could not accept that lightly because the percentage, although small, can do untold damage.  Despite all that the Minister has said, there is a fundamental weakness in this area of the Bill which is not being addressed.  For that reason I am not happy about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am most unhappy.  I would say to the Minister that in all honesty we are not doing people a service by letting this section through.  I agree that it improves the powers of the Customs and Excise officers and that it will have a certain positive effect.  However, we are legislating a loophole here.  On my point of information, I was obviously referring to hard drugs.  The Garda authorities have stated that most of the hard drugs are now coming in by suffers and swallowers. That is their stated public position, unless it has changed in the last week.</P>
      <P>Why are we letting this section go through without giving the powers which can deal with this?  Why are we not saying that, if we have suspicions about somebody, they should be subject to a close internal body search or other tests which they would be required to co-operate with?  Will the Minister tell me why we are not doing this?</P>
      <P>I accept his point that we must find the balance between civil rights and civil liberty and the common good.  I will re-emphasise my agreement with the Minister on this point.  But what good is that doing us if these people are walking free? They are walking free.  There are people who have made their money in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="654" /> A prisoner who is in Mountjoy Jail at present will be out in five year's time.  He has £750,000 stashed in the banks and everybody knows that this is money from drugs which came in in people's bodies.</P>
    <P>What the Minister said about people who have drugs inside their bodies is not true, and I do not believe that he believes it himself because he knows the way it works.  There is a conflict in what the Minister said in regard to this.  In his earlier presentation he said that he was talking about a period of 15 or 20 minutes, or perhaps an hour.  The Minister might clarify this.  I can assure the Minister that these people will stay in custody until the stuff bursts inside them and they die, because they do not do this kind of thing of their own volition; they do it because they are under pressure. Perhaps their family members are being blackmailed, kidnapped or whatever in some other state.  Many of these people are not doing this voluntarily.  However, others are doing it to feed their habit, and this is just as much a driving force and motivation.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to recognise that, while we support what he is saying as far as it goes, all we are asking is that he takes on board what we have just said and perhaps come back on Report Stage to see how we can deal with these points.</P>

The Minister must realise how serious this problem is, when the two Senators who are making this case are Senators who normally are very conscious of the rights of people.  They would be the last people in the world who would be looking for additional powers to search people or go through areas of privacy which none of us would condone in the normal course of events.  Everybody in this House has an obligation to ensure that the importation of drugs by this method is stopped.  On Second Stage, the Minister, Deputy MacSharry outlined the improvements that had taken place.  We admitted that the improvement as outlined by him was an indication of the failure of Customs and Excise to <Col N="655" /> come to grips with the problem simply because they did not have the legislative power to deal with it.  Senators are suggesting that that power should be strengthened in some way to ensure that the smart alecs are not able to get past the first line of defence.  We ask the Minister between now and Report Stage to consider this point seriously, particularly in the light of the Senators' contributions. The Minister should realise they are not lightly suggesting additional powers in this area.</P>
      <P>This brings me to my final point.  If we extend all these powers to the customs officers will they be subjected to the same critical analysis as members of the Garda Síochána?  In other words, the Garda have to submit themselves to a Garda Complaints Board.  Will the members of the Customs and Excise now also be expected to do the same to protect the rights of ordinary people?</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I was caught unawares.  Now I have done a little more research into the actual motion.  I hope the House does not mind if I give a few examples of how the proposed Estimates will affect my county.  I know that the roads and infrastructure are the bane of many county councillors and local authorities.  I will quote from a report by Leitrim County Council:</P>
      <P>The maintenance of the county roads system is a problem and expensive compared to other parts of the country, because of, <i>inter alia,</i> low population density and associated high route mileage per head of population. The network provision on a <i>per capita</i> basis is double the national average.</P>
      <P>The rural nature of the county, combined with its low population density gives roads a particular significance as the only means of transport over a wide area.  The people of the county are heavily dependent on road transport.</P>
      <P>The estimated cost at January 1987, of bringing county roads up to a satisfactory standard is of the order of £17 million and for regional roads in the county of the order of £3.75 million. Thereafter, the council would need an ongoing annual budget to keep county roads up to a satisfactory standard of approximately £3.5 million and a similar allocation of £840,000 for regional roads based on present costs.</P>
      <P>The grant in respect of road works and related services has been cut by 10 per cent in the estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we need £17 million to bring the roads up to standard in a small county like Leitrim, what will it cost on a national basis?  Cutting the grant by 10 per cent is very hard on local authority members, local authority workers and, above all, on people in rural areas who depend on roads for transport.  It is a sad state of affairs that roads are beginning to <Col N="658" /> become impassable and we will be back to the dark ages when the only thing that could get past was an ass and cart.</P>
    <P>In county Leitrim in 1971 approximately 4,500 houses or 55 per cent were without piped water.  While this was reduced to 22 per cent in 1987 the national figure is of the order of 5.5 per cent.  The low density and dispersed distribution of population affect significantly the cost of providing water supply.  From the figures in the Estimates there is no way that we in Leitrim can hope to provide a proper water supply or even reach the national average of 5.5 per cent without piped water.  I find this totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The number of houses in County Leitrim classed as unsuitable and beyond economic repair is 15 per cent of our housing stock.  This is well in excess of the average throughout the country.  I made a brief point last week that many local authority houses were in need of repair.  If the Government decide not to provide money for building houses &mdash; we may not need as many new houses &mdash; the Minister should consider putting a great deal of money into the maintenance of the existing stock of houses and bringing them up to an acceptable standard.  As a local representative I find that many people want specific work carried out to their houses and there is just no money to do it.  The allocation in the Estimates has been cut drastically from £87 million to £50 million.  I do not know how local authorities will keep going if they have to take that type of cut.</P>
    <P>Grants to local authorities in relief of rates have been cut by 12 per cent.  For example, in Leitrim we have 750 ratepayers, so we rely largely on the rate support grant.  Over the past number of years services have been diminishing.  But I feel that if these Estimates go ahead, it will be the final nail in the coffin of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>I have a great bone of contention with the Minister's party.  I do not want to bring politics into it very much.  My first experience of elections was in 1985, and I had a difficult time convincing people that the charges had to be accepted if we <Col N="659" /> were to provide services.  Fianna Fáil, in their strategy, decided to campaign that there should be no service charges.  In hindsight I believe they did irreparable damage, because they told people they should not pay their water or refuse collection charges.  As a result local authorities find it very difficult to collect these charges.  A property tax is now being talked about.  However, I think people have got into bad habits.  If they were not prepared to pay a small sum for such things as water charges, I would hate to see anybody going out trying to collect a property tax.</P>
    <P>Local authorities, in my opinion, do not receive proper funding.  Many local councillors at this stage are finding it increasingly frustrating to be part of a local authority.  It would remind you of breaking into some place where the guard dog had no teeth.  Local authorities will become talking shops if they do not get proper funding.  It is a terrible tragedy that local authorities should be dealt with in this way, because they have been the backbone of both political and social life for the past 60 years.  I would ask the Minister not to take away whatever powers they have left, but to give them proper funding so that they can carry out their functions in a proper manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the House for the opportunity of speaking on this motion put down by the Opposition. I suppose one can say that the rot in local government has been going on for many years.  I feel, as others feel, that local authorities should get more powers from central government to run their own house.  You cannot run your house without a certain amount of finance.  I think a whole restructuring of local authorities is needed to make them self-financing. Major schemes could be assisted from central government, and interrelated schemes could be assisted by neighbouring counties.  One would have to look in depth at the overall picture of local authorities at present, and ask if they are giving a good return for the moneys they are receiving?  One would <Col N="660" /> have to question that in many fields. When I was elected to Kerry County Council in 1979 we had a waiting list of 1,500 people for local authority housing. At that time we discovered that there was a similar situation all over the country. At present in county Kerry there are about 100 people on the waiting list.  Tenants who apply for local authority housing seem to be able to get houses now within a matter of months.  One would have to question whether this is the proper approach and whether we are getting a return for our money from that sector, because in the Book of Estimates this year about £63 million was paid out for repairs and maintenance of local authority housing while about £40 million was brought back in revenue from rents received in respect of local authority housing.  This is only one avenue that needs to be investigated.</P>
      <P>I feel the time is ripe for the introduction of a new purchase scheme so that we can give back some bit of dignity to those people to purchase their own local authority housing.  We have a record that speaks for itself; people get local authority houses for anything from £2 up to £10 per week, while the State subsidy is something in the region of £110 a week per house.  I feel a move should be made immediately to give the tenants of those houses an opportunity to purchase them, because under the present system they would never own their own houses.  I think if the proper scheme were introduced they would take up the option almost immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would have to look at other aspects of local authorities.  The condition of the county roads bothers us.  In the overall context of the roads programme we should ask again whether we are getting value for money.  I feel that many smaller schemes &mdash; for example, bin removals and ordinary maintenance of roads etc. &mdash; should be put out on contract. At present if the scavenging service breaks down 50 miles from the depot, the driver of that truck has to get back to his depot rather than perhaps getting the repairs done at a local garage.  The whole <Col N="661" /> restructuring of local government will have to be looked at in depth.</P>
    <P>When I was chairman of the General Council of County Councils I had the honour of dealing with three Ministers &mdash; Deputy Kavanagh, Deputy Boland and Deputy Flynn.  I think there was a consensus at the time that the only way forward for local authorities was power, the reform of local government.  I had the assurances over the years from all three Ministers, particularly in the past, that the reform of local government definitely would be forthcoming in 1988.  This could be a sign of hope for local authorities of achieving autonomy.  If local authorities are the people put into power, then they are the people who should bear the brunt for the way the county is run.  I do not think that the onus should be put back on central government.  All local authorities required new sewerage schemes, water schemes and sanitary services improvements etc.  Each county applied for these schemes, and more than likely overspent. I am not ashamed to say that we in County Kerry overspent, because the sanitary services and the water services were required.  I am glad we overspent, because at least we have the initial development on the ground for the people who want to develop further.</P>
    <P>At present the repayments on the loans we had to borrow in County Kerry are something in the region of £4 million.  If we did not have those repayments &mdash; and this goes back over a number of years &mdash; it would be very easy for us to put the extra finance back into our county roads. Local authorities would all want to look at the problem in depth in an effort to get out of the corner in which they find themselves.  We must ask whether we can continue to go on developing in our local authorities and at the same time downgrade the moneys available for county road systems?  The answer is that we definitely cannot, because all other local authority services have to be paid for before money can be spent on our county roads.</P>
    <P>The mileage of county roads varies from county to county.  We have 2,400 miles of county roads in Kerry, which is <Col N="662" /> an enormous mileage.  We do not have the number of rate payers other countries have.  Large counties have a greater number of ratepayers than smaller counties. If we are to grasp the nettle, if we are to make local authorities meaningful, a new system will have to be introduced. Some kind of direct financing will have to be devised on an equal basis for all the people and not have the burden falling on the business people who at the moment are carrying the can.  The 12 per cent of people who pay rates also pay water and other charges.  These people literally cannot afford to spend any more money.</P>
    <P>If there is to be any kind of reform there should be a shift somewhere along the line.  The burden should be divided on any equal basis with people paying some kind of property tax or some type of small taxation which people will be able to afford as soon as the economic crisis is over.  As I stated local authorities are mismanaged.  As public representatives we have not questioned the accounts, we have not questioned the book of estimates we get at local authority level or scrutinised them to see where we can make savings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>Parts of this country were far more developed than County Kerry and it took us a while to catch up.  There is a need for a different type of financing. Local authorities are facing a major crisis and it was not today or yesterday it happened, but there is a future if expenditure is cut.  Do we need all the architects and design people to design roads and new highways for which there is no demand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="663" /> These people should be redeployed in other services.  Should we dispose of some of these engineers who are sitting in offices drawing big salaries without being productive?  If there is to be pruning we will have to start looking into the cupboard and getting rid of the cobwebs. People have cushy jobs.  I see engineers looking through their little tripods on all the roads of Ireland and designing highways. You would think we were going to have 707s coming down the highways in the future.  I have travelled the length and breadth of most of the world and can tell you a funny thing.</P>
    <P>People in other countries, design roads to suit the environment.  They build cars to suit their own environment.  In a scenic area of countries like Italy, Spain or France, there is no such thing as removing the side of the mountain to make the road wider.  They kept their environment intact and have brought in smaller cars to travel on those roads.  We should congratulate those people and take a leaf out of their book.  I agree with the primary route systems in operation in this country. I see the need for getting goods moved from A to B.  There is no need for vast amounts of money to be spent on highways in rural areas provided the roads are maintained and have a good surface.  I am not denying the fact that there are plenty of potholes in my county at present but there were plenty of potholes there last year and the year before and it was not today or yesterday that these potholes appeared.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have been hungry for money for the past four or five years and just because this Government have grasped the nettle everyone is crying and shouting and roaring.  Previous Governments had let the economy run wild, and somebody had to call a halt.  Fair enough, this Government have called a halt.  We all have to halt.  We all admit that we had to call a halt as something had to be done. The Estimates will be discussed in every local authority over the next couple of weeks.  We have to go through them as ordinary citizens elected by the people. Do they want us to make a political issue <Col N="664" /> out of the crisis?  Do they want more local authority houses built at a cost of £110 subsidy per week from the taxpayers of this State when houses are abundant. They are cheaper by the dozen.  I fought very hard for housing schemes in my own village and I know at least two or three of those houses are vacant today.  We cannot even get tenants for them.  In many housing estimates, including in this city, local authority houses are boarded up.  They cannot get tenants for them.  We cannot continue building houses when we have no people to put into them.  We have to run our counties in an economic way and we have the opportunity to do it now for the first time in a long time. We have the estimates for each local authority brought forward for the first time months in advance.</P>
    <P>We can scrutinise our accounts and run our counties in a fair way.  I hope we can achieve that for the future of our people and for the future of our country because, as it is going at the moment, not alone are all the local authorities going down the tubes but the country is going down the tubes as well.  I am delighted something is being done to rectify that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try not to be negative. I am conscious of the fact that at the moment we have a housing surplus.  In 1979 and in 1981 we did not have a surplus. We implemented some schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We recognised that there were people in local authority accommodation who did not need to be there, and the £5,000 grant scheme proved that.  At this time we have a surplus of housing.  Schemes were implemented with £5,000 grants to local tenants plus £2,000 first time buyer grants and a £2,400 grant over a three year period.  They got £9,400 to leave accommodation and we got back houses to accommodate people who are less well off in our society.  I make no apologies for that.  There was a revolution in housing. With the elimination of these grants in a very short period people will be living in areas where I do not like to see them living in and, in particular, people who cannot afford to house themselves.  I resent that very much.  I hope that within <Col N="665" /> a short period we can say to people who are in accommodation that there is subsidisation for them.  Over a period of less than 14 months in my city we got back 750 houses and that proved it.  In the city of Dublin over 5,000 houses were handed back.  I do not make any apology for saying we were accommodating people.</P>
    <P>People were under the impression that they were entitled to get accommodation at a very small rent.  I hope that scheme was only deferred and can be implemented again, perhaps in another way, so that people who have improved their position over a period can accommodate themselves with some assistance.</P>
    <P>Other grants were eliminated and I resent that.  I particularly resent the fact that grants to the disabled were eliminated. This matter should be considered with a view to giving these people some small amount.  This is an area where people need some assistance and I ask the Minister to keep that in mind.</P>
    <P>The rates relief grant has been reduced by £20.5 million this year.  There has been an improvement in infrastructure in some local authority areas and it is now probably at a quite satisfactory level.  At no time can we say that we are at the same level in this regard as other European countries.  Why are we reducing the rates relief grant?</P>
    <P>Senator Reynolds referred briefly to local property charges.  I make no apology for saying that I envisage an increase in local charges.  Unfortunately, people in Opposition at the time they were introduced said they would not in any circumstances agree to local charges. Fianna Fáil gave the impression at that time that charges should not be paid.  I know Deputies who voted against those charges and said they should not be paid in any circumstances.  It was most unfair of them to give that impression.</P>
    <P>Cork Corporation should collect £1.6 million in local charges every year but they collect less than £700,000.  What exactly is happening?  The impression was given that a Fianna Fáil Government would not allow local charges.  They even said people should not pay them with the result that people were brought to court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="666" /> That is a very irresponsible attitude to take.  A short time later the Government reduced rates relief grants and other grants.  They told local authorities it was up to them to collect local charges and I have no objection to that.</P>
    <P>There are waiver forms for the less well off, of which I am very conscious.  If people are paying charges locally they must get the relief locally.  Central Government must suffer the consequences of charging such moneys.  For instance, the ratepayer &mdash; and I pay a lot of rates &mdash; who pays rates and local and domestic charges, should get tax relief on those charges.  If people pay local charges of £60, £70 or £100 they should get the appropriate tax relief.  That gives the incentive to pay the money.  People who do not pay will not get tax relief.  That would be a fair system and would show people that we are doing something locally to collect moneys.</P>
    <P>A man with three children earning £140 a week pays taxes and yet he is asked to pay another £100 in local charges on which he gets no tax relief.  That is most unfair.  At the same time the person next door may not pay the charges, or the farmer down the road may not have to pay at all.  Where is the credibility of any Government, irrespective of who is in power, in saying they recognise that some persons are paying too much and other people are not paying anything at all?  I resent that very much.  How many local charges are collected throughout the State?  I understand the figure is in the region of £8 million or £9 million, but I may be totally wrong.  It would be of benefit to the Government to give tax relief on local charges.</P>
    <P>In that way the local authorities, who have responsibility in this area, would succeed in collecting these charges and the Government would get the best out of local authorities councillors and people who vote for them.  The person paying locally for his services will recognise that he will get tax relief on that money.  I know this cannot be implemented immediately, but it certainly should be considered.  I see no reason it cannot be considered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="667" /> When are we going to recognise that some local authorities work better than others?  When are we going to recognise that some people do not spend their money in the right way?  Local authorities should have responsibility for spending money in the way they think is best for their areas.  I made representations to the Minister several times when he was in office previously for £50,000, £100,000 and even £200,000 for the local authority. We should not have to go to the Minister at national level for that money.  He should give a block grant to the local authorities.  Cork Corporation spend in the region of £22 million every year which we get from the State.  The block grant should be given to them to do what is best for that city, for Skibbereen or any other place in their area.  They should not have to go back to the Minister for more money.  By giving a block grant to local authorities they would be able to work better and would have the responsibility of having to work better.  That is what we are all trying to emphasise and I make no apologies for saying that.</P>
    <P>There have been reductions in rates relief grants, housing allocations, road allocations and so on.  There is no thinking behind those actions.  There is a need for improvements in particular areas.  I will not talk about Cork only.  Let us concentrate on the inner city of Dublin. Are we really saying it does not need improvements?  Are we saying it should not get priority?  Are we saying that the inner city of Cork should not get priority? Of course it should.  Which of the planning by successive Governments over the years was not needed?  There should be a revitalisation of inner city areas in particular and also in town areas.  I drive regularly through many towns late in the evening and they are dead.  There is no need for this.  We should give people an incentive to revitalise their towns with some help from central government or from local government.  This is an area where local authorities could supply money from block grant allocation to ensure that towns and cities are developed and revitalised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="668" /> There have been cutbacks in rate relief grants.  There have been cutbacks from £87 million this year to £50 million next year in housing.  The construction industry is in a bad state.  Promises were given to that industry but they were not fulfilled. I do not want to be political in saying this.  The Government said they would put £200 million into the construction industry but instead they took away the grants and will continue to take more.</P>
    <P>I am not saying there is need for many new starts but there is need for motivation and for incentive and that is what I would like to see.  Local authorities should be given the block grant which would give them the incentive to work better.  The Deputies and Senators within the different areas, can be the hawks of central government.  If some local authorities are not working properly they can report back to the relevant Minister. In that way we can be seen to be constructive.</P>
    <P>Grants have been eliminated, even in areas where people cannot provide for themselves, and I resent that very much. Fianna Fáil gave people the impression that they would not have to pay charges and for that reason, people voted for them.  Those people's sons and daughters will probably have to pay a lot more to private investors for accommodation because there is no housing available. That was totally irresponsible.  It was the Fianna Fáil people in 1985 who created that situation.  We are being most unfair to the people and we are not rationalising properly.  Local authority workers are saying to me at present: &ldquo;Maybe I would be better off taking the redundancy because in two years' time there might be no redundancy&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>These people are on £98 nett per week &mdash; and the Minister is aware of this because the same applies in his area.  If the Minister, as a man who represents the people, is saying that a <Col N="669" /> person on £98 per week should get redundancy that would be most unfair to that person and his family because he would get only £84 unemployment benefit.  He is working for £15 per week more than he would get in unemployment assistance and he is prepared to take redundancy. We are prepared to say to him that he should be laid off.  That, to me, is not logical thinking.  Perhaps the person on £20,000 a year or the people working in offices, architects and so on, could be made redundant.  But I am talking about the ordinary man on £98 per week, who can afford to buy only one or two pairs of shoes a year and whose children need things for school.  Yet we want to make him redundant.  If that is the way the Minister thinks, he does not have my support.  I see no reason why we should not rationalise in a proper way.  We should be responsible and sincere about it.  The removal of the grant from the disabled was equally as irresponsible, because these people cannot provide for themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion we are debating condemns the indiscriminate and unplanned cuts in local authority funding and calls on the Government to indicate in detail how they propose to finance, secure and maintain services and employment. Local authorities will, first of all, have to come to grips with this point: are they an employment agency or are they a business running on business lines?  If they are an employment agency then they will need more money in order to give more employment regardless of what the productivity would be.  I suggest that they should operate on the same lines as any well-run business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that, during the good years, no matter how much money local authorities received they were never satisfied, Indeed, whenever they asked officials why they were getting only up to 10 per cent of an increase on the previous year, they were told that there was not enough money.  This has always been the stock answer when something needs to be done.  During those years there was <Col N="670" /> much development and many administration staff and engineers were employed.  Today every county council in Ireland has only about 50 per cent of the road workers they had four or five years ago.  But is there any reduction in the administration staff or the engineers?  I know that is the case in my county and in my neighbouring counties.  We have to come to grips with the situation and see if we are efficient.</P>
    <P>In each local authority area there is an area engineer, a planning engineer and an assistant, a sewerage and water engineer, a housing engineer and a roads engineer, plus many other people right up the pyramid.  It is time we realised that one area engineer could look after all the services in that area; perhaps not the entire planning, but surely he should be able to do quite an amount of it.  A health inspector should not have to go out and examine for planning permission, look into a hole that the contractor has dug and tell you whether or not it is porous. That should be an engineer's job &mdash; to be able to tell you the quality of the soil for building purposes &mdash; rather than a health inspector's job.  We have built up a bureaucracy that is top heavy, but you are all afraid to grasp this nettle and to do anything about it.  We have to face reality.  Sometimes when engineers at local level agree on a road plan, officials from the Department come down from Dublin, rule them out of order sometimes and maybe rearrange the whole plan. Autonomy is needed in this area.  Big savings can be made in local government in general.</P>

      <P>Those are the areas in which we can make big savings.  It is time <Col N="671" /> we considered contract work.  When we start working on a road, for instance, we continue until the money runs out and then we stop.  If that road was let out on contract the job would have to be organised and would have to be done properly.  It would be worth considering contract work in the interests of economy, because the emphasis must be on value for money.  Everyone realises that we have come to a stage in this country where money is not available for such work.  That is the simple fact.  This Government are facing up to their responsibilities.  In fairness, all right thinking politicians in this House realise that there is a problem in this area.</P>

      <P>The problem is there.  We have not got the money.  The Government are facing up to their responsibilities and must continue with their present policies.  They deserve our support and congratulations for taking a mighty step forward.  They are getting our finances right.  Within two or three years we will be able to get back to that much-hackneyed word, planning.  We will be able to plan and, let us hope, we will plan more sensibly in the future.  Mar a deir an seanfhocal, bhíomar ag caitheamh as ciste an amadáin for far too long.  We have been spending out of a fool's purse for far too long.  We are spending what we have not got and the day of reckoning has come.  We have to realise now that we must cut back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme that was introduced to encourage local authority dwellers to buy their own houses was not a good one because it wrecked communities.  It encouraged the people with organising abilities &mdash; and, let us face it, we are not all blessed with the same abilities &mdash; to leave the local authority houses with the result that many good houses in cities and towns which cost a lot of money to build are now lying idle or are not used to the maximum.  We set out to build communities and while our intentions were good they resulted in syphoning off the <Col N="672" /> more ambitious and we still have not solved the problem.  Anybody living in those communities will tell you they are the poorer for it.</P>
    <P>Private houses can often be bought in the country for £10,000 or £12,000. Instead of providing one of those houses we decide to give a person a county council house or a specific instance cottage which costs a lot of money to build.  If a county council cottage was run down we would repair it so why not buy one of those houses from the private sector which would fill a housing need?  If we thought along that line we would make better use of the amenities and the properties in our areas for the betterment of all.</P>
    <P>Everybody wants to see this country progressing.  When we took it over it might have been poor but it was not in debt.  It has now run into debt and it is up to us to do something about it.  If everyone of us decided to give one week's work in the year to our country it would enhance and improve our finances.  That approach was adopted in Germany after the war and also in other countries.  It would be a real patriotic move.  We hear a lot about patriotism.  For far too long patriotism has been regarded as dying for your country.  We should regard it as working and living for our country and doing the best for it.  For far too long everybody has been saying: &ldquo;The country owes you a house, a job, a living, it owes you everything&rdquo;.  A country can do nothing for you.  It is the people of the country who must do things for themselves. In the present financial position we should all try to do our utmost to ensure that we get this country back on its feet so that our families will not be faced with these problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Haughey, in his contribution last week said he interpreted the motion as not condemning the cuts but that they were indiscriminate and unplanned.  He was quite right in his interpretation but the Opposition have not substantiated their allegation that they were indiscriminate and unplanned. I am not here to attack the Opposition's motivation in putting down this motion, that is not necessary.  I am happy to advocate the Government's position in relation to local authority funding.  When one realises that between current and capital expenditure local authorities will spend in excess of £1.6 billion in 1987, it has to be recognised that this area of expenditure constitutes a significant proportion of total public expenditure. There is also an important area of expenditure of relevance to the whole country and each part of it.  Local government activities impinge on nearly every service we utilise in our day to day lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Members of this House will realise, most of the local authority funding emanates from the Exchequer.  Taking 1987 as an example the Exchequer contribution to the current funding of local authorities is estimated to be £800 million in the form of grants, for the most part coming from my Department.  This represents in excess of 60 per cent of the day to day spending of local authorities.  Since 1983 the level of State grants to local authorities has increased by 33.33 per cent from £600 million in 1983 to £800 million in 1987.  Such a level of increase in State grants exceeds the rate of inflation for the period by a very substantial margin.  The reality is that the <Col N="674" /> source of this local authority funding, the Exchequer in this instance, has been getting deeper and deeper into debt in continuing to sustain such a high level of funding and it would be irresponsible of the Government not to recognise that basic truth.</P>
    <P>When the Government came into office just seven months ago we set about restoring order to the public finances, recognising that it was one of the essential factors for national recovery.  We felt, as did everybody, that there would have to be reductions in public expenditure and that, in order to arrest the tailspin of going deeper and deeper into debt, these reductions in public expenditure would have to be substantial.</P>
    <P>We have now published the Book of Estimates for 1988 indicating the amount the Oireachtas is being asked to provide for each Department of State.  It was not a rushed exercise and it is unfair to suggest in the motion that it was. Members of the Government spent considerable time during the summer period examining every area of public expenditure and we made our decisions.  Some of them were tough and harsh but we are absolutely convinced they were fair.  We are united that in the national interest we are adopting the correct and sensible course of action.  Any expenditure, retrenchment of savings that have been identified have been willingly handed up by every member of the Government in support of the basic effort to get the public finances back in order.</P>
    <P>The level of Exchequer funding of local authorities will be reduced in 1988.  I do not deny that, nor in any sense do I feel that I have to apologise for it.  The local authorities are not being singled out to bear the brunt of the burden; it is shared by every sector and rightly so.  I have been a member of a local authority for almost 21 years and I have a fairly good understanding of what local government is about.  I know local authorities are faced with many demands for the extension of new services and the improvement of existing services.  They would clearly desire to be in a position to provide the best and the most extensive services to <Col N="675" /> the people, whether in the provision of new houses, the provision of water and sewerage facilities, the provision of libraries, or the provision of local amenities. These services cost money and it is an inescapable fact that there is only so much money available to meet all the demands.</P>
    <P>My Department, as one of the big spenders of public money, have to take their share of the expenditure cuts.  We have to be practical and we have to cut our cloth to suit our measure.  The same applies to all public sector organisations, Departments, agencies and all areas where public finances are involved.  I am a realist and I acknowledge that local authorities will not have an easy time in 1988.  Difficult decisions will have to be made when they sit down to draw up their estimates for 1988.  I have laid my cards on the table.  Some time ago I told the local authorities the amount they will receive in rates support grants in 1988.  I took the initiative, long before the Book of Estimates was published, and told local authorities in good time their 1988 allocation. I also deliberately brought forward the prescribed period for the preparation of their estimates.</P>
    <P>There is the benefit to the local authorities of giving them information earlier, in that they have more time to consider how their budget for 1988 can be framed and adopted before the start of the next financial year to allow the collection of incomes to take place from the very start of the year.  I consider the practice in the past of having local authorities adopt estimates at a stage when up to a quarter, and sometimes even more, of the year had already elapsed to be totally unsatisfactory. It militated against the realisation of income projected for the year and it made expenditure control difficult when already a significant portion of the year had elapsed.  That practice had to be stopped.</P>
    <P>I would like it to be recognised by everybody that it was a deliberate measure taken by me to tell local authorities in advance how much they were getting and to give them time to sit down as <Col N="676" /> members of the authority with their finance officers, with their managers and among themselves to decide how best they could accommodate the services and the domestic services that they would have to provide from the money being made available to them.  I invite the House to examine the various amounts that have been provided in my Department's Estimates for 1988.  It will be seen that some of the provisions have in fact been increased.  This gives the lie to the impression being created that everything had been chopped in an unplanned way. That is not the case.  It will be seen that some of the provisions have been increased, notably the subsidy provision to assist in the servicing of capital debt. Other grants available for local authorities have been reduced by varying amounts.  This only serves to further rebut the criticism that these cutbacks are indiscriminate or unplanned.  I am pleased that those subsidy provisions have been maintained without change in 1988 since they relate to non-discretionary expenditure for the repayment of capital loans.</P>
    <P>I am pleased also that the House will soon have an opportunity of discussing legislative proposals, now being considered in the other House, to provide for the elimination of the system of capital loans, whereby my Department provide subsidies towards those loan repayments, and instead to introduce a simple system of capital grant financing of these programmes. This will lead to better financial management by eliminating wasteful circular transfers of funds between the Exchequer and local authorities.  I would like to think that all sides of this House would see the wisdom of that measure. I feel that you will also welcome these proposals in due course when they come before you.</P>
    <P>Another area of expenditure by local authorities &mdash; road works &mdash; is also of special consequence.  I know the particular interest that Senators, TDs and all public representatives, both at local and national level, have in so far as road exepnditure is concerned.  While the reduction in the overall level of rate <Col N="677" /> support grants will have an impact on the finance available for road works in 1988, I emphatically reject again the suggestion that this reduction is either unplanned or indiscriminate.  At my meeting with the city and county managers on 3 September I informed them that local authority allocations for county road strengthening and a block grant for roads would be broadly at the same level in 1988 as they were in 1987 while there would be some reduction in the funding available for improvement projects.  I want to point out that the county road strenghtening grant and the block grants to be allocated to each road authority will be exactly the same as in 1987.  The overall provision for maintenance in 1988 is now £30 million, which represents a small increase of just £200,000 on the provision for 1987.</P>
    <P>There have been some increases where I thought the best use and the best need and the greatest need existed for those increases.  In other places there had to be reductions and on occasions there had to be terminations.  The information on the block and county road strengthening grants is of particular importance to local authorities in the preparation of their estimates because these grants are generally designed to supplement expenditure from their own resources, unlike grants for national roads, which meet the full cost of the works.  Local authorities have therefore had fairly firm information on both the general level of road grants and the rate of support grant since 3 September.  This give them sufficient time to plan their road expenditure programme for 1988 in the areas where they have the main discretion as to spending, namely, county and regional roads.  That is where the discretion is for county councillors and urban district councillors.  I have given them advance notice of the money that is available and I have told them that they will not have less than they had this year.  I think that is significant.  I also hope to issue next month details of the actual individual allocations to local authorities.  This is in contrast with other years when the first indication given to local authorities of their roads allocations <Col N="678" /> was late January and often later in the year.</P>
    <P>My decision to maintain the level of the block grant and county road strengthening grant at their 1987 level, when State expenditure on roads is generally being reduced, was influenced by my concern for employment and the state of our country and county roads.  The roadworks undertaken with the assistance of these grants provide the most significant employment potential in the roads area. Most of our workforce are engaged on those type of roads and they represent about 92 per cent of the total road network. In straitened times I thought it was proper and prudent to maintain as best I can, the workforce on the road network, who service 92 per cent of the total network. That is the reason for the decision. It was planned that way.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the decision which I have taken and conveyed to managers will enable local authorities to undertake a properly planned and significant programme of road works in 1988.  There will, however, be a reduction in the provision for major road improvement projects on national and major urban roads, which will mean a slow down in the programme. Progress on these will be kept at as good a level as I can and, hopefully, other areas of investment in infrastructure might become available during 1988 which will allow us to take up again the major road network programmes we have become accustomed to.</P>
    <P>Senators may be aware that I have indicated that the setting up of a national roads authority will be announced, and I will be giving details about that in the near future.  They will have a job specification in regard to private investment in roads, further EC investment, the question of tolls and a whole range of related matters concerning national roads.  I expect that when that is in place we can get back to providing what I regard as an essential infrastructural need: the most efficient operational structure.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of Government policy also which will work to the benefit of local authorities this year &mdash;<Col N="679" /> but I noticed that they seemed to pass some of the speakers by without recognition. One of the principal means of reducing public expenditure is through reducing manpower levels to match the lower levels of works being undertaken. This applies particularly to local authorities. The difficulty is, however, that redundancies are costly for local authorities, particularly the lump sums which have to be paid.  The Government's new voluntary redundancy package recognises these difficulties and provides that local authorities will be recouped the lump sum and severance costs involved. This will be of major benefit to local authorities in 1988.  I would like Senator Doyle to appreciate that is my intention that the manual workers will not be the only ones who will have to bear the brunt of any lay-offs that become necessary.  I would like to think that it would be spread across the board.  That is the way it is planned by me and it is the way it is going to be implemented if I am able to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is going to be voluntary. The redundancy package is to be voluntary and, following that, there is the question of redeployment.  As far as I am concerned, quite a large number have indicated already their willingness to avail themselves of the redundancy package. Not everybody can be accommodated, even of those who were interested and willing to accept it at this stage.  Services have to be maintained. People in critical areas have to be kept on, but I believe that the vast majority can be accommodated in the way that has been set down by Government Ministers. Since the Government took office interest rates have come down and have stayed down.  Inflation has similarly fallen and future trends are encouraging.  Local authorities are benefiting from lower interest rates and will continue to benefit in 1988.  This is not often referred to but is well worth mentioning here because local authorities have the use of that downward trend in inflation and interest <Col N="680" /> rates to accommodate some of their expensive programmes.</P>
      <P>The Government's message is clear in relation to local authority funding.  Order had to be restored to the public finances and this involves reductions right across the board in every public sector organisation, not just with local authorities being singled out.  That has not been the game play of the Government in this critical period of decision making for our country.  It is right across the board in every Department including every agency and every authority.  It was willingly done as distinct from fighting your corner.  In the past Ministers were blamed if they let down the side or let down the Department.  &ldquo;Did you give in easily?&rdquo;  It was not a question of giving in.  It was a question of giving rather than trying to hold the line.  Otherwise it would be a nonsense.  Criticising us stood for nothing.  It would mean one Minister trying to outdo another Minister.  This was a Government decision taken by consensus. Once the initial decision had been taken that the fundamental problem of the economy was to be tackled in a collective way we all approached it from that point of view.  The Department understand that new drift and that new challenge and are accepting them and providing the necessary backup to Ministers to accommodate that Government attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are leading by example in cutting their own budget.  All Government Departments have had to take reductions both in terms of their allocation and staff numbers.  I appreciate that some people would argue that some changes might be more severe than others.  The motion put down by the Opposition and some of the exaggerated comments in some of the contributions do not justify support and do not deserve it.  There is no question of the reductions in local authority funding being unplanned. The planning and budgeting are done locally.  This is the central role of local authorities in dealing with their own area.  They must, of course, act within the limits of the money available to them by way of grants and their own resources. <Col N="681" /> They have the power and the information and it is their job to plan those resources. That is what they are doing right now.  I do not want to take that power from them.  There are those who would suggest it but I have never been a supporter of that view; in fact I canvassed the alternative.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have a major role to play in an independent democracy such as we have.  They can only have that independence when they have control over the resources available to them. That is why I do not want to be seen as a Minister who will in any way limit the autonomy or the independence of the local authorities and it would be an easy option to do it.  I am not that kind of Minister for the Environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Senator's gesture in the matter.  I would like to deal with the area of capital funding of local authority programmes.  I think that is important.  There are many who say that borrowing to finance capital investment <Col N="682" /> in the provision of infrastructural development is a good thing and that such borrowing is sustainable.  I agree with them in principle but I would also like to say that it is not all one way traffic.  There can be no such thing as limitless capital investment.  We have to structure capital investment in such a way that it provides the best possible return for the investment. It must take into account our ability to repay the money borrowed and such repayments must be provided for each year.  The notion is that somehow capital is expended and never has to be repaid.  Unless capital is put into a project that has the capacity to repay the interest and make a contribution to the capital refund as well, it should not be entertained. All current and capital expenditure has to borrowed annually.  That is the way it is.</P>

      <P>The only response I can give on that is that you do not see it in the Estimate where it has to be sustained by the Government.</P>
      <P>We will continue to provide capital funding to local authorities for their capital programmes but it will be at a reduced rate in 1988 towards funding construction works in progress.  One area where there has been a significant reduction in the past year relates to local authority housing construction.  This reduction must be viewed against the substantial fall in applicants for local authority houses in recent years.  That has been expressed by both sides of the House.  It is universally accepted that there is no need for the enormous level of investment of three or four years ago in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one further very important aspect relating to local authority funding on which I would like to comment.  I am <Col N="683" /> not satisfied with the present system of local authority current funding.  I have already initiated a review of local finances within the Department with a view to developing proposals for long term reform of the system.  The review is at an advanced stage now in the Department. I will be putting proposals to the Government shortly to put local authority funding on a sound and stable footing for the future.  I think a cheer will go up in every local authority in Ireland once that is in place and running.</P>

      <P>I should like to finish by saying I am pleased to be here to get a chance to advocate the Government's position in relation to local authority funding.  In common with every public sector area they will experience reductions in the level of State grants but they will not be asked to bear a disproportionate share of the burden.  That is agreed by the Government.  I have no doubt that local authorities will make prudent use of the funds available in 1988 and that essential services will be maintained while, at the same time, obtaining the best value for money.  For my part I will continue to foster local government in this country.  I am a supporter of it.</P>

      <P>I ardently believe in the system of local government and I will do my utmost to contribute to its future development with the financial framework to support that development.  Changes are inevitable.  Some of the changes both in the structure and the financial gearing of local authorities are overdue. It is a huge area of activity and it is not easy to get it in place.  I would like to have had both in place before the Estimates were struck for 1988 because that would have set a pattern people could have worked on and planned over a period of years.  Regrettably, it was not <Col N="684" /> possible to do it but hopefully and, assuredly, we will have it in place for the 1989 Estimates.</P>

      <P>The Minister made a very substantial contribution to the House on matters of local government.  This motion is an extremely important one.  The funding of our local authority activities is fundamental to local public representatives and the local government system in Ireland.  It is regrettable that any political party in this House should have to bring a motion before the Seanad calling on the Minister to provide adequate finance for local authorities.</P>
      <P>The recent publication of the Book of Estimates makes this motion even more urgent.  The 1988 financial allocations to local authorities make dismal reading, despite the Minister's efforts to put the best appearance on them.  I was amused that the Minister considers redundancy to local authority workers as a benefit to local authorities.  The fact that he is giving county managers 100 per cent recoupment of redundancy benefits in 1988 is now seen as benefit to local government.</P>

      <P>The Minister spoke about bringing forward the Estimates for this year.  I think that that is a very good move on the Minister's part.  It gives councillors time to look at the financial allocations they will receive and put into operation for 1988.  I certainly applaud the Minister's efforts in doing that.  However, I think the Minister should have told councils at this stage what the road and housing allocations are for 1988.  Up to yesterday most of them had not received them.</P>

      <P>The total Estimate, as Senator Ferris has pointed out, is £98 million of a reduction to local government, which is a savage decrease in current and capital expenditure for 1988. Even though the Minister said he had no apologies to make about the finances he was providing to local government, he should apologise for a reduction in finance to local authorities, especially when one considers his attitude last year.  Last year it was very difficult for the Minister and his party colleagues to refrain from telling the electorate during the election campaign that they were going to abolish service charges and abolish land tax.  Now the Minister has put himself in a position of his own making, where he is finding it extremely difficult to get adequate finances to maintain the services and maintain the employment that councils and local authorities presently have.</P>

      <P>In Kilkenny County Council we had the spectacle of 21 workers being let go about one month ago.  It was sad to see people who had given long <Col N="686" /> service to their county council being faced with that situation.  Many of the local authorities &mdash; in particular members of the Fianna Fáil Party before they came into Government &mdash; were against the principle of service charges as a source of local government finance and against land tax, which was another source of local government finance.  The Minister is also not prepared to clear the air in this House in relation to property tax.  Is the Minister in favour of property tax as a funding source for local government, or must we wait for the county managers to introduce their own estimates to find out?</P>
      <P>These are the matters we are very concerned about as public representatives. Indeed, I applaud the discipline the Minister has instilled in his local government representatives throughout the country because they are certainly bowing to his wishes on this occasion.  They seem to be totally happy with the allocations they have got and the sentiments expressed by the Minister over the last few weeks.</P>
      <P>The roads allocation has been reduced by 10 per cent on 1987.  No major road project will commence in 1988 in rural Ireland.  With the rates relief grant reduced by 12 per cent it will mean that regional and county roads will be reduced to the standard of country boreens in some cases.  Up to now we were in a position to tar a road one year in ten. Now that has been increased to one year in 29, as stated by our county engineer in County Kilkenny recently, as a result of the amount of finance we received.</P>
      <P>The Minister appears to have no policy at all in relation to housing.  Since March 1987 the Minister has eliminated home improvement grants, savaged new house grants, reduced mortgage interest relief, abolished the £5,000 surrender grant and abandoned practically any new start in local authority housing in 1988.  The measures will ultimately lead to longer housing lists for local authorities in 1988 and it will take another Government to reduce the housing lists.  We had to do this during the term of the last Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister reduced the capital allocation for water and sewerage schemes by 16 per cent, which means that he has <Col N="687" /> given a vote of no confidence in regard to the future planning of any new housing and industrial developments by local authorities.  At a time of unprecedented pollution of our water systems and waterways the Minister has decided that the solution is to cut the finance available to the staff of local authorities to deal with this problem and to abolish An Foras Forbartha.  Adding insult to injury, the Minister's own Government have virtually wound up the farm improvements scheme, which would have given some grant-in-aid to people who are in a position to improve their effluent storage.</P>

We have been listening to these platitudes about local government reform being at an advanced stage of development in the Minister's Department. Is that an advanced stage with successive Governments?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will come clean on the issue within the time indicated here.  The Minister has given county and city managers an impossible task in striking a reasonable rate for 1988. Redundancies will be inevitable and services will have to be abolished or curtailed. Charges for services will have to be increased dramatically and the commercial rate will increase to an extent where businesses will not be in a position <Col N="688" /> to pay those rates.  We have the appalling spectacle of Fianna Fáil public representatives scrambling for the introduction of new sources of local revenue. This is indeed hypocrisy when one considers that Fianna Fáil councillors told people not to pay water charges, and they were backed up by the Fianna Fáil Front Bench of the day.  It was part of the general election manifesto of 1987 for the Minister's party.  They told people not to pay land tax because it would be abolished, and the Minister's party did that, thus depriving local authorities of another source of revenue.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil promised that when they were returned to Government all service charges would be abolished and that local authorities would be put on a proper financial footing.  The Government have reneged on that promise.  The irresponsibility that was boldly displayed by the Minister's public representatives at local elections is a main contributing factor to the present situation, where we have huge amounts of finance outstanding to every local authority from these service charges.  All this has contributed to the malaise that prevails in the public mind.  They now do not wish to contribute anything for any local service. It must be embarrassing for many Fianna Fáil public representatives to have to perform U-turn after U-turn on these service charges and bow to the Minister's wishes &mdash; a monetarist wish because the Minister is getting good at balancing the books in his own Department.  I ask the Minister to tell us here this evening if he is in favour of service charges, if he is in favour of property tax, and to divulge his proposals for local Government reform as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Failure to clear the air in this matter will only be prolonging the agony for many local authorities.  Councils will not be able to fund existing services and employment on the allocations they have been given for 1988.  The Minister is prepared to put local authority <Col N="689" /> employees on the dole so that they can balance his books and at the same time take power away from local government and take it on himself&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Five minutes.  Portlaw Boys National School is a school with 122 pupils.  The children from this school went to Fishguard on their school tour last summer.  On the boat they met an American family &mdash; a mother, a father and a daughter.  Some of the children entered into conversation with the American family and explained about seeking their new school.  They made such an impression that the Americans expressed a desire to help out in some way.  The school received a cheque for $1,200 some weeks later.  This was gratefully accepted and has been used to obtain some badly-needed audio-visual aids for the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House should compliment the boys of Portlaw School, their parents and <Col N="693" /> their teachers for the fact that such a profound impression was made on these benevolent visitors.  The boys were able to describe their problem about getting their new school and by their behaviour and eloquence succeeded in greatly improving their school equipment.  They were not looking for anything, but their sincerity and commitment to their school and to their town asked for them.  I salute those children and I acknowledge the generosity of the donors; but is it not a sad comment on the provision for primary education down through the years, now alone in Portlaw but throughout the country?</P>
    <P>The savage attack on primary education in the recently-published Estimates is all the sadder and all the more devastating in the context of this story. In the 1986 Estimates £33 million was provided for school buildings, equipment and extensions.  In 1987 this was reduced to £30 million and in 1988 it will be reduced to £15 million.</P>
    <P>In Portlaw Boys' National School there is no storage space and it is being contemplated that the teacher's toilet will have to be converted into a strong room to store the audio-visual aids recently acquired from the American subvention. Surely, even within the £15 million provided, this school should be catered for. I read in the fire officer's report on the school what is required to bring the complex to an acceptable standard of fire safety:</P>
    <P>Remove all combustible linings in classrooms 1 and 2 and replace with a material with a surface spread of flame rating of class 0.</P>
    <P>This refers to the heavy wainscotting and partition between classrooms 1 and 2. These are requirements &mdash; to quote the fire officer again &ldquo;to bring the complex to an acceptable standard of fire safety.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Portlaw is a town of some 1,252 people, according to the 1981 census.  It has been devastated by the recession.  Its sole industry, Irish Leathers, has gone from employing over 400 people in pre-EC days to closure in the early eighties.  The <Col N="694" /> town is some 16 miles from Waterford city.  It is not on a main route between any other towns.  There is a &ldquo;Jobs for Portlaw&rdquo; Committee which has, with the assistance of State agencies, been endeavouring to provide jobs in the town. Their success, though it may seem modest to date, has been the production of intense effort, dedication and imagination. The important point is that it is ongoing, and last Monday night a very well attended meeting of the community reviewed progress and called for and got the commitment of the Oireachtas Members to put their full weight behind the committee in securing investment and jobs for Portlaw.</P>
    <P>The committee has identified projects which would be viable but capital is needed.  It is a town that is down, but it is fighting for its survival.  It is a town that retains the skills that produced some of the best leather in the world.</P>
    <P>Portlaw has been seeking its new boys' national school since 1970.  The existing building was bult in 1930 as a two-teacher school.  There was a subsequent extension, which provided an extra classroom and toilets.  Portlaw is now a four-teacher school.  It caters for pupils in standards one to six.  The infant classes attend the adjacent convent girls' school.  The rooms in the existing building are too small.  As I said before, there is no storage space. Recently when a medical examination was carried out in the school the children had to be sent home as the only available space was in the classrooms.</P>
    <P>There are only three classrooms in the school.  Some of the pupils in second standard and all of the pupils in first standard are housed in the Muintir na Tíre hall which is about 500 yards from the school. Most of these small children are sitting on adult chairs at adult tables.  The hall is in use virtually every night by the community and the teacher often has to rearrange furniture because the layout of the furniture required at night is different.</P>
    <P>The school has a mainly grassed play area which becomes very muddy and dirty during the wet weather.  I visited the school yesterday and the children were <Col N="695" /> excellently turned out in their school uniforms but the problems which mothers face during the winter period in keeping clothes clean are immense.</P>
    <P>Every Wednesday water charges are collected in the building.  Up to the time that the Irish Leathers Factory in Portlaw was closed a sub-office of a bank operated out of the same building.  The toilets, like the furniture, are unsuitable for seven and eight year olds.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the administration of the school, as a teacher who is on leave of absence, I understand the problems which arise from having the school student body split up.  The very fact of having second standard split between two buildings is a major problem. One third of the annual budget of the school goes on renting the Muintir na Tíre hall.</P>
    <P>I have in front of me a letter from the Minister of State at the Department of Education, dated 30 November last, stating that the Department had agreed to the placing of a contract and that official notification of this decision would be conveyed to the chairman of the board of management immediately.  Since then no such notification has arrived.  The boys, parents and teachers of Portlaw deserve better than this.  I attended a public meeting last Monday night in Portlaw.  I was asked should the children be taken out of the school in protest and as a means of bringing pressure to bear on the Minister. In reply I said that, in educational matters, I always put the children first and they should be the last ones to become cannon-fodder in the fight for a new school.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister in the strongest possible terms to provide a new boys' school for Portlaw by placing a contract in 1988.  The community have suffered a great deal.  According to a recent survey 47 per cent of males and 74 per cent of females in the families of the children attending the school are unemployed.  In spite of all these handicaps the children brought off what I consider to be a major coup in promoting the image of the young people of this country during the school <Col N="696" /> tour last year.  I submit that Portlaw has waited since 1970 and it has waited long enough.</P>

      <P>I realise that the Minister is constrained because of the moneys that are made available to him.  Portlaw has been beaten down by unemployment and the people have waited a long time for a new school.  The children have a disruptive daily school pattern.  I ask the Minister to make a solid provision for that school in 1988.</P>

      <P>I want to thank Senator O'Shea for making this time available to me.  I seem to have become the prophet of doom on these occasions and the list seems to go on and on.  The Minister can sit there and look relaxed when we discuss schools such as Faha, Frenchpark, Lisdowney and Portlaw.</P>
      <P>It seems to be almost a case of maladministration that we have to be taking up the time of the Oireachtas discussing matters which should be dealt with administratively in the Department of Education.  It is time that the Government accepted their responsibility to look after the needs of pupils, teachers, education and the service of education in all corners of Ireland.  One of the most worrying aspects of this is that it always seems to be the smaller schools in distant areas that are left last on the list.  It is as if the decision-makers in Dublin forget very quickly about areas of the country like Waterford and Roscommon because they are outside the general precincts.</P>
      <P>The Minister has much to answer for in this case.  I appeal to him not to take us through a litany of what happened in the school.  We know that it has gone out to tender and parents have been given the impression that something is going to happen because it has gone out to tender. We know very well that the Minister will stand up tonight and say nothing is going to happen there even though it has gone out to tender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Department of Education have it in their minds to <Col N="697" /> make things even worse in this school.  I believe they want to change the appointment schedules and probably get rid of a teacher from the school so that they will not have to build an extra classroom.  I am aware of the machinations about the future of Portlaw school.</P>
    <P>The parents, teachers and the pupils who are suffering all sorts of local problems, as outlined by Senator O'Shea, have enough on their plate without having to worry about this additional problem.  This is an area that has been hit badly by unemployment.  Already pupils are under difficulty, in terms of finding motivation to address themselves to the business of learning and education.</P>
    <P>We have a real duty to pupils and education in areas like this.  It is very difficult to motivate the pupils to learn in the very shabby surroundings of the school. Unemployment has created problems in the local community and these children need to get priority.  I am sure the Minister understands that it is hard to cover the curriculum in such surroundings with half the school half-a-mile down the road in a hall which is being used for all sorts of other purposes.  It is neither suitable nor clean in the morning simply because its use does not allow it to be prepared for teaching, education and learning each morning.  Because the school is split it is impossible to implement any kind of curriculum guidelines in it.</P>
    <P>It is also clear that the parents are absolutely frustrated.  Instead of looking after themselves communities are spending their time and their energy wondering how they can get the Department of Education to give them what they are entitled to.  The vice president of the INTO, Mr. Michael Drew, visited that school this week and was appalled by what he saw. He took the trouble to contact me today to give me some information about what he had seen there.  He was highly complimentary about the solidarity between the parents and the teachers in the area who are single mindedly approaching this problem in a school where there is not enough hard surface for an outdoor play area and no general purposes room.  They are trying against all the odds to <Col N="698" /> implement the curriculum.  I appeal to the Minister to consider what is happening in that school.  As in the other schools that have been mentioned over the last number of weeks, it is impossible to implement a curriculum in Portlaw and it is almost impossible for pupils to work and learn and for teachers to motivate them to a learning process.</P>
    <P>No matter what cutbacks there are or what priorities the Government have, surely the provision of primary education must be a priority for any thinking, caring Government.  There is £15 million less this year for the building of schools which means that this list will actually get longer in the foreseeable future.  How can that be justified?  We are also aware that there is no increase whatsoever in the money available from the State for the running and management of schools in places like Portlaw.  That means that if there is not enough money available the only way to give a service to the pupils and to give them whatever extras they need is to go to the local community.  In a community which is racked by unemployment that extra discretionary money is not available. By complying with a system which cuts back further and further on primary education what will happen is that the rich will get a better deal because they will be able to pay for a higher quality of education.  It is despicable.  I urge the Ministers to move quickly on this issue. The people, pupils and teachers of Portlaw deserve better.  I appeal to the Minister to give us good news tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank both speakers for their contributions. One has to be impressed with the cases made and, in particular, with Senator O'Shea's description of the spirit that is in the town in trying to overcome the difficulties that exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, once again the news is bad.  Unfortunately again, that is the way it will continue to be.  The detailed drawings for this project were in progress during 1984 and in January 1985, my Department authorised the invitation of tenders for the project.  The tenders were <Col N="699" /> subsequently received and examined. Senator O'Shea mentioned the fact that in November last year indications were given by my predecessor that the project would go out to contract.  A number of projects &mdash; I think about 24 in all &mdash; were chosen to go to contract in the first months of this year but, unfortunately, the project in Portlaw was not among them.  As I already explained to the House, since I have taken over responsibility for schools I have not been in a position to allow any further contracts to be placed because all the money provided in the current year's Estimate has been all utilised as a result of the allocations made before I came into office.  The situation now is even worse than it was then, as Senator O'Toole said, because in 1988 we will not be in a position to place any further contracts.</P>
    <P>I do not sit in a relaxed way, as Senator O'Toole suggested, almost as if I did not care.  I do care.  I care more about this area because both my father and my grandmother were national teachers and I trained as a secondary teacher.  As I said before, I am appalled at the condition of national schools.  However, it is very clear and unequivocal that no new school buildings will be commenced in 1988.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole was rather scathing in his attack.  That is the situation and we must accept the reason for that being the case.  The reason is that, if we continue to borrow money for this project and other projects which we want to get on with, in five years' time not alone will we not have the money to build the schools but we will not even have the money to pay the teachers.  If we continue to borrow an extra £2 billion per year, as has been happening, in five years' time this country's creditworthiness will be gone.</P>
    <P>I am the first person to agree that to have to stop projects like this is a desperately harsh decision.  But we have to face up to the fact that there is no option at this stage.  If we continue to borrow money at the rate we have been doing in five year's time we will not be able to pay <Col N="700" /> for essential services, including teacher's salaries.  Everybody in this House is aware that £2 billion per year has been added to the National Debt over the last four years and that if we were to continue with that type of expenditure the National Debt would continue at that level.  The choices are pretty stark.  I cannot argue with anything that the two speakers have said.  I can only put forward the situation is in which I and the Government find ourselves.</P>

      <P>I cannot.  But what I can do, and what I am attempting to do is this.  If there are essential repairs which can be carried out in order to alleviate the difficulties, I will at least examine the possibility of having those repairs carried out.</P>
      <P>It is as well for me &mdash; and it is now the policy of my Department &mdash; to spell out clearly the exact situation, I will attempt to be as honest as I possibly can.  Whatever other schools come up for discussion in this House or in the Dáil, that will be the response.  It is a terrible thing to have to be so negative, but unfortunately that is the situation.  It is as well that that is spelt out for the people so that they know exactly what the options are.  There will be no progress in regard to new schools in 1988 and the best I can offer is that, if there are essential repairs which can be carried out, we will at least look at the possibility of carrying them out.</P>
