      <P>I have notice from Senator David Norris that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The attendance of Irish diplomats at the official reception for President Waldheim of Austria on 25 June 1987 in the Vatican.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Jack Daly of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Government to reverse their decision to abolish Bord Scann·n na h…ireann (Irish Film Board) in the interests of the Irish film industry.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Paul Bradford of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to indicate when it is proposed to start a building programme at Rahan national school, Mallow, County Cork, as a serious accommodation problem will exist there in September 1987 as some of the present accommodation is extremely unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Mick Lanigan of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2016" /> The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to use his considerable influence to ensure that the United Nations renew the UNIFIL mandate in Lebanon which expires on 19 July.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Brian O'Shea of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to expand the recent decentralisation programme to include other areas than those designated in order to redress regional imbalances.</P>
    <P>I regard all matters as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment of the House.  I have selected Senator Norris's motion and it will be taken at the conclusion of business this afternoon. Senators Daly, Bradford, Lanigan and O'Shea may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, I would like to make a statement about item No. 34.  The Leader of the House, Senator Murphy and I have reached an agreement that item No. 34, the Government's motion on extradition, will be withdrawn from the Order Paper.  We will also withdraw our amendment.  The reason for this is because we feel it is responsible at this delicate and difficult time in Anglo-Irish relations for ourselves and the Government not to interfere in the delicate talks and negotiations <Col N="2017" /> which may go on.  I would like to congratulate Senator Lanigan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am just giving the reason for the withdrawal of a motion which has caused enormous trouble in this House. Senator Lanigan's responsible attitude, and by implication the Taoiseach's, to this matter will alleviate the problem which could have been very difficult for this House and for the Government.</P>

      <P>On the matter raised by Senator Ferris, it is very doubtful if the Taoiseach will be able to come into the House as the Government are extremely busy at present.  We have enough business to keep us here for quite some time.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business, questions were raised about the report on sexual violence and we will take that before the end of the session.  It will probably be taken the week after next.  Equally, there was much concern about item No. 10 on the Order Paper which is the report of the Joint Committee on Small Businesses. We will take that matter before the end of this session.</P>
      <P>As Senator Ross has said, it has been agreed that item No. 34 be withdrawn from the Order Paper.  I would not concur with him as to the reasons why it is being withdrawn.</P>

    <Title>Export Promotion (Amendment) Bill, 1987: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could first say how pleased I am to be speaking to Seanad …ireann.  It is my first occasion to do so since I left the House in 1981.  In view of your new surroundings, I welcome you to my House and say that I trust you will <Col N="2018" /> enjoy these surroundings.</P>
      <P>I recommend this Bill to the House. The Bill has two purposes one of which is routine, while the other represents a significant step forward in the restructuring of our export promotion effort.</P>
      <P>The routine aspect is that the Bill raises the ceiling on CÛras Tr·cht·la's aggregate level of grant-in-aid, the existing level now having been reached.  The innovative aspect is that the Bill creates a licensing system for the special trading houses envisaged in the 1987 Finance Bill, which extended valuable tax advantages to these new entities.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I could refer first of all to the matter of CÛras Tr·cht·la's grant-in-aid, which is dealt with in section 3 of the Bill. By approaching it in this way I can make some general comments on export marketing which will serve as an introduction to the question of special trading houses.</P>
      <P>An overall ceiling is provided by law in the amount of grant-in-aid that the Government may pay to CÛras Tr·cht·la, and from time to time that ceiling needs to be increased.  The existing ceiling, which was set by legislation in 1983, is £160 million.  The measure before the House raises that figure to £260 million, which is considered to be adequate for the next four years or so.</P>
      <P>What makes this section of the Bill relatively routine is that, of course, it does not actually provide this money, nor even commit the Government to doing so.  In the future, as in the past, allocations for CTT will be set each year as part of the normal Estimates process for the Department of Industry and Commerce and, as is customary on such occasions, the Estimate each year will be debated and approved by the D·il and Seanad.  This arrangement of limiting the aggregate total of grant-in-aid is a common feature in the legislation for semi-State bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The moneys provided each year to CTT are spent on a wide range of support to exporters.  These include: advice and basic information; specialist services in the field of market research; incentive grants to exporters entering new markets; <Col N="2019" /> and the organisation of national stands at international trade fairs.  As well as this, CTT has an important role in improving the marketing skills in Irish companies.  Together these services add up to a comprehensive support for our exporters, and the provision at section 3 of this Bill is necessary to enable CTT to continue to provide them.</P>
    <P>Indeed, this is a matter of some urgency because CTT has already reached the current ceiling of £160 million. Any undue delay in implementing this measure would result in CTT having to borrow money in order to continue to operate, because we would be unable to pay them the moneys that have been voted in this year's Estimate.  This would be an unnecessary cost which we are anxious to avoid, especially in the current financial climate.</P>
    <P>The urgency attaching to this part of the Bill, which also applies for different reasons to the measures relating to the special trading houses, is the reason why this measure does not provide for any overall restructuring of CÛras Tr·cht·la but is restricted to matters which cannot wait until the other side of the summer.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware from public comments I have made since taking up office that the Government consider it necessary to focus our national export effort on those areas that will deliver the best results in the shortest time.  Furthermore, we are conscious of the urgent need to give that effort a major new impetus so that exports can play the part they must in our national recovery.</P>
    <P>In this context, I have been carrying out a complete reappraisal of CTT's activities and functions.  What exactly do we want the organisation to do from now on?  Where should it concentrate its resources in the immediate future?  By what criteria should it operate, to meet the challenges that face us as a trading nation now &mdash; challenges that are on an altogether different scale, and indeed of an altogether different nature, to the ones we faced when CTT was first set up at the end of the fifties.</P>
    <P>The outcome of this reappraisal will <Col N="2020" /> certainly call for policy changes and almost certainly for new legislation.  I may, therefore, be returning to this House in the near future with another Bill relating to CTT.  It may be appropriate, however, if I now make some general comments to set this current Bill in perspective and also as an indication to the House as to the direction we are moving in.</P>
    <P>Exports are central to our economy. They account for more than half our GNP, and we as a nation are now more dependent on exporting than many of the world's traditional big exporters &mdash; like Britain, the United States and Japan &mdash; that is proportionately of course.  We have become what is above all a trading nation and it is not hard to see why. In contrast to the countries I have just mentioned we have no home market of any significance by modern standards. That tiny home market is fully open to the cold winds of international competition.</P>
    <P>So if we are to grow, we must grow through selling our goods and services abroad &mdash; in short through exporting. Irish companies need to sell internationally at a much earlier stage in their development than is necessary in bigger countries.  Bigger countries can offer rich pickings for local companies on their own doorsteps but Irish companies that do not move into exporting are doomed not to grow.  Even worse, they are doomed not even to survive because they are increasingly exposed to competition from much bigger companies from outside.</P>
    <P>In the past 30 years, our national policy has been for export-led growth and our record of success has been impressive in many respects.  We now export at the level of about £10 billion a year; the positive trade balance last year was around three-quarters of a billion pounds and this year's result will be even better.  The most recent month's trade figures were particularly encouraging but if we look behind these rosy figures, we get an indication of the scale of work that still needs to be done and where we need to focus our effort.</P>
    <P>There is, as Senators will be fully aware, a sharp contrast between the <Col N="2021" /> export performance of foreign-owned companies operating in Ireland and the performance of Irish-owned companies. In general, the foreign-owned companies are the stars of the export show, while the Irish-owned companies tend to have bit parts, smaller parts or no parts at all. In saying this I have no wish to ignore the magnificent export performance of many Irish-owned companies; the problem is that there are not enough of them and they are the exception, not the rule.</P>
    <P>This is obviously where we must focus our effort.  Now, as never before, we must concentrate on getting more Irish-owned companies into exporting and get those who are already in exporting to give it a much higher priority.  The task of Government, as I see it, is to create the conditions in which this will happen and happen quickly.</P>
    <P>It is now received wisdom that our biggest industrial weakness is in international marketing but while we have recognised the disease we have done precious little up to now to bring about a cure.  We urgently need to transform Ireland from being a production-led country to one that is market-driven.  It was the awareness of this need that led this Government to set up the Office of Trade and Marketing, the first time in the history of the State that the importance of marketing as an aspect of wealth creation was adequately recognised by devoting an office of Government to it.</P>
    <P>The whole thrust of our effort must be towards making good that deficiency in marketing capability within Irish-owned companies &mdash; a deficiency that we can afford no longer.  So in restructuring CTT, our emphasis will be overwhelmingly on Irish-owned companies in the first instance, and in the second place on getting those Irish-owned companies to take a proper marketing approach to exporting.  In essence that means that they should approach exporting on the basis of a strategic, long term plan.</P>
    <P>We cannot, and indeed we should not, do the job of these companies for them. No State should be in the business of mollycoddling private companies who are not prepared to make an effort for themselves. <Col N="2022" /> What this State should be in is the business of helping companies to overcome the handicaps they suffer through being, for the most part, small enterprises in a small economy.</P>
    <P>Export marketing is not easy, let us not be in any doubt about that.  It demands a major commitment of resources &mdash; in money, time and energy.  Let us not underestimate the very real practical difficulties that small companies face in venturing out on these waters.  In equipping them for the voyage, we need to offer not one support but a wide range of supports, each one geared to the different needs and circumstances of different situations.</P>
    <P>We need a toolbox for exporters.  In that toolbox should be only those tools that are necessary to help the people we are talking about; we can no longer afford to spend resources in providing tools that some people are perfectly capable of providing for themselves.  So part of what we will be doing is thinning out the toolbox but another part will be adding tools so that the people we need to help will have a full range of options available to them in approaching their task.</P>
    <P>Many of these tools are already in place and part of my task as Minister for Trade and Marketing is to ensure that people are fully aware of them and that they make full use of them.  We have, for instance, a scheme to encourage the employment of marketing executives in companies by subsidising their salary costs in the first year.  We have a scheme to encourage companies to group together for export marketing.  That scheme has already had some notable successes and I am glad to report to the House that there has recently been a dramatic quickening of interest in the idea.  In one recent week alone, more than 500 people from Irish-owned companies attended seminars on group export marketing which were mounted by CTT at five centres around the country. I attended one of these seminars and was highly impressed by the keen level of interest and indeed enthusiasm that is now being shown by many newcomers to the export scene.  It is evidence that the message is getting through that Irish companies <Col N="2023" /> can no longer afford to depend on the home market.</P>
    <P>Where do the special trading houses fit into this?  They will fill what I see is a structural gap in our export effort.  They will offer to Irish companies export marketing skills they are not in a position to provide themselves, or not yet in a position to provide.  They are a necessary addition to our national marketing toolbox, and section 2 of the present Bill is concerned with the creation of this tool.</P>
    <P>We have to face the fact that some companies have exportable products but do not have any resources to commit to exporting.  We have to face the fact that some manufacturing companies are able to cover only a few key export markets and have to turn their back on smaller opportunities in other countries in order to concentrate on their priorities.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we have to recognise that there is now in Ireland a considerable reservoir of export marketing experience that we can put to more effective use.  There are people and companies with special knowledge of certain markets or who possess certain language skills that are in rare supply.  Looked at from the national perspective, many of these talents are at present under used, not least because up to now we have been penalising rather than encouraging them.</P>
    <P>Suppose, for instance, someone with special knowledge of a particular product area or of a particular geographical market decided to set up a company specialising in exporting Irish goods into that market.  The existence of the company would be welcome to those manufacturers who were not able to do the exporting themselves.  But though the company would be selling Irish manufactured goods, and creating valuable new exports, the enterprise would be taxed unfavourably &mdash; compared with a manufacturer of those goods.  At present, the tax advantages of manufacturing goods do not flow through to a company whose only role is to export the goods.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder, then, that very few companies like that exist?  We now want to provide a positive incentive for people <Col N="2024" /> to go into this kind of business.  We want to make it worth people's while to act as exporters for Irish manufacturers.</P>
    <P>The incentives are already in place; they are contained in section 29 of the Finance Bill, which this House recently considered.  Special trading houses will get the concessionary corporation tax rate of only 10 per cent, which up to now has been restricted almost entirely to manufacturing companies.  Investment in special trading houses will also be eligible for income tax relief under the business expansion scheme, making it much easier for these enterprises to find start-up capital in the form of risk-taking equity.  In addition, special trading houses may be eligible for assistance from CÛras Tr·cht·la in exactly the same way as if they were manufacturing the goods they are exporting.  But the precise details in this area have yet to be worked out and agreed.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill before the House this morning has the purpose of setting up a licensing system so that these very substantial incentives are used only for the purpose the Government intended when we introduced them &mdash; to create additional exports for this country.</P>
    <P>We are fully determined to restrict the enjoyment of these incentives to bona fide trading houses that will fill the structural gap that exists at present in our exporting system.  The licensing system proposed is outlined in section 2, and it is my intention that it will be simple, fair and fast.  If I may repeat the phrase I used in the D·il in this connection, my objective is not to put an obstacle in the way of enterprise but merely to put up a fence to keep the cowboys out.</P>
    <P>The procedure will be that companies seeking the status of a special trading house will make application for a licence to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. To support that application, the company will have to provide information about their proposed capitalisation, their general qualifications and expertise, and their business and marketing plans.</P>
    <P>As a help for people applying for a licence, my office will very shortly be <Col N="2025" /> issuing a guidance leaflet which will set out the basic information that people will need to know in order to apply for a licence.  This leaflet will, for instance, detail the five main requirements that a company have to fulfil, to qualify as a special trading house.  These are: they must be registered as a company; their business must be solely the sale abroad of Irish goods (to which they have title); they must not be the manufacturer of those goods or of any other goods; they must sell only by wholesale; they must have received a special trading house licence.  The licence will be a necessary condition for getting the tax reliefs.</P>
    <P>In this context, perhaps I should add that &ldquo;Goods&rdquo; means goods manufactured in Ireland, and includes data processing equipment and computer software services, and &ldquo;Selling by wholesale&rdquo; means selling to a person who either carries on a business of selling such goods or who uses the goods for the purpose of a trade or undertaking.</P>
    <P>As well as this, the leaflet will provide a checklist of the information that we will need to assess the application.  This covers six main areas: firstly, we will need to see the memorandum and articles of association of the proposed company. In most cases, perhaps all cases, we will be talking about newly-incorporated companies.  I should like to make the point that the name chosen for the company should preferably reflect their status as a special trading house.  Secondly, we will need details of the management structure of the company, and details of the promoters' expertise in relation to the chosen target markets and the product areas.  Thirdly, we will need details of the sources and value of the proposed equity finance as well as that of any bank facilities for working capital (where that is appropriate).</P>
    <P>Fourthly, we will need cash-flow projections for the first three years.  Fifthly, we will need details of any contracts to acquire products from manufacturers. Finally, we will, of course, need to know what are the company's marketing plans and overall strategy.</P>
    <P>The applications will be assessed by <Col N="2026" /> the Office of Trade and Marketing, after consultation with CÛras Tr·cht·la.  CTT will be required to make a recommendation to the Minister on each application. It is obvious, I think, that the on-the-ground expertise of CTT should be fully availed of in this evaluation process; they are the closest to the export marketplace, and it is right that the Minister making a decision should have access to CTT's informed view on the proposal.</P>
    <P>Section 2 also provides that the Minister can seek further information about an applicant's suitability.  One purpose of this is to avoid the need to impose an excessively detailed disclosure requirement on all applicants, whether relevant to their individual needs or not.  A further aspect of section 2 that I would like to refer to is the provision for an appeals procedure.  I am sure that Senators will agree that it is right that such a safeguard should exist.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from the draft of section 2 that there is no explicit provision for the revocation or withdrawal of a licence, once granted.  In this connection I would stress that the benefits accruing to special trading houses are the tax benefits which are set out in this year's Finance Bill, and those benefits are subject to the conditions laid down in that Bill.  If a special trading house fail or cease to meet those conditions, then the tax reliefs will not be granted.</P>
    <P>The licence is, as I have said, a necessary condition for the tax relief &mdash; but it is not a sufficient condition.  As the major benefit to the licensee is the tax relief, then obviously the major sanction which is applied is the withdrawal of those reliefs when the company no longer fulfil the conditions.  It was for this reason that I decided not to include in the Bill before the House explicit provisions for withdrawing licences.  However, I can assure Senators that I will be monitoring the operation of this scheme very carefully indeed.  If experience indicates the need for modification to the scheme, whether in relation to the withdrawal of licences or otherwise, I will have no hesitation in <Col N="2027" /> proposing the necessary amendments.</P>
    <P>I should also like to stress that the object here is to stimulate new exports, not to divert existing trade away from manufacturing companies to the new houses.  However this element will be assured by the workings of a competitive market-place; an existing exporter, who already enjoys the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax will not consider putting his goods through a trading house unless he judges that by doing so his sales will be increased.  Otherwise he would have no incentive whatever for doing so if he is already getting the reliefs as a manufacturer. The trading house will enjoy no advantages that the manufacturer on his own does not already enjoy, and since the tax reliefs are benefits on profits actually made, there is no possibility of the benefit being received twice.</P>
    <P>In this, as in other matters, I have not put anything into the Bill except what is strictly necessary to achieve our ends. The Bill is not long on detail.  Where possible, I have approached the matter by using existing provisions, including definitions, in order to get this idea up and running as soon as possible.  I have, therefore, resisted the temptation to introduce a whole array of new definitions. Instead, I have used those already existing in finance legislation and company law legislation, and I can assure the House that this approach reflects the advice of the parliamentary draftsman.  It may nonetheless be useful if I make a few brief comments on this matter of definitions.</P>
    <P>Senators will note that the term &ldquo;special trading house&rdquo; is itself defined in the Finance Bill, 1987, and as such requires no further definition in this Bill. Under the Finance Bill a special trading house is required to confine its activities to the selling of &ldquo;export goods&rdquo;.  This term is defined in finance legislation as &ldquo;goods manufactured in the State in the course of a trade,&rdquo; and such goods are deemed to be exported when they are transported out of the State.</P>
    <P>I mention these points merely by way of background, because the activities of <Col N="2028" /> the special trading houses are largely governed by the parameters and definitions already set down in the Finance Acts.  The purpose of this Bill is not to redefine matters but rather to give a new stimulus to new exports.</P>
    <P>We want to encourage the setting up of special trading houses, and we want to see them in action soon.  From the response we have had to the idea since it was first mooted, I am in no doubt at all that there is both a real need for this initiative and a readiness to get involved on the part of people with the necessary expertise.  I am extremely encouraged by the inquiries to date to my office.</P>
    <P>The special trading houses will not, of course, be a panacea.  They are a specific response to a particular problem, which is only one aspect of the overall export challenge that faces the country.  To use the analogy I played with earlier, they are one more tool in our toolbox.  I am confident that they will be an effective tool, and for that reason I have pleasure in recommending this Bill to Seanad …ireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is mian liomsa ar dt˙s f·ilte a chur roimh an Aire St·it go dtÌ an Teach seo agus f·ilte a chur roimh an mBille seo, An Bille um Onnmhairi˙ a Spreagadh (Leas˙), 1987.  I would like to welcome this Bill, the Export Promotion (Amendment) Bill, 1987.  This Bill has a dual purpose.  Firstly, it is to provide for the licensing of special trading houses by the Minister for Industry and Commerce subject to the Minister being satisfied that the applicant for the licence has, as required under section 2 (5) of the Bill: &ldquo;the structure, organisation and marketing ability to undertake successfully the sale of export goods&rdquo;.  The second purpose of the Bill is to increase the aggregate statutory limit from £160 million to £260 million for CÛras Tr·cht·la for the purpose of enabling them to exercise and perform their statutory functions for export promotion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome, therefore, the introduction of this Bill because over one-half of our gross national product is created by exports and exporting is at the heart and <Col N="2029" /> core of our economy.  These trading houses are the subject of legislation under the Finance Bill, 1987, which provides for an arrangement whereby trading houses specialising in the export of Irish goods will qualify for the 10 per cent corporation tax at present available only to the manufacturing industry.  I hope this Bill will provide a valuable incentive to increase our exports.  This is all the more essential and crucial in view of the fact that some 80 per cent of small Irish manufacturing firms do not export at all.</P>
    <P>The acid test, indeed the only yardstick by which the success of this legislation can be judged, is in the amount of new export sales generated.  Otherwise, the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce is creating an expensive bureaucracy, an expensive tax concession.  However, I welcome the assurance given by the Minister in the D·il when he stated on 23 June 1987:</P>
    <P>Let us not be in any doubt about this.  We are not creating a device for creative accountants to play with.  We are creating a framework to create additional exports for this country.  We are fully determined to restrict the enjoyment of these incentives to bona fide trading houses that will fill the structural gap that exists in our exporting system.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the licensing system will be simple, fair and fast.</P>
    <P>I hope that the provisions contained in the Bill will help us to face the fact, and indeed the challenge, that we have many indigenous companies which have exportable products but which do not have the resources to commit to exporting. Therefore, on behalf of my party, I welcome this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to formally congratulate Deputy SÈamus Brennan on his appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for Trade and Marketing.  I commend him for the speedy manner in which he has acted in introducing this very important legislation to the Seanad, namely, the Export Promotion (Amendment) Bill, 1987.  The <Col N="2030" /> Bill, as the Minister has said, is not long in detail but is very important in content.</P>
      <P>The Minister clearly recognises the importance of exports to the Irish economy. This is highlighted by the fact that two out of every three jobs in manufacturing depend on export markets. Irish exports are equivalent to approximately 50 per cent of the gross national product which is roughly four times the figure for Japan and nine times that of the United States.  The various reports commissioned in recent years, namely, the White Paper on Industrial Policy, the Sectoral Development Committee report and recommendation on marketing, and others, recognise the need for export-led growth as a means for Ireland's future industrial development and expansion.</P>
      <P>Ireland has been successful in recent years and exports have shown a steady growth.  However, this has been mainly achieved by the development of multinational companies for which we are very thankful.  The majority of these companies have clearly defined markets and are largely beyond our influence in exporting.  Therefore, we need to focus on indigenous Irish firms.  I believe the enactment of this Bill will go a long way in assisting these firms to expand and develop new export markets.  At present, the major weakness with Irish companies is that only 20 per cent of them export and the major part of the production is sold on the Irish market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to speak briefly on various problems that Irish companies may encounter when they sell to foreign markets, particularly in the Arab world.  As the Minister has just said, export marketing is not easy.  Many companies, when they enter into these markets, are operating in a country where customs and culture are alien to the Irish way of life. The working conditions in many cases are, to say the least, difficult, with temperatures of 120∫f. and relative humidity ranging from 35 per cent to 95 per cent. Also in these countries accommodation can be a problem.  I recall in the early seventies visiting a small state in the Arabian Gulf where there was just one <Col N="2031" /> decent hotel.  The alternative &mdash; and it is still in my mind's eye &mdash; was a hotel in the old sector of the town with a lopsided sign.  It was called The Good Luck Hotel.  You would certainly need good luck to survive in it.  On that occasion I had to sleep on a bench at the airport. This was the case in the early days of marketing in the Arab world.  People in these countries work six days a week, including Saturday and Sunday.  The day of recreation is Friday.  There is also an element of danger attached to living in these countries.  If you are unlucky enough to be driving a car which is involved in a fatal accident you could end up spending a long time in detention.  If you are caught in the production of the local brew, which is the equivalent of Irish poteen, and which can also be used as a paint remover&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the penalties are very severe.  However, there are compensations. Virtually no tax is paid; what you earn goes into your pocket.  I welcome the Minister for Finance's initiative in the recent Finance Act which will allow Irish people to earn salaries abroad which will not be subject to tax when they return home.</P>
      <P>I would like to add a note of warning to companies intending to get involved in contracting in these countries.  I would advise that when they enter into joint venture agreements they ensure that the local Arab partner, who will hold 51 per cent of the company, will also finance the company because the contracts are generally fixed price contracts.  There is often a very long delay in payment and in a very short space of time a company can have an overdraft of millions of pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many small Irish companies' first introduction to foreign markets is in conjunction with larger Irish-based companies who have established branches overseas.  Having successfully tendered and won an order, which often can be for substantial amounts of money, <Col N="2032" /> their problems just begin, first in financing the order and, second, in agreeing on acceptable terms of payment.  Many small companies, due to inexperience, have accepted letters of credit which are not confirmed by an international bank and as such are virtually not worth the paper they are written on.  The export documentation associated with letters of credit is a speciality in its own right and to negotiate credit such as this one may require eight or nine different documents &mdash; invoices, advice notes, packing lists, certificates of origin, bills of lading, black list certificates, weight certificates, shipping certificates stating that the ship is a conference vessel and will not stop at a black listed port en route to its destination, age certificates for the vessel and so on.  I am highlighting these problems because the commissioning of these special trading houses has a vital part to play in assisting small companies.</P>
    <P>Having produced the full complement of documents, which must be perfectly in compliance with the letter of credit, they must then be certified by a chamber of commerce in the exporting country and legalised by an Arab embassy, a facility which we had not got in Ireland until recently and all documents had to be sent to the Arabian Embassy in London via CTT and the Foreign Office and returned via the same route.</P>

I have given my ruling on this, and I want to put it on record this morning.  I have served in public life for a long time and I appreciate matters of deep national urgency for debate, but there are rules and Senators cannot come in every day asking the House to deal with urgent matters.  All elected members are aware of urgent matters in all Departments.  I will talk to you later about this if you are not happy with my ruling, but I cannot allow people's interpretation of urgent matters under Standing Order 29 to be used every day in this House.  When there is another way for more open debate &mdash; and as Cathaoirleach I have talked about this with my colleagues in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, and you are well aware of my strong views on it &mdash; we may have fewer demands under Standing Order 29 each day this House sits.</P>

    <Title>Export Promotion (Amendment) Bill, 1987: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition, the consignor may very often appoint an international vetting agent, such as Bureau Veritas, to visit the factory, examine the quality of the goods and advise a packing specification which is usually very onerous and expensive and very often not taken into <Col N="2035" /> account at the time of tender.  Due to inexperience, when they receive a letter of credit, companies fail to analyse immediately the terms and conditions which are often contradictory and impossible to comply with, and to request immediately the necessary alterations. They only discover this when the documents are submitted to the bank for payment and the goods are on the high seas.</P>
      <P>The procedure then is that the bank will advise the customer that the documentation has a number of discrepancies and the customer's reply is not to effect payment until the goods have arrived at their destination and have been inspected, which could be many months later.  The manufacturer is now in the unenviable position that (a) he has a cash flow problem and (b) should the customer fold up or decide to reject the goods, he has no guarantee of payment.</P>
      <P>Irish companies are competing on a world market and many of our foreign competitors are in a position to offer long-term credit, up to two years in some cases, supported by Government backing and insurance cover to guarantee payment. In many instances, these facilities are available to Irish companies.  It is now possible to check the creditworthiness of companies all over the world at very short notice, to get a credit rating on any particular company and to take out export credit insurance cover which guarantees payment in the event of the foreign company failing to honour the contract.</P>
      <P>I am taking time to highlight these points because the majority of small companies are not aware of the pitfalls or of the support available for the simple reason that they have not the time or the manpower to research them.  I know of companies who have opted out of exporting because of the trauma of trying to negotiate difficult and cleverly worded letters of credit and as a result had to wait many months for payment, simply because they had not got the necessary expertise within their company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also, to be successful in overseas markets requires a continuous presence in <Col N="2036" /> these countries and small marketing companies just cannot afford to maintain a full-time presence in the market place, and they rely heavily on CTT travel grants to subsidise their expenditure in sending sales representatives to these markets.  To maintain a full time overseas technical sales person could cost as much as £100,000 per year and, for the majority of Irish companies, this is just not on.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the special trading house will, I am sure, fill the vacuum that exists in the marketing of the products of small Irish companies throughout the world and provide the missing link to help firms cope with some of the problems I have just outlined.  The special trading house would need to offer a service where they would have representatives who would visit these markets on a regular basis and build up personal contacts with different companies.  I can assure the House that many orders are won, particularly in the Middle East, on a man to man basis, and if you are not a regular visitor and are not prepared to make time available to entertain the customer, your competitor will.  This is where the order is often won or lost. Many companies had success in the past, but because they were not in a financial position to call on a regular basis and allowed contacts to go stale, they lost out on a very lucrative market.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister stated that the special trading houses are not being established to take over the work of CTT but to complement it and that Irish firms may continue to avail of CTT services if they so wish and will be given the same support in the future.  I am pleased the Minister has increased the money allocation for the running of CTT to a more realistic figure of £260 million because often the travel grant or other financial support from CTT enables small Irish firms to continue to explore foreign markets. Without this support many small firms would just concentrate on the home market.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the need to finance foreign orders.  I am pleased to learn that the financial institutions have responded to the scheme in a very positive manner <Col N="2037" /> and are fully supportive of it.  The special trading houses is a major Government initiative and will undertake the marketing for Irish companies who lack the expertise to do so themselves.  I understand that the Minister intends to appoint a small number of high quality trading houses with financial reserves, expertise and plans to help to deal with the marketing bottleneck which undoubtedly exists.</P>
    <P>While it is recognised and agreed, as indicated in many reports, that marketing must be improved, many Irish companies, while maintaining steady employment, are not expanding.  The reason for this is that these companies are using old machinery and old methods, mainly because they were set up initially to fill a need in the home market, and because this is, comparatively speaking, a small market, they did not realise the necessary profits to invest in research and production and to update machinery.  Small viable firms must be identified and given computer-based modern machinery to allow them to manufacture competitively priced, high quality products which will sell on the more accessible European and British markets.  The days of relying entirely on the home market to maintain a firm are gone, as indicated by the Minister. The home market is wide open to foreign competition from companies who can offer lower prices through a vast scale of economies.  These Irish companies cannot be protected but they can be helped and the special trading houses will play a big part in this.</P>
    <P>The introduction of modern technology and machinery has, in the past, created industrial disputes because workers believed that the introduction of such machines would do the work of perhaps five men and would result in redundancies.  For small Irish manufacturing firms the opposite applies because these firms are at present serving a small domestic market and, with the assistance of modern machinery and methods, they can manufacture a more efficient and high quality product which will sell and will give the firms access to the EC market, the largest and one of <Col N="2038" /> the richest in the world.  By identifying these indigenous Irish companies and with the help of the special trading houses to do the marketing we could in a very short space of time go a long way towards solving our serious unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>The services of CTT, AnCO, National Manpower and other State bodies must be reviewed, co-ordinated and directed to assist the many Irish companies to maintain and increase the pace of their exports.  It is essential to approach our most important national business of exporting in a much more professional and intensive way.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his initiative in introducing this welcome Bill which will go a long way towards solving the serious blackspot in regard to marketing small Irish companies.  I look forward to its speedy enactment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the previous speakers in congratulating the Minister, Deputy Brennan, on his appointment to a very imaginative and important role in the stimulation of our exports.  I have been watching the Minister's progress with interest.  He has been applying himself to an area in which there was an obvious need to heighten the consciousness of people involved in manufacturing to the importance, for their survival, of stimulating and increasing their exports and looking for new markets.  I am pleased with the Minister's progress to date.  This Bill is another stage in that progress of dedication to the task at hand.  On behalf of the Labour group I wish the Minister luck in his appointment and hope that his efforts will meet with success, which will then further stimulate employment.  If exporting companies can improve their expertise they will provide further employment and the economy as a whole will benefit from the Minister's efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, in addition to increasing the limits that the Houses of the Oireachtas can make available to CTT by some £100 million, also brings before us this interesting and welcome concept of the special trading houses.  The first part of this legislation <Col N="2039" /> deals with increasing the figure from £160 million to £260 million.  I take it that that additional grant-in-aid the Government may make available to CTT is as a result of their concept of what will be required over the next three or four years in this area.  Although it does not commit the Government to the immediate expenditure of that amount I take it that CTT, from their contacts in this area feel there is a necessity for this additional facility to allow them to carry out the work they have been doing, with a large measure of success, in the past.</P>
    <P>I knew some of the previous people involved in CTT and I also know some of the present management board.  I have often attended their seminars and projects. They have had major success in bringing potential buyers to the marketplace. That was a tremendous initiative, successfully achieved.  They helped Irish industrialists to sell their goods on the export market.  Much satisfaction has been expressed by external buyers regarding the level of expertise already existing in Irish industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in his speech the present level of exports and their value which is about £10 billion according to current figures.  That is a substantial amount of money for a small country. We are extremely fortunate in that we are more than self-sufficient in most products particularly in the food area.  We are self-sufficient and should be in areas where there is an overlap of exports, particularly in the agricultural area.  It is a pity that so many people avail of the imported product when any Irish product is available. That means the Irish producer must meet that challenge and satisfy not only the export market but the home one also. From the agricultural point of view no other country can guarantee its products, their purity, quality and naturalness as can Ireland.  As the Minister for Tourism and Transport, Deputy Wilson said last evening, replying to the Second Stage of the Tourist Traffic Bill, the quality of our food is the saver of our services industry. No other country world wide &mdash; with the possible exception of Australia and New <Col N="2040" /> Zealand &mdash; can guarantee the same level of quality of food free from contamination from radiation as can Ireland. Apart from the one or two isolated animals discovered following the Chernobyl disaster, the vast majority of our food products are of the highest quality.  That is an indication of our success in the agricultural food export market.</P>
    <P>The other area in which we have been extremely successful is that of the pharmaceutical industries, technology and computers, software and all the other technological products produced by multinationals here.  There are many located in my constituency in south Tipperary, supplies of pharmaceutical and technological products.  They have been a shining light or inspiration in that area. They are experts in the export trade generally. That is why they located their plants here, in order to benefit from tax reliefs allowable on their exports.  The fact that they located plants here is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that in accordance with the Minister's concept of special trading houses these will be confined initially to Irish-owned companies and that emphasis will be placed overwhelmingly on that aspect.  There is no doubt that there are many successful Irish manufacturers who are incapable of competing on the export market.  As Senator Mulroy said they do not have the necessary finance. They may have the expertise but they do not have the necessary finance, even with the benefit of feasibility grants, to entertain the possibility of going abroad to identify markets and manufacture the products sought.  The concept of trading houses will be of tremendous assistance to smaller Irish companies who make products which could be sold abroad, with some assistance and a correlation of all efforts in this regard.  Even if there is an element of competitiveness in their dealings with other larger exporters so much the better.  It will keep everybody on their toes.  There is nothing wrong with that and it will not affect the Minister's concept in this regard.</P>
    <P>We have been making significant progress here in creating an awareness in the <Col N="2041" /> minds of manufacturers and exporters of the necessity to broaden their market bases worldwide.  With our accession to Europe those markets are continuing to expand beyond our wildest dreams.  It had been my hope that the recent ratification of the Single European Act &mdash; although there is no such evidence to date &mdash; would remove some of the barriers and deterrents obtaining in the area of border frontier controls and taxes, leading to a cohesion of the whole market place within Europe.  It is our hope that the provisions of the Single European Act, when implemented, will assist everybody, particularly within the European context.</P>
    <P>We have made a considerable impact by way of exports to the Middle East. They have been proven to be of tremendous value, particularly in agriculture.  As Senator Mulroy said, this constitutes a whole new area of trading.  I welcome the recent establishment of the Irish-Arab Chambers of Commerce to assist in the process of exporting to the Arab world. There is a potential to be tapped there not easily perceived from here even as a member of the European Community. We must ascertain how best to deal with these people who have a culture not dissimilar from ours but who have certainly a different method of trading.  One must understand those methods of trading and of payment.  This must be understood and known in advance.  Otherwise we could encounter difficulties by way of payment. Certainly it has been found in the area of trade with Libya, that this has been proven to be payment in kind; one does not always receive cash.  Sometimes it can be oil.  Unless one is in the oil business there is no point in being paid for one's products or exports in oil.  One might then be forced to purchase a tanker, put it on the high seas, get into the spot market in Rotterdam and elsewhere in order to convert their payments in kind into cash.  In the past that created problems for some of our exporters to Libya when there was a sudden collapse of the oil market and what may have been a valuable consignment of oil as a payment in kind for agricultural exports ultimately <Col N="2042" /> turned out to be considerably less valuable because of the crisis in the oil market.  This means that exporters to that area must be extremely cautious and be aware of the pitfalls.  I would hope that these trading houses would overcome or iron out some of those problems that can arise for our exporters in an area in which they may have no expertise whatsoever. They may be unable to provide marketing sales people at the source of supply or consumption of such products.</P>
    <P>The whole concept is a good one.  I will monitor its operation.  I am sure the trade union movement will give it wholehearted support, seeing it as an incentive to additional manufacturing employment here.  Obviously our services industry will improve and do well in the future as a result of the promotion of our tourist industry and our competitiveness in that area.  This means our manufacturers can produce something for tourists that relatively few other countries can provide. Even our weather is an attraction for some international tourists, particularly Americans.  They love the mist on the mountain; they like the breath of fresh air.  They do not necessarily come for sunshine.</P>
    <P>The future looks bright for the service industry.  Manufacturing industry has had its difficulties in the past and warrants every possible assistance in the future to ensure that it will expand and go on to better things.  Our economy as a whole would benefit from an improved manufacturing base at home, with a secure market abroad.  It would improve our balance of payments by way of trading with other countries within and without the EC.  Ultimately such can only be to the benefit of our economy and employment generally.  I welcome the concept. I wish the Minister luck in his task.  On behalf of the Labour Party I should say I am glad to be here as a guest in this Chamber.  The provisions of this Bill may augur for better things in the future for all of us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to extend a warm welcome to the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce <Col N="2043" /> with responsibility for Trade and Marketing, Deputy Seamus Brennan, to this, his first meeting of the Seanad.  He is no stranger to the Seanad.  He was a Member of the Seanad and a colleague of mine from 1977 to 1981.  I congratulate him on his new and very challenging post and wish him every success in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>It is already clear that there is a widespread welcome for this Bill on all sides of the House and I propose, therefore, to comment only briefly on the two main objectives of the Bill, namely, the creation of a licensing system for the special trading houses and, secondly, the raising of the ceiling on CÛras Tr·cht·la's level of grant-in-aid.  Let me first take the grant-in-aid.  This Bill will provide CÛras Tr·cht·la with additional money, the fuel by which the organisation work, in order to enable them to continue their efforts in the crucial field of export promotion and development.</P>
      <P>CÛras Tr·cht·la are doing a good job but, like any organisation, their policies should be, and need to be, reviewed from time to time.  I welcome, therefore the Minister's statement that he is now reviewing the policies of CÛras Tr·cht·la and critically evaluating their current strategy.  This review will be likely to result in changes in the future, some of which may take legislative form.  We can look forward to further legislation in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Policy review is, of course, a primary function of a Minister.  I welcome the Minister's emphasis on the importance of strategy and his urgent desire to accelerate strategically planned marketing.  If there is one characteristic that distinguishes excellently managed companies from others it is the quality of their strategy.  This is not confined only to the field of marketing.  My own speciality in UCD is in the field of human resources management.  A strategic approach to human resources management is of critical importance, just as it is in marketing and in other functions of business.  A strategic approach can be developed <Col N="2044" /> through educational and training activities designed to improve marketing skills in Irish companies.  This is, indeed, one of the functions of An CÛras Tr·cht·la. They have been at that for some time.</P>
    <P>I might add, since I am referring to the university sector, that the study of marketing is now part of the curriculum in third level institutions generally and quite specifically in UCD we have a number of undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in marketing where there is considerable emphasis on a strategic approach to marketing.  There are now many UCD graduates in marketing working in the Irish economy and abroad as well.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note from the Minister's speech that the restructuring of our export effort is, indeed, one of the main planks and one of the main tasks he has set for his Office.  On the question of exports, we are an island people with a very small home market.  We have a number of companies, that are, if you like, locked into the situation of only supplying this small home market. Exports are of the first importance.  They are essential to economic recovery and to national development generally and the creation of jobs.</P>
    <P>It is heartening to see the exceptional achievement in exports to date this year and we should take confidence from that achievement.  The estimate that exports this year will account to a record of £10 billion is particularly encouraging. However, there is no room for complacency. Impressive as the export figures are, they disguise a major weakness in domestic firms in that only 20 per cent actually export.  Marketing is a major weakness among domestic manufacturers and this is confirmed by reports of the National Economic and Social Council and the White Paper on Industrial Policy.  Indeed, statistical surveys of domestic manufacturers themselves confirm the very weakness that has already been underlined in official reports.</P>
    <P>Given that there is this serious deficiency, what then are the Government doing about the situation?  Quite a lot.  The Government are committed to <Col N="2045" /> increasing exports, especially exports from domestic firms.  They are tackling marketing deficiencies.  This commitment is reflected very visibly in the establishment, for the first time in the history of the State, of an Office of Trade and Marketing headed by the Minister, Deputy SÈamus Brennan.  This Office has responsibility for CÛras Tr·cht·la which, in turn, are concerned with improving the marketing capability of Irish firms.</P>
    <P>More needs to be done and this leads me to the second objective of the Bill, namely, a licensing system for special trading houses which would ensure that the 10 per cent tax concession, a very valuable concession, will apply to these trading houses that will engage in creating new exports for Ireland.  Why do we need special trading houses?  Foreign owned companies here make a very important contribution to the economy, as underlined in the Minister's opening statement, not least, of course, by accounting for most of the exports from Ireland.  Indeed, one of the main incentives for the location of foreign industry here is the access which our membership of the European Community provides to the teeming markets of Europe.</P>
    <P>What we need, however, are more Irish companies and the Minister has emphasised this.  We need more Irish companies participating in the export drive and special trading houses are designed to complement the range of initiatives already provided by An CÛras Tr·cht·la.  In other words, the special trading houses are being introduced to fill a structural gap in our marketing effort.  We need export-led growth, foreign and domestic, in order to generate sustainable employment.</P>
    <P>This Bill is of direct relevance to the main economic and social problem facing the country, namely, unemployment. Special trading houses will undertake marketing for Irish manufacturers who themselves lack the expertise to do the job.  This raises the question of how people with considerable export marketing experience &mdash; and they do exist in the country &mdash; can be actually attracted into this line of business.  How do we get <Col N="2046" /> them to invest and to establish special trading houses?  This year's Finance Bill provides, as I have already said, the concessionary corporation tax rate of 10 per cent for the trading houses.  This concession has been confined almost entirely to manufacturing companies up to the present time.  This is an important new departure by way of an incentive.</P>
    <P>Investment in special trading houses will also qualify for income tax relief under the business expansion scheme. This should directly help in securing the start-up capital that is necessary for this type of enterprise.  The considerable resources and experience of CÛras Tr·cht·la will also be available for special trading houses on the same basis as if they were manufacturing the goods they are exporting.</P>
    <P>Turning very briefly to a few specifics in relation to special trading houses, it is obvious that certain minimum conditions must be met before licences can be issued.  While I appreciate the necessity for these minimum requirements, it is vital that no undue delay be encountered when an application is being processed. The Minister has anticipated this possible hurdle and he is obviously keen to ensure that the licensing system will be simple, fair and fast and not handicapped by unnecessary bureaucratic procedures.</P>
    <P>I am glad to know that CÛras Tr·cht·la will assist the Office of Trade and Marketing in evaluating applications.  They have on the ground experience and they are in a position to complement the assessment made by the Department.  It will be evident from what I have said that I think special trading houses are an excellent idea.  They constitute an imaginative Government initiative, which is agreed all around.  It remains to be seen, however, how they will work out in practice.  It is noteworthy already that the financial institutions are fully behind the scheme.  It is also promising that a number of interested parties, people with suitable background, have already been identified as being interested in investing in these new trading houses.</P>
    <P>There is one issue I do want to raise in this context.  Clearly, there is a need for <Col N="2047" /> specific marketing assistance for domestic companies.  There is no question about that.  It is also clear that special trading houses will fill this gap.  I would hope, however &mdash; and I have some concern here and the position needs to be monitored &mdash; that the special trading houses will not actually take over entirely, if you like, the export marketing function of these companies.</P>
    <P>If I could draw an analogy from my own field of industrial relations, one of the main reasons these special trading houses are being introduced is to provide assistance for small companies in small economy.  In the field of industrial relations, very often small or very small companies rely on an employer organisation to conduct negotiations for them on pay and conditions.  In due course some of these small companies may grow and therefore they in turn will need their own marketing expertise.</P>
    <P>I would not like to see a situation where the special trading houses would prevent the growth and development of the marketing function within the companies that are being assisted.  That is something that should be monitored as the scheme develops.  I assume, therefore, that the Office of Trade and Marketing, together with CTT, will monitor the performance of the special trading houses to assess how they work out in practice.  It is very important that the trading houses get off to a good start.  It is probably preferable that only a small number of high calibre trading houses will come into existence who would have the special resources, experience and the plans to tackle the export marketing needs of domestic companies.</P>
    <P>Statistical data provide an important base for policy formulation at Government level.  Equally, of course, statistical data provide a very important base for company policy formulation.  There is a scarcity of data in respect of exports by domestic manufacturers and this has already been documented.  Data deficiencies are not peculiar to the field of exports.  Perhaps the Minister might give us his views on how the statistics position <Col N="2048" /> should and could be improved in the future.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome the Bill and wish it a speedy passage through the House.  I congratulate the Minister, Deputy SÈamus Brennan, for the speed with which he has brought this innovative measure before us.  It augurs very well for the future.</P>

      <P>Like other speakers I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on his appointment.  My association with the Minister goes back to the middle seventies when we occasionally played squash together.  He usually won.  At that stage he was in the marketing business.  He had a slightly more difficult product to market in those days.  I suspect that at one stage I may have been part of his target market in a fringe way.  He had great success in that project and I hope he has similar and perhaps even more sustained success in his new office.</P>

      <P>The Minister has probably the most exciting job in Government. It would be very good if we had some form of power sharing in Irish politics or a scheme whereby Opposition spokespersons could perhaps go in for a month or two months every year to change places with Ministers.  We have not quite got the preconditions yet for that sort of arrangement in Irish politics but if it did exist the Minister's job is the one that I would like to have the chance to have a go at, even for a number of months.  Like Senator Hillery, I commend the Minister on the speed with which he has moved to bring in this Bill. It is a simple measure but it will have beneficial consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech today, the Minister was right to emphasise the essential importance of developing our exports.  Unfortunately in the past all of us have heard exhortations to our manufacturers to export or perish, export or die.  Too often <Col N="2049" /> these exhortations have been counterproductive because they have not been supported by practical measures which take account of the very real problems facing Irish firms and especially small Irish firms.</P>
    <P>We have all seen examples over the past number of years of indigenous Irish goods of high quality coming on the market.  Our first reaction has usually been that these goods should be exported and they should do very well on foreign markets.  Far too often we have seen what we regarded as a good product failing to establish itself in the export area.  For a variety of reasons things have gone wrong.  These are usually to do with marketing, occasionally to do with delivery date, slackness or a bad run which destroys the image and the credibility of a range of products.  Far too often what we have regarded in the home market as an exportable product has failed when it has been put to the test.</P>
    <P>The Minister is absolutely right to take seriously the restructuring of CTT.  Yesterday we had probably the best debate of the current session in the Seanad on the question of tourism and Bord F·ilte. In the course of that debate the point was made that Bord F·ilte are around so long that they have virtually become part of the establishment.  Any organisation who are not constantly open to new ideas, who have not have to constantly face the challenge of justifying why they need to exist, who are not constantly striving to meet new targets and who do not have new challenges foisted upon them on an annual basis are not going to perform to their full capacity.  I hope that in restructuring CTT and looking in a root and branch way at the reasons for their very existence, the Minister will not in any way be hindered or sidetracked and that he will take in the widest range of use possible.  I hope especially that he will do something I know he is very good at and that he will go out to the marketplace to talk to the practitioners, go to the small firms who have failed and those who have succeeded; go out of the country to see how CTT work on the ground in other countries and that he will take into <Col N="2050" /> account the views of those who are involved at the coal face and not rely solely on the experts.  I know the Minister will take this approach.</P>
    <P>One very striking point in the Minister's speech and one very depressing aspect of our export performance is the disparity in success between Irish firms and foreign firms.  Foreign firms are far ahead of Irish firms in their exporting success.  We welcome their success, the jobs they create and the income they earn for the country but we also must ask ourselves some very serious questions as to why Irish firms have not been so successful. I am very glad that the Minister in trying to sort out this problem did not rush in and say: &ldquo;The State must spend more and the State must become more involved.&rdquo;  Obviously sharing a constituency with Deputy John Kelly for the past number of years has to some extent rubbed off on the Minister.  I am particularly impressed with the Minister when he says that we cannot and indeed we should not do the job of these companies for them and no State should be in the business of mollycoddling private companies who are not prepared to make an effort for themselves.  Ten or 12 years ago that statement might not have been made as clearly as it is made today.  There was a greater belief in the role of the State and in the duty of the State to get involved a short number of years ago.  We must be very careful as to when and where the State should be involved, the extent of State involvement and when the State should pull out from being involved.  The State should not be in the business of helping firms who are not in there fighting and who have not developed products which will sustain themselves in the export area.  Whether I can give credit for this to Deputy John Kelly, certainly the Minister is adopting the right approach in this area.</P>
    <P>A recent survey by the Small Firms Association asks why so many of our smaller firms were not exporting.  The reasons given were not all that surprising. Clearly the first and, for many firms, the biggest reason was our distance from the major markets and the transport costs <Col N="2051" /> involved.  That is not directly within the brief of the Minister and it is something perhaps over which we do not have a great deal of control.  A second reason given by many firms as to why they were not even thinking of exporting was their belief in their own lack of competitiveness. They did not believe that the products they were producing were sufficiently competitive in price and sometimes in quality to stand a chance of making an impact on foreign markets.</P>
    <P>There are other factors which inhibited the willingness of many of our small firms to get into the export market.  One of them apparently &mdash; it is surprising in 1987 &mdash; was that among many firms there was simply a lack of interest.  They were not interested in getting into foreign markets. They did not see it as something that was possible or as part of their business. They were content with their share of the local market.  In many cases I believe &mdash; the survey showed this also &mdash; that the lack of interest was a front for what was, at a deeper level, a lack of confidence, a lack of belief in themselves that they were good enough to go out and compete with a similar firm in Germany, Birmingham, France, or wherever and that they were good enough to compete with the hope of success.</P>
    <P>Other factors included &mdash; Senator Hillery mentioned one of them &mdash; the lack of marketing expertise in so many other smaller firms.  In spite of the growing number of marketing courses available, either full time or made available through seminars and so on, it still appears that a great number of our smaller firms simply lack basic marketing expertise.  Lack of funding is also a factor which inhibits many smaller firms from thinking of getting into the export market.</P>
    <P>Another factor, which surprised me, was the belief in many small firms that the amount of management time devoted to exports was excessive and did not justify the reward.  I presume time spent in travelling and seeking out new markets tended to take the management away from what they saw as their main function <Col N="2052" /> of running the business at home and that, when they balanced the possible gains in the export market against the dilution of managerial control at home, it was probably not worth their while getting into the export business.  Half of the firms in this survey &mdash; this brings me back to CTT &mdash; complained of the lack of appropriate and easily understandable information concerning the range of advice and assistance which CTT were offering. They felt CTT to be remote from them. There was some sort of a credibility gap or a gap of understanding between them. This may not be CTT's fault.  I read much of their literature and I find it understandable. I found in many conversations with people in CTT that it is possible to get hold of that information.  Nonetheless, from the small firms' survey it appears that many firms do not have that contact with CTT and do not seem to have the confidence to make it.</P>
    <P>While I am dealing with the question of surveys, I should mention also that another recent survey carried out for the Small Firms Association &mdash; I think the Minister is familiar with it; I saw his photograph in the paper today with that excellent Director of the Small Firms Association, Mr. Frank Mulcahy &mdash; showed that for smaller firms the availability of export credit insurance was the key factor in the development of their exports and that at present export credit insurance was difficult.  They found it difficult to avail of; they found it expensive; it was not well marketed; information was frequently out of date and the cost of administration was too high.  I should like the Minister to comment on that.</P>
    <P>I am very grateful to the Small Firms Association for so much material for my brief contribution today.  The point is made in the newsletter of the Small Firms Association, Volume 3 No. 5, 8 June 1987, that there are over 1,500 exporting firms in Ireland of which some 600 are Irish owned &mdash; roughly what the Minister said in his speech about the dominance of foreign owned exporting firms.  The point was made that the central thrust of the industrial policy, as stated by the Minister, is to foster the development <Col N="2053" /> and diversification of established export orientated Irish firms.  In support of this drive there are more than 20 institutions and organisations supporting and checking on progress.  These bodies employ more than 3,500 people which, according to this article, equates to a ratio of six employees to every one exporting indigenous firm.  It makes the point that this multiplicity of organisations, duplication of effort and disaggregation of support seriously limits the operational effectiveness of the support available. Collectively, it is claimed, these organisations have committed the cardinal sin against marketing.  They have failed to communicate effectively the range of support available.  That is a very strong statement.  It is obviously made from the point of view of the small firms, but it is a point of view on which I would like to hear the comments of the Minister.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, one of the key sentences in the Minister's speech is that exporting is not easy.  Again, we are back to a situation where the criticism of those who fail to export is often based on a misconception that it is easy to get out there and export.  Well, clearly it is not.  The range of preconditions necessary for successful exporting are wide and diverse. There is no single key to success, but there are a number of factors to which the wider community could be turning its attention.  Again, Senator Hillery mentioned the growing number of schools of marketing, studies of marketing and marketing courses which are available in the third level institutions.  I suspect, however, that we are only at the beginning as far as marketing is concerned and I wonder if we yet have the range of expertise available in sufficient numbers to ensure that the marketing is of a high quality fairly universally.  I suspect from looking at some marketing courses they are not of the highest level and we may have people coming out with poor qualifications in marketing where, in fact, more harm than good may be done. Nonetheless, I obviously support the growth in marketing courses.</P>
    <P>Languages are an old hobby-horse as far as export success is concerned.  We <Col N="2054" /> still have not the commitment to the study of modern European languages in our secondary schools and universities. We could do a great deal more.  In this I am going to be parochial and commend the president of University College, Dublin, for one section of the development plan for the college which was exclusively reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> today.  He proposes to give emphasis to the development, within a business and a technological context, of Chinese and Japanese studies.  We have been almost totally negligent in this area and clearly we will need to establish bridgeheads into China, Japan and Taiwan.</P>
    <P>As a person who has been to Taiwan and who is aware of the diplomatic complexities of the subject, I would like to see us establishing a stronger trading relationship with Taiwan where, I believe, there is a willingness to invest in this country and where there is a market for some of our goods.  I am digressing slightly.  We need to develop this area of expertise in Chinese and Japanese studies. Those who control educational policy in this country should be left in no doubt whatsoever of the national need to concentrate resources in this and similar areas.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the Bill and wish him success in his very exciting and challenging portfolio.  We on this side of the House welcome and support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, and congratulate him on making it from the Seanad to the post he now holds.  I wish him success in the future.  He has a fairly sizeable job and one in which everybody in the country is interested.  Our future depends, to some extent, on how successful the Minister is in his campaign.  I am basically interested in this matter.  For our survival we must be interested in selling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On one occasion when I was on a trip to America I saw what I thought was best in selling.  Somebody said in the House yesterday that we should employ foreigners, <Col N="2055" /> or people in foreign countries, to sell tourism on our behalf and the thought crossed my mind that this is not what the Japanese would do.</P>
    <P>During my trip to the US a group of us noticed that the Japanese succeeded in America when they rented shops and manned them with their own personnel to sell their transistors, watches and all the electrical gear the Japanese are so good at producing.  They did not entrust the task to American agents or to any other agents.  They had highly skilled personnel from Japan.  They went to a country where their goods were being sold and they adopted the best tactics.  The success of Japan in selling to the world has been largely due to their technology and their ability to sell.  In many areas we have the capability of producing good products that are wanted abroad but we fall down on our ability to sell.  All of us join with the Minister in hoping he will be successful in his efforts.  We will give him whatever support we can.  I suggest that his campaign should start in the secondary schools.</P>
    <P>Recently at a regional college in Donegal I said that if we can train young boys and girls to be salespersons there is no danger of them not getting a job.  Any young boy or girl leaving secondary school or leaving third level college with the ability to sell will automatically be employed because there is a shortage, even in the country, of people with the ability to sell.  Many of our firms are in serious difficulty because they do not have the technical know-how and expertise to sell.  All too often, whether it be a breadman, somebody selling a product from door-to-door, or the man who drives a van and owns a small business he has to do the selling himself.  It is not part of our make-up.  Selling is not what we are best at.  It is important to put emphasis and effort, as well as to have money set aside, on marketing as one of our major areas for development.  I am serious when I say I will give every support and commitment to the Minister. I hope he will extend this campaign of making people aware of marketing into <Col N="2056" /> our schools.  He should highlight the possibilities for our young people and also the dangers if we do not place more emphasis on marketing.</P>
    <P>I would like to instance how the French sell their fruit and vegetables and farm products from Brittany.  When their crop of cauliflower and other products are ready, they do not sit back and get on the telex and expect other countries to be aware of their readiness to sell.  They send their representatives out in advance, whether to Liverpool or Dublin.  They rent a portakabin, a telex, a telephone and hire a secretary and they are in touch with the market immediately.  They do not stand waiting for the orders to come and their cauliflower to rot.  The Dutch do the exact same in every country to which they export.  From time to time we ask why the Dutch and French are so successful in selling their apples, vegetables, tomatoes, and all of their produce which is of a perishable nature. It has to be sold and delivered when fresh.  They depend only on those trained to sell, who have the experience, background knowledge and a commitment to their country.  If we do not embark on a similar sales approach I believe we are not doing the best for the country.</P>
    <P>We have to set up shop in whatever country we intend to export to.  We have probably a serious danger of duplication. I mentioned that Bord F·ilte have offices abroad in different countries.  I wonder whether there could be more co-ordination and harmonisation between our embassies and trade missions and those that sell?  I ask the Minister to examine the feasibility of CÛras Tracht·la co-ordinating our sales team in whatever country we are in in order to improve the exchange of information.  The elimination of duplication and waste is important because at the end of the day our resources to support the sales campaign necessary to sustain productivity in this country are scarce and have to be well spent.</P>
    <P>I will refer to one of the worst examples of a sales operation which I hope will soon be eliminated.  We have a potato marketing company occupying two <Col N="2057" /> offices in Merrion Square &mdash; a very expensive office site and expensive rent. There are probably 20 people working there.  We have a whole sales organisation, which I venture to say is the worst in Ireland.  We export 10,000 tonnes of seed potatoes; all of which come from County Donegal, none from anywhere else.  We have directors of a potato marketing company who travel from Donegal about five or six times a year to meet in the Merrion Square headquarters to decide what they are going to do about exporting potatoes that initially came from Donegal.  That is the worst, the sloppiest and the most outdated method of selling.  God forbid that we have much repetition of that sort of administration and sales effort.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Little wonder.  Even though those people there have been questioned, the Departments and Government after Government have failed to recognise where the difficulties are.  The Department of Agriculture and Food nominated two representatives to the potato marketing company and they were totally ineffective; I understand they are not on the board of the potato marketing company.  I am not reluctant to highlight that again; I have mentioned it so many times that it is like playing a record again but it has to be played and it has to be said and it has to be brought to the notice of every Minister and every Government Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister, Deputy SÈamus Brennan, is serious and committed to his task of selling.  I hope he does not have many companies similar to the potato marketing company in Merrion Square. If so, his task will be even more difficult than it should be.  It is important that the Minister succeeds.  It is important for all of us.  The future for many of our young people lies in how successful we, as a country, will be in selling our goods.  I believe strongly that those who lecture and teach should tell our young people that there is a enormous potential in this <Col N="2058" /> area that we cannot afford to neglect.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators for their support and encouragement which I value greatly.  It is difficult in political life to get a measure on which you can get cross-party agreement.  It is very exciting that we have been able to do it in this business of exporting which is important for the nation.  I will deal very quickly with some individual contributions and then conclude with some general remarks.  I will not detain the House long.</P>
      <P>Senator Kennedy, in welcoming the Bill for which I thank him, had a query in regard to what he called expensive tax breaks.  He wondered whether, if companies did not perform it could then turn out to be an expensive tax break.  I appreciate the Senator's concern, but I must explain to him very crisply that this is a &ldquo;no foal no fee&rdquo; approach to exporting &mdash; I know that is a topical analogy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in that, if the company do not achieve the exports, they do not get the tax break.  Therefore, it can be expensive in that regard.  No exports, no tax break &mdash; therefore it is totally linked.  I can reassure Senator Kennedy that I am convinced it will be a success but its failure at worst would just mean that we did not get the exports.  No tax would be foregone in those circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to tell Senator Mulroy how much I admired his very practical approach and his story about the &ldquo;good luck&rdquo; hotel which he told so well and his talk about the documentation and letters of credit.  That demonstrates what I was trying to say.  Exporting is hard work.  It is difficult, not easy.  Stories like that about exporting in the early days, literally dragging your suitcase around the world, almost sleeping rough in hotels such as the Senator's &ldquo;good luck&rdquo; one, show in a dramatic way how difficult exporting can be.  I have been very impressed with <Col N="2059" /> the band of exporters with whom I have had occasion to travel in recent weeks. Sometimes they are referred to as junketeers, but that is a pity.  These people live out of suitcases, spend weeks away from home, live in one hotel after another trying to break into markets through sheer determination and with very small resources.  Their energy is terrific and I admire them greatly.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulroy captured in his address to the House the physical and human dimension to exporting and how quickly the shine wears off foreign travel if you have to do it every Monday morning, year in year out, to try to get your exports moving.  It is an entirely different type of travel from the fortnight in Portugal or Spain on the package tour, I assure anybody who wants to try it.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulroy mentioned the question of documentation.  I am told that documentation costs this economy £150 million a year.  That is excessive exporting documentation.  One of the things I am trying to do at the moment with the Council of Ministers dealing with the internal market on a monthly basis in Brussels is to reduce the amount of documentation to an absolute minimum.  It makes sense in terms of our integration within the EC that the volume of export documentation clearly will be reducing as the internal market completes itself.  I am determined to put a hole in that £150 million.  It is unnecessary expense and I appreciate the Senator's views on it.</P>
    <P>I want to thank Senator Ferris for his extremely generous compliments and welcome on behalf of the Labour Party. I know he has a particular concern &mdash; as we all have but he emphasised it rather well &mdash; about the question of employment. The reason we are doing all of this, that we are trying to get exports up and to get marketing brought to the fore, is that at the end of the day it will spin off and provide employment for Irish people.  Wealth on its own, if it does not spin off into the creation of sustainable <Col N="2060" /> employment, sustainable jobs, is quite useless to the country.</P>

      <P>In that context I am glad to hear Senator Ferris laying emphasis on employing our own Irish people. We can do that by being successful at exporting and I hope these trading houses will contribute to that.</P>
      <P>He commented very favourably on the inward buyer programme of CTT.  I did not know too much about that until recently when I had occasion to observe it.  Certainly it is an intriguing programme and I hope CTT can be even more successful at it.  In that programme they fly into Ireland buyers from abroad.  We have just entertained French and German buyers.  They came here at CTT's invitation.  They toured Irish industry.  They met their counterparts in Ireland.  They met Irish exporters and the State was able to say to them in an official way that we value their business.  We are beginning now to get quite a volume of business from that system of bringing buyers into Ireland so that they can get the feeling of what we are trying to do here and a feeling for the kind of country this is.  In many ways that has been even more successful than our own people visiting the marketplace.  I hope we can improve on that and encourage it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ferris laid emphasis on quality. I do not think that the House needs a lecture from me or anybody in regard to quality.  I spent a few days in Germany and was told there by the many importers into Germany that they could and would buy a great deal more Irish products but we had to stop regarding &ldquo;delivery date&rdquo; as an aspiration and see them for what they are, firm delivery dates.  We have to see quality specifications for what they are, firm quality specifications not &ldquo;sure, it is near enough&rdquo;.  In general Irish industry is not like that, but there are very bad black spots.  These black spots were brought to my attention by some German industrialists and I have taken action in regard to those cases already.  For anybody who is interested in exporting, gets <Col N="2061" /> the quality right and delivers on time, there are tremendous opportunities, but if you do not do that you are better off not to be in the business of Irish exporting because you are only giving the country and Irish industry a bad name.  I have told that to Irish industry in no uncertain terms on many occasions.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris asked about the £260 million, wondering if this was the correct figure.  I will take the opportunity to explain that this Bill is not giving money to CTT.  It is just enabling the Oireachtas to vote money to CTT on an annual basis. Therefore, the figure of £260 million is, I suppose, a &ldquo;guesstimate&rdquo; of the funds which CTT may require over a number of years.  It is just an upper limit and ties nobody's hands in any way.  It does not vote money; the money is voted by the Estimate debate, not by this Bill.  That is just an enabling section.  The substantial part of this Bill deals with trading houses.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris asked me whether we would license foreign companies in regard to trading houses.  He said he was glad that only Irish companies would be licensed.  I should clear that up with the Senator because that is not actually the case.  We will consider for licences any company incorporated in Ireland.  I do not believe we have the option of being specific in regard to the nationality of the owner of the firm.  The important point here is that whoever owns the firm, if it is incorporated in Ireland, buys Irish manufactured goods and exports Irish manufactured goods, it is doing the State a service and as such we will certainly consider it.  We would be foolish to rule out foreign involvement because very often they have the international links in the marketplace which a successful trading house might require.  I want to clear that up for the record because it would be wrong to give the impression that only Irish companies would be licensed.</P>
    <P>I want to thank Senator Hillary for his welcome and his compliments.  He talked about the need for a review of CTT and particularly the need for a strategic approach.  I say to him that that is precisely <Col N="2062" /> the path on which I am going at the moment.  I think everybody agrees, and CTT themselves agree, that they are not really interested in the exporter who drops in for a quick grant, a quick trip to Japan or the US.  That is not the way we want to support Irish exporters.  We want to support them on the basis that they have a strategic, worked out, thought out approach to a marketplace over a long period, not looking for the quick fix trip at the expense of the Irish taxpayer.  That is not to say that has been going on to any great extent, because I suppose very often in business you have to take a risk and you have to take an initiative based on some gut feeling that you might do something at the end of it.  We cannot remove that instinct from CTT's armoury but, at the same time, they have to behave in a strategic way and they have to support serious Irish exporters.  In that regard I should say to the House now that CTT will support serious Irish exporters but only serious Irish exporters.  They will not support any organisation or individuals who are not serious about the task of exporting.</P>
    <P>Senator Hillery spoke about the marketing courses.  I had the privilege of visiting UCD recently and discussing with the people there the progress and performance of their marketing courses.  At the moment I am having a close look at the whole business of marketing education and training.  There are a number of institutions and third level colleges, NIHE, IMI and AnCO, in the business of marketing education.  Over the summer I hope to conclude a study of how best we can co-ordinate all of these courses and activities so that they support Irish marketeers. A number of other Departments are involved in this because the institutions report to different Ministers.  I will be talking to my colleagues about how we can pull the marketing training and education business together.</P>
    <P>Senator Hillery had some specific questions. He supported the view that the application of the trading houses should be simple, fair and fast.  I assure the Senator that is why we are introducing this measure so quickly and why over the <Col N="2063" /> summer months we hope to get a small number of high power trading companies into the marketplace and have them trading before the year is out.  That is the target and I hope the procedure will be simple, fair and fast.  That is why I have gone for a very small Bill rather than one that was tied down in detail.  I wanted to avoid particularly the problems that arose with the business expansion scheme a couple of years ago.  When the Bill was brought in it contained a number of pages stating who could and could not apply.  It was so tied down in red tape that in the end the whole business expansion scheme had to be rejigged and loosened up.  It is now beginning to work but in its early days the instigators of it were so cautious that nobody took it up.  I do not want that to happen to this measure.  It is a measure that is tax-led and I want to keep it nice and simple and get it up and running quickly.</P>
    <P>The licensing system will ensure that people play the game and do not abuse the system.  As I said in my speech, I do not want this to become the plaything of accountants lying on the shelves of tax experts as part of their tax shelter information to their clients.</P>
    <P>That it certainly will not become. Neither will it become a haven for cowboys who decide that this is another area of corporate development that they should be involved in.  We are very keen to watch the number of firms that grow here and monitor them very carefully. What I am interested in is a small number of well financed companies headed by experienced competent people who will increase Irish exports over what they are at present rather than taking the other approach and having this as part of someone's tax toolkit.  That I will not let it become.</P>
    <P>Senator Hillery was also worried that it would take over from small manufacturing companies.  That is a risk we have to take just now because Irish manufacturers by definition are production led. If exporting is the major national priority now, which I believe it is considering we do not have the option of pump priming <Col N="2064" /> or reflating the economy by throwing money into it, the only way we can grow is to increase exports.  If we leave it entirely to the small manufacturer to do that it will develop at too slow a pace for us to get the exports we need.  A manufacturer can learn a lot from a trading house if the house is trading successfully and the manufacturer is selling to it.  That is a reason for the manufacturer to get into exporting and not to give it up and leave it entirely to a trading house.  We can run a dual system very quickly.  The Senator is right about the scarcity of statistical data and as a result of his comments today I will institute an inquiry into that.  We find it difficult to get information from small firms in regard to much of their activity.  Perhaps a lot of the Fourth Directive information and so on will start to come through now in that regard.  Statistics are very scarce in regard to exporting by small companies and I hope to make some progress on that over the summer.</P>
    <P>If Senator Manning is really keen on doing this job there are some days when I would be delighted to let him have it because it can become difficult.  The Senator quite rightly talked about the role of CTT and the need to restructure it.  One of the difficulties with an agency like CTT, just like Bord F·ilte, is now to measure their performance.  CTT's budget last year was of the order of £23 million.  The key question we have to ask is, if CTT were not there and we did not spend that £23 million would our exports still be £10 billion?  From what I have seen to date I do not think they would have grown to that extent.  CTT's role down the years has been very valuable and very pivotal.  It is great to go into a marketplace where you are totally unknown and find an Irish representative who can introduce you to possible purchasers and can play that pivotal role. CTT's role is necessary and essential. What I have to do is try to restructure and refocus it in such a way that, with scarce resources, it can get the maximum exports for us.</P>
    <P>The Senator also spoke about the role of the State.  In that regard I had a very <Col N="2065" /> quick thought in setting up these special trading houses.  I had a look at a previous experience that was tried about 1957 or 1958.  The State had an involvement in it but it struck me that that failed, and it failed for many reasons which are well documented.  I do not think it would be appropriate just now to set up a trading house or any kind of an activity in which the State would take an equity share because it would be too bureaucratic and too slow to move.  There are many Irish entrepreneurs in the woodwork still.  If we can point them in the direction of this tax break they will come out and get the exports for us.</P>
    <P>The Senator also spoke about the question of Chinese and Japanese languages. I have been lecturing Irish industries in recent months to try to do something about the state of languages.  We should extend our horizons beyond European languages.  The growth in the marketplace is not just in Europe.  In that regard I led a trade mission recently to Singapore and Malaysia where there is a strong Chinese influence.  There are tremendous opportunities there and it would be flattering for those people if our exporters were able to converse with them in their own languages.  We are having a close look at what we can do to try to get people to be serious about learning the languages.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan is a very practical businessman with a lot of experience.  He certainly knows what he is talking about when he says that we should start at secondary schools to make people conscious of the necessity to sell, market and export.  That is something about which I will be talking to the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, over the summer.  Senator McGowan raised the question of potato exporting and the marketing board.  I am very interested in what he said; I was not aware of that and I will have a very close look at it over the next few days to see whether that operation can somehow become part of the marketing review which we are carrying on over the summer.  I want to thank Senators for the comments they made in <Col N="2066" /> the course of the debate today.</P>
    <P>To conclude in a general way, the whole concept behind the trading house is to bring into the business of exporting people who are not already in that business. It is too important a job to be left just to Irish manufacturers.  That is too narrow a base.  In that regard I should point out that two-thirds of all our exports at the moment come from multinationals and the other one-third comes from our own companies.  Eighty per cent of Irish companies are not exporting.  That is a very vulnerable situation which can only be redressed if all of that one-third of Irish companies get into the exporting business.  With only 20 per cent of them in it at the moment it is much too vulnerable and much too narrow a base.  I came to the conclusion that we needed some special new initiatives to try to grow that one-third area and that is how we came up with the idea of trading houses.</P>
    <P>The Japanese are very successful in this regard.  Their trading houses are based on more of a conglomerate idea where they have financial services in banking and all sorts of activities involved.  Ours are starting out very small, just on exporting, but I would not place any limit to their movement or to their march.  Perhaps they might appear on Irish stock exchanges some day and might grow to be truly international trading houses in the model of those in Japan and some European countries.</P>
    <P>We should be conscious of the diversification of our exports at the moment. One-third of our exports go to Britain, one-third go to Continental Europe and one-third go elsewhere.  That underlines the question of languages that Senator Manning spoke about.  It also underlines how diversified our effort now is.  While the EC is important to us, it is not the only marketplace.  There are markets beyond the EC which we should not ignore just because we are members of the EC.</P>
    <P>I am looking carefully at the question of earnings by CTT.  While CTT have funds available to them to run their operation, I am talking to them at the moment about trying to self-finance a number of their activities.  If CTT successfully help <Col N="2067" /> a company and that company are very satisfied, get increased exports and become so successful that they are considering stock exchange quotations and the like, I wonder whether it might not be appropriate to ask that company to pay CTT for their consultancy advice, support and activity.  Successful business people will respect that kind of thinking which is based on the notion that, if CTT are successful in helping them and they are able to measure that success, the least the Irish taxpayer and CTT should be entitled to is to recoup some of the funds.</P>
    <P>I have to stress that that is just thinking out loud at this stage and we have not advanced it any further.  It seems to be an idea I should be looking at very carefully because, if an ordinary company consult ordinary consultants they usually end up paying them, whether they are successful or not.  We should look particularly at successful cases but we must be careful not to rule out existing help to small, fledgling companies or make them feel they will have a large tab to pay at the end.  I do not think that applies to successful companies.  I am having a close look at that, particularly the type of revenue it would raise and the type of relationship it would lead to between the Irish Export Board and the exporter.</P>
    <P>I want to thank Members of the Seanad for their very generous welcome for this Bill, and to say that this is an experiment which tells Irish entrepreneurs that if they export Irish goods they can get the same tax break the Irish manufacturer gets. That means anybody who exports gets the same thank you from the State, whether they are manufacturers or trading companies.  We watch them very carefully and make sure they are up and running as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>This country at this time does not have the option of pump priming and reflating the economy.  It only has the option of getting the books right on the one hand and, in a parallel fashion, growing by exporting.  If that is the national priority, these kinds of measures, with no absolute guarantee of success, have to be tried to see whether we can boost exporting and <Col N="2068" /> Irish marketing.  One objective I have is to take the soft edge off the question of marketing.  It is not a fuzzy subject; it is the cold face of what Irish business should be doing.  In that regard I want to take the soft edge off the concept of marketing and put it where it belongs which is at the cold face of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>The Office of Trade and Marketing is an ideas office.  I will take ideas from any party, Senator, Deputy, or any member of Irish industry.  I am touring Irish industry at the moment collecting those ideas to see how we can make them work.  This is an ideas office which is open for ideas and we will implement them as quickly and as sharply as possible but they have to be hard nosed, workable and business like.  Broad generalisations, lectures and exhortations will not get us anywhere. We have to have hard nosed, workable ideas.  My door is open for those ideas and I will implement them as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>In the few short months I have had the honour to hold this post, I have come to one conclusion, that is, that there are terrific opportunities all round the world for Irish goods and services and the only thing stopping us availing of them is our own internal organisation and our own determination.  The business is definitely out there.  There is enough business out there to make sure that nobody needs to leave this country and nobody needs to be unemployed.  All we have to do is to go out there and get it.  I hope these special trading houses will set about doing that immediately.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their warm welcome for this Bill and I commend it to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like clarification from the Minister on section 2. The Minister sought to avoid what he saw as the mistake of the business expansion scheme in its early stages by having this section written in a very clear and a very bare, bald way.  I should like elaboration on subsection (2) which states that every application for a licence in respect of a special trading house shall be in such form as may be approved by the Minister, and it then goes on to state the way in which the Minister may refuse and that the person may reapply.  I am a little concerned that a scheme which is meant to have speed as its essence may, because of a lack of clarity in the early stages, have people making applications without being fully aware of what exactly is expected, what the standards and conditions are.</P>
      <P>The intention behind this Bill is for speedy decisions but frequently, as we know from experience, officials down the line for whatever reason &mdash; they may have a bad day, they may not have the information or they may be cautious &mdash; may not give the full information and a company might find itself to-ing and froing to the relevant people.  This may build up frustration and people may decide it is not worth it, or there may be some disparity between one application and another.  Under this section will the Minister be preparing very clear guidelines for universal application so that a company will know exactly what will or will not be relevant when they make an application and thus speed up the whole procedure?</P>

      <P>Next Monday, I am launching a <Col N="2070" /> detailed leaflet which will be provided to every applicant.  It will point out the six main areas which the applicants will be asked to cover: the memorandum and articles of association, the details of management structure, the source and value of proposed equity finance, the cash flow projections, the details of any contracts which they have with manufacturers, and the company's overall marketing and sales strategy.  I am happy that after the launch of those details on Monday every applicant will have full information available and there is no reason why they should not respond to it as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Senator's concern. When there is a licensing system involved or something to do with the Revenue Commissioners, there is always a fear that it will be delayed by bureaucratic approaches and strangled in some way. You cannot allow for that in legislation; all you can allow for in legislation is the licensing system.  No matter what type of legislation you bring in, you are depending on the goodwill and sense of urgency of the people behind the scheme because if people are not energetic, encouraged by it and enthusiastic about it the best drafted scheme can get delayed and bogged down for many lengthy periods. I share a little of the Senator's worry but I think this will be covered in the publication of this document on Monday next which will lay out the criteria in detail.  There is no time limit within which the Minister must give a decision, and that is something we could have considered, but we did not put it in the legislation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1) (f), line 4, after &ldquo;groups&rdquo;, to insert, &ldquo;, voluntary organisations,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This calls for the inclusion of voluntary organisations so that they can form part of the web of the direct and indirect relationships of both An Foras and the subsidiary.  While voluntary organisations might not be in the structure they play a very important role.  Voluntary organisations also solve problems in particular areas and there is a great similarity between them and other bodies who have access to the services.  Therefore, they should be included with community groups, co-operative workers, etc., as their behavioural patterns are very similar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with the comments about voluntary organisations made by Senator <Col N="2072" /> Harte, but the purpose of section 4 (1) (f) is to allow F¡S to operate community-based enterprise activities such as the community enterprise programme which is well known as CEP and operated by the Youth Employment Agency.  Many of the community groups assisted under the programme are voluntary and a great many of the better known schemes in the city were undertaken by voluntary bodies, as Senator Harte and I know.</P>
      <P>The community aspect of the projects is significant therefore, voluntary organisations are not excluded provided their project activities are community-orientated and that the community element takes precedence.  However, it would not be appropriate to include a specific reference to voluntary organisations in the Bill as this would widen the scope of the programmes beyond their present objectives.  The existing Manpower agencies assist voluntary organisations through employment and training schemes, other than the community enterprise programme, and this will continue to be part of the work and functions of F¡S when it is established next year.</P>
      <P>The Senator's concerns regarding voluntary organisations are covered because the community aspect is essential to carry on the good work done by voluntary organisations under the CEP scheme.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1) (g), lines 14 and 15, to delete &ldquo;in a state that is a member of the European Communities&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;outside the State&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with employment outside the State.  It is a little strange to confine ourselves to the EC.  We are using <Col N="2073" /> the term &ldquo;outside the State&rdquo; to embrace other places such as Northern Ireland and America.  People might go to Third World countries on a voluntary basis and would need advice or service either from An Foras or the subsidiary, particularly the subsidiary.</P>
    <P>A lot of money has been spent on training people, trying to place them and not being successful.  Although the State pays money to them to help them over their financial difficulties by means of the dole or unemployment assistance, it is not prepared to go a little bit further and give support outside the EC, in the sense of having access to the subsidiary.  This is illogical.  Many Irish people have problems in America because they are there illegally and perhaps service and advice could be provided for them.  Perhaps the Minister will consider this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Community is a single labour market and there is freedom of movement between member states.  The EC operates an international vacancy notification and job placement service for all the countries.  It is like one Manpower authority for the EC which helps to ensure that people who take up employment abroad are advised and informed about conditions in the country and the place of work and will be supported by a Government agency if necessary.  The National Manpower Service are responsible for implementing these procedures in this country and section 4(1)(g) will enable the new organisation to continue this work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment of section 4(1)(g) as requested by Senator Harte to apply to all countries outside the State would not be possible on practical and legal grounds.  Apart from the fact that the detailed information would not be readily available on the employment labour market in these countries, the filling of jobs &mdash; how they would be filled and by whom &mdash; would be a matter for the country concerned.  This would involve work permits, visas and so on which would not be readily within our control or within the control of the agreements <Col N="2074" /> that cover the European Community.  I am advised that if this amendment were accepted, the F¡S organisation would be obliged to assist persons to obtain employment in a country in any part of the world such as the United States, Australia or Japan and that would not be possible.  What we do attempt to do &mdash; and what the National Manpower Service are increasingly attempting to do &mdash; is to provide assistance, advice and even discouragement at times &mdash; advising people to make sure they have made the appropriate arrangements or have thought out their actions fully before they leave this country.  It is intended to extend the provisions of that programme in National Manpower offices throughout the country to ensure that the young people about whom Senator Harte was concerned would not leave the country without any practical knowledge or experience or without having thought out their plans.  This will ensure that they can be advised appropriately.  The staff of the National Manpower offices will be on hand to advise these young people.  For the reasons given, it would not be possible to accept the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the technological improvements will proceed at an even faster rate.  Inevitably that will result in growth in urban population and in unemployment.  Simultaneously the safety valve of emigration is being introduced except that its targets are somewhat wider now that we are members of the EC.  It appears to me that An Foras will train some of these people who, if you like, have suffered as a result of free market vandalism.  Some people will seek training but not all of them.  There are people who can be trained for jobs outside the country.  In effect, therefore, is the Minister saying that while we will train everybody we cannot train in skills for use outside this country even within the EC?</P>

I should like to compliment this group, and congratulate them for their submission of these amendments for consideration.</P>
      <P>That being said I am very happy with the provisions of this Bill.  They meet almost all of our objectives.  I am happy in the knowledge that the Minister for Labour will have amendments or suggestions examined and scrutinised.  I merely want to acknowledge the submission made to us.  I do not table amendments just for the sake of amendment.  I have amendments to the Schedule only.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Senator that any organisation that goes to the trouble &mdash; and a number of them have been in touch with my Department putting suggestions forward &mdash; are to be complimented.  While we cannot always accept such suggestions they do merit examination.  As F¡S develops these suggestions may not necessarily be written into legislation but will be taken into account in their operations.</P>
      <P>To clarify the position for Senator Harte I should say that any scheme, course, or whatever available within this country to people who apply for them are available to anybody.  What happens thereafter is another matter.  If the Senator is asking me if a person who undertakes a course of study or training here leaves the country, can we then assist in getting them a job in the United States, New Zealand, Japan or wherever, the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  We can train anybody eligible for a course here.  They will reap the benefits of such a course.  But there our responsibility ends.  When they go abroad we cannot assist them but, within the EC, we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I explained, the European Community constitutes a single labour market and there is freedom of movement of workers between the member states.  The fact that the EC operates an international vacancy notification and job placement service, must help people who leave our shores within the EC region.  But we cannot extend those facilities beyond <Col N="2076" /> that.  For practical and legal purposes that would not be possible.  The National Manpower Service and my predecessor are very conscious of this aspect.  Indeed my predecessor started much of the work in this area.  Officials within my Department try to ensure that people will not leave the country without being aware of the pitfalls and dangers ahead of them. Every possible advice is given such potential emigrants.  That is what the Bill seeks to achieve.  The reason the words &ldquo;in a state that is a member of the European Communities&rdquo; have been inserted in the Bill is that it is only within the European Communities that we can have any real power to assist such people.</P>

      <P>I certainly do not think it would be the job of this body or its subsidiary to place people in employment. I would like to eliminate the apparent confusion here.  If that were the case we would all be placing our relatives fairly quickly.  I do not think that is what is meant at all.  In a country say, outside the EC where there is a skill available which is not available here &mdash; in that we have a subsidiary for selling services outside the country &mdash; can an Irish citizen not avail of such courses to equip himself for the job market obtaining in that country?</P>

      <P>The answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. The subsidiary exists in order to sell some of the expertise and services available within the body as at present constituted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned on the Second Stage debate last week AnCO have won a major contract in Indonesia, have been competing and been successful in some of those areas.  When they win a contract they export some of our experts to help people on some of those programmes. That is an entirely different matter from one of our citizens wishing to go to the United States or elsewhere and obtain training there.  It is within the EC only that we can help such people in their job seeking task.  Perhaps some day there will be &mdash; outside the EC context &mdash; an organisation that will help such people. But such is non-existent at present.  The National Manpower Service will advise <Col N="2077" /> anybody wishing to emigrate regardless of where but we cannot go any further than that.  Again the amendment seeks to delete &ldquo;in a state that is a member of the European Communities&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;outside the State&rdquo;, it would not be practical or legal for us to do so.  I hope the Senator will accept that. The Senator's concern is covered in so far as the National Manpower Service and the new body, F¡S, will be concerned with endeavouring to assist with advice anybody wishing to emigrate.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(h) to collect, collate, prepare, publish and distribute such data and information in relation to its services or activities, in co-operation with the Central Statistics Office, as the Minister may specify.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The real concern here is that people are worried about the danger of duplication between the Central Statistics Office and An Foras and they believe that the rewritten paragraph might ensure that this would not happen.  What they are saying in essence is that there is enough duplication going on and the whole purpose of this Bill is to cut out duplication and overlapping and, instead of having a whole plethora of agencies, to bring them all together.  They are afraid this might happen.  I will not ask the Minister to reply to this amendment but that is the concern.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The position here is that we are asking that &ldquo;An Foras&rdquo; be deleted and that it be replaced by &ldquo;the subsidiary&rdquo;.  The point is that the additional functions should be conferred on the subsidiary because it appears that An Foras will have an awful lot of strength, both directly and indirectly, and therefore there is the <Col N="2079" /> question of the whole delegation of authority particularly as a more effective way of dealing with the additional functions. An Foras may not have the legal right to delegate these additional functions. What the Minister will have to decide at this point is whether the functions remain with An Foras or, in fact, are delegated to a subsidiary body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be some confusion.  I must explain that &ldquo;the subsidiary&rdquo; in the legislation is purely for overseas commercial operations.  If there is a particular expertise needed by a contractor and one of our agencies here could usefully put together a package and try to tender for a contract abroad in either training requirements or some other expertise which they have they could use that expertise.  It is not for anything else so the points made by the Senator do not apply.  Any other power rests with the F¡S organisation and it is only in that capacity that the subsidiary have any particular role.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>That clarifies the position. This particular group of amendments were put down because people are very concerned, in general, about the way the other bodies functioned before this proposed merger.  Naturally people want to try to get it as nearly right as possible. Many people who visited me in the past had very bad experiences particularly with Manpower even though Manpower are the Civil Service side of the operation. <Col N="2080" /> Many of the problems seemed to lie there.</P>
      <P>The danger is that this is a reinvestment of a failed structure that might have less public accountability by, on the one side, becoming overloaded and, on the other side, not being fully occupied.  We are trying to see if any scope exists &mdash; instead of An Foras taking on all additional functions despite the fact that the commercial activities of the subsidiary are the only activities that can go on outside the State &mdash; for some extra work being channelled through the subsidiary where we think people may have quicker access to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>To go back over some of those points, section 5 is a contingency provision to enable the Minister to confer additional functions on F¡S if the need arises.  It is expected that this provision will be invoked very rarely.  It might happen that F¡S would be unable to carry out some activity in the future because it is not mentioned in section 4. That is what Senator Harte is requesting and that is what section 5 is for.</P>
      <P>However, the conferral of additional functions will be subject to the approval of the Oireachtas and these functions must be connected with those specified under section 4, so there will be no major departure from the statutory mandate. The thrust of the proposed amendment would mean that such additional powers could not be conferred on F¡S.  We could not accept this.  The role of the subsidiary which would be wholly owned by F¡S, as I have already stated, will be the operation of activities overseas on a commercial basis.  Therefore, any additional functions for the subsidiary must be conferred through the main organisation, through F¡S.  It would be inappropriate to allow additional functions to be conferred on the subsidiary and not on their parent body.  From what Senator Harte has said section 5, which is the contingency provision to allow the Minister to confer additional functions, probably overcomes his difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will come later to the position on accountability but I have to say that the difficulties which I know would never <Col N="2081" /> have been intentional have arisen in these organisations because of their changing role over the past 20 years in clearing their programme.  The plans and schemes are far tighter in this legislation than in any of the other Bills such as those setting up the Youth Employment Agency and the AnCO organisation.  I hope that satisfies the thrust of what Senator Harte is seeking to ensure, that the organisation is not hamstrung, in that it can move if there is some area into which it is necessary to move.</P>

      <P>The concern in this amendment relates to the question of one State body making reports to other State agencies when it would be possible to hand over the work to selected auditors.  With regard to the issuing of reports, particularly when taxpayers' money is involved, there would be nothing wrong with the Minister appointing an auditor.  In so doing we would not have to rely on the same source to report on how the taxpayers' money is used.  Reports on the financial aspects and the workings of An Foras might get bogged down if things are left the way they are at present and responsibility for reports is not given to individuals.</P>

      <P>I follow the point Senator Harte has made but it is worth making the further point that the Comptroller and Auditor General and his Office are highly competent and experienced in this regard and have a wide range of responsibilities for auditing bodies of this sort.  The workload of the Comptroller and Auditor General at times seems to be very heavy and I am drawing on my experience of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies in that regard.  There is no question about the expertise and the competence but at times one would like to see the audit approval coming on line rather quicker than has been the case up to now.  I do not think that would be sufficient to add the amendment Senator Harte has in mind.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that I have to agree with him.  The organisation will have a budget of around £200 million. Section 11 is the standard provision for non-commercial State-sponsored bodies. The Industrial Training Act, 1967, which established AnCO contains a similar provision to what is contained in this legislation. It requires the accounts of F¡S to be submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  This will ensure greater accountability because the Comptroller and Auditor General is the Oireachtas auditor.  The use of other auditors would be unacceptable particularly in relation to the large sums of money involved. Even if these large sums of money do not come from the European Social Fund they are predominantly taxpayers' money and the Comptroller and Auditor General is the only person who would be acceptable to do that work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be moving amendment No. 10 but it is important to explain the context in which it was put down.  As I understand it subsidiaries enjoy limited liability.  This is important in the context of international trading and professional services where taxpayers' money is involved.  A litigation for negligence could cost the agency involved a lot of money.  The benefit of limited liability could be stripped if anything goes wrong. The Minister and the company would be held responsible and liable for the debts of a company if anything goes wrong.  It might seem strange to say that a special auditor could solve that problem but he may see the danger signs and circumvent any problems that might occur to a limited liability company abroad.  This is an area in which great diligence is needed. If a court of law treats a limited liability company as an agent of the Minister and not an independent body the protection that company gets abroad will be removed.  It might be more appropriate to have one specific auditor delegated by the Minister to keep an eye on the finances and investments in projects rather than leave responsibility to the normal State agencies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>During the lifetime of the previous D·il the work of the Committee of Public Accounts progressed and reports of the committee were thoroughly read which is not the norm when committees are not sitting.  If the Committee of Public Accounts were able to examine the reports together with the Oireachtas accountability could be extended further. <Col N="2084" /> The public have a right to further disclosure. The committee started off well during the previous D·il but during the four year period they did not really thrive.  This is an area where we could have further vigilance and get more public exposure on how taxpayers' money is dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Senator Harte's view about the need for control of expenditure, However, a reading of the Bill indicates that the controls are very tight.  When we debated the Bill on Second Stage the point was made that a balance on the policy side has to be struck between flexibility on the one hand and departmental control on the other.  There is no room for flexibility in the financial area because that is particularly important and accountability is of the utmost importance.</P>
      <P>It is very important for An Foras, when they come into existence, to understand that there will be a rigid approach to expenditure and that plans, programmes, and so on, will be submitted for approval in advance.  Because the accounts will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, any committee of the House, including the Committee of Public Accounts, can examine them after that.  The mechanism is already in place to do that if any committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas decide to do so; there is adequate provision in the Bill.  In fairness to the Minister &mdash; and, indeed, the provisions of the Bill &mdash; the financial controls are very clearly set out already.</P>

      <P>I understand the points being made by Senators Harte and Hillery. The Committee of Public Accounts are a very important committee to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The normal process is for copies of the annual report to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is a matter for each House to make whatever arrangements are necessary for distribution to Members or to the committees.  Senator Harte's amendment is covered in so far as it is a matter for the House to decide what is the appropriate committee or committees.  In <Col N="2085" /> a report coming from an organisation like F¡S that covers a number of areas both in the training, employment, research on statistics and a number of other areas it is quite likely that more than one committee would be interested in its activities. Senator Harte's point is covered in section 12.</P>

      <P>Groups and bodies are set up and after a time, they develop their own dynamism and their own direction.  The general direction of the committee or the group for the year should be clearly known.  By having it presented to the Oireachtas, as well as the idea of accountability &mdash; which has been dealt with three or four times here already &mdash; there could also be informed discussion on the work of the group.  The work of F¡S is sufficiently important to require this kind of informed and fully fledged debate.  This report in a sense will plan the budget of F¡S for the year.  If we are to have a responsible type of committee, the Oireachtas should be almost forced to take notice of what is happening and should have all the information available to it in order to have a full discussion on it.</P>

      <P>I dare say one could argue that a brief summary of the plans of any State body could be justified but there is the question of how far one goes in this.  I do not think it would be appropriate for a body to divulge in any substantive detail what it plans to do in the <Col N="2086" /> time ahead.  In certain bodies there could be the danger of breaching confidentiality and flexibility is often necessary in such plans.  On balance I cannot see the merit in going that far in relation to the year ahead in terms of laying the plans beforehand. I return to a point I made last week in this regard, that the policy unit of the Department of Labour which will be monitoring F¡S should involve itself in that activity and scrutinise the plans.</P>

I join with the Senators in wishing him well.  He explained to me the seriousness of the operation on one of his children and I hope it goes well.</P>
      <P>In relation to this legislation I assured him that we will pass on the details he requires in his amendments.  The report referred to in subsection (3) is an integral administrative document which will outline the activities proposed for the following year.  It tries to get the programme clearly laid down of the activities to be engaged upon in the following year.  The document will be subject to considerable discussion in the context of the Estimates. It would not be appropriate to lay it before the Houses of the Oireachtas. As applies to existing agencies at present, details of the proposed activities and expenditure of F¡S, when finally approved, will be available in the Book of Estimates.  It is important also to say that the makeup of F¡S is representative of the social partners involved.  There will be a considerable input from various sectors of Irish life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Hillery has explained the policy unit in the Department will be anxious to give direction to the priorities <Col N="2087" /> to be taken into account.  When the document is passed F¡S and the policy unit in the Department of Labour will have been well debated.  It will be debated in this House as part of the Labour Estimate in any year.  Perhaps more than most organisations F¡S will be open to the scrutiny not only of this House but of a considerable number of organisations and agencies within the State.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is not quite so simple as the last one.  Having spent long years working with different structures that tie in with the Department of State, I certainly know from trying to make any procedure work, that there have to be time limits built in to every stage of it.  Otherwise if you have a number of stages in development, and there is not a clearly <Col N="2088" /> built in time limit in moving from one section to the other, it could stop dead.</P>
    <P>In this section the Minister quite rightly asks that neither An Foras nor any subsidiary should carry out any plan or incur any expenditure until the report has been approved by the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Finance.  I agree with that.  It is the type of failsafe and accountability that is necessary but, as is written here, it is clear, the Minister could be sitting on the proposal for two years and it could be sitting on his desk gathering dust and the Minister could stand up here week after week and say that the legislation says it cannot go ahead without his approval and as they are full up to their eyes, what with the public service embargo, the hard-pressed officials cannot get around to dealing with it and, therefore, this matter will receive priority.  We know the story, and the different formulae off by heart for procrastinating time and time again.  I would have to insist that there is some form of failsafe built into this, that there is some bottom line to the period of time beyond which we could not wait.  That is the general context, but in a more specific context, as somebody who has to plan educational and training programmes, I know you need time to do these things and that, in fact, you need most of a year to plan for the following year.  That in itself is a long enough procedure.  If this body, F¡S, have a plan to implement something in 12 months time and they go through all the detailed research and planning and put together what they consider is a proper training or employment programme, whatever the programme happens to be, then they say to the Minister we now need ministerial approval, it seems to me that the formula in this legislation allows the Minister quite simply to opt out, file it in the pending file and let it sit there and there is no comeback on it.  I am pushing this amendment. I have worked with groups who have been waiting for months before getting responses, and years before getting action on events and it is all because there is no time limit, whether it is building a school, getting a teacher appointed or <Col N="2089" /> whatever.  Unless there is some place where you can say you have got another day, like in planning permission, that it has to be either approved within a certain period of time or else it is deemed to have been approved.  I need that assurance in this Bill.</P>

If you ask what they will say, if F¡S or their subsidiary submit a report stating what the organisation wish to do in 1988, I would almost with certainty say that there could well be an amended approval but they will get approval prior to the end of the year because with the operation of the budget, unless that changes, it would all have to be wrapped up in or around the end of the year anyway.  The budget would come forward and you would have the Estimates of the Department of Labour in mid-January, so the organisation would have to know prior to the end of the year, and that is the intention.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is actually the type of organisation Senator O'Toole is talking about, maybe a building programme or an educational report or a social welfare report&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the report of the F¡S organisation was not to be approved even <Col N="2090" /> in an amended form, it would mean that the entire fairly major organisation of F¡S would come to a standstill.  Under the legislation as it is F¡S could submit the report anytime between January and September, and if you take in the three months provision you would be saying that if they submitted the report in July, it would have to be back in September.  I think I can assure the Senator that the solemn intention of this Minister and the thrust of the legislation is that the report will be considered within the policy unit of the Department and a decision given prior to the financial year.  That is the whole process which has been worked out.  If the organisation send in the report with their plans for the next year three months prior to the end of one financial year, there would be an obligation on the Department to come back and say, &ldquo;this is what your figure of expenditure is and this is what this Government Department wish you to do in the next financial year&rdquo;. That is a fair point to make and I will put in on the record of the House.</P>

    <P>My father always said that the worst kind of legislation was the kind of legislation you could not enforce, and I think Homer nodded in the drafting of this.  It reads at the moment: &ldquo;a person shall not, without the consent of An Foras, disclose any information obtained by him while performing duties as a member&rdquo; etc.  I dislike seeing something in legislation which cannot be implemented.  To take it to its ridiculous limit, somebody could find out the direction to an employment agency or a training agency through being part of, director of or a member of this body and would be unable under the terms of the legislation to disclose it to anybody.  I tell the Minister it is an absolute nonsense.  The proposal here is to <Col N="2092" /> put in the word &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; because I think that was intended from the very beginning but I do not think it is right&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Probably the Minister has a problem here.  He wants to get this legislation through and making changes in it at any stage can cause difficulties, but as this is written it is nonsensical.  It literally means &ldquo;any information&rdquo;.  I do not know why the word &ldquo;any&rdquo; was put into it because that makes it worse.  I have read it again and again and it is not clear from the language there that it refers only to confidential information &mdash; at least I hope it was intended to mean only confidential information.  However, it does not.  I think the word &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; should be added and that it should now read: &ldquo;A person shall not ... disclose any confidential information obtained by him while performing duties as a member, or director, or member of the staff of&rdquo; etc.  I can think of no reason the Minister cannot accept that simple amendment.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that the people who have to work the agency are being asked to tie their hands to a great extent.  There will certainly be occasions when they will have to impart information. Under the present wording of this section if the Minister rang them up for information would they be obliged to give that information?  If the Minister's representative or some Member of the D·il wanted some information relevant to the pursuit of his own business, could they not disclose that information?  The present wording would be putting them beyond the access of public representation, and that is not a good thing. The word &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; is what matters. I support Senator O'Toole in this.</P>

      <P>It is clear from the comments of both Senators that they understand the difficulties here.  Within the Manpower organisation and other organisations there have been tremendous difficulties and problems with leaks of information.  The word &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; was discussed at length in relation to this Bill but based on the legal advice a decision was taken against it.  The insertion of the word &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; would add nothing to the draft and then it would be necessary to define what constitutes &ldquo;confidential&rdquo;.  That is the legal advice which was given.  In other words, in layman's language &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; would mean nothing and would not overcome the difficulties which we sought to overcome. So that &ldquo;any&rdquo; does not mean every single thing; guidelines will be laid down within the organisation as to what constitutes information which can be issued freely to the public and what is confidential in a way that all Senators and I would consider confidential.  To write &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; into the document would not give the desired effect.  Based on legal advice, &ldquo;any&rdquo; is the word which is in the legislation.  On the commencement of the new organisation in January the guidelines will be laid down for what is public information and what press officers or information officers can give so that they would have a <i>modus operandi</i> to handle information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The term itself is too broad. The word &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; would narrow it down.  There is the fear, as I said, that public representatives may be unable to get access to information because the people they would be trying to contact may, because of the way this is written in the Bill, see it as a kind of blanket coverage and that, therefore, they are not free to disclose information.  That would be a bad state of affairs.  We do not want to get into a hassle with the people who are going to administer these agencies.</P>

      <P>I do not think that the intention behind the Bill is to prevent any reasonable information being divulged to public representatives or anybody <Col N="2094" /> else.  Quite clearly there is a problem in defining what is meant by &ldquo;confidential&rdquo;.  It seems that the publication of guidelines as to what can be divulged and what cannot is a reasonable compromise in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>That does not wear. Any responsible civil servant administering this, asked a question and reading, &ldquo;A person shall not, without the consent of An Foras, disclose any information&rdquo; could interpret it only in the way it is written.  That is the rule under which people will work.  We are sitting here discussing it now and the intention behind it, as Senator Hillery has said.  However, the intention is not written into the document and next year or the year after different four people could discuss it somewhere and they would be struck with what is written into the rules.  What is written into the rules is quite definite in this case: no information.  It raises other issues &mdash; if An Cathaoirleach were here she would say that I am going beyond my brief here.  It raises things like freedom of information Acts and stuff like that which, of course, I do not intend to discuss at this point.  However, I mean to push this question of confidentiality.  I do not know whose was the legal advice but many model documents for groups, agencies, etc., use the word &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; and the courts have quite often determined the meaning of &ldquo;confidential&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of confidentiality, very often in the model documents for the setting up of boards, etc., the group themselves can decide what is or is not confidential information.  For instance, the board of management of a primary school may not break confidentiality.  The board themselves decide what is confidential in that case.  They do not need legal advice.  The board simply say, &ldquo;This item which we are now discussing is confidential and, therefore, may not be disclosed outside this committee&rdquo;.  I think I have been very honest in accepting the arguments put forward since we started to discuss this matter this afternoon.  The arguments do not wear in this, and the Minister should accept that and at least <Col N="2095" /> see whether there is a way out.</P>
    <P>To wind up, confidentiality can be decided by the group themselves, by the agency or by the committee or, indeed, it could be decided legally.  However, as it is written there it is restrictive, too restrictive, and in many ways unworkable because there are members of this agency representing different groups.  That does not mean that if there is somebody on this agency representing the trade union movement that person should go back to the general trade union body and say, &ldquo;That is being discussed next week. Could you give me an indication of how I might vote or how I should go forward in it?&rdquo; However, at least people should be able to say, &ldquo;This following genuine issue is being discussed.  Could we have a policy position on this which I can put to the board?&rdquo; etc.  This is restricted. It will take from the effectiveness and efficiency of the board.

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see that argument at all.  As a matter of fact, I do not understand the Senator's logic.  To put into a Bill a word that then has to be defined when we have obtained legal advice from the parliamentary draftsman that this would not fulfil our wishes is just a nonsense.  It is putting in something that is not strong enough.  If we were just to take a word that sounds strong but means nothing I do not know what sort of legislation we would be drafting.  I was not happy to put in words that did not have the desired effect.  It is not to muzzle anybody from saying anything; it is to bring some type of order.  If public moneys to the tune of £200 million are being discussed within an organisation, people can come out and give the information to others.  It is the duty of the parliamentary draftsman, the sponsoring Minister and the Oireachtas to make sure that the legislation is as right as is necessary. We are not dealing with freedom of information Acts.  We are dealing with taxpayers' money and how decisions in relation to it are made.  For that reason I <Col N="2096" /> would not, in any circumstances, consider any word other than &ldquo;any&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It will be the F¡S organisation, made up of trade union representatives, employer representatives, people from the Department of Labour and from the youth organisations who will decide, where they think it was necessary, to give or not to give information.  That organisation will decide on their guidelines.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole said in the course of the debate on this section that a school body might make such rules but a school body may not have it in legislation.  We have it in legislation and the word &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; must be defined in the legislation. Putting in &ldquo;any&rdquo; and clarifying the guidelines within the organisation is the most satisfactory way of protecting the organisation and of ensuring that the legislation is responsible.  Even if there was a difficulty that the organisation could not agree on what was a fair interpretation of the information they could give and on the definition of confidentiality, I could then give a policy directive but it is highly unlikely that would happen.  To put in the word &ldquo;confidentiality&rdquo; which sounds very strong, &ldquo;very confidential&rdquo; or &ldquo;extremely confidential&rdquo; would mean nothing.  I am advised that the word &ldquo;any&rdquo; is far stronger.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept that. I said in my presentation that the word &ldquo;any&rdquo; is far stronger, that it is too strong, that it is all encompassing and that it does not meet the needs of what the Minister just described.  I am a member of a joint committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas and this week the chairperson of the committee, a member of the Minister's party said: &ldquo;the following item is confidential and members should not discuss it outside the committee.&rdquo;  That was decided on by the committee.  It is a perfectly normal method of procedure and there is nothing difficult about it.  The committee decide what is procedure and, <i>en passant</i>, rules for shools etc., carry the force of regulations introduced by ministerial order and are accepted by the courts as legislation.  The only reason they <Col N="2097" /> are not in legislation is that successive Governments have refused to propose an education Act.  The Minister has not responded to the arguments on this matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This could not be more topical.  In the present atmosphere of cutbacks and rumours of cutbacks it is very difficult to find any information &mdash; and I stress any information &mdash; on intended cutbacks in any Department.  Apart from confidential information which the Minister has already discussed, any information is difficult to get.  The plot and the formula at the moment are that there is an inspired leak from a Department to the Press that they are intending to cut back in a particular area and people are prepared for the axe.  Little bits of information are let out here and there in such a way that it is almost impossible to respond to them.  There is an example in today's newspapers of the cutbacks in education which, of course, are done in a piecemeal fashion and it is impossible therefore to get a tight and total picture of what is happening.  The Bill states that the Minister may give a direction in writing to An Foras requiring them to do various things, to refrain from specified <Col N="2098" /> services, to refrain from incurring expenditure of amounts and to refrain from incurring specific kinds of expenditure.  I agree with that.  It is absolutely right that bodies should be answerable in the same way as Ministers should be answerable. We should all be accountable.  The Minister may give a direction in writing to An Foras.  An Foras, as we have just discovered, cannot tell anybody about it because the Minister has made it quite clear in the previous section that no information can be disclosed.  They may be working on the basis of their budget and their activities being cut back in a way that has not been made public.  We are not told the reasons for it.  I am saying that where this direction is given to An Foras by the Minister, such direction should be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  We have not put a wall of silence around the workings of An Foras. We are telling them not to give any information on this business because it is confidential information.  On the other hand we are saying their activities will be cut back.  The people in An Foras cannot tell anybody about what is happening, nobody knows about it and the cutbcks are being made silently and stealthily.  It is a beautiful equation but unacceptable.</P>

      <P>It would not be appropriate for such directions to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  The Minister of the day, in his dealings with F¡S, <Col N="2099" /> must be entitled to a certain degree of discretion.  What is envisaged in this section is that the Minister can give directions in relation to major programme matters of policy and not minor matters. However, it is expected that this power will be invoked very frequently and only if there is a major conflict of views between the Minister and F¡S which, I hope, will not happen, but it can happen. It will be the responsibility of the Minister in the end to decide on policies.  It is unlikely that such powers would need to be invoked but they are necessary where there is a conflict and the Minister of the day is the person who has to decide.</P>
      <P>There are few boards in the whole semi-State or State area that are made up of so many outside bodies, groups and organisations as the Manpower service. Last week I read on the front page of <i>The Irish Times</i> about the decisions which one of the Manpower agencies were about to make.  It was very kind of <i>The Irish Times</i> to let me know of these serious matters. Unfortunately, it is not a question of confidentiality because if it were, the only person who seemed to be unaware of what was happening was the Minister.</P>

An Foras cannot talk to anybody because of the confidentiality aspect.  They then write to the different training courses &mdash; one in Killybegs, one in Limerick and one in Dingle and it is the people at the end of the line who are suffering.  The only way we can get at the information is by bringing the people <Col N="2100" /> involved in the Dingle, Limerick and Killybegs courses together and trying to assess where the cutbacks are hitting.  I do not believe this serves the public interest in any way.  The Minister is on a very weak wicket and he knows it.  We will have to wheel them out on this one.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that Senator O'Toole is doing his duty to ensure that all information will be readily available to the public but the important point is that the Minister for the day would rarely give any direction, and then only if there was a policy difference and no doubt that would be well aired in public.  The direction would have to be given in writing, so there is no question of anything happening under the counter or being sidetracked in some way.  The Minister is answerable to the D·il and Seanad and can be questioned.  That is the reality.  The matter is set out in detail in the Book of Estimates and can be discussed by the D·il, Seanad and the committees &mdash; we spoke earlier about which committees would examine it. There is no question of the Minister of the day being able to do anything in an underhand way.  This section would be implemented only where there would be abnormal happenings, where there was a fundamental difference or a policy difference between the organisation and the Minister.  It is unlikely that this would happen, but if it did, it would be in the open and there would have to be a direction in writing, followed by a debate.

      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 16, before section 28, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>28.&mdash;(1)  The Minister shall establish for An Foras a Council to be known as the Users' Council.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Council shall consist of not less than ten and not more than 20 members to be appointed by the Minister.</P>
      <P>(3)  Each appointment shall be for a period of not more than three years.</P>
      <P>(4)  The Council may settle its own rules of procedure.</P>
      <P>(5)  A person who is, for the time being, entitled under the' Standing Orders of either House of the Oireachtas to sit therein as a member or who is a member of the Assembly of the European Communities shall, while he is so entitled or is such a member, be disqualified from becoming a member of the Council or a member of the staff of the Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(6)  A member of the Council who is nominated as a member of Seanad …ireann or as a candidate for election to either House of the Oireachtas or to <Col N="2103" /> the Assembly of the European Communities or is appointed to such Assembly shall thereupon cease to be a member of the Council.</P>
    <P>(7)  A member of the Council may resign his office by letter addressed to the Minister and the resignation shall take effect on the date of receipt of the letter by the Minister.</P>
    <P>(8)  The Minister may remove a member of the Council from office.</P>
    <P>We are discussing here the whole area of answerability and responsibility.  In this case we believe that the people at the end of the line should have some say in how public moneys are disposed of.  We have given power to the Minister.  We have given certain powers to An Foras, and to the people involved in its running but we have not considered the client who also deserves a voice in this area.  The checks and balances should work all the way down the line, not just at ministerial, Oireachtas and An Foras council level, but right down to the client.  A populist Government, such as the present Fianna F·il Government, would never oppose a users' council.  The Minister is looking very benignly on this amendment and perhaps he will surprise me by accepting it because opposition to it is opposition to the people.  This amendment makes the Bill more answerable and the legislation more responsible and I commend it to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is one of the accountability and to enable people to have proper access.  We will have to overcome the problems we had with other agencies where there were a substantial number of complaints about behavioural patterns, lack of access and so on.  The question posed by the amalgamation of these three agencies, to youth in particular, and to those engaged in the network for youth participation projects is if they represent the modern, competent, highly efficient and user orientated service. Others will want to know if it will provide a better and increased service at less cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2104" /> That is the purpose behind the idea of the Users' Council.  As I said earlier people suffer from free market vandalism. That free market vandalism does not humanise the impact of technology on people's lives.  This means we must rely on these agencies and should be able to use them to greater effect.  There is a great deal of frustration felt, the basic cause of which is the discrimination against the underprivileged in urban society.  So many of these people find themselves powerless to change anything. It is largely in urban areas that this problem obtains.  Therefore, a Users' Council which afforded them access to services and so on would be of benefit to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The present agencies &mdash; the Youth Employment Agency, the National Manpower Service and AnCO &mdash; have made great efforts at every one of their centres to try and involve the local community.  If anything, much of their efforts go almost unappreciated by the local community.  They are forever endeavouring to involve them in their activities, make them aware of the centres, keeping in touch with local schools, parish committees and so on.  It forms a large part of their work.  Anybody familiar with the Manpower Service will be aware of their involvement and efforts. That is one area only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say also that the social partners, in particular the Irish Congress of Trade Unions who comprise the largest part of the present organisations will be represented by four members on the new organisation, work very closely with the other employment agencies.  All over the country they are setting up employment centres where there are committees of unemployed people.  There are well known ones in Dublin city and Senator Harte will be aware of them.  I am not as familiar with those elsewhere in the country.  I visited recent the Larkin Unemployed Centre on the North Strand and also one of the most progressive centres in the entire country in Ballymun.  It is the co-operation among people who <Col N="2105" /> make up the agencies and the local community that renders them so effective.  In all the social employment scheme, the Teamwork scheme, and almost every scheme initiated by the employment agencies &mdash; and now the new F¡S, there is local community involvement.  It is extremely successful.</P>
    <P>Perhaps in some areas where there are commercial organisations where people pay for the services provided, and where there is a contractual obligation there is need for Users' Councils.  To take the example of the board of F¡S, composed of representatives of so many and varied interests in the labour market, I do not believe such a User's Council is necessary or that there is any desire for it.  I have been dealing with the National Manpower Service now for almost seven years.  Indeed I was one of the people who argued strongly for this Bill and discussed it with my predecessor.  Only since this amendment was put down have I become aware that there was any requirement for a Users' Council.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I cannot agree with Senator J. O'Toole.  I seem to be disagreeing with him all afternoon &mdash; which I do not intend &mdash; because he has been making some valid points.  I do not think there is a desire on the part of the people involved for a Users' Council.  I can assure the Senator and the House that the very close liaison obtaining in the operation of all the schemes of the outgoing Manpower agencies will continue under the new agency &mdash; more than exists in any other area.  The close liaison between the social partners and the various local organisations ensures efficiency, effectiveness and good value for money. But most importantly, communities themselves have a say in how these schemes should operate.  The social employment scheme, the Teamwork scheme and so on were the result of communities coming forward with proposals to the agencies, asking them how they would assist them.  Then State money was injected, as expertise, by way of various supervisors, co-ordinators and enterprise workers in the agencies going into the <Col N="2106" /> communities and working with them.  I do not believe there is a parallel in any other organisation in the Manpower area. Indeed they are to be highly commended. It is on that non-legislative co-operative basis we should continue.  I am sure that will happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 16, before section 28, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>28.&mdash;For the purposes of processing a complaint by a person against the actions of An Foras, the First Schedule of the Ombudsman Act, 1980 shall be construed to include An Foras.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with people who might have a grievance and their means of processing such grievance.  Action can be taken by any agency.  This is a new agency.  They are very likely to take action, either by accident or design that will cause people some difficulty and perhaps quite serious difficulty.  Having regard to the Ombudsman's success since his appointment &mdash; particularly in regard to bodies like the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and so on, where he has done a very substantial job on behalf of the public &mdash; we feel that this grievance procedure or mechanism should be available to people who may feel aggrieved as a result of having been badly treated by this agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Harte on this amendment especially in view of the fact that the last two were withdrawn.  I would not see there being any great frequency of <Col N="2107" /> recourse to the Ombudsman.  There is general acceptance that the office of Ombudsman has worked in an extremely impartial and even-handed way although, like many other Senators, I feel a great sense of unease at present given the savage cutbacks; I think there is about a 25 per cent cutback in the cash allocation to the Ombudsman in the current year. Perhaps it would be inappropriate at this stage, given the degree of cutbacks that office has had to endure, to add another function.  In view of the fact that the last amendments were withdrawn, the Minister might think of accepting this one.  It would strengthen the provisions of the Bill without causing any extra cost to the Exchequer.  Probably it would not be used very often but it would be useful to have it there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I take Senator Manning's point.  I do not believe it would be used too much.  Perhaps it would be seen or viewed as a type of protection.  When I was spokesman on Labour and the Public Service I argued strongly that An Post and Bord Telecom should be brought under the aegis of the Ombudsman.  That was done by way of the Ombudsman (Amendment) Order, 1984.  That was because of the great public outcry that the Users' Councils largely were unable to make progress with Bord Telecom or An Post in the thousands of difficulties people had experienced.  I should say that right from the commencement of the operation of the provisions of the first Ombudsman Act I supported his powers and the idea behind the establishment of his Office.  All the Senators who are in regular contact with him will appreciate his great workload and difficulties.  I do not believe there is any great desire to burden him with any further work at this stage until he has overcome his present difficulty <i>vis-·-vis</i> Bord Telecom, An Post and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedure laid down by Deputy John Boland, when Minister for the Public Service &mdash; now under the umbrella of Finance &mdash; is that any extensions to that Office should be done by way of the <Col N="2108" /> Ombudsman Act, 1980 through Finance &mdash; but not by way of legislation.  That would be the proper way.  My view would be that a year down the road in F¡S's operations we could ascertain whether there is a necessity to do so.  But at present I do not think it necessary.  The complaints of any serious nature that come in are almost nil.  The serious complaints against any of the agencies in the manpower area would be very different from the usual.  There, somebody would be seeking a course or arguing about the terms of a course and the entrants into it.  There is a fair amount of flexibility within the organisations to try to cater for those problems.  The practical difficulties that any of us dealing with the agencies would know of over the years are normally sorted out through the local centre with the local manager and it is different from a question of getting your billing period amended after it has been clocked up in a computerised operation.  Perhaps it might be necessary in the future to start referring complaints to the Ombudsman. The new organisation I see as a positive, constructive organisation to tackle the major problems of unemployment and help the communities.  It would be wrong to say that we should start off by referring complaints to the Ombudsman.  The new organisation should have their own complaints division.  They should be able to deal with their own difficulties and should not require a third party.  If at some time in the future they do have that difficulty, then the Department of Finance can be consulted regarding the Ombudsman Act, 1980.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 16, before section 28, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>28.&mdash;(1)  The Chairman and an ordinary member of An Foras who is either directly or indirectly interested in any industry or enterprise in which An <Col N="2109" /> Foras proposes to carry out its functions under this Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  shall disclose to An Foras the nature of such interest at the meeting of An Foras at which the question of such functions is first considered or, if he has no such interest at that time, as soon as may be after he has acquired such interest,</P>
    <P>(b)  shall take no part in any deliberations of An Foras relating to such functions save to such extent as the chairman of the meeting, at which such deliberations take place, may permit, and</P>
    <P>(c)  shall not vote on a decision relating to such functions.</P>
    <P>(2)  A disclosure under this section shall be recorded in the minutes of An Foras.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where the Minister is satisfied that a member of An Foras has failed to comply with the requirements of subsection (1), he may, if he thinks fit, remove that member from An Foras and, in case a person is removed pursuant to this subsection, he shall thenceforth be disqualified from being a member of An Foras.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I ask that another section be put in before section 28.  This is not strictly a business situation but it will be run along business lines.  There can be a great conflict of interests if people do not declare, either directly or indirectly, whatever interest they might have in an industry or an enterprise.  After being appointed to the board or the subsidiary they may find that an appointment comes their way and, therefore, presents the difficulty of a great conflict of interests.  The nature of the interest should be disclosed as quickly as possible.  That is the tone of this amendment, to avoid the conflict of interests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I have a certain sympathy with this amendment.  It raises a great problem in appointing people to State boards.  It seems to be almost a sin <Col N="2110" /> these days for a political party to appoint somebody to a State agency or a State board if that person is seen to have political affiliations.  Politicians have no problems with this at all because all of us in politics know that there can be people of great ability who are committed to a particular political party and who would bring great expertise to a State board and would be very much custodians of the public interest.</P>
      <P>As far as the media are concerned, it seems to be a mortal sin for any political party to appoint somebody who has strong political views to a State board.  I greatly deprecate this tendency.  It is lazy, sloppy journalism; it provides for sensationalism, and so on.  The last thing we want in legislation is to do things which would inhibit good business people or good people involved in the community from becoming involved in political parties. On the contrary, we should be trying to get them into political parties where they have a lot to offer.  This sort of publicity can occasionally inhibit them. Likewise with a board of this sort it may very well benefit from having members with a proven track record.  It should be axiomatic that they should not participate in decisions in which they may have a vested interest, that their interests should be declared.  Perhaps the Minister expects this will happen in the normal course of events and there is no need for a safeguard.  The safeguard may be a little too elaborate if it gets to the point of meeting the Senator's wishes.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's reaction to this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand both points made by the Senators.  It would be easy to say that we will write it into the legislation that anyone who serves on the board of F¡S should make a full declaration of interest.  The kind of person we are looking for for this and any other organisation is somebody who is of the highest calibre possible.  Anyone who has watched the semi-State boards over the years knows that you are asking people who have achieved great successes in their own private capacity to go on a State <Col N="2111" /> board out of public duty, with no reward. It has not been a practice in this country that people who have been on boards have been appointed by successive Governments for their own gain; if anything, they would have lost substantially. In general, there is a great debt of gratitude due for their assistance.  They spend a considerable amount of time and because of the many difficulties of State boards, they get a substantial number of headaches from their voluntary involvements because they are, by and large, voluntary involvements except for very small remuneration.  I do not think there is any remuneration involved here &mdash; a few hundred pounds.  That is not going to make any difference to anyone serving on it.</P>
      <P>There is a provision in some other legislation but I do not consider this provision appropriate or necessary in this Bill which deals with the establishment of a noncommercial organisation, people who are involved in trying to devise schemes to help the unemployed.</P>
      <P>Under section 21 of the schedule, the board of F¡S will regulate their own procedure.  It is considered in this situation that such items as declarations of interest would be best handled in this way if they feel that there should be declared interests on a particular project.  If they are dealing with something that is big, a purchase of property, or something major, they could ask people to declare interests.  This is the normal practice in the case of a non-commecial organisation. On the issue of policy decisions, I could say that people who are on this board of F¡S should declare their interests.  I would rather not do that because I do not think it is necessary, unless the Senators really think it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary to go that far but perhaps in the letter of appointment whoever is in the office of Minister at the time might suggest to those who are being so appointed that it is normal practice that, should there be a conflict of interest, there would <Col N="2112" /> be full declaration.  I think that would go far enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 16, before section 28, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;28.&mdash;An Foras shall, at such times as, and in respect of every period to which, subsection (2) of this section relates, draw up and submit to the Minister for his approval, given by him after consultation with the Minister for Finance, a programme outlining An Foras projected activities (in this section referred to as a &lsquo;strategic plan&rsquo;).</P>
      <P>(2)  A strategic plan shall be drawn up by An Foras in respect of the period ending on the 31st day of December, 1992, and shall be submitted not later than six months after the date of the first meeting of An Foras, and thereafter An Foras shall draw up and submit a strategic plan before, and in respect of, each subsequent three-year period and each such report shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We are talking about a strategic plan and review here.  I say this in the sense of a plan rather than the normal programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the private enterprise world Governments are more given to programming; Irish Governments anyway, have been more given to programming rather than detailed economic planning. Detailed economic planning never got any help at all.  The safety of generalities was always employed when they were introducing the programming.  Maybe there was a good case for that, but I do not think so.  We are probably suffering from the effects of not having detailed economic planning before this.  It should not be beyond the wit of many people who will be on these boards of both An Foras and the subsidiary.  We will have people represented from the economic <Col N="2113" /> field, agriculture, people who are probably well into the idea of knowing the levels of investment in a commercial sense and knowing the business world generally.  It is well within their capacity to introduce a strategic plan.  The Bill does not provide very much in that direction. With this amendment we are trying to see if the Minister would consider in a serious way how planning can be done on a much more detailed basis than we had to listen to or put up with in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Some good points were made by Senator Harte in endeavouring to ensure that the organisation will be working towards a strategic plan and a reviewing of their plans.  Just to give the details that he requires the planning and report relationships between F¡S, the Minister and the Department are covered in sections 12 and 17.  These require F¡S to submit an annual report outlining their programme of work including expenditure estimates for the coming year.  The Minister is empowered also to give directions to F¡S in connection with manpower policy generally and any activities or expenditure of F¡S.</P>
      <P>It would not be appropriate to require F¡S to produce a three year plan. However, when F¡S are established and in operation the question of more long term plans can be addressed.  My expectation is that a medium term plan will be prepared and I think this is what Senator Harte would like to see them do. However, the one year plan is more important from the point of view of budgets and immediate impact and they should concentrate on this at this stage. In 1988 we will ask them to consider working on medium term plans.</P>

      <P>In page 17, paragraph 2 (1), line 10, to delete &ldquo;16&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;17&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that a representative of the Union of Voluntary Organisations for the Handicapped shall be appointed as a member of the board of An Foras Aiseanna Saothair &mdash; the new national manpower and training authority.  As I mentioned on Second Stage the National Economic and Social Council in their publication <i>Manpower Policy in Ireland</i> which was published in December 1985, identified four major sets of objectives for a labour market policy.  One of these objectives is the need &ldquo;To improve the employment opportunities of groups with special labour market problems, and hence to contribute to social equity&rdquo;.  The previous Government in their 1986 White Paper stated: &ldquo;The Government have decided that the needs of disabled people require the adoption of more flexible criteria.&rdquo; The voluntary organisations who have displayed such marvellous dedication and commitment in the advancement and promotion of the interests and needs of mentally and physically disabled people should be represented on the board of the new manpower authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the publication by the previous Government of the Green Paper on services for disabled people which was entitled <i>Towards a Full Life.</i>  I welcome in particular the comprehensive response of the Union of Voluntary Organisations for the Handicapped to that Green Paper.  They are a union who act as an umbrella organisation for approximately 40 voluntary organisations which are <Col N="2115" /> affiliated to them.  There is no doubt that many of the problems with which disabled people and professional and voluntary workers have to cope could be more easily eradicated with a greater flexibility within the statutory services to innovate quickly new responses to new ideas.  I am sure the Minister will acknowledge that we in Ireland have been very fortunate in having a long tradition of voluntary support services for disabled people.  The voluntary organisations have been a major provider of services for disabled and handicapped people.  Meaningful arrangements must, therefore, be made for the involvement of the voluntary organisations in the future planning and monitoring of services for disabled people as equal partners. We must ensure that all initiatives and programmes at every level make it possible for disabled people to take part in the designing and organising of such services.  I strongly believe, therefore, that the new body should be given a lead responsibility for vocational training leading towards open employment.  The voluntary organisations who cater for the needs of the physically and mentally handicapped should be represented on the board of the new employment and training board.</P>
    <P>The Union of Voluntary Organisations for the Handicapped to which I have referred are representative of some 40 voluntary organisations including, for example, the Central Remedial Clinic, the Irish Association for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus, the Irish Society for Autistic Children, the Irish Wheelchair Association, the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Ireland, the National Association for Cerebral Palsy, the National Association for the Deaf, the National Council for the Blind of Ireland and many more.  The Union of Voluntary Organisations in their response to the Green Paper on services for the disabled entitled <i>Towards a Full Life</i> said:</P>
    <P>We are concerned that the time has now arrived for the transfer of the placement service of the National <Col N="2116" /> Rehabilitation Board from the Department of Health to the Department of Labour.  We have listened long and often to this request and we make it ourselves today.</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, making the request to the Minister that the Union of Voluntary Organisations for the Handicapped be represented on this board and I urge the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The case for the inclusion of this amendment has been made very comprehensively by my colleague, Senator Kennedy.  I ask the Minister to look in a very positive way at this amendment which would genuinely have the support of people in all parts of this House.</P>
      <P>The amendment is two things.  First, it is a gesture of solidarity from the lawmakers as a continuing indication of goodwill towards the handicapped.  We have a very good record in this regard. The Minister's Department have a particularly good record and this would be a gesture of further support from this House of the Oireachtas in a week when the question of the provision of further amenities in education and integration for the handicapped has been very much to the forefront.</P>
      <P>Second, in a very practical way it would ensure that when the activities of An Foras are being examined in detail by the board there would be present a continuous vigilant voice on behalf of the handicapped.  Too often and too easily the needs of the handicapped can be overlooked. Very often people think that they are aware of the special problems of the handicapped and most of us do go out of our way to inform ourselves.  Nonetheless we can be insensitive without realising it and we can overlook things which would not be overlooked by a person who is handicapped.  There is a very practical reason for this amendment and if it was accepted it would enhance the Bill enormously and I believe it has the support of all Members of the House.</P>

      <P>I would like to support both <Col N="2117" /> Senator Kennedy and Senator Manning's amendment.  I hope that the Minister in the course of his reply will not be thinking strictly in terms of the ratio of disabled people to the rest of the workforce.  If the Minister cannot appoint a representative from the Union of Voluntary Organisations for the Handicapped his reason should be much more substantial than that kind of argument.  I am not anticipating what the Minister might say because I understand that the ratio is small.  In view of what Senator Kennedy said it is very important to make sure that disabled people are represented on the board.  Some years ago there was a debate in the Seanad and promises were made in relation to disabled people but nothing materialised.  It was left to the voluntary organisations to keep ploughing away and do what they could for the handicapped. I urge the Minister to think seriously about this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to commend Senator Kennedy for his contribution on this issue today and last week on Second Stage.  It is quite obvious that he has a great knowledge and involvement with the voluntary organisations and particularly the cases that he makes for the voluntary organisations dealing with the handicapped, organisations with which I am perhaps not as familiar as he is.  However, I am aware of much of the good work that some of their agencies do.  I have had long involvement with the Central Remedial Clinic, and Senator Manning's area is a central part of that organisation, with Saint Joseph's School for Blind and the National League of the Blind.  They are excellent organisations and a number of them are based in the heart of my own constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Kennedy has asked what meaningful arrangements can be made for the handicapped.  For some time now AnCO have been endeavouring in small ways to improve all their centres nationally to facilitate the handicapped and to ensure that wherever possible handicapped people can participate in their courses.  That is a policy decision of AnCO.  I am aware from two officials of <Col N="2118" /> my own Department that there is close liaison with the voluntary organisations for the handicapped when they are discussing policy matters.</P>
    <P>The case was well made last week by Senator Kennedy on how we can actually do that.  I give an undertaking that while I cannot accept the amendments put down I will consult with Senator Kennedy since he has a particular interest and has highlighted that interest in the Seanad debate.  I do not think it was even mentioned in the D·il debate how perhaps we can try to build up some mechanism whereby the handicapped organisations can have a policy input within the Department of Labour.  It would be a welcome and encouraging step and would enable their policy views to be taken into account.  While much of the work of F¡S would have nothing to do with them, clearly there are areas that are highly important to them.  I will undertake to devise some mechanism whereby they could have a policy input.</P>
    <P>My difficulty &mdash; of my own interest in the cases has been well put by Senator Kennedy and others &mdash; is that there has been a strong campaign by a great number of organisations to have representation on F¡S.  While it was in the Government White Paper and was referred to in the NESC report it was not in the existing legislation.  The previous Government did not change or add any of the organisations that made representations. That was a standard rule across the board which I have followed. Several organisations have made strong cases and are not being mentioned here today.  I do not believe they would be making a stronger case than those made by Senator Kennedy.</P>
    <P>The best I can do &mdash; because I did not get much time between last week and now to see what we can do &mdash; is to give an undertaking with regard to the request so well put by Senator Kennedy for meaningful arrangements between the handicapped people and the policy section of the Department and we will try to build in some mechanism where that can be done.  Thus, in the substantial areas that affect handicapped people they can in <Col N="2119" /> some way have a direct input into the policy unit.  We will ensure we will do that and consult with the UVO with which Senator Kennedy and myself are familiar. Unfortunately for the reasons stated, I cannot agree to the amendments put down but I will undertake to do the work I said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for his kind remarks and for his obvious and genuine interest in having the handicapped services as close as possible to the new agency.  However, I must put on record that I am not at all happy with this response.  It will not meet the requirements in the two amendments we have tabled.  I just quote from a speech made by Mr. John Lynch, Chairman of AnCO and the Youth Employment Agency to the National Social Service Board, a speech delivered on Thursday, 25 June 1986 entiled &ldquo;Social Policy Issues, the Challenge to Co-operation and Planning and Development.&rdquo; I will quote one paragraph.  This is what Mr. Lynch has to say:</P>
      <P>As regards the handicapped, AnCO developed a number of years ago a formal policy in relation to training. AnCO's policy is to provide training for disabled persons who have been assessed as suitable for training on an integrated basis with the able-bodied for open employment.  AnCO takes steps to ensure that such persons are facilitated in obtaining training in AnCO as necessary&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>This is the crucial point.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but of course AnCO does not get involved with training more seriously disabled persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that statement indicates and emphasises in a very significant way the need to have the disabled services and the various voluntary organisations represented by a national umbrella organisation such as the Union of Voluntary Organisations for the handicapped.  We are fortunate we have such a national <Col N="2120" /> organisation embracing most of the various services.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay a tribute to the Minister for the way he has piloted this Bill not alone through this House but through the other House and for the marvellous interest which he has shown in Manpower policy.  However, I regret he is unable to accept the amendments. Unfortunately we cannot withdraw them, because we believe they are very significant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Senator's position; I know he has been fighting this case for some time.  The Seanad will appreciate that that speech was made when I was not Minister for Labour but it is correct so far as it goes.  While the AnCO training centres are trying to update and involve themselves in training for the handicapped, there would be all types of practical and medical difficulties in training the more seriously handicapped. The Department of Labour are involved as the co-ordinating Department in respect of the European Social Fund.  Great emphasis is put in the Department on the substantial finance achieved for organisations like UVO and centres like CRC and other organisations for the handicapped have been helped physically and mentally through the European Social Fund.  This money has allowed for modernisation of centres such as the Rehabilation Institute, CRC, the National League for the Blind, St. Joseph's School for the Blind, the School for the Deaf in Cabra and so many other organisations of which I am very well aware.  However, I am not too sure if it would be practicable for AnCO to become directly involved in the more severe cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While understanding Senator Kennedy's position, we will as far as we can build up some mechanism to ensure that UVO at least have a policy input although I cannot accept these amendments.  A Chathaoirleach, I know you have been a great fighter in my own party over the years for the handicapped.  I know there would be unanimous interest in our doing something but it is just the practicality of <Col N="2121" /> how that can best be done.  I will try to do that over the coming months.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 24 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
      <P>In page 18, between lines 9 and 10, to insert a new subparagraph as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7) In appointing the ordinary members of An Foras, the Minister shall have regard to the necessity of ensuring that both sexes are adequately represented on the Board.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would not like anyone to get the impression that I am dealing in the question of tokenism or something like that, or that I did not favour equality in its true sense.  The purpose of the amendment is to improve the position of women who have been discriminated against on the question of training.  The terms of the Employment Equality Act positively discriminate in favour of women, particularly in the area of training.  Even though that is laudable in itself, if women who know of women's problems with regard training and how they should be addressed and can lend their expertise to it, are not on the board in equal numbers, the Employment Equality Act will not be implemented in favour of women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one of the main reasons we want women on this board.  Apart from that, they can use their knowledge about such matters as training during pregnancy and the difficulties to be faced there.  Special units might be needed some time to deal with women who have to re-enter the labour force.  Perhaps the agency could go into discussions with other agencies and co-operate with them in this respect. Women can be a great asset in that regard.  I am not talking about women for the sake of doing so, I am talking about people.  There are very exceptional females who are active in the trade union movement, in the business field and elsewhere who are very much involved in training and in seeing to it that the provisions of the Employment Equality Act are implemented in favour of women in training.  There is a need for that.  Women have been left behind for years in that <Col N="2123" /> respect and it is necessary to bring them into line.</P>
    <P>To a great extent F¡S will provide a form of career guidance, not strictly in a second or third level education sense, but in steering people in the right direction for jobs.  This is where the knowledge of a woman who can carry her weight as a board member to the process of inductive and deductive reasoning and who can bring her expertise and knowledge of women's affairs to bear is valuable, particularly in view of discrimination in the Employment Equality Act that I have spoken about.  Therefore, it is important that women should be represented here. I am not talking about somebody calling for creches and so forth.  I am talking about serious, genuine difficulties that women know about and can give advice on.</P>
    <P>Not only can they advise on women affairs in regard to training, but the women I am talking about are equal in capability to the men in the matter we are discussing.  I do not like to use the term, but I am not talking about appointing &ldquo;lame brains&rdquo;, I am talking about people with ability with the extra dimension of being able to steer An Foras into using the Employment Equality Act correctly in regard to training, placement and people returning to the labour force.</P>

      <P>I share Senator Harte's views about the contribution women can make to the board of F¡S. Many of them have considerable expertise and insight that could add to the policy making and implementation of F¡S.  I also share his view that tokenism should be avoided.  It is not just a case of putting women on the board for the sake of women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, he has touched on a point there.  After all, the body will be made up of representative groups like the ICTU and employer bodies, apart from the ordinary members the Minister will nominate.  Therefore, it is up to the nominating bodies like the ICTU and employer interests to take Senator Harte's views into account as well and to <Col N="2124" /> select women on their merit so that they will be perceived as having the qualities, the expertise and the intellectual weight to perform well on the board of F¡S.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very mixed views about this amendment.  Certainly I support the general thrust of it and the objectives Senator Harte is trying to attain.  As far as possible there should be some sort of statutory obligation on the Minister to ensure that there is adequate representation of both sexes.  Frequently we say that, if we leave it to the good sense and the goodwill of the Minister concerned, other factors may, and often do, intrude I am not making a political point here, but when the Taoiseach was making his 11 nominations to the Seanad this year &mdash; they were 11 excellent nominations &mdash; we found that there was not even one woman amongst them.  I am quite sure that his intention was not to appear to be discriminatory and probably other factors intruded.  However, it is not enough just to leave it to good intentions and hope that people will do the right thing.  Very often they do not.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, I do not like the form of wording in this amendment.  In the phrase &ldquo;the Minister shall have regard to the necessity of ensuring that both sexes are adequately represented on the Board&rdquo;, the word &ldquo;adequately&rdquo; would leave itself open to all sorts of litigation.  What is the meaning of the word &ldquo;adequate&rdquo;?  In one person's book &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; could be one woman.  For some people that might be one too many. For others &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; could mean half of the members of the board; it could mean two or three.  It is the sort of expression which could lead to problems later on.  People could take legal action against the new authority for that reason. I have very mixed views on it.  I like the objective Senator Harte has in mind but I am not sure this is the best way to go about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment very strongly.  The Minister must take into consideration the fact that women constitute almost half of the workforce.  Therefore it could be said that <Col N="2125" /> they will be members of representative groups and organisations etc.  That is not so because the majority of women in the workforce are in the lower paid section. They constitute the group of people who are at the bottom of the hierarchy of workers.  They are the lowest paid workers.  They are probably, more than any other large group, the group that most needs and can most benefit from and most avail of training for further job opportunities.</P>
      <P>F¡S will certainly have to take on board the need to target groups and to make them more able and ready to avail of employment opportunities.  We only have to look at generations of oppression and suppression to see the way women have been treated.  We have a duty to bring women forward in every area.  I do not see the same difficulty that Senators Manning and Harte see about discriminating positively in favour of women.  I support that general idea.  This measure is not positive discrimination or reverse discrimination; it is simply a positive proposal in order that women would be represented on the board.  Depending on where they come from and where they work people would be able to point out to their colleagues or fellow workers where they could avail of training.</P>
      <P>I agree with the general point made by Senator Hillery.  He stated that if women have the intellectual capacity they will succeed but unfortunately that is not the case.  They have the intellectual capacity but they will not be at the proper level of an organisation or of an organised workforce in order to avail of opportunities. That is a sad fact.  This proposal is attempting to create the kind of climate in which we will be able to look back in a couple of years time and say: &ldquo;There is no longer a need to make special provision for women; they can now come through the system in their right&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the duty of training organisations and groups to give women both the confidence and the competence to avail of job opportunities.  That really must be the objective.  By attending the training courses they would gain competence and confidence which would enable them to <Col N="2126" /> avail of whatever new initiatives or new job opportunities are there.  I urge the Minister to take this on board.</P>
    <P>The amendment asks the Minister to have regard to the necessity of ensuring that both sexes are adequately represented on the board.  That is not confining him; he will have quite an amount of leeway.  Even at the end of the day he could say: &ldquo;I cannot take this on board but I will do something about it&rdquo;.  I remind the Minister, as he is well aware, that he can nominate two members to the board and his colleague, the Minister for Finance, can nominate one member.  If the Minister cannot accept this amendment I ask him to signify his intentions in certain areas.  He could do so here in a very positive way and we could see the results in a very short time.</P>
    <P>This is the second day in a row something has been discussed in this House in greater detail than it was discussed in the D·il.  I say to the press reporters that this is the way legislation is supposed to operate.  I have no doubt in my mind &mdash; the Minister will not agree with me &mdash; that had this Bill been initiated in the D·il he would have taken on board many of the proposals put forward today and would have accepted many of the amendments. I am not asking him to reply to that.  Most of us sense that is the way the system works.  We recognise that if he were to accept some amendments today it would mean recalling the D·il before he could enact this Bill.  There is something wrong with that system.  I plead with the Minister to introduce the next legislation in this House where it can be guaranteed that it will get the kind of detailed discussion which will be of help to him and to his officials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment tabled by my colleague, Senator Harte, to insert a new paragraph.  It is not unreasonable to ask the Minister to accept the principle of what Senator Harte is suggesting.  He has made a very good case.  He is not confining the Minister to numbers but he is concerned, particularly in view of the functions of An Foras, that they will relate to and have an impact on the lives of many women in the workplace.  As a result it is appropriate that they should be adequately represented on the board, as Senator Harte stated.  He did not mention numbers; he is leaving it to the Minister's discretion to ensure that they are adequately represented.</P>
      <P>Some women feel that men can adequately represent their views as is evident in this debate where men alone are speaking about the rights of women. Possibly there is a message to be got from this.  Some women feel men put their case for them better than themselves. Whatever the reason, we are of the opinion, based on fair play and the impact that women have on society, that it is important that the Minister should exercise his discretion in this matter.  When he and his ministerial colleague make their appointment if the normal representation that Senator Hillery referred to has not taken place through the other nominating bodies &mdash; the Minister's will appoint their nominees only when every other nominee has been appointed &mdash; the Minister should take it upon himself, under the powers conferred on him by the Act, to ensure that Senator Harte's views in this matter are taken into account and that both sexes are adequately represented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course he wants the Minister to discriminate in favour of the fairer sex. The wording of the amendment is not unreasonable.  It is very broad and it gives the Minister the kind of power and flexibility this House wants to give him.  I am <Col N="2128" /> sorry that if the reason he cannot accept it is that the legislative procedure which has been referred to by my colleague, Senator O'Toole and which the Chair viewed with alarm, although probably in total agreement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Harte for this amendment.  I have no great hangups about who the nominating bodies appoint, whether they be male or female. Regardless of my personal preference about who I would like to see run the F¡S organisation for the first year or two, it is for the nominating bodies to decide.  I will have an input into two of these organisations but in order to maintain management proportions, it has almost been designated whom I will have to nominate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point was made by Senator Harte that there are plenty of people in the employers organisations, the Civil Service, the Congress of Trade Unions and <Col N="2129" /> the youth bodies who will be nominating able men and women.  To have a balance on the board is a good thing because many of the services, training courses and schemes are open both to males and females.  I think that is a valid point. Senator Manning is probably as close to my own views as anybody, it is not necessarily the sex of the appointees that is important but the broad-minded view they adopt.</P>
    <P>So that Senators will not feel they were wasting their efforts in July when the Lower House is on holidays, with the exception of the Minister for Labour who was with them last week and this week and will be next week, I want to tell them that the letter to the nominating bodies &mdash; including a letter to myself&mdash;suggests that women should be considered for appointment to the board but I have to accept an amendment to do that.  I know that Senator Harte in his very strong and influential position with the Congress of Trade Unions will also try to sway them to show good example by bringing in some of their quality officers, or at least 50 per cent of the ICTU representation. I am sure some of the female Senators if they were here, would also use their influence with the nominating bodies. What is important is that following the passing of this Bill &mdash; and I thank Senators for their co-operation in having it in the House in the month of July &mdash; we get the best people for the job. Whether they be male or female, old, young or middle aged is not relevant. What is relevant is that the best people are nominated to do the job.</P>
    <P>In all the discussions I had with various groups, nobody raised the point Senator Harte has mentioned.  I will discuss this with the relevant people and ask them to consider having some kind of fair, equitable representation of males and females on the board.  I will be glad to do that with the compliments of Senator Harte.</P>

I detect that the Minister is going to apply the principle of the Employment Equality Act in a training agency and that he will discriminate in favour of women. <Col N="2130" /> I want to put that on the record.  On the more serious side I believe the Minister has gone as far as he can.  I was toying with the idea of calling a vote but in view of the Minister's reply I think he has gone as far as was practical in all the circumstances.  When we read the record of the Minister's statement I trust we will be able to read between the lines, that women will be adequately represented on the board and that the letters he sends out will get the necessary response.

      <P>May I thank Senators for their co-operation last week and this week in passing this Bill.  I take the point made by Senator O'Toole that this is important legislation. It is setting up a State organisation that will have almost 3,000 members and a budget in excess of £200 million.  I thank Senators for getting through a great number of amendments, more than I had in the D·il.  The Department of Labour and the Government are very conscious of bringing Bills into the Seanad first and appreciate Senators' efforts.  The last Bill from my Department which came through the Seanad was the Workers' Participation Bill and that effort was greatly appreciated.  Today's debate was very useful and a number of useful points were raised.  Even if amendments cannot always be accepted, it does not take from the fact that the operation of an organisation can benefit from the discussion. What is in legislation is one thing but we have an awful lot in legislation that in practical terms, is not followed through. A number of good points were raised today, particularly those dealing with the <Col N="2131" /> handicapped, which will be very useful in the operation of the new organisation.  I will ensure that those points are taken into account.</P>

    <Title>Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1987: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher) Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this short Bill is to close a loophole in fisheries legislation as disclosed by a recent judgment of the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>The background to the matter commenced in 1982 when an Enniscrone, County Sligo, fisherman was convicted in the District Court of using a &ldquo;fixed engine&rdquo; contrary to section 97 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959.  He appealed his case to the Circuit Court which sought the opinion of the Supreme Court as to whether the fisherman's net was a &ldquo;fixed engine&rdquo; within the meaning and for the purpose of the Fisheries Acts, 1959 to 1983.</P>
      <P>It was the unanimous judgment of the Supreme Court that the net was undoubtedly fixed to the soil but that it could not rank as a fixed engine unless it was also &ldquo;stationary&rdquo; which it was not.  Accordingly the net was outside the statutory definition of &ldquo;fixed engine&rdquo; and so the conviction of the fisherman has had to be set aside in the Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>It is desirable to close the loophole in the legislation as otherwise some salmon fishermen may attempt to avail of it and use nets that under the existing legislation cannot now be deemed as &ldquo;fixed engines&rdquo; and, consequently, their use would not be prohibited under section 97 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959.  This could pose a serious threat to salmon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senators will no doubt observe on a perusal of the Explanatory and Financial <Col N="2132" /> Memorandum which I circulated with the Bill, three changes have been made in the amended definition as compared with the existing definition.  In order to deal with the defect disclosed in the judgment of the Supreme Court I have deleted the expression &ldquo;or held by hand or made stationary in any other way&rdquo; and replaced it by &ldquo;or by any other means&rdquo;.  I have added the expression &ldquo;or a drift net&rdquo; so as to make it clear that drift nets which were not fixed engines under the old definition continue to be excluded by the revised definition.  Finally, acting on the advice of the Attorney General, I have made a slight change in the reference to &ldquo;anchors&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I regard the Bill as an important conservation measure.  We have to continue in our efforts to conserve our very valuable salmon stocks.  I am pleased to be in a position to tell Senators that there is some evidence this year of an improvement in the escapement of salmon into fresh water.  Our country is one of the few in Europe where salmon angling is still available and it makes a substantial contribution through tourist revenue.</P>
    <P>Since coming into office the Minister, Deputy Daly and I have met the managers of the regional fisheries boards.  The Minister also had meetings with some of the boards and he and I will be meeting the remainder as soon as possible.  At these meetings he stated that, in so far as it is possible to do so, they should aim at stamping out illegal salmon fishing within the limits of the resources available to them.  We have the support of the Naval Service and the co-operation of the Garda SÌoch·na in pursuing our objective in this regard.</P>
    <P>Turning to the new Department of the Marine, I want to say that one of the major reasons for its establishment was to facilitate the development of a coordinated overall approach towards our marine industries so as to exploit to the maximum their potential for jobs.  The main thrust of the commercial development division of the new Department will be to produce long term policies for our <Col N="2133" /> marine industries including inland fisheries and in particular our very valuable salmon fisheries.</P>
    <P>As I stated at the outset, the purpose of this Bill is to close a loophole in the fisheries legislation.  I regard it as an important measure to assist in ensuring the conservation of salmon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and wish him well in his new responsibility.  If he does not know everything there is to be known about fishing and fisheries, very few people do, given where he comes from and his business background.  On behalf of this side of the House I wish him every success.</P>
      <P>I will not get into a technical discussion about fixed engines.  Before this Bill was introduced in the other House I had no idea what a fixed engine was.  I had great difficulty associating the idea of a fixed engine with fisheries.  However, the Minister in his short speech today had outlined the technical nature of the Bill and how and why it has become necessary to tighten up the definition of a fixed engine to prevent further abuses and further illegal fishing due to the loophole which came into existence after the Supreme Court judgment.</P>
      <P>All fixed engines, stake nets, bag nets, fixed draft nets, head weirs fixed to soil or rock and secured in one or more places are all now illegal.  I am not speaking as an expert but the Minister in this Bill seems to have covered all possible loopholes. I certainly hope he has because the consequences of further loopholes appearing could be very serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, although short, is important and give us an opportunity to focus on two items of major current importance in the Minister's Department.  There is the ever-growing problem, of salmon conservation <i>versus</i> drift net fishing.  It also gives us a chance to ask whether the fisheries board &mdash; I am glad the Minister met them in recent times &mdash; have sufficient funding to carry out their full range of functions, which are far wider than most people realise.  They include management, <Col N="2134" /> conservation, powers of protection and of developing and promoting. The last aspect, developing and promoting our inland and sea angling resources are probably crucial in the current economic climate.</P>
    <P>The question of drift nets was discussed at some length in the other House and questions were asked about the report of the salmon review group which was set up by the last Government.  I would be interested to hear from the Minister the current status of that report, if, in fact, he accepts its main findings, if he will be publishing it and if it will be the basis for action.  The scope and nature of the drift netting problem is all to apparent.  At the moment drift netting is taking far too high a proportion of salmon from the sea.  This means that the requirements of individual rivers are being very adversely affected.  The drift net fishermen follow the main runs of salmon at sea, their hauls generally are large and make it virtually impossible for sufficient numbers of salmon to get into the rivers in question.  In many rivers it is likely that there will be insufficient numbers of salmon to regenerate and ensure adequate supplies in the future.</P>
    <P>At present, more spectacularly, there is the problem of enforcement.  I am glad to see the commitment from the Minister on talks held with the various interested groups and of the full backing for the law enforcement agencies of the State.  This problem of enforcement can often cause difficulty to Deputies and Senators in particular areas.  Very often the people involved may otherwise be law-abiding. They may even be friends or supporters of the Deputy or Senator in question and there can be difficulty about giving adequate backing to the law enforcement agencies.  I am glad of the full commitment of the Minister in that regard. In recent times we have seen pictures of very ugly events as law enforcement officers of this State have tried to board vessels which were obviously involved in illegal fishing.  Such attacks on the law enforcement agents cannot be tolerated.</P>
    <P>At present I gather there are about 820 drift net licences held by fishermen who <Col N="2135" /> are trying to make a living in very difficult circumstances.  But the problem of drift net fishermen is not common to this country only.  Other countries have had to face up to that problem also.  I would be interested in hearing from the Minister if it would be possible to get &mdash; not today, obviously &mdash; some type of summary of how other countries faced, with a similar problem, are attempting to resolve it.  We live at a time when what was unthinkable 20 years ago is happening, that we would actually pay farmers not to produce milk, not to produce butter &mdash; as is happening now in parts of Britain where farmers are being asked not to grow crops, not to do the things farmers always did in times of surpluses.  The principle is being accepted that people may well have to move out of traditional areas of husbandary but on the principle that they will be compensated. I wonder if it might be possible to persuade people to get out of drift net fishing on the basis that they would be compensated.  I do not know; it might very well be that the cost would be exorbitant. I believe Canada has been adopting practice of trying to phase out drift net fishing, but on the basis of compensation. I do not know enough about it.  I do not know if it has worked in Canada.  I do not know if the fishermen have taken the compensation and then gone back fishing in another area which would always be a possibility.  But I would be interested to know whether the Minister or his Department have any information on that.  Norway is the only other country that I am aware of which has been facing up to the problem.  Their policy has been to ban all drift netting at sea.  It may be that the cost of compensation will be exorbitant.  It could also be that a simple ban on ruthless activity might be counter-productive.  However, I have a very open mind on the problem.  I will be interested to hear in some specific detail the Minister's views on the subject.</P>
    <P>My last point concerns the potential of our inland and sea angling resources.  This subject was touched on by a number of speakers yesterday in an excellent debate on the Tourist Traffic Bill and the role <Col N="2136" /> of Bord F·ilte.  A number of Senators referred to this resource which, as a country, we under-value and under-use.  I am not sure of the exact figures but I believe we have an inland surface water of over 300,000 acres of lakes, we have over 8,000 miles of main channel rivers.  That is a far higher proportion of land under water than is the case in most other European countries, certainly higher than Britain.  This resource is not particularly costly in its upkeep although I am appalled in certain parts of the country at the lack of local effort.</P>
    <P>In a debate this morning the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, Deputy SÈamus Brennan, talked about the role of the State in helping companies to export.  I agreed with everything he said about the State not being the body which should have to get involved in all of these activities.  I am appalled at the lack of local effort and pride in some of our rural towns in developing the inland waterways, in beautifying them, making them a place of pleasure for the people who live in the area.  If I might be totally parochial for a moment and mention as an exception my home town of Bagenalstown, County Carlow, the approach to which is an example to other towns of what can be done where there is an inland waterway, where trees and shrubs have been planted, where a great local effort has been made to turn what is a natural amenity into a source of local recreation and pride.  I am appalled at the frequent lack of local patriotism and local effort in making the best use of these resources. It is not particularly expensive to keep our waterways in good shape.  Again, in passing and in parenthesis may I say how appalled I am at the state of the Grand Canal in Dublin one notices as one travels from the Naas Road along the canal.  In any other city in Europe it would be a major source of attraction.  It would be used by the citizens for fishing and boating, and it would be visually attractive. Yet the Grand Canal is an eyesore at present with very little attempt made to turn it into the resource it could be.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2137" /> Most of our waterways are not expensive to maintain.  Most of them are renewable as a resource.  Many of them are in very valuable settings.  I know the Minister is aware of this.  I know he is aware that last year we made £30 million from tourist angling revenue, we made half of that sum again in revenue from Irish anglers and 1 believe we are only scratching at the surface.  I know that, in many cases, there are local rivalries with vested interests which make difficult the development of our angling resources.  I hope that the Minister, in conjunction with Bord F·ilte, will turn his attention to this matter.</P>
    <P>I hope we will get from this Government an integrated, positive policy document on the development of our fisheries and inland waterways.  They are a great natural resource.  It is a matter of scandal that over the years successive Governments have failed to exploit this potential. I hope the Minister will do so and, in so doing, I wish him well.  I commend this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the Minister to the House.  I welcome this short Bill whose provisions are vitally necessary for the protection of our fishing stock.  I smiled to myself when Senator Manning mentioned that he did not really know the meaning of a fixed engine.  In my part of the country many people in the folklore business could tell the Senator the meaning of a fixed engine. Indeed I am sure the Minister would have plenty of advisers in his constituency in that respect also.</P>
      <P>The provisions of this short Bill are vitally important to stamp out illegal fishing. There has been definite evidence of such attempts being made this year by the new Department of the Marine to prevent large trawlers using their monofilament nets.  There is also evidence of more salmon in our rivers this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Manning mentioned our discussions in the House yesterday.  There is no doubt that tourism and fishing are cousins.  The potential of fishing as a tourist attraction has only been scratched on the surface.  There is vast need for <Col N="2138" /> improvement in that area.  I welcome the establishment of the new Department of the Marine and its potential in job creation.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the pollution of our rivers.  It is pointless safeguarding fish stocks if they are to be killed by pollution of our fresh waters.  This problem will have to be tackled.  Could the Minister tell me what his Department are doing about the recent incidence of red tide found in one of our harbours in west Cork?  This is a serious problem.  We do not know whether the Department's inspectors have carried out an inspection. Also I should like to know what provisions the Minister or his Department have made to deter or prevent the importation of any live fish or fish eggs into this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Together with my colleagues, I want first to extend a welcome to the Minister of State and to congratulate him on his appointment to the new Department of the Marine.  As has been said by Senator Manning, there is no other Member of either House of the Oireachtas who knows as much about fisheries as the Minister.  I have no doubt he will apply that dedication to the specialised industry in his new Department and we wish him well.</P>
      <P>We realise that the Bill before us arises from a court decision and it is a technicality but for a land locked county like Tipperary we would have problems in trying to relate fixed engines to nets. However, we have to accept the decision of the court and the Minister's reasons for the legislation.  He points to the fact that the legislation is needed as a conservation measure.  Anyone who talks to fishermen &mdash; and he does on a daily basis, I am sure, and I do occasionally &mdash; knows that they consider themselves experts in fishing for salmon in the sea.  They tell us we seem to have all our facts and figures wrong in regard to conservation of salmon, that is, salmon that get into fresh water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency, in particular, we have one of the well known salmon fishing <Col N="2139" /> rivers, the river Suir, and the Blackwater is not too far from us, either.  The number of salmon available in those two rivers last year was extremely high and it was also extremely high off the coast last year.  It was a bumper year for salmon off the Waterford coast, in particular. Talking to the fishermen down there who fish in the legal period, they are of the opinion that salmon come in cycles and that the level of fishing that is done around the coast bears no relationship whatsoever to the number of fish that eventually get into the rivers.  They have told me &mdash; and I listened intently to their views &mdash; that the only thing that ever stops salmon from going into fresh water is the diminution of the level of fresh water in our salmon fishing rivers and that goes for all the rivers of this country. The Minister, Deputy Wilson, referred to this last night in dealing with the tourist aspect of fishing which is of vital importance.</P>
    <P>We have within our jurisdiction some major trout and salmon fishing rivers which are still at a very high level of environmental control and as the Minister said, we have a responsibility to protect that environment and pass it on. As well as rivers, we have lakes, but we have a level of pollution creeping into our inland rivers now which is of extreme concern to all of us.  The fishermen around the coast will tell you that if we looked after our rivers better with regard to the level of effluent discharge and effluent pollution the number of salmon would increase.  They say that the fishing taking place off the coast has no bearing on it.  That is their view but obviously they have some vested interests in being allowed to fish off the coast.</P>
    <P>That brings us into the whole area of the debate that is going on about monofilament nets and all the other fishing nets that are available.  Those of us who live inland would not know anything at all about that, although the river Suir is tidal as far as Carrick-on-Suir and I am sure that some amount of fishing takes place there as well.  If we paid more attention to the kind of effluent that is discharged <Col N="2140" /> into our rivers, whether by agricultural works which recently in my own constituency created problems, the discharge from silage could be used for re-cycling. If it is collected properly from the silage pits it can be used safely and be fed back to cows with benefit to the overall milk production.  If attention were paid to this matter the amount of effluent escaping from silage would be drastically reduced and the pollution taking place in our fishing rivers would also be reduced.</P>
    <P>We also have a certain level of factory effluent and semi-State factories have not been exempt from responsibility for the tragedy of pollution of our rivers, which has created quite an amount of fish kill in South Tipperary.  I hope the Minister, as a result of this Bill, will stay in constant touch with his colleagues in the Department of the Environment to see that the Water Pollution Act is operated in the strictest possible way to ensure that both indiscriminate and accidental effluent discharge is controlled.  Then we will have a major up-turn in the numbers of salmon and other fish in our inland rivers.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said he has had discussions and will have continuing meetings with the regional fishery boards.  All members of fishery boards whom I know or talk to have expressed concern, this year in particular, about the resources that are available to them.  The Minister asks them, within the limits of the resources available to them, to stamp out all illegal fishing.  With the resources available to them, it is their opinion that their ability to stamp out illegal fishing is greatly reduced this year.  Perhaps the Minister would discuss this particular aspect with them, because they are extremely concerned that they are constrained this year in trying to stamp out illegal fishing.</P>
    <P>All of us would agree with the responsible view that has been expressed recently when bailiffs or law enforcement agents of the State, trying to do their duty, were inhibited from so doing by a minority of fishermen.  We all would defend the right of our law enforcement agents to do their job.  We would also like to make sure the Minister provides <Col N="2141" /> sufficient funds for them to carry out their work effectively and efficiently.  There are large stretches of river which need to be patrolled and visited on a regular basis, otherwise we are only paying lip service to this whole concept of ending illegal fishing.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry is a major industry. It is one of which we should be very proud.  Our salmon are world famous &mdash; whether fresh or smoked.  That anglers can have the pleasure and the sport of fishing for large fish like salmon in our inland rivers &mdash; is something we must be very careful about and for that reason the Minister will have the widespread support of this House for the Bill. However, I hope he will take on board some of the comments made in the other areas which also concern us, to ensure that this important industry which is now under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Marine, will get the attention that it needs.</P>
    <P>The industry has obviously been neglected.  With our accession to Europe and the fact that Spain is now a member of the European Community, the problems that can arise for our fishing industry have increased &mdash; and I think that is being kind to our colleagues from Spain who have entered the Community.  They have a larger fishing fleet than the whole of the Community put together and because of that they are naturally more active and operate in greater numbers around our coasts.  It is important that we have the fullest support of the State to defend for our fishermen the rights that have been achieved for them in the Community. There have been debates about the level of support that has been given to them in the past.  I welcome the fact that we have the full support of the Navy and the gardaÌ and all the other enforcement agencies to ensure that the livelihood of fishermen is protected, that fishermen who indiscriminately break the law will be taken to task and that people who pollute rivers to the extent that it damages that industry will also be dealt with under the appropriate legislation.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to add <Col N="2142" /> my voice briefly to the debate on this legislation.  While it is a very short Bill, nevertheless it incorporates a definition of a fixed engine which is in its own way a curtailment of the existing fishery laws that are in operation to date.  I agree with those Senators who have already spoken about pollution.  It is detrimental to fish life and every effort must be made to ensure that our rivers are not polluted any further.  ACOT and the people who are involved in agriculture must ensure that any project, silage slab or slatted house that is being erected at present must conform to regulations so that the effluent from these houses is no longer let run into water courses and rivers which adjoin many farmer's lands.  Many farmers live close to major salmon rivers and in future a provision like this must be built into the grant-aiding of facilities for silage making, silage slabs and slatted houses.</P>
      <P>The curtailment of pig slurry from piggeries is very important.  Our legislation is very loose in regard to this.  It is a pity that grants which were available for the proper protection of the effluent that flows from these buildings are no longer available.  Farmers are not in a position to invest substantial capital in the protection of fisheries.  It is not their field.  Substantial moneys must be made available if we want to curtail the pollution that is happening daily and which will eventually get into rivers because of the absence of proper tanks for slurry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past draft and driftnet fishermen along our coasts were blamed for the lack of fish in our rivers.  Many angling associations blamed driftnet fishermen for stopping fish coming in at the mouth of rivers.  That is a myth and I want to scotch it here and now.  The amount of fish taken by driftnet fishermen, whether at the mouth of rivers or a mile from main rivers, is minimal when compared to the amount of fish being taken by international trawlers who steam inside the 12 mile limit area at night.  These international fishermen take huge hauls of salmon to their factory ships which are outside the restricted limit area and they process the fish on board.  There is no <Col N="2143" /> regulation in force to deal with this illegal operation which is taking place along our coast.  The State protection team cannot protect us from that type of poaching of our waters by international boats.  I am well aware that this is happening because when I go out fishing I can see a mass of ships waiting until dusk so that they can speed into the salmon fishing areas, take their hauls and return outside the restricted area where they can transfer the fish to their factory ships without paying the Government any levy.  We do not know exactly the size of the hauls but it is well known that hundreds of thousands of fish have been taken from our waters by this method.</P>
    <P>Small driftnet fishermen along the coast have been blamed for the lack of fish in our waters and of course this is not so.  I know fishermen who have been in the driftnet business for many years who are now no longer pursuing that activity. This is evident from the number of licences in operation at present.  I am sure the Minister is aware that many of the licences that were in operation up to ten years ago are no longer being used because driftnet fishing is no longer a profitable business.  More money can be made from fishing for lobster or crayfish along the coast rather than fishing for salmon.</P>
    <P>This is minor legislation and refers only to the definition of a fixed engine.  I want to ensure that it does not curtail driftnet fishermen any more than they have been curtailed in the past.  While I welcome the new Department more exploration and detection work should be carried out outside our 12 mile limit to curb the activities of those type of fishermen I have mentioned who are very seldom brought before the courts because our protection fleet are unable to curb them. I ask the Minister to do all in his power to ensure that the continuation of that type of poaching will not ruin our waters for the future.</P>
    <P>There is a tourist attraction in the area of flyfishing.  We have many miles of waterways and good salmon and trout fisheries which are not being utilised at <Col N="2144" /> present.  These may be restocked but, until such time as this intrusion by international fleets is curbed, there is no way fisheries can be controlled.  I ask the Minister to take particular notice of this international intrusion into our waters.  It should be his first concern.  Because of advanced technology these fishermen know exactly the streams and rivers the fish traditionally come into in the spring and they are able to detect them and take them onto their factory boats.  This is the major difficulty in relation to the protection of our waters.  The amount of poaching done by our traditional fishermen at present is insignificant compared to the amount of damage being done by international fishermen.  I appeal to the Minister to look at this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief.  I should like to take this opportunity to wish the Minister of State every success in the great task that lies ahead of him.  It is important that the Department should continue to develop the fisheries industry. It has always proved to be a difficult sector but, nevertheless, it needs more inputs and new technology to ensure that, as an island nation, we are able to reap the greatest possible benefits from our national waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from the midlands and I am not directly involved with sea fisheries, drift nets or anything like that.  It is surprising to note via the media that certain people engaged in fisheries seem to place themselves above and outside the law, and this is a great pity.  I hope the Minister and the Minister of State will do all they can to ensure that laws already enacted are observed.  There is little point in strengthening the legislation we have, or in enacting additional legislation, unless it is possible to ensure that that legislation is enforced for the good of the population as a whole and for the good of the industry and the national economy.  That is very difficult in this area when individuals, whom the papers say are breaking the existing law, do so by applying physical and brute force.  That is an extraordinary situation and I hope the Government will tackle that problem head on. <Col N="2145" /> We cannot have anarchy or allow any sectoral interests to decide what they want to do, or to place themselves above the laws enacted by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister success with this important legislation &mdash; small as it is with two sections &mdash; and I hope justice will be done.  The Department have a huge task in building up the fish stocks to ensure that the industry prospers and expands and it can only be done with co-operation. I hope the key word will be cooperation with all sectors involved. Otherwise the Minister should lay it on the line very firmly that the law must be upheld in this regard and that adequate resources will be put at the disposal of the State agencies who are assigned this difficult task.  I hope there will be cooperation and that people who are endeavouring to make a livelihood from the fishing industry will increase their incomes one hundred fold.  The few people who want to do exactly what they like, irrespective of the law, must be dealt with.  I know the Minister is a man with great experience and a great tradition in this area and he will be able to deal with the related problems with fairness and justice and, above all, with determination and strength.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivianOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers I too extend a sincere welcome to the Minister and subscribe to the points made by other Senators.  This legislation is of significance only as it relates to a facet of the difficulty being encountered in the whole drift net industry off our coasts at present.  I have sympathy for the Minister in his efforts to confront this problem because it is an arena of confrontation at present.  He is almost like Macbeth.  When he steps in, whether he goes back or forward in this confrontation, people will disagree with him. That is a phenomenon that is nothing new to Ministers, you cannot be all things to all men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to appear to be the devils advocate but this is a classic confrontation. It is an ugly confrontation in many places like Helvick, Unionhall or off the Donegal coast last week.  This <Col N="2146" /> is not a normal phenomenon for Irish fishermen.  It is not the kind of thing they have done in the past.</P>
    <P>Fishermen are the stock of rural peninsular communities and, quite often, are island people.  It is not their normal <i>modus operandi</i> to go around bashing bailiffs or involving themselves in confrontation with the gardaÌ or the naval forces.  This problem has developed and it has been allowed to develop.  Because of the proliferation of driftnet licensing over the past 15 or 20 years the Minister now finds himself virtually with his hand in a hornets' nest.</P>
    <P>In 20 years' time this House may be debating the demise of the Atlantic salmon which could probably be described as the most magnificent creature in the sea.  We must decide whether we will grasp this nettle or whether, as has been suggested in some parts of this country, we should legalise monofilament netting.  This suggestion has been made by responsible people. It is not a nonchalant suggestion.  The Minister should contemplate legalising monofilament netting and then control it. The parallel is almost as simplistic.  To ask a developing farmer to go back and start ploughing with a pair of horses is almost parallel with asking our fishermen to fish off the coast &mdash; with the kind of competition confronting them from the international trawling fleets of other EC countries, in the main, and Eastern bloc countries &mdash; with netting other than monofilament netting.</P>
    <P>The suggesting has been made that we should legitimise the use of the net completely. It is extraordinary, for example, that the State collects VAT from the importation of monofilament netting and yet it is illegal.  I know people will say it is legal for other uses, but the reality is that the bulk of the imported monofilament netting is used for illegal fishing. That is one side of the story.  The other option is that we could do as the Canadian Government and recently the Icelandic Governement did buy out the owners of driftnet licences and perhaps contemplate going back to some form to draft netting which is a relatively inefficient <Col N="2147" /> form of fishing which tends to be the preserve of a few.  Eventually the Minister will have to opt for one or other end of the spectrum because I do not think we can continue to have both.  We will continue to have confrontation; we will continue to have difficulty; we will continue to have law breaking.</P>
    <P>I concur with my colleague from County Mayo, Senator O'Toole, that in the middle of all this confrontation a large percentage of legitimate licence holders are trying to eke out a living.  I am aware of two licence holders who live quite close to me, one of whom has stopped fishing altogether in Bantry Bay because it does not pay him any more.  Last year he caught something like 57 salmon altogether. Years ago he would catch that number in one morning before his breakfast which of course confirms what others in the conservation area would say. Despite the peak and valley phenomenon that is abroad in the salmon industry last year, as Senator Ferns remarked a moment ago, appeared to be a very good year in some places.  That does not alter the fact that bays and estuaries and rivers that traditionally had a lot of salmon swimming through them do not have any now.  I refer to Bantry Bay in my own area.  Three of the rivers going into that bay were deemed to be amongst the finest salmon fisheries in the province and they have not had a fish killed there for the last four or five years.  This of course is grist to the mill for the conservationists. I do not find it difficult to agree with them.</P>
    <P>That does not alter the fact that we have island and peninsula communities dependent in the summer time, on fishing. They have no other form of income in the main, except the income from drift netting.  What do we say to these people? Do we say: go back to the prehistoric form of fishing where you may or may not catch fish, or use the efficient system of fishing whereby they can be guaranteed a catch most of the time?  The argument the fishermen have put up of course is that if there is a legitimisation of monofilament nets, they then would agree <Col N="2148" /> to stringent controls.  It is debatable what fishermen will agree to at any time but, for example, there was a time in this country and it is not a thousand years ago when very few if any fishermen fished on a weekend, especially on a Sunday.  It was regarded as sacrosanct.  It was regarded as fundamental to the wellbeing of the resource that the salmon be given some opportunity to go up the rivers on weekends.  I understand that they would be prepared to seriously respond to that overture and they could conceivably agree that proper control of licensing and of nets a better result could be achieved than the situation we are confronted with at present.  I am not suggesting to the Minister that I am necessarily in agreement with that point of view but is one that is being put forward by people in the fishing industry at present.  We cannot however, unfortunately, lose sight of the fact that we have a sizeable river and lake angling industry, which brought in in excess of £30 million to this country last year.  Is is tragic to read the reports of regional fishery boards that fishing on river after river, estuary after estuary and lake after lake is slowly coming to a halt to the extent that many of them did not see a fish killed there last year.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset can we continue to adjudicate over a situation like that where this magnificent resource will be gone from us in 15 or 20 years time? Despite the fact it was a great season last year, we cannot go on indefinitely killing the fish at source and not allowing the salmon to get back up the river to where they spawned the first day.  This is the classic problem that confronts the Minister and I suspect that at the end of the day the only acceptable resolution will be to compensate the fishermen in a proper way and induce them to get into other forms of fishing &mdash; as many fishermen are trying to do.</P>
    <P>We may be headed off at the pass, as it were, in any event by the fact that we have so many salmon ranches on this island even at present.  In my own home town in the past few days a sizeable salmon ranch has commenced operation and they will be producing hundreds of <Col N="2149" /> tonnes of salmon per week.  Of course that does not alter the fact that the traditional attraction of the Atlantic salmon as a wild swimming species can never be overstated.  It is indeed a phenomenon of up market restaurants on the Continent to have specific insertions on the menu, and for two considerably different prices you may have farm salmon or free flowing salmon.  It is an indication of the importance that should be attached to that resource.</P>
    <P>I have great sympathy for the Minister and he is probably in need of much sympathy. It is a very onerous and difficult task and anybody who lives in a fishing community as I do, would know the vehement debate that this can conjure up at any given moment.  It is a difficult one. I wish to raise one other point before I resume my seat, and you might indulge me on this a Chathaoirligh &mdash; the Leas-Chathaoirleach was indulgent to Senator Kiely a moment ago &mdash; and allow me to touch on the problem of red tide which is very relevant for the Minister's Department. Red tide is a very serious problem at present in the south west region where we have sizeable tracts of water in Cork Harbour closed for the extraction of shellfish at present.  We have a sizeable resource in Bantry Bay in the form of something in the excess of £3.5 million to £4 million of a mussel crop which appears to be at risk from this phenomenon of the red tide.  I suggest that the Minister should with all expedition dispatch some people from his own Department to reside for the next six or seven weeks in the area where this phenomenon appears to be active during the months of July and August.  We should not have to depend on <i>The Cork Examiner</i> or RTE or anybody else to be giving us information which we do not know to be accurate or factual on the day and where people are told that it is inadvisable to eat shellfish taken from certain harbours and so on.  I think that this is a total and absolute responsibility of the Department of the Marine and this can only be achieved by providing a permanent resident marine biologist from this Department, who can speak with effect on behalf of the Department. <Col N="2150" /> We would then see in the public media a proper reflection of the actual situation and not the meanderings of some people who set themselves up as experts.  Again I welcome this measure taken by the Minister to close off this loophole as stated in the opening paragraph. It is overdue and I wish him well in his office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I thank all of the Senators for their very kind wishes on my appointment as Minister of State.  Needless to say that I will take decision that will be in the best interests of the industry generally.  I also thank the Senators for their very constructive contributions and I must say that I was extremely impressed with the very keen interest shown by the Senators who contributed to the debate and their knowledge of the salmon fishing industry.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to a number of points made by the various Senators commencing with those raised by Senator Maurice Manning.  A number of the points made by him were also made by other Senators in their contributions on salmon conservation, the regional fishery boards, their funding, management, their development and promotion of inland and sea fishing generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept there were cutbacks in all Departments and every Minister and every semi-State body and the regional boards suffered as a result of the cutbacks, but I think I should point out that the regional boards are not financed directly by the Department of the Marine.  We finance the Central Fishery Board and they in turn finance the regional fisheries boards.  In 1986 the total grant to the Central Fishery Board was £5.022 million and this year it was £4.813 million, a drop of some 4 per cent.  I certainly think that should be increased because the Central Fishery Board have statutory obligations and we must ensure that we give them sufficient money to do this.  We have asked them to do their utmost and work within these financial constraints in order to ensure that they can stamp out illegal fishing to the best <Col N="2151" /> of their ability.  They of course have a back up from the Naval Service and from the Garda SÌoch·na.  The role of the navy is twofold.  First, to protect the fisheries outside our 12 mile limit and second, to assist the protection staff of the regional fisheries boards inside our 12-mile limit. We would like to think they are available all along the coast at all times within the 12-mile limit.  However there must be a sense of proportion.  The navy have over the years done excellent work, bearing in mind that they have a vast area of sea to patrol right out to our 200 miles limit. However, they have apprehended very many boats outside and indeed a number of boats inside the 12-mile limit.  In my own county there was a case before the courts on the very day we had a debate in the D·il some two weeks ago.  A number of the minesweepers are decommissioned now and the Minister, Deputy Daly, has made a case to the Community for assistance towards surveillance and hopefully the position will improve in the years to come.</P>
    <P>Fishermen have a very important and key role to play in the management of our fisheries.  They appreciate fully that fish is a renewable resource and we must ensure that fisheries do not continue to overfish.  There are a number of conservation measures, the most important of which was referred to by a number of Senators, that is, the weekend closed season.  As Minister of State at the Department I pointed out on numerous occasions before the season started in the debate in the D·il, and I will take the opportunity in this House this evening to reiterate that I have no mercy whatsoever for weekend fishing or for what is very prevalent in certain parts of the country, end of season fishing.  End of the season fishing does not give an opportunity for fish to get up the rivers.  That is problem No. 1, and there is the other direct economic disadvantage in that the fish that are landed and sold at the end of the season are sold at almost 50 per cent of the market price.  That has an effect not on the price at the current season but on <Col N="2152" /> the price in the following season.  We must protect not only the fishermen but the fish processors and smokers and ensure that this practice will be stamped out.  I am sounding a warning in this House that end of season fishing and weekend fishing will not be condoned by me, by the Minister, by the boards or any officials of my Department.  That is the most important one of all, and there the fishermen themselves can play a key role.</P>
    <P>We had some difficulty in a part of the country which happens to be in my county last weekend.  During last week I appealed to the fishermen in that country and throughout the country to refrain from weekend fishing.  I am delighted to be able to report that last week very few boats, if any, were out.  The fishermen respected this request.  Some speakers mentioned that a small percentage of irresponsible fishermen can tarnish the image and reputation of the many responsible fishermen along our coast.  We should bear this in mind.  I assure the Senators that I share their concern about the future of the industry.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning referred to conservation and suggested that we look at the position in Canada and Norway.  I suggest that if we were to compensate the drift net fishermen that could be very costly.  This has proved to be so in Canada.  However, it has been partially successful.  This and the other measures referred to are under consideration by the salmon review group.  We hope to have their report available to us in a few months, and I assure this House that we will act on it at the earliest possible date because none of us wants a recurrence of what happens every year.  I hope the incidents which we experienced recently have been a lesson to all right down the coast because the season will go on longer the further south we go.  The people concerned in those incidents learned a lesson and all others similarly involved will be treated in the same manner.  On that Saturday evening I issued a statement condemning these activities and said that we would tolerate no attacks on our law enforcement agencies.  I assure the House <Col N="2153" /> that if there are any further such attacks we shall certainly deal with them.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald referred to the legislation, which is quite simple but very important.  I assure him this will be enforced immediately it is enacted after it passes through this House and is signed by the President.  He referred to the attacks on the law enforcement agencies, and I think we are all at one on that.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris mentioned the end of season, and I have stated that we will not tolerate that end of season activity.  He also referred to the importance of trout and salmon angling to the tourist industry. That can continue only providing that we allow enough fish up our rivers.  At this stage I would like to pay tribute to the many angling associations throughout this country who are responsible for the restocking of many of our rivers.  While there is no monetary return to them, they have a deep-rooted interest in the industry and I take this opportunity to thank them.</P>
    <P>Another very important question raised was that of pollution.  If you, a Chathaoirligh, will bear with me I will dwell on this for a few moments.  The responsibility for water pollution would fall primarily within the jurisdiction of the Department of the Environment and the local authorities under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977.  The protection of fishing waters from pollution and poisoning is provided for under sections of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959.  The regional fisheries boards are responsible for the protection of fisheries and fish-bearing waters under the Fisheries Act, 1980. They usually prosecute pollution offences detected by them under these sections. The maximum penalty on summary conviction is £500 or, at the discretion of the court, imprisonment for any term not exceeding six months, or both such fine and imprisonment.  The regional fisheries boards submit reports to my Department in respect of each individual fish kill which is reported to them.  The causes of fish kills originate from various sources, notably poor farm practices in regard to the storage and disposal of animal slurries, <Col N="2154" /> silage effluent, pesticide wastes and industrial activities.  The Northern and North Western Regional Fisheries Boards, insert advertisements in the local papers circulating in their respective areas reminding farmers who are planning to make silage of the need to ensure that they have proper facilities for the disposal of the effluent.</P>
    <P>I will give the House a few facts.  The number of prosecutions initiated by the regional fisheries boards in respect of pollution offences in 1984 was 63, in 1985 it was 73 and in 1986 it was in the region of 72.  Therefore, the regional fisheries boards, the local authorities and the Department of the Environment are doing their utmost in this respect.  We have impressed, and will continue to impress, on them the necessity of ensuring that there is no further pollution as far as possible.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to Senator O'Toole who has some evidence of fishing outside the 12-mile limit by foreign vessels.  I will be only too pleased to have further details from him at some stage and I hope he will be kind enough to give them to me.  I remind the House that for some days past spotter planes have surveyed the west coast.  I have no reports back as yet but I am sure that if those boats were there we will receive reports on them in more precise detail than Senator O'Toole may have.  Certainly I will be interested in obtaining any details he can give me.</P>
    <P>I accept what Senator O'Callaghan says, that it is not normal that the irresponsible minority are tarnishing the reputation of the responsible majority, and I mentioned that earlier.  He said he has great sympathy for me because I will be very much in the firing line.  I am glad of any sympathy but I do not need it.  I think the fishermen have realised in the past few days that I am working in their best interests and it is for that reason that I will do my utmost to stamp out weekend and after season fishing.</P>
    <P>The thorny question of monofilament nets &mdash; it is a thorny question &mdash; is one which is being considered by the salmon review group set up by the former Minister, <Col N="2155" /> Deputy Liam Kavanagh.  The review group will be reporting to us in a matter of months.  We will take the decisions which we feel are right for the country, as they concern the draft net, the drift net, the loop net and the angling associations.  The Department of Tourism and Transport will also have an input in this area.  Decisions will be taken which will be in the best interests of the country.</P>
    <P>Senator Kiely referred to pollution which I have dealt with.  He also raised two important matters.  First, there was the question of red tide which is very topical at the moment.  I will take this opportunity to outline to the House the present position in this regard.  The red tide is known as marine algal blooms or acquatic algal blooms.  There are many different species of unicellular organisms and these are capable of blooming explosively, given the right conditions of water circulation and temperature increase. Unfortunately, those conditions prevail in the Cork harbour area at the moment. These blooms fall into three main categories, consisting of species which kill fish by gill clogging and asphyxiation or choking and may also have a mildly irritating effect on human skin; a species which, if consumed by humans, could give rise to persistent diarrhoea and will also kill fish by choking and species which, if consumed by humans, could cause paralysis and will also kill fish by choking.</P>
    <P>My Department provide services to three sectors, namely, finfish farmers, shellfish farmers and regional health authorities at their request and with their co-operation, their interest being health care while our interest is the protection of the farmers and the securing of their trading credibility.  Roinn na Mara have been providing this service since 1984 and indeed lesser services since 1976.  It is important to point out that samples are received daily at the fisheries research centre at Abbotstown from all around the coast and our laboratory is equipped to do the necessary tests.</P>
    <P>In relation to Cork harbour, it has been confirmed that red tide is in that area. <Col N="2156" /> There will be no further taking of shellfish from this area until my Department can confirm to the health board that this bloom is gone.  That may take some time. Many of us will have pressure exerted on us to try to ensure that these fish can be taken and can be exported.  All we can do in our Department at the moment is to ensure that no licences are issued for exporting purposes.  I understand the Southern Health Board are in a position to ban any movement from that area.</P>
    <P>We must act responsibly and take all the necessary steps.  I pointed out the effects that these species can have on human beings.  There is a high risk of PSP in shellfish.  Any pressure which may arise will not deter us from taking the necessary steps in the long term interest of the industry and indeed of our exports.  I hope that, as was suggested by Senator O'Callaghan, the Department will be in a position to keep the public informed about this matter and the Southern Health Board from time to time.</P>
    <P>The question was raised as to the steps which are being taken in relation to the importation of eggs or young fish.  Since 1972 the importation of live fish and the eggs or young of each fish has been prohibited except under licence from my Department.  In addition to the health status of the fish being imported, it must be certified by the relevant authority in the country of origin on the basis of criteria set down by my Department.  Juvenile fish are examined at source by my Department's fish pathologist to establish their disease-free status before importation can be allowed.  As an additional precaution, all materials involved in the transporting of imported fish must be destroyed.  It is my intention to encourage the relatively new fish farming industry to become fully self-sufficient at all levels of production as soon as possible, thus virtually eliminating the need to import young fish.  I assure Senator Kiely, if he has any fears in relation to importation, that all the necessary steps are being taken to ensure that no diseases are transmitted.</P>
    <P>I hope I have answered most of the questions raised by the various Senators. <Col N="2157" /> In conclusion, I would like to take this further opportunity, at the risk of repeating myself, to appeal in the middle of the salmon season, to all our fishermen to bear in mind that we are dealing with a renewable resource, to respect the law enforcement agencies, to respect the weekend closed season and to bear in mind that fishing during the weekend or after the end of the season will not be tolerated by me, by the Minister or by the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter I wish to raise on the Adjournment is the attendance of senior Irish diplomats, including the Irish Ambassador, at a reception on 25 June in the Vatican for President Waldheim of Austria.  I attempted to raise this matter under Standing Order 29 on the morning of 25 June when there was a possibility that some intervention might take place by the Minister for Foreign Affairs requiring the ambassador not to attend, as happened in a number of other countries. You, a Chathaoirligh ruled that this was out of order, quite properly.  I would like to express my gratitude to you for your courtesy in that ruling and for your assistance to me in finding a proper method of introducing this matter which I consider very important for discussion before the House so that the Minister, in this case the Minister, of State to whom <Col N="2158" /> I am very grateful for attending this evening, would have the opportunity to respond.</P>
      <P>At the outset I wish to say I have no intention whatever of attempting to criticise the Pope as a spiritual leader. He is one of the world's great spiritual leaders and it would be an impertinence for me to criticise him in any sense in that role.  It would also be deeply offensive to the vast majority of Irish people.  I should like it to be noted at the outset that there is no intention whatever on my part to deliver this kind of insult.  However, the Pope is also a Head of State.  He has a political role.  He acts as a political figure and in this case there is no doubt whatever that his initiative or his reaction to proposals that emerged from Vienna was seen by the Austrian Government as a very direct and very clear political situation and it was responded to by the representatives of this country as a political situation.  It is only with that dimension that I intend to deal.</P>
      <P>Had Dr. Waldheim intended merely to visit the Vatican on a pastoral quest, it would have caused no concern whatever that Pope John Paul II should hear his confession, but this was a different matter.  This is a matter which clearly caused concern.  I have here a scrapbook compiled, 14 pages long, every single page filled with reports in the Irish newspapers, first, heralding this proposed visit, giving quite clearly the reasons of the Austrian Government for so anxiously negotiating and seeking it, and then the reaction throughout the world to the advance publicity of that visit, the visit itself and the aftermath.  It is very instructive, indeed, to look at this process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that shortly before the Waldheim visit was announced in a report in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 14 June 1987, it was stated that there was no intention that this country should invite President Waldheim to visit.  I welcome that unofficial assurance and I trust that this evening the Minister will be able to copperfasten that assurance and reassure the Irish people that there will be no intention of inviting Dr. Waldheim to <Col N="2159" /> visit.  There is no doubt that he is a highly controversial figure and that the invitation from the Vatican to visit Rome for an audience with the Pope effectively broke what has been referred to in every single newspaper in this country, and most of the newspapers throughout the world, as a blockade, an isolation of the Austrian President.</P>
    <P>It is not for me in this House to abuse the privileges of such an occasion by appearing to sit in judgment upon Dr. Waldheim, but it is worth reading into the record of the House the reasons why so many countries, including the European countries and the United States of America, felt it necessary either not to attend this reception at all or to instruct a junior diplomat to attend in place of the Ambassador.  The reason is that while Dr. Waldheim has not as yet been found guilty, sufficient doubt has been raised so that the United States Justice Department has reason to believe that sufficient evidence exists that Dr. Waldheim may have assisted or otherwise participated in the persecution of persons because of race, religion, national origin or political opinion.  Although a Head of State, he has been placed on a watch list of undesirable aliens whose entry into the United States of America shall be prohibited. The United States of America is not the only country which is clearly sensitive to this issue.</P>
    <P>I have before me also a report of the attitude of the Italian Government who were very clearly upset and dismayed by this invitation.  The Italian Government made clear, in the days surrounding the Waldheim visit, their disapproval of the occasion by specifically not according to President Waldheim the courtesy of a call on their foreign ministry which is, as the Minister I am sure knows, a traditional conclusion of visits by foreign Heads of State to the Vatican.  The Italian Government very clearly and very deliberately snubbed Dr. Waldheim and this, despite the fact that the Austrian Foreign Minister, Mr. Alois Mock announced to the press that the invitation of Dr. Waldheim was an exceptional gesture of the Holy <Col N="2160" /> Father to the President.  It was, indeed, an exceptional gesture and I believe a most unfortunate one.</P>
    <P>If you look at the response immediately on the announcement &mdash; the headlines were: &ldquo;Waldheim's Papal Trip Angers Jews,&rdquo;&ldquo;Inquiry on Waldheim&rdquo;&mdash; even the Austrian Government felt impelled by the international outcry, the outrage which is echoed here in page after page, to establish an inquiry into the bona fides, the standing of their own President under the chairmanship of a distinguished Swiss military historian, Hans Rudolf Kurtz. As the days built up, increasing doubts grew as to the suitability of the attendance by Irish diplomats at this particular reception for Dr. Waldheim.  In a human way, it is very moving to read reports in the newspapers of the reaction of some of those who were most intimately concerned with this tragic period of European history.  I quote from <i>The Evening Press</i> of 25 June, the evening after this audience, which said:</P>
    <P>The atmosphere was tense and one man whose parents spent time in a concentration camp yelled, &ldquo;It is useless for the Pope to go to Auschwitz to cry for our dead and then receive this Nazi.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the degree of feeling there was in Europe, in Rome, on that afternoon. That is the kind of feeling unleashed by this visit.  I will quote again, this time from <i>The Evening Press:</i></P>
    <P>Italian former concentration camp victims yelling shame, and waving posters bearing the names of Nazi death camps waited at the Vatican for Dr. Waldheim's arrival.  Many of the protestors had concentration camp numbers tattooed on their arms.</P>
    <P>This is important because, alas, we cannot afford to forget the history of Europe, the tragic history of Europe, in which Austria played a particularly undistinguished role.  It is because of the role of Austria as a country that I feel it particularly important that we should be sensitive to receptions for a President <Col N="2161" /> of Austria whose credibility has been so seriously called into question.</P>
    <P>I refer to a number of surveys that were carried out.  For example, a survey of interviews conducted by the allied occupying forces between 1946 and February 1948 shows that only 42.6 per cent of respondents thought national socialism was a bad idea, and 38.1 per cent of Austrians, between 1946 and 1948, thought that national socialism was actually a good idea.  There are even more worrying statistics, because I want to place the position of President Waldheim in a context in terms of his own country and its responsibilities.  In 1973 another survey was conducted which asked Austrians if they should feel a special degree of responsibility towards the Jews: 67 per cent said no.  In 1976, 83 per cent asked for an end to war crime trials. One wonders why they wished this process of justice to end.  Perhaps the explanation comes with the infinitely worrying statistics.  In 1982, 77 per cent of Austrians agreed either completely or partly with the statement that the Jews were to a certain degree themselves responsible for mass exterminations.  I regret very much to have to tell the Minister that by 1986 this figure had actually gone up, not down.  Sympathy for these appalling ideologies is not dying out; it is reawakening. In 1986, 43 per cent of a representative sample said Jews were not Austrians, and a staggering 79 per cent thought the Jews had been at least partly responsible for their own fate.</P>
    <P>It seems that there was occasion for us to be at least cautious in appearing to give approval to a Head of State who could be construed as representing this kind of unfortunate trend in European thought which I had hoped we might have put behind us at this stage.  I again draw a distinction here between Dr. Waldheim as a man and Dr. Waldheim as a Head of State, because I noted with interest that Vatican officials drew this distinction and said they were not welcoming him as a man, they were welcoming him instead as a functionary of an institution or a State.  I am attempting to close off that argument as well by saying that, until <Col N="2162" /> these doubts are resolved, a question mark still exists.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to pillory the Austrian people, their nation or their Government because I believe that we are all guilty in this.  I remind the Minister that under the Constitution Ireland is defined as a Christian and democratic State.  I sometimes wonder, when I hear this phrase so glibly trotted out on all sides in debate, what does it mean, that we are a Christian and democratic State?  I speak as somebody who attempts to live as a Christian and to believe as a Christian.  Does Christianity, as a result of this clause in the Constitution, inform the conduct of our daily affairs?  Does it inform our foreign policy, for example, or are we, like so many other countries, merely mercenary, merely self seeking?</P>
    <P>Is there any international standard of morality at all?  I sometimes wonder particularly in a case like the question of the audience of President Waldheim, what the Christian response would be in these circumstances, certainly to forgive the individual but not, I am sure, to appear even to condone the kinds of activities of which Dr. Waldheim has been accused.  While, there is no secure proof of guilt, there is at least an acknowledgment that at the very minimum he falsified events in his own biography and did not tell the full truth about events that took place during the war.</P>
    <P>Lest I should be seen in what I have already said and what I intend to say further to be merely sensitive to the question of the Jewish problem, I should like to remind the House that the activities of which Dr. Waldheim stands accused and whose substance has been attested to by the activities and the response of the United States Justice Department were not only against the Jews but also against Yugoslavian and Greek patriots and partisans, so that any insult towards the Jewish people is also an insult towards the Yugoslavian and Greek Governments. We also must be aware of and sensitive to this problem.  We are not isolated from it.  We are not cut off.  I noted the reply of the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, when questioned about the <Col N="2163" /> appropriateness of this.  He replied with easy affableness that there was no problem, a phrase with which I understand his name is associated in the popular view&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It was singularly inappropriate. We may comfort ourselves that we have little to regret on the question of the European Holocaust but we have because in the past we have been insensitive.  I remember with great shame the visit of an otherwise extremely distinguished President of this country, Eamon de Valera, to the German Embassy at the end of the war to express condolence with the German ambassador on the death of Adolf Hitler.  I remember also with the greatest regret that in 1943 a former Member of this House actually said &mdash; and it is on the record of this House &mdash; that Hitler had the right idea about the Jews and that we should learn something from him.  None of us has our hands clean.  It is a matter in which it behoves us all as human beings and as Christians to be extremely careful.</P>
      <P>If we look at the visit itself, it is notable that the newspaper reports emphasised the fact that &mdash; and I quote <i>The Irish Times</i> of 26 June:</P>
      <P>Ignoring world wide storm of Jewish protest.</P>
      <P>I make the point here that I do not believe the protest was exclusively Jewish; it was mounted by persons of conscience all over the world.</P>
      <P>&mdash; Pope John Paul II yesterday warmly welcomed President Kurt Waldheim of Austria to the Vatican for his first official visit abroad since he was elected a year ago.</P>
      <P>The man who until yesterday was being called &ldquo;the prisoner of Vienna,&rdquo; because of the reluctance of most countries to receive him, was given the full diplomatic treatment down to the smallest detail of protocol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was not just a formal visit.  It was, <Col N="2164" /> most unfortunately, a red carpet.  I feel strongly &mdash; and I know many Irish people feel strongly with me &mdash; that it was highly inappropriate for a diplomat of the status of ambassador to be present at this controversial visit.  Of course, as a spiritual leader it is perfectly appropriate for the Pope to mix with persons of doubtful reputation.  After all the founder of the religion, Jesus Christ, did that as a matter of principle and the present Pope has been remarkably generous in the inclusion of this kind of person in his circle.  One remembers also, regrettably, the figure of Archbishop Markincus in this.  However, it is of course appropriate for a great spiritual leader to be charitable, but charity of this kind is the province of spiritual leaders.  We must be aware of the political repercussions of our action.  I must ask the Minister whether it was not surely more appropriate to take the line that other European countries did in either instructing their ambassador to be absent, or that the country should be represented by a less senior diplomat. I note that this was done by many countries, including the United States and Italy.  The Minister will have a full list of those countries who took this action.  I very much wish that this action had been taken.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to inform the House why the decision was taken that the ambassador should go.  Who took it? Was there a specific reason?  Was it intended to reinforce Dr. Waldheim or, as a political decision, was it intended to release this discredited figure once more on to the international stage?  If it was I reiterate my belief that it was a great mistake.  I look at the aftermath and at 27 June where, in the light of the fact that the Pope intends to make a visit over the next year to the United States of America, all the leading Jewish groups in the United States have decided to boycott that visit which is most unfortunate and regrettable in a situation where perhaps the Pope might have used his influence diplomatically to relieve some of the tensions in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>I note that even in Dr. Waldheim's own country of Austria the response on <Col N="2165" /> behalf of the Socialist Party was to ask him to resign.  Most worrying of all, look at the flurry of invitations that were subsequently received and where they came from.  Almost immediately an announcement was made in the press that Dr. Waldheim was to visit Iran, the country that after the demise of the Nazi regime in Europe has the single most bloody record in abuse of human rights.  There is not time for me to read the shameful category of their atrocities into the record.  Anybody who wishes it may purchase the briefing document on Iran by Amnesty International.  What is the response of this Government?  We have an Iranian Embassy here which has recently been expanded.  We have also got an office of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, which I welcome.  They continually send me briefing documents. I do not wish to open up too controversial an area, but it is noticeable that the Vatican has no diplomatic representation from Israel and that Ireland is the only European Community country that does not have an exchange of ambassadors. This I know is a delicate area but I urge the Minister to take into account this very important fact in a situation where the Waldheim visit came up.  It is most important although I will not go into great detail because there is no time and it might be indelicate.  I urge the Minister to consider this question of the establishment of proper and full diplomatic relations between this country and the State of Israel.  I look forward to his reply in the matter of the diplomatic representation of this country at this most regrettable reception of a Head of State.</P>

      <P>I will start by thanking Senator Norris for his extremely articulate contribution. The Government's position is that Ireland maintains good and friendly relations with Austria as a State and will continue to do so.  President Waldheim is the democratically elected Austrian Head of State.  Our Ambassador in Vienna has presented credentials to President Waldheim.  The reception <Col N="2166" /> offered by the Vatican to enable ambassadors accredited to the Holy See to meet President Waldheim on the occasion of his visit to the Vatican on 25 June was in accordance with normal diplomatic protocol.  Similarly, in attending the reception, the Irish Ambassador was following normal diplomatic protocol. I should point out that he was one of a large number of ambassadors representing democratic States in doing this.</P>
      <P>The Senator mentioned the question of the invitation to which I should respond.  In the course of his State visit to Austria last year President Hillery, in accordance with the diplomatic courtesies, normally extended between visiting Heads of State, extended to his host, who was then the Austrian President, Dr. Kirchschlaeger, an invitation to visit Ireland.  The then President, that is, Dr. Kirchschlaeger, made a private visit to Ireland in March 1987.  I want to inform the House that there are no plans for an official visit to Ireland by President Waldheim.  I should also point out that in these matters of invitations between Heads of State, quite a number of these protocol invitations never materialise; some of them do but quite a number do not.</P>
      <P>The Pope, as the Senator said, is also a Head of State.  His invitation to President Waldheim obviously was an invitation to another Head of State.  It just struck me, as the Senator spoke, that Austria did not exist, as such, as a State during the period of Nazi outrages involving that country.  Indeed, it was one of the first States to be swallowed up by the Hitler regime.  It is a State that was established anew after the war.  It is a member of the community of democratic States with which Ireland and all other democratic States have maintained diplomatic relations for many decades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say, in the strongest possible way, that the Government, like Senator Norris, will not engage in pillorying the Austrian nation, its people or their State. It is for that reason that Ireland maintains good and friendly relations with Austria and will continue to do so.  I should also <Col N="2167" /> stress to the House that the formal institution of the State must deal with formal and legal structures and legal institutions as it finds them.  It does not have the luxury of dealing with these matters on an individual, personal or emotional level.  We must deal with them in a formal, structured way.  We must deal with the institutions as they present themselves to the House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2168" /> There are no plans for an official visit to Ireland by President Waldheim.  Ireland will continue to maintain good and friendly relations with Austria.  I look forward to us continuing on that line.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 6.45 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 14 July 1987.</P>
