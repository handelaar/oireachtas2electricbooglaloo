      <P>Ba mhaith liom go gcuirfí rún comhbhróin chuig clann Ned Murphy as ucht a bháis.  Bhí sé san Teach seo agus san Teach eile den Oireachtas as son a pháipéir ó 1931.</P>
      <P>He was a man who did justice to this House and to the Dáil.  He was a fellow Kilkenny man.  He saw the formation of this State and he treated the Houses of the Oireachtas at all times with respect. He gave them the status that they deserved and it is my privilege to ask that we remember him in a special way.  We send our deepest sympathy to his family and we hope those who follow him will deal with the business they have to report just as Ned did in his lifetime.</P>

      <P>I wish, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, to voice my sadness on learning of the sudden death of Ned Murphy who was known to all of us.  It is hard to conceive that his quizzical eye is no longer focused on the debate in this House from the press benches.  He was very much part and parcel of this House and, indeed, of the whole of Leinster House.  A very important element is now missing from all of our lives.  It will be very strange, indeed, to think that we will <Col N="1786" /> not meet him again in the Chamber or its environs.  I would like to express the sympathy of the Fine Gael group to his family and to say that he was a gentleman, a wise man and a first class reporter. May he rest in peace.</P>

Cosúil le Senator O'Toole, ní raibh aithne agam féin ar Ned Murphy ach tá a fhios agam go raibh árd-mheas ag Senators Ferris agus Harte air.  Ba mhaith linn comhbhrón a dhéanamh len a chlann.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be associated with the expression of sympathy on the death of E. B. Murphy.  Last week he attended here at the House.  He was a friend to Senators from all sides of the House for many years.  He carried out his official duties in an exemplary way and over the years we have grown to look upon him as a friend and a colleague and we will miss his genial presence.  I should like to be associated with the expression of sympathy to his family and also to his colleagues on the press gallery.</P>

      <P>Bhí cuid mhaith aithne agam ar Ned Murphy, agus an rud ba mhó a chuaigh i bhfeidm orm ná go raibh an sprid beo i gcónaí ann.  Is beag duine a bhí i gcomh-aois le Ned Murphy go raibh an oiread sin den sprid argóinte agus sprid cainte ann, an sprid ceisteanna a phlé leat agus a bhí ag Ned Murphy. <Col N="1787" /> Baineadh an-geit asam ar maidin nuair a léigh mé go raibh sé caillte.  Ní fhéadfá a chreidiúint gur tharla a leithéid, bhí sé chomh beo, bríomhar agus chomh gníomh ach sin go dí go bhfuair sé bás.  Mar gach éinne sa Teach, déanaim comhbhrón lena chlann agus ba mhaith liom a rá leo go raibh saol iontach, fiúntach aige. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>

      <P>I would like to be associated with the tributes being paid to the late Ned Murphy who was taken very suddenly from us yesterday.  As some Senators have already said, he attended at the last sitting of this Seanad which was only last week.  He was a character well known to all Members of the Oireachtas for many years.  He was one with whom one was always anxious to discuss the political happenings he had seen, and many of us who are older Members of the House have seen, down the years.  It was a great pleasure to discuss these happenings with Ned.  Very often we sought his opinion and likewise he sought our opinions.  He operated as a political correspondent since 1931.  I venture to say that he was probably the longest serving political correspondent in Europe.  He will certainly be missed around the corridors and in many areas of this House.  May he rest in peace.  I am glad the Seanad are sending a message of sympathy to his relatives today.</P>

      <P>Roimh Riar na hOibre, chuir tú fáilte roimh Lá na Gaeilge: cuidím leis, ach caithim a rá, don tríú uair sa Teach, cuireadh tímpeall chugainn Billí de gach sórt le seachtaíní anuas, ach ní raibh na téarmaí as Gaeilge in aon cheann acu, ní raibh sliocht Ghaeilge in aon cheann acu.  Ní féidir aon Bhille a phlé go gcuirfear aistriúchán ar an mBille, aistriúchán ar théarmaí na mBillí.  Is hypocrisy den céad scoth é go bhfuil muid anseo ag labhairt ar Lá na Gaeilge agus ag cur i gcéill go bhfuil tacaíocht againn don Ghaeilge nuair an rud is furasta dúinn a dhéanamh&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Maraon le Seanator O'Toole, cuirim fáilte roimh Lá na Gaeilge, ach ní fiú linn lá mar seo nuair nach bhfuil aon tseirbhís aistriúcháin againn sa Teach seo, agus táim cinnte nach bhfuil ach b'fhéidir 25 faoin gcéad de na hiriseoirí atá anseo ábalta an méid atá mé ag rá anois a thuiscint.  Tá sé mar a gcéanna mar gheall ar Baill an Tí.  Ní cóir go mbeidh díomá ar éinne anseo nach bhfuil ábalta Gaeilge a labhairt, ach muna bhfuil seirbhís aistriúcháin mar atá sa Dáil, ní fiú dúinn bheith ag caint faoin Ghaeilge bheith dá úsáid anseo.  Dá mba rud é go raibh seirbhís aistriúcháin ann d'fhéadfaí Gaeilge a usáid sa Teach seo. A fhad is nach bhfuil seirbhís aistriúcháin ann níl aon spreagadh dúinn agus, chun an fhirinne a rá, ní fiú dúinn mar ní thuig-fear sinn agus ní scríofar focal fúinn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Caithfidh me gearán a dhéanamh le Ceannaire an Tí ar an bpointe.  Tháinig se chugainn tuairim is mí ó shin agus do chur sé i gcéill dúinn go raibh an-bhrú oibre orainn agus go raibh Bille i ndiaidh Bhille le teacht os ár gcomhair amach.  Mar is cuimhin liom, dúirt sé go raibh suas le dosaen Billí le cur os ár gcomhair amach roimh an Nollaig. Táimid anois coicís nó, b'fhéidir, trí seachtain ina dhiaidh sin agus i rith na seachtaine seo nílimid ach ag teacht le chéile ach ar aon lá amháin.  Níl sé sin sásúil.  Ba mhaith liom a fháil amach ó Cheannaire an Tí cén fáth nach bhfuilimid ag tógáil an Adoption Bill, an Companies Bill, an Insurance Bill nó an reachtaíocht ar fad atá ós ár gcomhair amach.  Níl sé sásúil.  Níl aon riar in aon chor ar obair an Tí seo muna bhfuil an sórt sin oibre os ár gcomhair amach.</P>
      <P>I hesitate to do so but I wish to repeat in English what I just said in Irish in case it has not been clear to everybody.  We have heard about the amount of work that was coming before us.  A month ago the Leader of the House told us there would be so much work that we would have to meet three days a week from then until Christmas, that we could not get through all the business, that there were up to 11 Bills waiting to be dealt with. We have now reached a stage where not only are those Bills not coming to us but the Committee Stages and the Report Stages of other Bills, notably the Adoption (No. 2) Bill, the Companies (No. 2) Bill and the Insurance Bill have not come back to us.  It is disgraceful and it reflects badly on the House.  It is the type of thing that gives an opportunity to those who criticise the House to come back at us. There is work to be done.  Why is it not being done?</P>

      <P>Os rud é nach raibh tú ábalta an Bille, the Prison Officers Compensation Bill, a thógaint ba mhaith liom ceist a chur ar an Seanadóir Lanigan an bhfuil aon phlean ag an Rialtas Bille a chur os ár gcomhair mar tá ceist na bpriosún an-phráinneach ag an noiméad. An bhféadfadh sé a insint dúinn an mbeimid in ár suí amárach?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>In deference to the previous speeches of some of my colleagues who, if I understood them correctly, suggested that there was some difficulty about talking in Irish because of the absence of translation facilities, I will make my remarks in the second national tongue.  I would like a ruling from the Leader of the House with regard to taking the Bill put down in the names of Senator O'Toole and myself which seeks to amend the 1987 Bill.  This is a matter of considerable national importance particularly since this Bill was denied a reading in the lower House.  It has been accepted in this House as a matter of national urgency that it should be taken.  It should be taken before next week when the date of 1 December passes in order that these very serious and important matters should be discussed in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I agree with the Senators who said go mba ceart go mbeadh gléas aistriúcháin anseo mar tá daoine anseo nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge go flúirseach acu.  Bhí rún ós ár gcomhair go mba cheart go mbeadh gléas aistriúcháin againn.  I ask again for the same translation system as they have in the Dáil.  Dúirt an Seanadóir O'Shea go bhfuil an prison officers Bill práinneach.  I had representations from the Prison Officers' Association.  I contacted them on a number of occasions and each time I contacted them they said they did not have time to meet me.  If the Bill is urgent I would suggest that they should meet me.  I got a piece of literature from them eventually.  I got in touch with that office on numerous occasions.  They <Col N="1791" /> contacted me about the Bill, I got back to them but I have not been able to meet them.  If it is urgent they should at least have the courage to come back to me, having contacted me in the first place.</P>

      <P>An Bille a chuir Páirtí an Lucht Oibre isteach níorbh fhéidir leis an Cathaoirleach é a thógáil sa Seanad, mar bhain sé le hairgead.  An bhfuil aon phlean ag an Rialtas Bille mar sin a thabhairt ós ár gcomhair?  Aontaím leis an Ceannaire, ós rud é go ndearna sé roinnt iarrachtaí dul chun cainte leis na prison officers nach bhfuair sé an deis sin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not at this stage any legislation coming before us of that nature.  There is no hypocrsy or cur i gcéill, as Senator Ryan states, on this side of the House regarding the use of Irish. If anybody wants to use the Irish language or the English language in this House they are quite entitled to do so.  There is no hypocrisy in stating that today because it is Lá na Gaeilge, people should use a bit more Irish.  If Senators wish to use Irish on any other day they are quite entitled to do so.</P>

      <P>We will be sitting next week.  I do not accept the statements made that this House is not working to its maximum capacity.  We will sit one day this week.  We have got through quite a number of Bills in the House.  I will exclude Senator O'Toole from the remarks I make on business we have put through the House.  It is not our job on this side of the House to delay the putting through of Bills.  If Bills go through faster than they would normally be expected to go through it is not our fault.  The Status of Children Bill, Report Stage, will be taken next week.  The Insurance Bill will be coming up within the next two weeks and the Adoption (No. 2) Bill will be before us.  I would also like to remind the House that this Seanad has put through more Bills in the short number of months we had been sitting then any other <Col N="1792" /> Seanad has put through in any year.  Since this was an election year that is something of which we should be proud.</P>

I am still not happy with <Col N="1793" /> this so I am now proposing an amendment to the Order of Business.  As I understand it, that is quite in order and quite within Standing Orders.

      <P>Go raibh mait agat.  Ní bheidh mé ach cúpla nóiméad, sílim.  I intend to make regulations called the Friendly Societies Regulations, 1987, which will bring about a considerable improvement in the operation of friendly societies.  A draft of these regulations has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas and, in accordance with the legislation governing friendly societies, each House must pass a resolution approving the draft before I can go ahead and make regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last June this House gave approval to a draft of the proposed regulations.  Since <Col N="1797" /> then I have reconsidered the position of the limits for loans and deposits in the case of specially authorised loan societies and have decided that the limits proposed in June were not adequate even though they represented a substantial increase. Therefore, I decided on a further upward revision of the limits.  Hence, I must now ask the approval of the House for the revised draft of the regulations.</P>
    <P>The proposed regulations can, for convenience, be split into two parts.  The first part deals with the position of what are called specially authorised loan societies and the second part applies to all other friendly societies.  Specially authorised loan societies were originally established to take in monthly subscriptions and from these to provide loans for special family events, such as bereavements, weddings, holidays, and so on.  They are small-scale operations and by law the maximum single deposit they can accept at present is £200 and the maximum loan that they can make is £50.  These limits were set in 1986 and they are far too small by today's values.  As can be seen we are not doing anything rash.</P>
    <P>The original draft of the regulations proposed to raise these limits so as to fix the maximum single deposit at £3,000 and the maximum loan that could be made at £1,500.  As I have explained to Senators, I now consider that the limit for a maximum single deposit should be raised to £5,000 and the maximum loan to £2,500.  These limits are intended merely to reflect realistic present day values and are not in any way intended to change the nature of the societies concerned from mutual help bodies, which they are, or to permit them to carry on business in a real commercial sense.  That was never the purpose of these bodies and it is not now intended either.  If the House approves the draft regulations in this form I will, of course, have to ask Dáil Eireann to approve the revised draft also.</P>
    <P>In view of these increases the regulations will also require these specially authorised loan societies to have supervisory committees.  In this way there will be an extra degree of supervision for <Col N="1798" /> these societies now that they will have the power to handle larger sums of money.  I also intend to raise the monetary limits applying to all other friendly societies in regard to certain types of assurances under mutual self-help schemes and benefits payable from these.  These limits were last set in 1966 and, on reviewing them, it was considered that more realistic limits should now be considered. It is proposed to increase the maximum benefit assurable to a member, and to which a member is entitled, to a sum of £10,000 and to set a similar limit to the amount a member may dispose of on his death by nomination or distribution when a member dies intestate.  The maximum amount payable on the death of a child would be £1,000.  Again, these changes are not intended to permit any change in the mutual status of friendly societies.</P>
    <P>The regulations will also provide additional safeguards for members by requiring proper accounting and auditing procedures in all friendly societies.  As the amount of money handled by friendly societies has grown over the years, provisions are included in the proposed regulations requiring each society to keep proper accounts, to retain the accounts of the six most recent years, to present accounts at each annual general meeting and to have the accounts audited each year by a properly qualified auditor.  I now ask Seanad Éireann to approve the draft regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Go raibh maith agat. Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire san Seanad inniu.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the updating of the draft regulations for the friendly societies.  I have no doubt that the Minister will agree it was a timely intervention on his behalf to update the regulations in view of the fact that the Act was passed in 1896. In June of this year, regulations were brought before the House to increase the maximum single deposit from £200 to £3,000 and the maximum single loan from £50 to £2,500.  I am glad to hear the Minister has decided to increase the maximum single deposit to £5,000 and the maximum loan deposit to £2,500. <Col N="1799" /> This will provide people with an up-to-date alternative to other lending institutions such as banks and building societies.</P>
    <P>Friendly societies have played a large part in the social aspect of communities by providing monetary assistance for such functions as holidays, weddings and other family events.  The introduction of the regulations today has increased the value of the societies in respect of everyday life. They are now an up-to-date alternative to illegal moneylenders.  We have all seen the brutal tactics by which moneylenders operate their business.  They lend money at extreme rates to people who find themselves in severe financial difficulties. When these unfortunate people are unable to keep up their repayments the moneylenders use illegal and barbaric means to try to get money from them. Families and homes have been destroyed due to these moneylenders.  I compliment the Minister on bringing these regulations before the House.  They are up-to-date now on a financial basis; it was farcical that a loan deposit of £200 was the maximum that could be made.  I welcome the Minister's initiative in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom freisin fáilte a chur roimh an Aire Stáit who has explained the position briefly.  As he has pointed out, what he is doing here today is seeking the approval of the House for regulations which he has prepared and which have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in draft form as he has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree totally that an updating of these regulations are long overdue.  As the Minister said, the Principal Act dates back to 1896.  Certainly, any changes upwards in loans and deposits at this point in time are long overdue.  It is important that when we are dealing with the public and their finances we should from time to time examine &mdash; building societies, banks or whatever &mdash; any body engaged in the distribution or taking in of money.  It is right and proper from time to time that we should have a look at the regulations and so on to ensure <Col N="1800" /> that they are up-to-date and to ensure that the consumer has adequate protection at all times.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has rightly pointed out, the friendly societies are now, and will be in the future, handling much larger sums of money, larger deposits, larger loans.  It is unthinkable that in this day and age the limits should be as he outlined to us, very low limits indeed.  Now we are looking for adequate limits.  It is right and proper to say that over the years this type of organisation within the financial world has played an important role in the social life of our country.</P>
    <P>The elements of the regulations are clearly set out to us, the various substitutions from the low figures to high figures.  I particularly welcome one of the regulations in the knowledge that we can have money disappearing through fraud, misappropriation of funds, or whatever. I therefore welcome the fact that the Minister laid a good deal of emphasis on a proper accounts system for the societies. In the Explanatory Note to the regulations he has clearly stipulated that the content of the accounts of all registered societies and the balance sheets should be laid before the annual general meetings of those societies and the regulations require the audit to be carried out by a public auditor.  I am not sure if that provision has been there in the past but if it has not been, it is all the more welcome. In this day and age, public accountability is appropriate.  That regulation in particular is one that I welcome but, overall, it is time for a change in these regulations.  The Minister has acted correctly and wisely.  Certainly on this side of the House there is no opposition to it &mdash; a total welcome in fact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their very warm welcome for these measures. Senator Reynolds quite rightly expressed worry about the activities of some moneylenders.  That is a worry I would share, particularly coming up to the Christmas period, obviously a traumatic time for many families.  It is a scandal <Col N="1801" /> that very many moneylenders abuse a privileged position to take advantage of many thousands of disadvantaged families. Certainly, that is something I join with the Senator in denouncing, but that is not what we are at here today.  This regulation will apply in effect to 11 organisations; there are only 11 of them in existence at the moment.  They have about 15,000 members and those 11 are the special, authorised loan societies to which these new limits will not apply. They are not in the moneylending category as such; they are a special category governed by the friendly societies legislation.</P>
      <P>I can confirm to Senator Fallon that as they are not limited companies &mdash; rather they are friendly societies &mdash; the requirement to have accounts and so on properly kept has not been laid down in as strict a form as it is now being laid down.  It is about time we got around to doing this. I thank the Senators for their very kind agreement to this proposal.</P>

      <P>Ní miste a lua ar dtús, ar ndóigh, go raibh a lán tuairimí á nochtadh le roinnt míonna anuas nach gcloífeadh an Rialtas le cuspóirí an Chrannchuir &mdash; cúnamh breise ar leith a chur ar fáil do spórt, do na healaíona, don chultúr agus don Ghaeilge &mdash; agus nach raibh sa chrannchur ach cáin ar bhealach eile agus go n-úsáidfí an t-airgead i ndáil le gnáthimeachtaí an Stáit.  Ach léirigh na tograí éagsúla a fógraíodh an tseachtain seo caite nach raibh aon fhírinne sna tuairimí sin agus is cúis mórtais domsa, mar Aire Stáit ag Roinn na Gaeltachta, go bhfuil suim shuntasach £4 mhilliún á cur ar fáil as fáltais an chrannchuir ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge.</P>
      <P>Ar ndóigh, bhí an-chuid iarratas againn ar chúnamh ón gcrannchur agus ní fhéadfaí teacht i gcabhair orthu uile. Ní hé sin le rá nach raibh fiúntas ag baint leo agus tuigim go maith go bhféadfadh díomá a bheith ar dhreamanna áirithe toisc nár cuireadh airgead ar fáil dóibh.  Is féidir liom a rá, ar ndóigh, go ndearnadh gach iarratas a mheas go cúramach agus gur roghnaíodh na tograí le haghaidh cúnaimh tar éis gach gné de gach cás a chur san áireamh.</P>
      <P>Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil liosta feicthe agaibh sna nuachtáin de thograí Gaeilge atá ag fáil cúnaimh airgid agus go ndearnadh cur síos níos iomláine ar roinnt acu.  B'fhéidir nár mhiste dom anois cur síos gairid a thabhairt daoibh ar gach togra atá ag fáil cúnaimh ar an £4 mhilliún don Ghaeilge ionas go mbeidh sé níos soiléire daoibh an réimse leathan d'imeachtaí atá clúdaithe.</P>

Rachaidh an togra seo chun leasa na teanga féin agus an 1,100 macléinn a bhainfidh úsáid as na saoráidí ar bhonn leanúnach.</P>
    <P>Tá suim airgid breise de £150,000 á chur ar fáil do Chumann na bhFiann sa tréimhse go dtí 31 Nollaig 1988 chun a chumasú don eagras sin tuilleadh clubanna Gaeilge don aos óg a bhunú i mBaile Átha Cliath agus in áiteanna roghnaithe eile ar fud na tíre.</P>

    <P>Le cúnamh deonach nach beag, reachtáileann Cumann na bhFiann clubanna in áiteanna éagsúla ar fud na tíre.

Tá an t-airgead breise ag teastáil chun íoc as tuarastail, fearais, costais taistil agus na costais eile a bhainfeadh leis na timirí agus chun freastal ar chaiteachas eile ar nós cíos do hallaí, etc.</P>
    <P>Tá sé beartaithe £120,000 a chur ar fáil chun cabhrú le Muintir Chrónáin Ionad Cultúrtha a thógáil.

Tá an t-eagras deonach seo an-ghníomhach ó shin agus gréasáin teangan á mbunú acu ar mhaithe le pobail, teaghlaigh, scoileanna lánGhaeilge, déagóirí, daoine fásta, etc.</P>

      <Col N="1804" /> Meastar go gcosnóidh an obair thógála ar an Ionad Cultúrtha £230,000.  Tá suíomh, le lánchead pleanála, ag Muintir Chrónáin cheana féin agus tá £80,000 bailithe go háitiúil acu chun cabhrú leo na costais a ghlanadh.</P>
    <P>Tá cumas Gaeilge ag a lán daoine toisc oideachas trí Ghaeilge a bheith ar fáil sa cheantar agus tabharfaidh an t-ionad, in am tráth, deis dóibh chun úsáid nádúrtha a bhaint as an nGaeilge sin atá acu.  Tá an suíomh suite ag Bóthar Belgard, Tamhlacht, agus cuirfear ar chumas Mhuintir Chrónáin freastal ar na grúpaí teangan go léir atá gníomhach sa cheantar agus ar an líon méadaithe macléinn a bhfuil oideachas trí Ghaeilge á fháil acu.</P>
    <P>Cuirfear cúnamh £30,000 ar fáil don tréimhse go 31 Nollaig 1988 ó chiste an chrannchuir d'Eagraíocht na Scoileanna Gaeltachta, eagras deonach de mhúinteoirí agus de thuismitheoirí Gaeltachta, a bhfuil an chéad iarracht fhiúntach le blianta fada anuas á dhéanamh acu chun fadhbanna teanga na limistéar Gaeltachta a réiteach ón dtaobh istigh.</P>

    <P>Cuirfear £90,000 ar fáil chun obair dheisiúcháin agus athcóiriú a dhéanamh ar &ldquo;an tÁras&rdquo; i gCorcaigh. Tá úsáid á bhaint as &ldquo;an tÁras&rdquo; ó 1958 i leith mar an t-aon ionad don Ghaeilge do cheantar na cathrach agus na fo-bhailte i gCorcaigh. Eagraíonn an-chuid dreamanna atá gníomhach i gcur chun cinn na Gaeilge gníomhaíochtaí teanga agus cultúir san ionad.</P>
    <P>Tá gá le deisiú a dhéanamh láithreach ar an bhfoirgneamh, atá sean, mar aon le athchóiriú agus athfheistiú.  D'fhéadfaí a lán a dhéanamh leis &ldquo;an tÁras&rdquo; agus le hathchóiriú cheart a dhéanamh ar an áit, táim cinnte go mbeidh i bhfad níos mó imeachtaí trí Ghaeilge ar siúl ann.</P>
    <P>Úsáidfear £220,000 ón gcrannchur le haghaidh oibreacha feabhsúcháin i dTaibhbhdhearc na Gaillimhe agus chun <Col N="1805" /> scéim phíolótach a thionscnamh chun seirbhís níos fearr a chur ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht agus do Ghaeilgeoirí lasmuigh de chathair na Gaillimhe.  Tá drochbhail ar díon na hamharclainne agus tá géarghá le spás stórais agus le cóiríocht i gcomhair cleachtaithe.</P>
    <P>Bunaíodh an Taibhdhearc i nGaillimh i 1928.  Tá compántas aisteoirí aimitéaracha ann a fheidhmíonn ar bhonn páirtaimsire toildheonach agus a chuireann drámaí, ceoldrámaí, drámaí do pháistí agus imeachtaí amharclainne ar fáil trí mheán na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Tá cúnamh £10,000 á chur ar fáil ón gcrannchur chun go mbeidh ar chumas comhar dianfheachtas margaíochta a thionscnamh agus chun tuilleadh feabhais agus scóip bhreise a thabhairt d'ábhar na hirise.  Bhí comhar chun tosaigh i gcónaí i gcur chun cinn na litríochta Gaeilge agus is ann a d'fhoilsigh cuid de mhórscríobhneoirí a luathshaothar.</P>
    <P>Is comhlacht nua é Clann Lir Teo., a cuireadh ar bun d'fhonn iar-ospidéal Naomh Sheosaimh i gCúil, Contae na hIarmhí, a fhorbairt mar Aonad Gaeilge agus Cultúrtha.  Cuirfear £100,000 ar fáil ón gcrannchur chun an t-áitreabh a mhaisiú agus é a chur ar fáil mar áras cónaithe dóibh siúd a bhfuil fonn orthu a gcuid Gaeilge a fheabhsú nó an teanga a fhoghlaim.  Tá sé beartaithe cúrsaí a reachtáil ann do réimse leathan daoine &mdash; daltaí scoile chomh maith le déagóirí agus daoine fásta.  Tá sé beartaithe cúrsaí lae, deireadh seachtaine, seachtaine agus níos faide a reachtáil ann.</P>
    <P>Cuirfear £400,000 ar fáil i 1988 ar mhaithe le feachtas fógraíochta chun úsáid na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn.  Mhúsclódh feachtas mar sin suim an phobail sa teanga agus thabharfadh sé eolas, dea-shampla (trí aird a tharraingt ar dhaoine mór le rá a úsáideann Gaeilge) agus spreagadh don phobal chun an méid Ghaeilge atá acu a úsáid.  Tá sé beartaithe fógraíocht a dhéanamh ar theilifís, ar raidió agus ar na nuachtáin.  Bhí beartas mar sin ar siúl cúpla bliain ó shin chun go mbeadh leanúnachas ann ach níor tharla sé sin, agus tá sé an-tábachtach go mbeidh an t-airgead seo curtha ar fáil leis an beartas seo a chur cinn arís.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1806" /> Reachtáiltear comórtas Ghlór na nGael gach bliain chun duaiseanna a bhronnadh ar an mbaile/sráidbhaile/ bhruachbhaile a rinne an méid is mó chun úsáid na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn i ngnáthshaol an phobail ann.  Is é aidhm an chomórtais ná an Ghaeilge a threisiú agus buan-áit a thabhairt di i ngnáthshaol na ndaoine &mdash; tógáil pobail le nasc na Gaeilge, mar a déarfá.  Ní leor an ciste atá ar fáil do dhuaiseanna agus níl ach beirt thimire lánaimseartha ag reachtáil na scéime.  Ní féidir leo teagmháil ceart a dhéanamh leis na pobail a ghlacann páirt sa chomórtas.  Cuirfear £105,000 breise ar fáil chun go bhféadfar timirí breise a fhostú agus ciste na nduaiseanna a mhéadú.</P>
    <P>Faoi láthair tá cinneadh tábhachtach le déanamh ag Siamsa Tíre maidir lena n-áitreabh i dTrá Lí.  Tá an foirgneamh ag meath go tapaidh &mdash; aghaidh an tí ag titim as a chéile, díon ag ligean braon isteach, etc.  Chomh maith le sin, níl an spás stáitse dóthainneach agus níl cóiríocht ar bith ann i gcóir cleachtaithe.  Tá clár athfheistithe mór á mheas ag Siamsa agus b'fhéidir go mbeadh orthu amharclann nua a thógáil ar láithreán eile ar fad atá ina seilbh i dTrá Lí.  Tá £700,000 á chur ar fáil don obair seo i 1988.</P>
    <P>Tá straitéis ceaptha chun suim agus tionscnamh an phobail ina n-oidhreacht féin a spreagadh agus a chothú trí tograí píolóiteacha a eagrú (m.sh. seandálaíocht, geolaíocht, stair an nádúir, etc.) agus staidéir ábhair (m.sh. fásra agus ainmhithe mara, etc.) a chur ar bun.</P>
    <P>Cuirfear £40,000 ar fáil agus cabhróidh an t-airgead sin le tuarastail an stiúrthóra agus gríosaitheoirí réigiúnacha a ghlanadh.</P>
    <P>Tá sé beartaithe cláracha Gaeilge teilifíse a leathnú trí scéim phíolótach.  Níl sé lánsoiléir fós conas a dhéanfar amhlaidh. Tá daoine ann atá ag lorg scéime thrialaigh i gceantar Gaeltachta (m.sh. Conamara) ar feadh tréimhse trí mhí, abair, agus táid ann freisin a cheapann go bhfaighfí sochar i bhfad níos mó don Ghaeilge as an airgead speisialta seo dá gcaithfí é ar chláracha breise a chraolfí ar gnáthbhealaí RTÉ.  Bheadh buntáistí an airgid le fáil, ar an mbealach seo, deirtear, ag <Col N="1807" /> Gaeilgeoirí uile na tíre, seachas ag líon teoranta Gaeilgeoirí dá n-úsáidfí an t-airgead do scéim thrialach a gceantar amháin Gaeltachta.  Tá na mionsonraí á bplé agus cuirfear suas le £½ mhilliún ar fáil i 1988.</P>
    <P>Tá £150,000 a chur ar fáil chun scoileanna lán-Ghaeilge a fhorbairt agus tá na sonraí á meas i gcomhairle leis an Roinn Oideachais d'fhonn a chinntiú go dtiocfaidh an sochar is fearr don oideachas trí Ghaeilge as an gcúnamh sin.</P>
    <P>Tá £367,500 luaite faoi thograí Gaeilge ilghnéitheacha agus teagmhais agus beidh sé ar fáil chun teagmhais a chlúdach agus chun tograí sonracha a airgeadú.  Ní miste a rá nach bhfuil aon chinnithe déanta go fóill faoi aon chuid den chaiteachas a bheidh i gceist.</P>
    <P>Tá dhá thogra de chuid na Roinne Oideachais á airgeadú freisin as an £4 mhilliún a fógraíodh le déanaí.  Tá £10,000 á chur ar fáil don Chumann Scoildrámaíochta agus £7,500 le haghaidh Cluichí Cumarsáide a tháirgeadh &mdash; pacáiste atá réitithe ag Ionad na Múinteoirí, An Charraig Dhubh, ina bhfuil cluichí, nótaí teagaisc agus videó le húsáid i múineadh na Gaeilge ag leibhéal na mbunscoileanna. Táim cinnte go bhfáilteoidh an Dáil roimh an gcúnamh seo agus, cé nach bhféadfaí teacht i gcabhair ar gach togra, is é mo thuairim go gcabhróidh na tograí atá roghnaithe go mór le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I dtús baire caithfidh mé rud éigin a rá, agus níl mé ag iarraidh a bheith diúltach, agus ní bheidh mé diúltach. Ní hé sin atá i gceist agam.  Ach ós rud é gur labhair mé i gcoinne an Chrannchuir Náisiúnta caithfidh mé é sin a rá i dtús báire.  Ní raibh mé i bhfábhar an Chrannchuir Náisiúnta, ach tá sé ann agus beidh sé ann.  Ach tá rud amháin faoin gCrannchur Náisiúnta, agus rud gur bhreá liomsa go gcuirfeadh an tAire ceist ar lucht bainistíochta an Chrannchuir Náisiúnta faoi: an Ghaeltacht a bhfuil an aithne is mó agam air ná Gaeltacht Chorca Dhuibhne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sna fógraí atá taobh amuigh de na hoifigí poist i gCorca Dhuibhne, ní an <Col N="1808" /> Crannchur Náisiúnta tá fógraithe ach an National Lottery, agus ní dóigh liom gur cheart gur mar sin a bheadh sé agus tá mé lánchinnte nach muintir na n-oifigí poist ná muintir Chorca Dhuibhne ba fhreagrach as sin.  Ba chóir go n-athrófaí é agus go n-athrófaí é go tapa.</P>
    <P>Tá cuma ar chuid mhaith de na heagraíochtaí nua Stáit nach bhfuil siad sásta an leagan Gaeilge dá n-ainmneacha a úsáid.  Bord Gáis, mar shampla, má fhéachann tú ar Eolaí an Telefóin faoi Bhord Gáis, deirtear leat féachaint faoi Irish Gas.  Níl aon ghá dé leithéid agus níl sé ceart.  Is rud beag é ach tá &ldquo;symbolism&rdquo; ann, dá bhféadfainn é sin a rá.  Níl ceart ag bainistíocht chomhlachta mar siúd athrú polasaí mar sin a dhéanamh, agus ní cóir go ligfí dóibh é a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Cuirim fáilte faoi leith, agus caithfidh mé seo a rá faoina trí nó ceathair de na rudaí atá fograithe.  I dtús báire, Oidhreacht Chorca Dhuibhne.  Ní as Corca Dhuibhne mise, ach tá mo chroí ann, caithfidh mé a rá.  Tá fhios ag an Seanadóir Fitzgerald faoi sin.  Chaith mé cuid mhaith de mo laethanta saoire ann le déanaí, agus dá mba rud go raibh an seans agam chaithfinn cuid mhaith de mo shaol ann.  Ach ní bheidh a leithéid de sheans agam, agus b'fhéidir go bhfuil an t-ádh ar mhuintir Chorca Dhuibhne nach mar sin a bheidh sé.  Ní fheadar an mbeinn chomh tógtha leis an áit agus go mbeadh muintir na háite chomh tógtha liomsa dá mba rud é is go rabhas ann i gcónaí.  Ach cuirim fáilte, mar sin, roimh an airgead atá curtha ar fáil do Oidhreacht Chorca Dhuibhne.</P>
    <P>Tá brón orm nach bhfuil aon trácht ann fós faoi Fhundúireacht na mBlascaod, agus ós rud é go bhfuil thart ar £300,000 nach bhfuil curtha amach go fóill, mholfainn don Aire go gcuirfí cuid mhaith de siúd ar fáil do Fhundúireacht na mBlascaod, mar tá sé tábhachtach go gcoimeádfar na Blascaodaí faoi smacht, ní hé na tíre seo amháin ach faoi smacht mhuintir Chorca Dhuibhne.  Tá sé an-tábhachtach ó thaobh staire agus ó thaobh cultúir de. Chomh maith leis sin, tá tracht ar theilifís nó ar chláir theilifíse as Gaeilge sa mhéid airgid atá curtha ar fáil.  Mholfainn féin don Aire agus do na daoine a bheidh <Col N="1809" /> ag socrú na ceiste seo gur do sheirbhís teilifíse don Ghaeltacht a chuirfear an t-airgead sin ar fáil.  Cé go dtaitneodh sé go mór liomsa go mbeadh cláir bhreise Ghaeilge ar aon chaighdeán leis na cláir atá ar siúl faoi láthair &mdash; agus caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil feabhas tagtha ar chaighdeán na gclár Gaeilge atá ar siúl ar RTE agus gur maith é go bhfuil cláir theilifíse as Gaeilge ar RTE gach oiche sa tseachtain anois agus go leathnófaí an méid sin &mdash; tá gá mór ann, agus is iad muintir na Gaeltachta na daoine a bhfuil aithne agam orthú is mó a deir seo liom, do sheirbhís teilifíse don Ghaeltacht má tá an Ghaeilge le coimeád beo sna Gaeltachtaí.</P>
    <P>Tá meas mór agam do mhuintir na Gaeltachta go bhfuil an teanga chomh láidir sin is atá sna Gaeltachtaí, in ainneoin an bhrú atá ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta ón mBéarla agus ó na meáin chumarsáide agus óna lán rudaí mar sin. Fad is atá aithne agamsa ar Ghaeltacht Chorca Dhuibhne le cúig bliana déag nó mar sin is iontach an rud é cé chomh láidir is atá an teanga anois in ainneoin an méid atá tar éis tarlú ó thaobh na himirce agus ó thaobh na turasóireachta agus gach rud.  Tá an Ghaeilge go hanláidir. Tá aithne agamsa ar Ghaeltacht Chonamara, cé go bhfuil athruithe tagtha sa dá Ghaeltacht is iontach an rud é go bhfuil an méid sin Gaeilge ann go fóill.  Is iontach an rud é, agus is iontach an rud atá déanta ag muintir na Gaeltachta go bhfuil an teanga beo fós, mar tá brú anláidir orthu agus d'fhéadfaí géilleadh dó agus is iontach an rud nach bhfuil muintir na Gaeltachta tar éis géilleadh don bhrú atá orthu.</P>
    <P>Rud a chuireann díomá orm, nach bhfuil aon trácht sa mhéid atá ráite faoi Bhord na Gaeilge go bhfuil airgead ag dul do Bhord na Gaeilge on gCrannchur Náisiúnta.  Tá a lán ráflaí ag dul timpeall faoi thodhchaí Bhord na Gaeilge nó cad atá i ndán do Bhord na Gaeilge, agus bheinn thar a bheith sásta dá mbeadh duine éigin idir an Aire agus an Taoiseach ag cinntiú dúinn an mbeidh Bord na Gaeilge againn as seo amach, nó an bhfuil sé ar intinn ag an Rialtas rud éigin a dhéanamh le Bhord na Gaeilge, é a chur <Col N="1810" /> ar scor nó Bord na Gaeilge a dhúnadh nó athrú bunúsach a dhéanamh faoi Bhord na Gaeilge.  Tá mé amhrasach, ós rud é nach raibh aon trácht air, go bhfuil rud éigin i gceist do Bhord na Gaeilge nach bhfuil fógraithe fós.  Chuirfinn fáilte roimh a thuilleadh eolais ón Aire faoi sin.</P>
    <P>Tá cúpla ceist eile agam faoin airgead atá fógraithe.  Tá airgead curtha ar fáil do na scoileanna lán-Ghaeilge, ach níl sé soiléir cad atá le déanamh leis an airgead sin.  Níl sé soiléir ón méid atá ráite ag an Aire nó ó phíosa beag sna nuachtáin a léamh, níl sé soiléir cad a dhéanfar leis an airgead sin nó cad atá i gceist.  An i gcóir taighde nói gcóir chúrsaí riaracháin an t-airgead sin nó cad atá i gceist ag an Aire dhéanfaí leis an airgead sin?  Caithfidh mé a rá go gcuireann gach éinne fáilte roimh an méid airgid atá curtha ar fáil don Ghaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht ón gCrannchur Náisiúnta.  Beidh mé ag súil go mbeidh, b'fhéidir, a thuilleadh airgid ag teacht as seo amach.  Beidh cuid mhaith airgid ag teacht don Stát ón gCrannchur Náisiúnta.</P>
    <P>Is fiúntach an rud é cuid den airgead sin a chur ar fáil don Ghaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht, go speisialta do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Tá an-meas agam ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Tá a fhios agam na míbhuntáistí atá ar dhaoine atá ina gcónaí, dá bhféadfainn é sin a rá, in áiteanna atá go fíor-iargúlta, nach bhfuil infrastructure dóthaineach acu in aon chor, go bhfuil míbhuntáiste acu ó thaobh tionsclaíochta agus a lán rudaí.  Ós rud é go bhfuil siad ann, go bhfuil siad sásta cloí bheith ann agus go bhfuil siad sásta cloí leis an teanga, ba chóir go gcabhrófaí leo. Is ceann de na mionlaigh is tábhachtaí sa tír anois iad muintir na Gaeltachta, agus ó thaobh forbartha cultúrtha agus forbartha pobail is cóir as seo amach, má tá cuid mhaith airgid le teacht ón gCrannchur Náisiúnta, go gcuirfí an t-airgead sin ar fáil go speisialta do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, mar is ó mhuintir na Gaeltachta, i mo thuairim, a thiocfaidh bás nó beatha na teanga.  Agus má fhanann an teanga beo sna Gaeltachtai beidh sí beo sa tír. Má chailltear an teanga sna Gaeltachtaí is deacair a chreidiúint go mbeidh aon teanga sa tír seo in aon chor.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1811" /> Mar sin, cuirim fáilte roimh an méid airgid, cuirim fáilte chomh maith roimh gur úsáid an Rialtais an t-airgead go léir ón gCrannachur Náisiúnta sna slite inar úsáidigh siad é.  Níor cuireadh isteach sa &ldquo;national kitty&rdquo; é ach úsáideadh an t-airgead faoi mar a moladh dúinn, a dúradh linn, go n-úsáidfí é.  Mar sin, cuirim fáilte roimh an méid atá ráite ag an Aire agus féachaim chuig na blianta atá romhainn lena thuilleadh airgid a bheith curtha ar fáil.  Tá brón orm faoin &ldquo;stumbling Irish&rdquo;.  Níl mo chuid Gaeilge chomh maith le mo chuid Béarla.  Dá mba rud é go gcaithfinn níos mó ama i dteannta an tSeanadóra Fitzgerald thiocfadh feabhas air sin.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús céad míle fáilte a chur roimh an Aire Stáit ag Roinn na Gaeltachta, An Teachta Denis Gallagher, agus ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis na Seanadóirí go léir istigh sa Teach so inniu a rinne a ndícheall chun an Ghaeilge a úsáid agus d'éirigh go hiontach ar fad leo.</P>
      <P>Is cúis mhór áthais dom an deis seo a ghlacadh, chun labhairt inniu faoin rún tábhachtach seo atá ós comhair an Tí ar an lá fíor-thábhachtach seo &mdash; Lá na Gaeilge.  Ar ndóigh, is mór agamsa bheith anseo chomh maith, chun labhairt mar Chathaoirleach ar an gComhchoiste don Ghaeilge agus tá sé tráthúil go bhfuil an deis seo agam chun cur síos gairid a thabhairt don Teach ar obair an Chomhchoiste agus cad atá beartaithe againn a dhéanamh amach seo.  Beidh mé ag déanamh tagairt dó sin ar ball beag, ach i dtús báire ba mhaith liom cúpla rud a rá faoi Lá na Gaeilge agus ansin faoin gCrannchur Náisiúnta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anuraidh don chéad uair riamh, ainmníodh lá speisialta mar Lá na Gaeilge, d'fhonn deis a thabhairt ach go háirithe do lucht na seirbhíse poiblí, chun an méid Gaeilge a bhí acu a úsáid.  Tuigim gur éirigh go han-mhaith leis an lá sin agus is cúis áthais dom gur shocraigh an tAire Airgeadais go ndéanfaí an rud céanna arís i mbliana.  Tá sé fíor-thábhachtach go mbeadh an fhoireann ar fáil i Ranna agus in Engrais Stáit chun plé a dhéanamh le daoine i nGaeilge, agus tugann an lá <Col N="1812" /> speisialta seo deis ar leith dóibh siúd atá ag iarraidh a gcuid Gaeilge a fheabhsú nó a chleachtadh, chun gnó a dhéanamh le custaiméirí an Stáit.  Cuireann an easpa seirbhísí atá ar fáil ón Stát trí Ghaeilge isteach ar go leor daoine agus caithfear fáilte a chur roimh aon bheart a déantar chun teacht trasna ar na fadhbanna atá ann.  Tá sé seo fíor i gcás na Gaeltachta ach go háirithe &mdash; faoi mar is eol go maith dom féin, agus do Chomhaltai eile den Teach seo &mdash; arb as an nGaeltacht iad.  Is aonad ar leith í an Ghaeltacht agus má tá an teanga chun maireachtáil agus chun dul i dtreis inti caithfidh an Stát céimeanna ar leith a ghlacadh d'fhonn a chinntiú nach bhfuil na Ranna agus na heagrais faoina scáth ag brú an Béarla ar an bpobal inti &mdash; rud atá ag tárlú le fada, faraor.</P>
    <P>Tá na mílte daoine san earnáil poiblí agus tá roinnt Gaeilge &mdash; cúpla focal, fiú &mdash; ag beagnach gach duine díobh.  Ar an dtaobh eile den scéal tá daoine ann a bhfuil togha na Gaeilge acu agus tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh gach duine iarracht chun an méid Gaeilge atá acu &mdash; bíodh sí láidir, measartha nó lag &mdash; a úsáid inniu, ina gcuid gnó agus ina gcaidrimh sóisialta.  Ceapann daoine áiri-the nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge go maith acu agus bíonn siad náirithe triail a bhaint as cúpla focal nó cúpla abairt.  Is trua go mór gurb amhlaidh an scéal mar, ar deireadh thiar, is comhbhádóirí muid uile &mdash; is cuma cén cumas Gaeilge atá againn &mdash; atá ag saothrú ar mhaithe le cur chun cinn na teanga.  Caithfidh na daoine a bhfuil an Ghaeilge ar a dtoil acu, iarracht ar leith a dhéanamh, chun teacht i gcabhair orthu siúd nach bhfuil líofa inti d'fhonn iad a mhealladh ar thaobh na teanga.  Go minic, foraor, is í a mhalairt a bhíonn fíor agus cuirtear olc go deo ar dhaoine, a mbeadh meas acu ar an dteanga, trí easpa tuisceana agus easpa cineáltachta.</P>
    <P>Níos luaithe rinne mé tagairt do Lá na Gaeilge anuraidh agus cé chomh maith agus a d'éirigh leis.  Rinne mé roinnt taighde nuair a bhí mé ag ullmhú don díospóireacht seo faoi chonas a d'éirigh le cur chun cinn na teanga i dTithe an Oireachtas ar an lá sin, agus caithfidh mé a rá gur éirigh go han-mhaith leis.  Ar slite áirithe níor chuir sé sin iontas orm toisc <Col N="1813" /> gurb eol dom féin go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ar a dtoil ag an lán Comhaltaí den Teach seo agus den Dáil.  Rinneadh a lán plé sa Dáil ar ábhair éagsúla trí Ghaeilge ar an lá sin agus rinne coistí Oireachtais a bhí ag teacht le chéile iarrachtaí ar leith chun roinnt Gaeilge a úsáid ina gcuid imeachtaí. Tá súil agam nach dtógfar orm é má luaim go speisialta an tionól den Teach seo ar an lá sin chun tuarascálacha an Chomhchoiste don Ghaeilge a phlé. An Comhchoiste féin a rinne an moladh sin, agus is léier gur éirigh go han-mhaith leis.  Ar ndóigh, bhí páirt lárnach ag an Teachta Denis Gallagher, a bhí mar Chathaoirleach ar an gComhchoiste san obair sin agus cuireann sé an-áthas orm go bhfuil sé linn inniu mar Aire Stáit ag Roinn na Gaeltachta, chun éisteacht a thabhairt don díospóireacht seo.  Níl amhras orm ach go n-éireoidh go han-mhaith leis an bhfeachtas arís i mbliana i dTithe an Oireachtais.  Tá sé tábhachtach go dtabharfaidh na Comhaltaí den Teach seo agus den Dáil dea-shampla do phobal na tíre faoin nGaeilge agus tugann an lá speisialta seo deis dúinn chun é sin a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Before I proceed to speak about the motion before us here today I would like to say a few words about Lá na Gaeilge, particularly for the benefit of those present whose Irish may be a little rusty.  It is on occasions such as this that one becomes acutely aware of the lack of a suitable interpretation or simultaneous translation system in this House, and I hope that this difficulty will be overcome when the refurbishment works on the Seanad Chamber are completed.</P>
    <P>Lá na Gaeilge is an excellent idea because it gives a chance to everyone to use whatever Irish they have.  Some of us who are fluent in the language may, on occasion, take that for granted, and be less than understanding and considerate to those who are not.  Some of us may do this quite unknowingly and innocently but our actions cause untold damage to the cause of the Irish language and people who would otherwise be favourably disposed are alienated forever.  Therefore, let us realise that the Irish language belongs to us all.  It does not belong to <Col N="1814" /> any elite group, as is often perceived and the person with a little Irish should be encouraged to use whatever amount he or she has as frequently as possible.  Is ar scáth a chéile a mhaireann na daoine, the proverb states, and we must put this into practice if Irish is to have the chance it deserves.</P>
    <P>This debate gives Members of this House a valuable opportunity to use their Irish and I am sure that they will avail of it.  Needless to say, the eyes of the country will be focused on this House and on the Dáil today, to see if we are practising what we preach in relation to Irish.  This is no bad thing as the people look to their elected representatives for a lead on many issues.  We should, therefore, avail of the opportunity presented today to show them that Irish has a prominent place in this House and in the Dáil and that we will provide the leadership which they seek on this question.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom dul ar aghaidh anois agus píosa cainte a dhéanamh faoin gCrannchur Náisiúnta, agus an tionchar a bheidh aige ar an nGaeilge agus ar shaol na tíre i gcoitinne san am atá romhainn. Nuair a cuireadh an Crannchur ar bun i dtosach bhíomar go léir ag súil leis go n-éireodh go maith leis d'fhonn leas na tíre i gcoitinne a chur chun cinn.  Ní dóigh liom go raibh aon duine ag súil leis an toradh iontach a bhí ar an gcrannchur ach b'shin mar a thit sé amach, agus tá go leor airgid ar fáil chun tograí fiúntacha a chur i gcrích.  Beidh réimse leathan tograí ag fáil cúnaimh ón gcrannchur, ar mhaithe le cúrsaí spóirt, cúrsaí sláinte, cúrsaí cultúrtha agus, ar ndóigh, cúrsaí na Gaeilge.  Anuas ar an réimse leathan ábhar a bheidh ag fáil cúnaimh, beidh an t-airgead á dháileadh i ngach cearn den tír agus is maith an rud é sin don phobal i gcoitinne.</P>
    <P>Luaigh mé go mbeidh a lán tograí fiúntacha ag fáil airgid ón gcrannchur, agus tá an-áthas orm go mbeidh luach £4 mhilliún ar fad de thograí á chur i gcrích ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge.  Is suim anfhiúntach é sin ag am ar bith ach le cúrsaí mar atá faoi láthair caithfear fáilte ar leith a chur roimhe &mdash; rud a dhéanaim go fonnmhar.  Is ábhar dóchais dúinn uile an caiteachas seo ar mhaithe leis an <Col N="1815" /> nGaeilge agus creidim gurb é seo an gaisce is mó a rinneadh ina taobh le fada an lá.  Níl amhras orm ach go bhfáilteofar roimh an airgead seo ó chuile thaobh mar tá éagsúlacht sna tograí atá ainmnithe; léiríonn siad neart samhlaíochta agus beidh siad tarraingteach do dhaoine de gach saghas a bhfuil suim acu sa Ghaeilge.  Tá rúdaí ann dóibh siúd atá ar bheagán Gaeilge agus dóibh siúd atá líofa sa teanga agus tá meascán maith déanta idir tograí a bheidh ag freastal ar phobal na Gaeilge sa tír i gcoitinne agus ar phobal na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Bhí sé mar aidhm ón tús airgead ón gCrannchur a dhíriú i dtreo i dtreo tograí nua nach mbeifí in ann freastal orthu sa ghnáth bhealach.  Sin atá beartaithe i gcás an airgid don Ghaeilge agus cuireann sé áthas ar leith orm go bhfuil roinnt tograí suimiúla &mdash; nár cuireadh i gcrích ná nár baineadh triail astu cheana &mdash; ar an liosta atá ceadaithe.  Léiríonn sé sin an saghas samhlaíochta atá riachtanach chun dul chun cinn a dhéanamh ó thaobh na Gaeilge de.  Tá sé fíor, gan amhras, go bhfulimid coimeádach mar chine agus go bhfuil sé sin fíor ach go háirithe i dtaobh na Gaeilge.  Is iomaí deis a ghabh tharainn nach rabhamar sásta a thapú agus is í an Ghaeilge a bhí thíos leis ar deireadh.  Leis na tograí úra seo b'fhéidir go bhfuil an ré sin thart anois agus go bhfuil ré nua buailte linn &mdash; tá súil agam go mbeidh an scéal amhlaidh.</P>
    <P>It gives me great pleasure to support this motion today and it is very fitting that Seanad Éireann wishes to record formally its welcome for the moneys provided from the proceeds of the national lottery for the benefit of the Irish language, on Lá na Gaeilge.  I am confident that the major advance for the Irish language, heralded by the announcement of £4 million worth of projects, will come to fruition before long.  The sanctioning of this money will give the language a great boost which it badly needs and one of the best things about this, in my view, is that the new projects which have never been attempted before are now being tackled. For far too long we have been reluctant to step outside fairly narrowly-defined <Col N="1816" /> limits in relation to the Irish language and because of this many excellent opportunities for its promotion were lost.  My own wish is that this will no longer be the case and that this new era being heralded in will lead to a greater openness and opportunism in relation to the promotion of the language in the years to come.</P>
    <P>Ceithre mhilliún punt ar fad atá le caitheamh ar 16 thograí atá ainmnithe móide tograí ilghnéitheacha ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge agus teastaíonn uaim tagairt a dhéanamh do chúpla cheann dóibh siúd ina dhiaidh seo.  Níl i gceist agam ach na cinn is tábhachtaí, i mo thuairim, a lua agus roinnt smaointí atá agam a nochtadh ina leith.</P>
    <P>Feictear dom go bhfuil beartaithe milliún punt a chaitheamh ar mhaithe le haonad Gaeilge a bhunú in Ollscoil na Gaillimhe.  Glacaim leis gurb é a bheidh anseo ná aonad ar leith de chuid na hOllscoile ina mbeidh na hábhair go léir á múineadh trí mheán na Gaeilge, ina mbeidh áiseanna ilghnéitheacha den scoth ar fáil don fhoireann agus do na mic léinn agus ar a mbeidh mic léinn, a bhfuil suim acu sa Ghaeilge agus ina cur chun cinn, ag freastal.  Tá sé éasca go leor a shamhlú cén maitheas don Ghaeilge a thiocfadh as a leithéid sa ghearr agus san fhad téarma.  Níl amhras ar bith orm ach go bhfuil aonad mar seo fíor-riachtanach mar, de réir mar a thuigim, tá sé deacair go leor cúrsa oideachais ag an tríú leibhéal a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge.  Má éiríonn leis an togra seo &mdash; agus bheinn an-dóchasach go n-éireoidh thar barr leis &mdash; b'fhéidir go bhféadfaí an rud céanna a dhéanamh in Ollscoil eile, anseo i mBaile Átha Cliath nó ó dheas.  Bunaithe ar thaithí na Gaillimhe bheadh ciall lena leithéid agus neartódh sé staid na Gaeilge tuilleadh ar fud na tíre.</P>
    <P>Ó mo thaithí pearsanta mar fhear Gaeltachta is eol dom go maith an sár-obair atá déanta ag na coláistí samhraidh chun an Ghaeilge agus grá don teanga a chur chun cinn i measc aos óg na tíre. Déanann na mílte daltaí freastal ar na coláistí samhraidh sa Ghaeltacht &mdash; agus lasmuigh di i gcoláistí cónaithe áirithe, de réir mar a thuigim &mdash; ar feadh trí nó cheithre seachtain gach bliain ach ní <Col N="1817" /> bhíonn an deis acu ina dhiaidh sin chun an méid Gaeilge a fhoglaimíonn siad a chleachtadh nó a fheabhsú.  Is laige mhór í sin sa chóras agus is trua go mór é. Tuigim go mbíodh scéim iar-chúram nó iar-aire á reachtáil ag Cumann na bhFiann in áiteanna roghnaithe ar fud na tíre ar mhaithe go príomha lena ndaltaí féin agus go raibh ag éirí go han-mhaith leí. Bhí fonn orthu an scéim a leathnú amach ach ní raibh ar a gcumas é sin a dhéanamh ceal airgid.  Nach iontach mar sin go raibh an t-airgead ón gcrannchur ar fáil chun teach i gcabhair ar thogra chomh fiúntach leis seo.  Creidim féin go ndéanfaidh an caiteachas i gceist &mdash; céad caoga míle punt &mdash; an-mhaitheas ar fad don teanga agus go mbeidh sé ina chabhair shuntasach chun daoine óga a mhealladh ar thaobh na teanga.  Is infheistíocht san óige an t-airgead seo, agus sílim go mbeidh toradh an-fiúntach ar an gcaiteachas.</P>
    <P>Cé go bhfuil léirithe ag suirbhéanna atá curtha i gcrích le blianta beaga anuas go bhfuil mórlach de phobal na tíre báúil don Ghaeilge níl móran dul chun cinn déanta maidir lena hathbheochan go dtí seo.  Ní maith liom a cheapadh gur easpa suime is cúis leis seo, agus b'fhearr liom bheith in ann a rá gurb iad easpa tuisceana agus easpa eolais na deacrachtaí atá i gceist.  Sílim go bhfuil bunús maith leis an tuairim seo agus chuige sin fáiltím roimh an togra chun feachtas fógraíochta a chur ar bun ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge. Bheinn ag súil leis gur feachtas proifisiúnta a bheidh ann, chun daoine a chur ar an eolas faoin nGaeilge, chun a mhíniú dóibh an tábhacht a bhaineann leis an nGaeilge, idir chaomhnú agus chur chun cinn, agus chun iad a spreagadh d'fhonn an méid Gaeilge atá acu a úsáid oiread agus is féidir.  Cé go gcaithfear pobal na tíre i gcoitinne a spreagadh ó thaobh na Gaeilge de san fheachtas atá beartaithe creidim féin nach mbeidh an rath i ndán dó mura n-éiríonn leis aos óg na tíre a mhealladh chun na teanga.  Mol an óige agus tiocfaidh sé, a deir an seanfhocal agus tá bunús leis an méid sin sa chás áirithe seo, mar, má táimid chun an Ghaeilge a shlánú, caithfimid braith ar aos óg na tíre chun é a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1818" /> An togra fógraithe ina bhfuil an suim is mó léirithe ag an bpobal ann ná an leath mhilliún punt i ndáil le teilifís Ghaeilge nó Ghaeltachta.  Tá suim ar leith agam féin &mdash; agus ag comhaltaí eile den Chomhchoiste don Ghaeilge &mdash; sa cheist seo agus is mithid aghaidh a thabhairt uirthi i mo thuairim.  Ní léir ag an bpointe seo cad go díreach atá beartaithe don airgead sin, agus caithfear bheith an-cúramach nuair a bheidh sé á dháileadh lena chinntiú go bhfaighfear an toradh is fiúntaí air. B'fhearr liom féin go ndéanfaí iarracht chun díriú ar sheirbhís theilifíse don Ghaeltacht mar tá a leithéid fíor-riachtanach sa lá atá inniu ann.  Tá sár-obair déanta ag Raidió na Gaeltachta ó bunaíodh é agus tá cruthaithe aige go bhfuil éileamh ar sheirbhís phroifisiúnta mar í ar fud na Gaeltachta.  Is leathnú nádúrtha ar sheirbhís raidió é seirbhís theilifíse, ach caithfidh a leithéid bheith tarraingteach don phobal.  Mura mbeidh an scéim phíolóta atá beartaithe amhlaidh, ní bheidh meas ag an bpobal uirthi agus ní bheidh an rath i ndán di.  Sin í an chúis go ndeirim go gcaithfear bheith cúramach faoin scéim seo, agus táim dóchasach go dtabharfaidh an tAire Stáit agus an Taoiseach suntas don phointe sin nuair a bheidh siad ag scrúdú an togra ina iomlán ar ball.</P>
    <P>Caithfidh mé a rá go gcuireann sé an-áthas orm go bhfuil seacht gcéad míle punt le cur ar fáil do Shiamsa Tíre.  Is eol dom féin go maith an dea-obair atá déanta sa bhaile agus ar fud an domhain ag Siamsa Tíre, chun an Ghaeilge agus an cultúr Gaelach a chur chun cinn agus tá sampla iontach tugtha acu dúinn uile. Cabhróidh an t-airgead seo leo chun a gcuid áiseanna a fhorbairt agus chun a dheimhniú go mbeidh amharclann tarraingteach den scoth ar fáil dóibh.  Tá cúpla rud faoi Shiamsa Tíre a thaithníonn liom féin ach go háirithe agus is iad sin líon na ndaoine atá páirteach sna himeachtaí, ar bhonn deonach agus líon na ndaoine óga atá páirteach.  Thosaigh Siamsa ar scála beag ach tá forbairt iontach tagtha ar a chuid imeachtaí agus cabhróidh an t-airgead seo leis chun leathnú amach tuilleadh.</P>
    <P>Mar fhear a rugadh i gCorca Dhuibhne <Col N="1819" /> fearaim fáilte ar leith roimh an daichead míle punt atá le tabhairt d'Oidhreacht Chorca Dhuibhne.  Is í leithinis Chorca Dhuibhne ceann de na háiteanna is saibhre in Éireann ó thaobh na seandálaíochta agus na hoidhreachta de agus tá a lán oibre curtha i gcrích sa cheantar le blianta beaga anuas chun cur leis an saibhreas sin.  Tuigim gurb é atá i gceist anseo ná eolas a chur ar fáil do phobal na leithinise, agus do thurasóirí, faoi oidhreacht an cheantair agus go mbeidh fístéipeanna ar taispeáint agus seimineáir agus léachtanna á reachtáil i hallaí agus in aonaid áitiúla.  Tá sé tábhachtach go dtuigfí an tábhacht a bhaineann leis na cúrsaí seo, agus molaim Oidhreacht Chorca Dhuibhne ina gcuid imeachtaí.</P>
    <P>Fhaid is atáim ag caint faoi cheantar Chorca Dhuibhne ní fhéadfainn an deis a ligint tharam chun cúpla focal a rá faoin dea-obair atá ar siúl ag Fondúireacht an Bhlascaoid chun an Bhlascaod Mhór a cheannach ar mhaithe le muintir na hÉireann. Tá clú agus cáil ar an oileán sin de dheasca na scríobhneoirí tábhachtacha a bhíodh ina gcónaí ann &mdash; a leithéidí Tomás Ó Criomhthainn, Peig Sayers, Muiris Ó Súilleabháin agus daoine eile. Thug na scríobhneoirí sin cuntas ar shaol atá imithe anois agus faoi mar a dúirt An t-Oileánach é féin, &ldquo;ní bheidh ár leithéid arís ann&rdquo;.  Aithnítear an tábhacht a bhaineann le leabhair na ndaoine sin ar fud an domhain agus tá sé fíor-riachtanach mar sin go gcoimeádfaí an t-oileán, inar mhair siad agus inar scríobh siad, don na glúinte atá le teacht.  Sin é an saghas oibre atá ar siúl ag an bhFondúireacht agus molaim iad dá réir.</P>
    <P>O thús na hóraide seo tá béim leagtha agam ar an tábhacht a bhaineann leis an aos óg ó thaobh na Gaeilge de.  Cuireann sé áthas orm mar sin a fheiceáil go bhfuil beartaithe céad is a caoga míle punt a chaitheamh ar mhaithe le scoileanna lán-Ghaeilge. Tá líon na scoileanna seo ag dul i méid an t-am ar fad, agus is rud andearfach é sin ó thaobh na teanga de. Ceann de na rudaí is dóchasaí faoi seo ná go bhfuil an t-éileamh ar oideachas trí Ghaeilge ag teacht ó na tuismitheoirí. Leis an scéal amhlaidh níl amhras orm <Col N="1820" /> ach go mbeidh an t-airgead atá á chur ar fáil ón gcrannchur ina chabhair an-mhór do na scoileanna atá i gceist agus go mbainfear lán-tairbhe as.</P>
    <P>Agus mé ag caint faoin nGaeilge sa chóras oideachais caithfidh mé a rá &mdash; agus is rud pearsanta é seo &mdash; go gcuireann sé iontas orm go dtagann daltaí tríd an gcóras sin agus i bhformhór mhór na gcásanna níl siad in ann abairt iomlán trí Ghaeilge a labhairt.  B'fhéidir go mbíonn cuid mhaith acu cumasach i léamh agus i scríobh na teanga ach ní féidir leo í a labhairt agus, faoi mar a deir an seanfhocal, &ldquo;is beatha teanga í a labhairt&rdquo;. Caithfidh go bhfuil locht éigin bunúsach ar an gcóras oideachais nuair atá an scéal amhlaidh.  Leagaim béim ar na focail &ldquo;córas oideachais&rdquo; lena chinntiú nach mbeidh aon mhí-thuiscintí amach anseo. Is é an córas atá lochtach agus ní na múinteoirí, ní na daltaí agus ní na tuismitheoirí is cúis leis.  Tá gá le gníomh dearfach faoin gceist seo go han-luath má táimid chun dul chun cinn d'aon saghas a dhéanamh i dtaobh na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that the moneys available from the national lottery will give a much needed boost to the Irish language.  My reasons for this are best illustrated by reference to the list of projects sanctioned for assistance.  The Irish Language Centre for University College Galway, will be of major significance because at present the number and range of third level courses available through Irish are limited.  This should not be the case.  Hopefully this new centre will help to remedy this problem and lead perhaps to the establishment of similar centres in years to come on other campuses.  I am glad to see also that money is being made available to assist all-Irish schools.  These have enjoyed a truly magnificent rate of growth in recent years and their impact on the language and its development outside the Gaeltacht, in particular, has been, and I have no doubt will continue to be, extremely significant.</P>
    <P>It is important to make the public more aware of the importance of Irish and to that end the proposed advertising campaign is to be welcomed.  Also the proposed television project seems to have <Col N="1821" /> caught the imagination of the public and such a development can only be a good thing.  However, great care must be taken in selecting the format for the proposed television project to get a result which will be attractive to viewers.  If the package is not attractive to viewers it will fail and much valuable ground could be lost. This would be a shame and I urge the Minister and the Taoiseach to exercise great care in their deliberations on this issue.</P>
    <P>Mar fhocal scoir, ba mhaith liom, ar an lá speisialta seo, cúpla focal a rá faoina bhfuil ar siúl ag an gComhchoiste don Ghaeilge.  I dtús báire is mian liom go pearsanta tréaslú leis na comhaltaí den chomhchoiste a bhí ag feidhmiú romhainn as ucht na hoibre a chuir siad i gcrích. Cuireann sé áthas ar leith orm an méid sin a chur ar thaifead an Tí seo nuair atá an tAire Stáit inár dteannta, os rud é gurb eisean a bhí mar Chathaoirleach ar an gcomhchoiste sin.</P>
    <P>D'fhoilsigh an comhchoiste a bhí ag feidhmiú romhainn trí thuarascáil agus is cúis áthais dom gur pléadh iad go léir sa Teach seo.  Is trua liom nár pléadh aon cheann díobh sa Dáil ach tá iarrtha againn le tamall ar an bPríomh Aoire Rialtais go bpléifí iad a luaithe is féidir.  Glacaim leis go dtacódh an tAire Stáit leis an iarratas sin agus tá súil agam go dtógfaidh sé an cheist leis an bPríomh Aoire.  Ar ndóigh, tá an comhchoiste féin ag ullmhú tuarascáil faoi láthair i ndáil le staid na Gaeilge i dTithe an Oireachtais agus tá súil agam go mbeidh sí réidh roimh an Nollaig, más féidir, nó go luath i 1988 ar a dhéanaí. Tuarascáil thábhachtach a bheidh inti inár dtuairim agus nuair a bheidh sí foilsithe tá súil againn go mbeidh díospóireachtaí fiúntacha in a leith sa Teach seo agus sa Dáil.  Is mithid a thabhairt le fios chomh maith, ag an bpointe seo, go mbeidh an comhchoiste ag lorg cead ón gCeann Comhairle agus uait féin, a Chathaoirligh, chun suirbhé a dhéanamh i measc na gComhaltaí den dá Theach i dtaobh na Gaeilge go luath amach anseo. Ní haon rud mór a bheidh sa suirbhé sin ach cabhróibh sé linn inár gcuid oibre má tá tuairim againn faoi chumas agus dearcadh na gComhaltaí i dtaobh na <Col N="1822" /> Gaeilge.  San ath-bhliain tá beartaithe ag an gcomhchoiste tabhairt faoi cheist na fógraíochta &mdash; nó an easpa di, b'fhéidir &mdash; a déantar trí Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Agus an méid sin ráite níl fágtha le déanamh agam anois ach fáiltiú arís roimh Lá na Gaeilge agus roimh an rún atá os ár gcomhair.  Is lá stairiúil é seo ó thaobh na Gaeilge de agus tá súil agam nach mbeidh anseo ach tús.  Molaim an rún go fonnmhar, a Chathaoirligh.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire, an Teachta Denis Gallagher, don Teach seo.  Tá lá speisialta againn inniu, Lá na Gaeilge, agus is maith an rud é sin.  Mar a dúirt an Seanadóir Fitzgerald, tá a lán daoine sa Seanad nach bhfuil ach beagán Gaeilge againn agus ní labhraíonn siad mar is dócha go bhfuil siad cúthaileach.</P>
      <P>As Senator Fitzgerald said &mdash; and I was encouraged by this because he comes from a Gaeltacht area &mdash; the people in this House who have a little Irish should be encouraged to use it.  Lá na Gaeilge should be used in that respect and the people who have a little Irish should make the effort to make some contribution in the House today as Gaeilge. I fit into that category so I will make an effort to say cúpla focal ar an tairiscint seo as Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>Lá na Gaeilge &mdash; as Senator Fitzgerald so generously pointed out &mdash; should be geared more towards the Senators who have a little Irish rather than people who are native Irish speakers.  That is the idea behind it.  Senator Fitzgerald and any other Senators who are fluent Irish speakers should encourage people to use their Irish on a day like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte speisialta a chur roimh ar deontas £1 mhilliún a bheidh le fáil ón Chrannchur Náisiúnta ar mhaithe le aonad teanga i gColáiste Ollscoil na Gaillimhe.  Tá clú agus cáil ar an gcoláiste suite in aice leis an ceantar Gaeltachta suite in aice leis an cheantar Gaeltachta is mó san tír, sin Conamara agus cuirim fáilte roimh an airgead seo.  Cuirim fáilte chomh maith roimh an suim £220,000 do Thaibhdhearc na Gaillimhe.  Tá sár obair déanta acu agus, mar a dúirt an tAire, tá <Col N="1823" /> siad ann ó 1938.  Is maith an rud freisin go bhfuil £120,000 á chur ar fáil do scoileanna Gaeltachta &mdash; Voluntary Organisation of Teachers and Parents in Gaeltacht areas; agus £400,000 don feachtas fógraíochta ar an teilifís, ar an raidio agus sna páipéir.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of £4 million for the promotion of the Irish language. The additional moneys are being used as was planned for the benefit of Irish and the Gaeltacht areas.  As Senator Mac Gearailt said, we should welcome the fact that the money was not channelled into the general kitty but is being delivered as planned.</P>
    <P>I encourage others to take the lead Senator Fitzgerald has given, to practise their Irish by using lá mar seo, Lá na Gaeilge, le cúpla focal a rá san áit seo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>It became apparent early this afternoon that a six months course in Irish in the Ballymoney College of Further Education had done little to prepare for me for Lá na Gaeilge.  However, I hasten to add that this is no reflection on the wonderful teacher I was privileged to come in contact with during those six months.  It is perhaps a reflection of the divided nature of this island and the way in which some of the people living in it feel threatened by the great tradition associated with the Gaelic language.  I would like to put on record that my teacher, Gary Hastings, who was brought up in east Belfast, met the daughter of a native Irish speaker at the University of Ulster.  He became so enamoured with the language that he took to it and, having a fine musical ear &mdash; he is a well known traditional musician &mdash; he picked it up perhaps with more facility than most of us and did a degree in it.  He then did a post-graduate degree and wrote a study on the Lambeg Drum in the Irish language. He has done much to try to influence those of us who seek to rectify the fact we did not have the language in our up-bringing.  I take this opportunity to pay a small tribute to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish is important for many reasons, particularly in the world in which we live <Col N="1824" /> in which individuality and the different expression of different peoples are in danger from the relentless onslaught of centralism.  Difference and variety are essential for biological, sociological and psychological health.  Because of our modern technology and because of the thinking which has gone into producing our over-centralised and highly specialised super technologically controlled societies, there is a grave danger that the variety which is required in the human species and the variety of expression that is required to reflect that, could be steamrolled out of existence.</P>
    <P>In this respect I draw attention to a very sound ecological principle, one of the echo principles: the more complex and diverse the echo system, the more stable it is.  In other words, stability in nature depends on the built-in myriad of self-regulating mechanisms where variety is the essence of health and survival.  If variety is important for species of animal and plant life it surely also applies to human life.  I re-emphasise the point which I am trying to stress: the centralism to which we are so subjected today may be a very subtle way of eroding that variety which is essential if we are to survive as a species.</P>
    <P>In this century we have observed the destruction of many thousands of animal and plant species.  We have also, alas, come to realise that along with these have gone many hundreds if not thousands of languages millennia old, languages which have been used in various parts of the world to reflect the history of a people and a way of looking at the world in a unique fashion.  We destroy our minority languages &mdash; if you wish to look at them in that way &mdash; at our peril because those languages are a reflection of something which is very precious in our heritage, not only the heritage of the people who speak the individual language but also the heritage of humankind.</P>
    <P>I have to develop this argument further and say that in relation to centralism on the one hand, and marginalisation on the other, language is undoubtedly a reflection of power.  David Hammond of BBC, Northern Ireland, who has done so much <Col N="1825" /> to try to stiimulate an interest in traditional music, in art forms and in Irish &mdash; I always feel it is a Gaelic language and I will come back to that later &mdash; wrote to me once and said that language is an expression of power.</P>
    <P>If we look at the development of the western world there is little doubt that at various times its affairs have been dominated by the controlling group who imposed their controlling language, Portuguese, Spanish, French and, latterly, English.  That may have had at one time a very serious significance in relation to what I have been saying, but in today's world it becomes much more serious indeed because with super technology we can now project a form of language into the sitting rooms of many citizens on a nightly basis.  It is, therefore, most encouraging to feel that at least in Ireland, and indeed in other parts of Europe, an attempt is now being made to redress that balance by ensuring that in the media an increasing place is given to preserving what is precious in our heritage, that special way of looking at the world which can be expressed uniquely in languages preserved from the remote past.</P>
    <P>Some years ago I took my children, when they were very young, across the Minch from the west coast of Scotland to the outer Hebrides.  It was the first time I had visited there, but certainly not the last.  I told them before we got off the boat that I wanted them to listen carefully on the harbour because I thought I would not be disappointed.  Of course, they thought the old fellow had once again taken leave of his senses, which perhaps was not surprising as we were all decidedly green in colour by the time we had crossed the Minch.  We arrived on the harbour and it was not, as I had pointed out to one of them, the seagulls that I wanted them to listen to.  All of a sudden they said: &ldquo;Daddy, what language is that person speaking over there?&rdquo;  In fact, without any special article in any Constitution the people of the Western Hebrides were speaking their native Gaelic language.  This is their first language and they spoke it naturally.  They were proud <Col N="1826" /> and glad of their language.  They communicated through it in their work and in their homes.</P>
    <P>I asked myself what was it that preserved this language.  What did the Minch do which the Irish Sea was unable to do? I suppose I had to conclude that people living in the Western Hebrides were perhaps less of a threat to the English people as they were developing over a number of centuries than those who lived on the western flank across the Irish Sea.  Be that as it may, the point I am trying to emphasise is that if you go to Lewis and Harris you will find that over 90 per cent of the population &mdash; I am sure that is a conservative estimate &mdash; are Presbyterian like many of the people in Northern Ireland so that, in effect, we were listening to the language of our forebearers. Yet it is a language which not many Presbyterians in Northern Ireland speak today.  It is a language which has certain threatening connotations for them.  In that context I was delighted to hear Senators Fitzgerald and McCormack suggesting that we should try to encourage people who have not got the language, or who do not speak it with great facility, especially those who perhaps feel most resentful about the possibility of learning it.  We must ensure, in a gentle way, that they realise they are being asked to take back what once belonged to them and what is as much part of their heritage as it is of yours.</P>
    <P>The Gaelic language in particular provides a fascinating way of looking at the world.  Without the language the old stories do not make an easy resonance in the reading.  When you have taken a very short course you can read names, place names and references in such a way that the resonance is retained in your memory.  With the language, our place names become alive, the very rocks and stones carry a message.</P>
    <P>I remember so well some years ago at Cruit Island, off the Rosses in Donegal, when my two boys were taken out in a boat time after time by a man who had been brought up there, but who now lives in Dublin, and how they would come back and relate to me that every crack in <Col N="1827" /> the rocks, every point, every current had a special name which related to something that had taken place, or to the name of a person who had lived there.  In fact, that small island suddenly became alive to them in a way it could not have if they had not been with a person who understood and spoke Irish and who could relate in such a personal way and so intimately to the natural world around which they were passing in the boat, day after day.</P>
    <P>More important perhaps is the link with the past.  Professor Donncha Ó Corrain of UCC was at a conference which I had the honour to chair in Stirling University this year dealing with the subject of Ireland and Scotland, their Gaelic traditions &mdash; similar but different.  He made the point that a huge proportion of the genetic stock of these islands is, in fact, pre Indo-European, but we do not have the languages which connect us with the peoples who lived here before the Gaelic invasions.  There are 250, I believe, symbolic pit stones.  We have the old pit names, particularly prevalent in Scotland, the Ogham scripts and the King lists but the only thing that can connect the present with the remote past, the past from which we draw our ancient mythologies and history, is our Irish or Gaelic language.</P>
    <P>While we are on that subject, let us not forget that the old Celtic language came to these islands in two forms, the Brythonic, which as I understand it is a less pure form, but which was spoken after the colonisation in Wales, Cornwall, and was spoken in Brittany, and at one time in England.  The older and purer form of the language came up through Ireland and was eventually taken from the north eastern corner of Ireland across to Scotland and to the Isle of Man.</P>
    <P>In that context Dalriada has a very special place in my interests.  This summer in Ballymoney we entertained what were called the Viking surgeons, surgeons who practice in island communities or isolated communities from the west coast of Iceland down to Gibraltar. In order to honour the occasion I <Col N="1828" /> tried to study, in as far as a surgeon can study a historical topic, the story of Dalriada and how the old Uladh &mdash; which is now central Northern Ireland pushing down into Leinster and Donegal &mdash; related to the west coast of Scotland.  It is a wonderful story.  Fergus the son of Erk with his two brothers Loarne and Angus left Ballycastle at a place called Portbrittas, which is thought to be the present location of Seán Morton's fish business, in the year 507 to colonise what is now known as Argyle and part of the western islands.  His brother Loarne settled in that part of Argyle which is still known as Loarne to this day.  Fergus settled in the main part of Argyle and Angus went to the Isle of Islay.  They brought with them the Gaelic language, and some of the old stories, the Lia Fáil, the Stone of Destiny.  They also brought the name Scotti, which is Scotland.  They gave to Scotland this language which is still spoken there as the first language by some 40,000 people.  It is used daily.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to listen to Irish here today because I was unaware there were so many people in the Seanad who spoke it so fluently.  That in itself will be a stimulus, I am sure, to others throughout this land to take greater and a deeper iterest in the language and what it stands for.  Let us not forget that in Africa today school children are having their tribal languages beaten out of them, in the same say as it was done in Ireland over 100 years ago. There is a need for a global language as well as local languages.  In this day and age we must communicate globally.  By having a language of our own we have a built-in antidote to what the global language can do, if it is associated with too much power.  Language gives us a special identity.  Variety is the spice of life.  It is a pity that in the Constitution Irish is given a place which to my mind holds it up a bit to ridicule.  Everyone knows that Irish is not, at present, the first language although there may be an aspiration to that end.</P>
    <P>It will be a very useful boost to the language to have this money available for the projects that have been outlined.  I would like the House to consider two <Col N="1829" /> suggestions as to how this money might be used, if not this year in subsequent years.  First, in Northern Ireland schools have been established which are truly integrated and are trying to deal for the first time with the two traditions equally. Certain schools call themselves mixed schools but, in actual fact, they are usually liberal, orientated to the British tradition but not having a very secure place for the Irish tradition.  In the integrated schools Irish is alive and flourishing.  As a gesture we should provide scholarships. They need not necessarily be in the form of money, but in form of a course or a visit to some place of interest.  Secondly, if you want to make the language come alive do not forget that Ulster Gaelic has much more affinity with Scots Gaelic than with Munster Gaelic.  Therefore, let us not become so introspective that we forget this connection across the North Channel between those who speak what is called Gaelic there and those who speak Gaelic here.  Perhaps that is the key to encouraging &mdash; and I use a word that has been used by two speakers today &mdash; those of us who live in Northern Ireland to take a greater and more abiding interest in this very precious part of our heritage, and movement between the Gaelic peoples of Scotland and Ireland, if you wish to use those terms.  We should use this money to encourage that type of movement.  Whether you like to hear it or not in this House, the Protestant people in Northern Ireland feel threatened by Irish.  They feel, it is an expression of outrage, or of some advance into their territory by the rest of Ireland, instead of a language we should all be able to share, that gives us a new vigour as we look forward.</P>
    <P>That great ship <i>The Asgard</i> came up to Iona when we were at the conference in Stirling and I wonder whether we could reward some young people or some school for their efforts in the promotion of Irish by giving a them a special trip on <i>The Asgard.</i></P>
    <P>In conclusion, let me say how much I welcome the support for the Gaelic language for the reasons I have outlined If people really feel for a language, they <Col N="1830" /> should realise how necessary it is to use it gently in order to engage the interest of those who have not got it.  Perhaps people would take to it very quickly, as did my tutor, Mr. Gary Hastings whom I mentioned at the beginning of my address, once he had been given the opportunity to learn it.  Go raibh míle maith agat.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Aire Stáit i Roinn na Gaeltachta, an Teachta Denis Gallagher, mar gheall ar an obair iontach a rinne sé chun an t-airgead seo a chur ar fáil le haghaidh na Gaeilge.  Is iontach an rud é le rá ach is fear Gaeltachta é féin, fear mór ceoil, fear Gaelach é a bhfuil suim faoi leith aige sa Ghaeilge agus gach uile rud atá Gaelach.  Tá seo le feiceáil go soiléir san tacaíocht a thug an Rialtas le roinnt blianta anuas.  Caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil an-áthas orm chomh maith is a rinne an t-iarthar, go mórmhór ceantar na Gaillimhe Thiar, maidir leis an gcéad rud sa cháipéis faoi Ollscoil na Gaillimhe. Tá mé ag ceapadh gur rud iontach é seo, ní amháin don ollscoil féin ach do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, mar tá a fhios agam go bhfuil baint mhór ag Ollscoil na Gaillimhe leis na ceantair Ghaeltachta maidir le Áras Uí Chadhain ar an gCeathrú Rua, áit a mbíonn cúrsaí Gaeilge go minic i rith na bliana, go mórmhór do dhaoine anseo i mBaile Átha Cliath sa Státseirbhís, agus cabhróidh an foirgneamh nua seo a mbeidh 20,000 troigh chearnach ann.  Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach an cúnamh, agus tabharfaidh sé cúnamh do dhaoine atá sa Státseirbhís anseo atá ag iarraidh feabhas a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge, daoine atá ag obair sna cúirteanna &mdash; agus rinneadh gearán anseo níos luaithe inniu maidir le téarmaíocht sna Billí.  Tá mé cinnte go gcuirfidh a leithéidí seo ar fáil do na Státseirbhísigh an cineál eolais agus an cineál Gaeilge a theastaíonn uathu, agus dá bharr sin tá mé cinnte go gcuirfidh sé le fostaíocht ní amháin i gcathair na Gaillimhe ach i gceantair na Gaeltachta freisin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Feicim anseo chomh maith go bhfuil tionchar mór arís ag an Aire, rud a raibh suim faoi leith aige féin ann, maidir le <Col N="1831" /> bunú theilifís na Gaeilge.  Agus go deimhin, caithfidh mé a rá gur iontach an rud é gur cuireadh £500,000 ar fáil chun é seo a chur ar bhonn píolótach.  Bheadh súil agam go mbunófaí é seo i gceantar Ghaeltacht Chonamara, an áit ar bunaíodh Raidió na Gaeltachta roinnt mhaith blianta ó shin, mar tá mé ag ceapadh go mbeadh sé níos éasca ar an Stát dá mbeadh Raidió na Gaeltachta agus Teilifís na Gaeltachta ag obair as láimh a chéile.  Níor mhaith liom go bhfeicfí an £500,000 seo súite isteach an iomarca faoi sciathán RTÉ.  Tá mé ag ceapadh má tá rud le poibliú go píolótach i gceantair na Gaeltachta, go gcaithfidh tionchar a bheith ag eagras éigin ann nó ag Údarás na Gaeltachta nó a leithéidí.</P>
    <P>Tá go leor ráite faoi theilifís na Gaeltachta le roinnt blianta anuas, agus fuair muid meastachán le gairid ó RTÉ go gcosnódh sé £10 milliún a leithéid a chur ar fáil.  Ach tá mise cinnte gur féidir a leithéid a chur ar fáil i bhfad níos saoire ná sin.  Má thógann tú na ceantair Ghaeltachta féin, tá go leor foirgneamh nó monarchana ann, b'fhéidir, atá folamh, agus go bhféadfaí ceann nó péire acu seo a úsáid chun stiúideonna a chur ann, agus ar an mbealach sin go bhfágfadh sé nach mbeadh mórán airgid bhreise le cur ar fáil chun foirgneamh nua a thógáil. Gheall RTÉ i 1983 go mbeadh 20 faoin gcéad de na cláracha teilifíse as Gaeilge, agus níl sé sin tarlaithe ná dada mar é, cé go gcaithfidh mé a rá go dtáinig feabhas mór, nó roinnt feabhais, ar RTÉ go mórmhór le cuid de na cláracha atá ann ar nós &ldquo;Cúrsaí&rdquo; agus a leithéidí, ar RTÉ 2.  Agus ar an mbealach sin is dócha gur maith ann an méid mar thosnú é.  Feicim i ndeireadh na cáipéise go bhfuil roinnt airgid, £367,000, fágtha aige i leataobh le haghaidh, ní fheadar? Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh freagra ón Aire; is dócha nach bhfuil freagra ar bith aige féin fós cén chaoi a gcaithfear é.</P>
    <P>Rud amháin a chuireann imní ormsa ná nach bhfuil aon pháipéar Gaeltachta ceart ann do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Is mó <i>News of the World</i> as Londain atá á dhíol i Leitir Móir.  Díoltar i bhfad níos mó díobh sin ná den pháipéar atá ann nó <Col N="1832" /> ceaptha bheith ann mar pháipéar Gaeilge.  Mar sin, ba mhaith liom go scrúdódh an tAire é sin, mar tá mé cinnte go bhfuil rud éigin mícheart áit éigin faoi seo.  Agus b'fhéidir go bhféadfadh leis feabhas a chur ar an scéal, fiú leis an bpáipéar atá ann faoi láthair, go bhféadfadh sé cuidiú le é a bheith ina pháipéar cúige.  Ní hé an scéal céanna do mhuintir Dhún an nGall, muintir Chonamara, muintir Mhaigh Eo, muintir Phort Láirge, Chontae na Mí nó muintir Chiarraí nó muintir Chorcaí.  Ach dá bhféadfaí a leithéid a chur isteach sa pháipéar, ar a laghad bheadh rud éigin le léamh air. Mar is é an rud atá ann, tá an brú isteach i gcónaí ar an nGaeltacht ag an mBéarla, agus tá mé ag ceapadh nach bhfuil an páipéar seo faoi láthair atá ann ag cuidiú leis an nGaeilge agus go mórmhór le muintir na Gaeltachta chun an Ghaeilge a chothú.  Ba mhaith liom go mbreathnódh an tAire isteach ansin.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhí mé ag labhairt ar ball faoi theilifís na Gaeltachta labhair mé anseo cheana sa Seanad mar gheall ar Raidió na Gaeltachta, agus caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil seirbhís iontach curtha ar fáil ag Raidió na Gaeltachta do mhuintir na Gaeltachta le blianta fada.  Níl a fhios agam cén costas atá ag gabháil leis seo, ach de bharr na himirce atá ann lena cúig nó sé de bhlianta tá cuid mhór de na daoine óga imithe go Meiriceá agus imithe go Sasana.  Má tá bealach ar bith, agus ba cheart go mbeadh muid in ann é seo a dhéanamh de bharr na ngléasanna nua-aimseartha atá ann, go bhféadfaí uair éigin iarracht a dhéanamh ar Raidió na Gaeltachta a leathniú isteach go Sasana agus go Meiriceá &mdash; tá mé ag ceapadh, má tá an Ghaeilge ag fáil bháis sa tír seo; tá mé ag rá &ldquo;má tá&rdquo;&mdash; ar a laghad an dream atá imithe, bheadh siad in ann an teanga a choimeád. Tá sé cruthaithe agamsa go minic go dtagann go leor acu ar ais as Sasana agus as Meiriceá agus Gaeilge thar barr ag na gasúir.</P>
    <P>Tagaim ar ais go dtí an méid airgid a cuireadh ar fáil le haghaidh Thaibhdhearc na Gaillimhe, agus caithfidh mé a rá gurb iontach an rud é seo arís do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus do mhuintir na Galltachta <Col N="1833" /> chomh maith céanna, mar tá an-obair déanta ag an Taibhdhearc le blianta fada agus is as a tháinig go leor de na haisteoirí iontacha atá ann sa tír seo, agus cuid acu imithe ar shlí na fírinne.  Tá mé ag ceapadh gur rud fadtéarmach é seo a chuirfeas leis an teanga, mar is cinnte gur ceart a leithéid airgid a chaitheamh ar son na Gaeilge lena forbairt.  Tá go leor airgid curtha ar fáil le haghaidh Shiamsa Tíre i dTrá Lí agus freisin le scéim, tá súil agam, a bheas ag muintir na n-oileán, a bheas ag cur leis seo, an £30,000 a chur ar fáil le haghaidh na mbunscoileanna, agus go mbeadh an scéim thar barr leis sin. Agus arís, is fiú an t-airgead sin a chaitheamh ar an gceantar agus a chaitheamh ar ghasúir óga agus an áit.  Sin a bhfuil le rá agam, ach deirim arís, tá mé fíorbhuíoch den Aire mar gheall ar an suim faoi leith atá aige i gcúrsaí Gaeltachta agus i gcúrsaí na Gaeilge.  Agus tá súil agam gur fada an lá a bheas sé linn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeEogan" hpid="Professor Eogan Professor Eogan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Eogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom aontú leis an rún seo agus fáilte a chur roimh Lá na Gaeilge.  Rud an-tábhachtach ar fad is ea ár dteanga dhúchais agus is cóir agus is ceart dúinn athbheochan na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn.</P>
      <P>It is, therefore, with considerable pleasure that I welcome this motion and the good news that we have been hearing over the past few days that a considerable bulk of funds has been made available from the lottery to aid Irish enterprises. I believe this will have a very considerable and beneficial effect and it will help very much in the general revival programme in which we are all interested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately one has still got to talk about revival programmes despite the fact that they have been going on in one form or another for a very long time. However, as mentioned by many Senators today, if we could move on to a greater use of the language this in itself would be a major revival step.  I believe that bilingualism is of considerable benefit to any society.  I know bilingualism may not have a good record in this country. It is the case that in Gaeltacht areas the first step towards the destruction or non-use of a language in a given area is <Col N="1834" /> the creeping in of English through bilingualism and eventually the native language tends to disappear.  Nevertheless, if we can get bilingualism, in other words a greater usage of Irish coming into everyday activity, this will help enormously.</P>
    <P>I would like to make one point by way of a suggestion; I am sure an tAire has received many suggestions in one shape or another in the past and I am sure he will receive more in the future &mdash; but this suggestion concerns our place names.  It is a fact that many of our place names are in the Irish language.  In many cases due to the way they were recorded in the last century they are now practically useless. It is hardly necessary for me to point out cases of this but let us just take Roundstone. Roundstone is a totally meaningless name.  It is Cloch na Rón.  A surveyor at the time had not a notion as to what was being said to him, or he might just have managed to hear &ldquo;cloch&rdquo; and he could translate that into a stone. After that you get Roundstone.  There is so much of this in our place names.  I believe that the State and all of us should use these place names as a vehicle for projecting the language more than is being done.</P>
    <P>In this connection, as the Minister is aware, we have An Coimisiún Logainmneacha.  I am not certain as to how it is functioning at the moment.  It is attached to the Ordnance Survey.  Perhaps an tAire might at least inquire how viable An Coimisiún Logainmneacha is at the moment?  My reason for asking this is that I have seen a welcome development with regard to maps.  In a number of cases the names of towns are given in Irish as well as in English.  This is a step that one must welcome.  We must move even further.  It is not enough to have Athlone in Irish as well as in English.  We must move into the small villages and preferably even into the fields.  There are many place names hidden away in the names of Irish fields.  We could encourage local people to take an interest in their language by explaining to them the meanings of the names of these fields.  I would like to see An Coimisiún Logainmneacha <Col N="1835" /> not only giving us Irish forms for villages or towns that may have post offices, for instance, but moving into the local fields, names of rocks, and so on, and, furthermore, on a wider issue of course, getting this material published and having it more readily available.</P>
    <P>Our place names relect almost a certain absence of backbone or a lack of confidence in ourselves.  I am sorry to have to say that. Within a few yards of where we are, we have the Westbury Hotel.  In the suburbs we have the most ridiculous names ever, Shrewsbury Lawn and so on. Here we have our splendid native names which mean something to us.  Shrewsbury Lawn in Dublin means nothing; neither does Westbury Hotel.  We must utilise our place names and in this way we would be doing something for the Irish language.</P>
    <P>However, having said all of that, I must compliment Governments over a number of years on making considerable funds available for the language.  My own children have availed in the summer of the coláistí samhraidh to considerable avail and have benefited quite a lot from that. I would also like to see the coláistí samhraidh expand as much as possible bearing in mind that again it is in the local interest, whether this local interest originates in Dublin or in Connemara. Local interest is vitally important.  I am not saying Governments should hand out money for this, that and the other.  We must encourage the local people to do as much as they can.  That has been a factor and an important feature of the coláistí samhraidh.  The State is very generous in making scholarships available to the coláistí.</P>
    <P>Taking up a point Senator Robb made today, I would like the Minister to consider the possibility, if proper organisation could be put in place, of scholarships being made available to pupils who might wish to study in, say, the Scottish Gaeltacht.  In doing that we would be linking this Pan Gaelic culture. We would be looking at a broader front. We would be encouraging the development, the preservation of what is now, <Col N="1836" /> unfortunately, the last remnant of a vital language which was spoken over vast areas of Europe at one time.</P>
    <P>As other Senators said, we must use television and radio much more than we do.  They can have a tremendous impact. I and others benefited from the Irish programme of some years ago called &ldquo;Anois is Arís&rdquo; which did a very good job.  I hope the Minister will again try to use his influence to have somewhat more time made available on television and radio. Incidentally, that will apply very much to what we now hear is going to be a great series of local radio.  Unfortunately, when I turn on Radio Éireann 2 and, indeed, the other local radios, I have yet to hear one word of Irish spoken.  I hear some good, quite interesting and most entertaining Irish music programmes.  I am not listening to radio all around the clock but it is rather disturbing that not one of these pirate radio stations that I have tuned into from time to time, and certainly Radio Éireann 2, is making any programmes available in Irish.</P>
    <P>The other encouraging aspect of the State's involvement over a number of years is making cheap publications readily available.  I believe An Gúm and various other agencies have done a very good job here.  We should all encourage this work to go ahead because, not only have we a language as such, but we also have an extraordinarily rich literature. The name of the Blasket Islands was mentioned today.  We do not even have to go to those wonderful, heroic authors of the Blasket Islands.  We can think of a vast number of authors in the Irish language who appeared even within this century.  Not only have we the creative writers emerging but we also have the seanachaí, the great traditional learning which happily is also being made available to us, not only in the written word through An Coimisiún Bealoideas, but also with tapes.  An tAire may know of the tapes recently made available from north Mayo which are a great pleasure to listen to.  We have considerable goodwill. It is a question of trying to use and capture this goodwill so that at least if we <Col N="1837" /> cannot become a totally Irish speaking nation we will at least be bilingual.</P>

      <P>Nuair a tháinig mé isteach chuig m'oifig maidin inné fuair mé litir on Aire Stáit ag an Roinn Airgeadais. The letter said:</P>
      <P>A Sheanadóir,</P>
      <P>Amárach Lá na Gaeilge.  Tá sé an-tábhachtach go dtabharfaidh Tithe an Oireachtais dea-shampla maidir le úsáid na Gaeilge.  Mar sin bheinn buíoch díot dá ndéanfá iarracht do chuid Gaeilge a labhairt amárach.</P>
      <P>This is amárach and this is my iarracht.  I am particularly pleased to support this motion because it is very important and worth supporting.  I do not know how good my iarracht will be because nuair a bhí mé óg bhí neart Gaeilge agam ach tá sé uilig caillte anois because I suppose cosúil le most of the people around here tá sé caillte agam because I do not practise and if you do not practise, you will never get perfect.  That is my fault and nobody else's.  There are many people around here who wear a fáinne and there are those who have a few words like myself who would be willing to speak the language if they were approached. Perhaps this day will serve to promote this and prompt us to use a little more Irish.</P>
      <P>Is cúis mhór áthais dom go bhfuair an Ghaeilge cabhair fhlaithiúil ón gCrannchur Náisiúnta.  Is dea scéal é seo.  Tá sé tabhachtach gach tacaíocht a thabhairt don teanga náisiúnta.  Is maith an rud é go bhfuil an Crannchur Náisiúnta á úsáid sa tslí seo.  Tá an dea-thoil ann i measc an phobail don Ghaeilge agus caithfimid an dea-thoil seo a aithint go hoifigiúil ar an raidio, ar an dteilifís, sa saol poiblí agus go mórmhór trí chabhair airgid ón Stát.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason I welcome some of the proposals in this report.  I am pleased to hear of the proposal to expend £1 million to provide a year-round physical facility to my old alma mater, Ollscoil na Gaillimhe. It is indeed important that our graduates should have a knowledge of <Col N="1838" /> their native language.  This facility will, through the development of a modern Gaeltacht community, help to facilitate this.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the provision of some £220,000 which will be used to improve facilities in Taibhdhearc na Gaillimhe. My wife Meave was for a number of years a member of the company of the Taibhdhearc and, having sat through many performances there, I can testify to the great work this theatre has done and is doing to foster a love of our native language.  When you think of County Galway, with the Taibhdhearc and the Druid Theatre Company you realise they are paving a way in the world of theatre, and long may they succeed.</P>
    <P>Bhí an-athás orm go raibh Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann luaite i measc na ndeontas ón gCrannchur Naísiúnta. B'fhéidir nach raibh an deontas mór go leor nuair a smaoiníonn duine ar an gclár mór oibre atá acu, ní hé amháin i ngach contae in Éirinn ach thar lear fosta.  Tá súil agam mar sin nuair a bhíonn seans ann arís go meadófar ar an gcabhair don Chomhaltas.  Tá obair iontach ar siúl acu ar son ár gcultúir agus ar son óige na tíre, go mór mhór sna Sé Chontae.  Freastalaíonn beagnach milliún duine ar imeachtaí an Chomhaltais gach bliain agus is mór an chabhair é seo don turasóireacht.</P>
    <P>Tá géarghá níos mó ná riamh tacaíocht a thabhairt don chultúr chun an féiniúlacht náisiúnta féin a chosaint.</P>
    <P>Language is part of culture and the Irish language is part of our culture.  I was interested in Senator Robb's remarks, particularly when he said that language is power.  I had direct experience of this many years ago when in England I used to use mo theanga dhúchais to communicate with my friends to the amazement and confusion of surrounding Englishmen.  If for no other reason but that we might confuse a few more Englishmen it would be worth while promoting its use more fully.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the promotion of Irish as a spoken language. Personally, if I had my way, I would dub all soap operas such as &ldquo;Dynasty&rdquo;, <Col N="1839" />&ldquo;Dallas&rdquo;, &ldquo;Falcon Crest&rdquo; and &ldquo;Crossroads&rdquo;, in the Irish language and in three weeks' time most of the population would speak fluent Irish.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I congratulate the Government.  It is significant when you see a Government putting their money where their mouth is.  I am happy to support the motion.  Go raibh míle maith agat.</P>

      <P>Luaigh an Seanadóir Connor agus daoine eile a labhair an tábhacht atá le teilifís.  Ba mhaith liom féin go mbeadh bun Gaeltachta ag an stáisiún teilifíse nuair a chuirtear ar bun é.  Níl a fhios agam go fóill cén leagan amach a bheas air sin ach sin an rud ba mhaith liom féin agus fad agus a bhaineann sé liomsa sílim gurb é an rud is ciallmhaire dá mbeadh comhcheangal idir Raidió na Gaeltachta agus teilifís Gaeltachta agus go gcuirfí an teilifís chun cinn ar an mbun sin.  Sílim go mbeadh sé i bhfad níos fearr don Ghaeilge dá dtarlódh sé sin.  Bheadh eagla orm go mbeadh sé á reachtáil ar fad ó Bhaile Átha Cliath, agus b'fhéidir, an rud atá ag tarlú i láthair na huaire, nach mbeadh an Ghaeilge ag fáil oiread ama agus ba mhaith liom go bhfaigheadh sé.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aontaím leis an méid a dúirt Seanadóirí go bhfuil feabhas mór tagtha ar RTÉ ó thaobh cláracha a chur ar siúl i nGaeilge agus cláracha ní amháin i <Col N="1840" /> nGaeilge ach cláracha a bhaineann lenár gcultúr féin cé acu i mBéarla no i nGaeilge.  Ba mhaith liom níos mó dóibh sin a fheiceáil agus tá súil agam go leanfaidh siad ar aghaidh ar an mbun sin.</P>
    <P>Luaigh an Seanadóir Ryan na scoileanna lán-Ghaelacha agus aontaíonn muid ar fad go bhfuil an-obair á dhéanamh acu ar fud na tíre.  Níl aon leagan amach cinnte ar cén chaoi a gcabhróimid leo ach bíonn deacrachtaí acu le láithreáin a cheannach agus rudaí mar sin agus is dócha gur ar bhealach éigin mar sin a bheas úsáid á baint as an airgead le cuidiú leo.  Tagann buíonta le chéile leis na scoileanna seo a bhunú agus bíonn deacrachtaí acu le sárú.  Is dócha go mbeimid ag baint úsáid as an airgead chun cuidiú lena n-iarrachtaí.</P>
    <P>Luaigh an Seanadóir FitzGerald agus an Seanadóir Ryan Fundúireacht na Blascaoide. Aontaím ar fad leo.  Tá an-tábhacht leis an obair a rinneadh chun scríobhneoirí an cheantair sin a chaomhnú. Is oidhreacht an-saibhir agus uasal é agus ba cheart cuidiú leo ar gach bealach.</P>
    <P>Bhí mé tógtha go mór leis an méid a dúirt an Seanadóir Robb.  Sílim go raibh an-domhaineacht agus tairbhe san méid a luaigh sé ó thaobh tábhacht na teanga agus an chaoi a dtiocfadh linn úsáid níos fearr a bhaint as ár dteanga le, b'fhéidir, tuiscint níos fearr a fháil ar ár ndúchais agus muintir na hAlban agus muid féin a thabhairt le chéile.  Bhí taithí agam féin nuair a bhí mé im Aire Gaeltachta cheana cuairt a thabhairt cúpla uair ar na hoileáin in Albain agus tuigim go díreach céard a bhí á rá aige agus aontaím leis an smaoineamh a bhí aige.</P>
    <P>Luaigh an Seanadóir Hogan na logainmneacha. Sin run a bhfuil an-suim agam féin ann.  Níl a fhios agam go díreach an bhfuil an coimisiún a bhíonn ag plé le logainmneacha ag obair i láthair na huaire ach mura bhfuil sílim go mbeadh sé an-tairbheach iad a choinneáil ar siúl agus ag obair.  Tá sé sin an tábhachtach mar chuid dár n-oidhreacht.</P>
    <P>Ní maith liom dul thar an am, ach caithfidh mé gach duine a thóg páirt san díospóireacht seo a mholadh agus go mór-mhór na daoine a shíleann nach <Col N="1841" /> bhfuil an Ghaeilge ar a dtoil acu.  Nuair a bhí Aire na Gaeltachta é féin, An Taoiseach, ag caint le Comhchoiste na Gaeilge anuraidh fiafraíodh de cén fath nach raibh níos mó Gaeilge sa Dáil, agus dúirt sé gurb é an locht is mó a bhí orainn ar fad ná go raibh leisce orainn an Ghaeilge a labhairt.  Sílim má éiríonn linn ar fad éirí as an leisce sin agus níos mó Gaeilge a labhairt go mbeidh feabhas i bhfad níos fearr ar rudaí.</P>
    <P>Arís, tá mé buíoch gur éirigh leis an Seanad an deis seo a thabhairt dúinn an cúpla uair a chloig seo a bheith againn ar Lá na Gaeilge.  Níor éirigh linn é sin a dhéanamh sa Dáil agus tig le Comhaltaí an tSeanaid a rá go bhfuil siad chun tosaigh ó tharla go raibh siad sásta am faoi leith a thabhairt chun na cúrsaí seo a phlé.  Tá mé buíoch díobh ar fad.</P>

    <Title>Death of Press Gallery Member. - Libyan Support for IRA: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Senator Hogan on 18 November 1987:</P>
    <P>That in view of the explicit statement from the Libyan Ambassador to France of his country's support for the IRA and the continuing interference by that country in the affairs of this island through the supply of deadly weapons to the IRA, Seanad Éireann calls upon the Government to convey to the Government of Libya the demand that it desist forthwith from its policy of interference in this country and failing such assurances to break diplomatic relations with that country forthwith.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Government&rdquo; where it first occurs and substitute&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;to break diplomatic relations with Libya forthwith and calls upon <Col N="1842" /> the Taoiseach to repudiate all claims to friendship with him already made by Colonel Gadafi.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator Ross.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I had had enough notice I would have put in an amendment to this motion which might or might not have been accepted.  The amendment I would have put down is: &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann notes the statements made by Libyan political leaders supporting paramilitary groups in this country and calls on the Government to clearly restate the position of this nation and its people.&rdquo; That I believe is acceptable to everybody. Over a number of years past everybody has been aware of the statements that have been made or attributed to political leaders&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, would the Senator mind restating the amendment?  I did not hear it the first time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;That Seanad Éireann notes the statements made by Libyan political leaders supporting military groups in this country and calls on the Government to clearly restate the position of this nation and its people.&rdquo;  That would be my simple interpretation of what I think should be said.  I am aware that over the years there have been many statements made, some of them made with strong political connotations and for political propaganda here.  I have no stand to take other than the one which would generally be supported by a large number of people in this country, that is that we do not need outside interference here in our difficulties. This is the stand that will be unanimously taken if politics are left out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years statements have been made by the Libyan leaders; many statements were attributed to them and some of these were ill-founded.  This is to my personal knowledge because I was a member of a parliamentary group that went to Libya.  That group was broadly <Col N="1843" /> based and covered all political parties over the whole political spectrum here. During our visit to Libya we had discussions about commercial and trade possibilities.  We have had one reporter or more from this country who sent back messages stating that a private meeting took place between Colonel Gadafi and named certain members of that parliamentary group.  That statement was completely false.  I do not know if it was ever corrected but it was completely false and without any foundation.  No member of that parliamentary group ever met Colonel Gadafi.  They did meet leaders of Libya and attended meetings with them in Government House in Libya but certainly nothing of a political nature was discussed and no indication of Libyan support for paramilitary groups in this country was ever evident or stated during those meetings.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am surprised now that this matter has to be discussed and cleared up.  I am surprised that any national leader would make statements of support for a paramilitary group operating in another country.  So much is propaganda these days and propaganda is a big part of foreign policy in some countries.  We have our political difficulties with Britain and they are very much involved in a struggle with Libya.  We can make our own judgments and assessments but certainly the whole area of propaganda is one that we are not very much involved in.  We have not got the resources or the finance to get involved on a national scale in that kind of propaganda.  I think it is unwise of us to attribute too much importance to the statements alleged to have been made.</P>
    <P>I would be very happy if our Government would clearly state the exact position. I think it is unnecessary for our Taoiseach to refute statements that are attributed to Colonel Gadafi or the political leaders in Libya about claiming friendship with our Taoiseach and leader here.  It is sufficient for those statements to be ignored.  To call on our leader to <Col N="1844" /> refute any such claim is totally unnecessary and is purely political propaganda. We should not pay much attention to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say, first of all, that I had to consider for some time whether I would agree to lend my name to the amendment which was put down in the names of Senator Ross and myself because I was aware of the fact that it might be interpreted as being in some sense anti-Arab or anti-Libyan.  I would like to make it clear from the start that I regretted that in the debate last week there was detectable some element of an anti-Arab or an anti-Libyan people bias. I would like to make it clear that I do not start from that standpoint and that, quite on the contrary, I respect, honour and appreciate the contribution of the Arab people to the development of civilisation on this planet.</P>
      <P>I also would like to say that I certainly do not regard Colonel Gadafi in quite the unqualified way as do some speakers on this side of the House.  He clearly has been implicated in a number of negative events, shall we say, but equally he has in the State of Libya very actively promoted things with which I fully agree and heartily endorse and which are quite unusual in the Arab world.  For example, despite the impact of the Iranian fundamentalist element in that country, he has very actively promoted the rights and welfare of women.  I salute him for that.</P>
      <P>I also greatly regret the fact that the Americans took the unjustifiable step of pinpointing, targeting and attempting to bomb his home in retaliation for events, some of which could very much more easily have been laid at the door of the Syrian People's Republic but the Americans were unwilling to take that difficult situation on board.  However, it seemed to me last week that we were in a situation of considerable seriousness.  Having reviewed the events of the intervening week it had become that much more serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quote, for example, from a press comment in which the Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, made very clear the nature of his concern.  Referring to the <Col N="1845" /><i>Eksund</i> cargo he commented at his news conference that it had threatened the lives of Irish people.  &ldquo;It also threatened&rdquo;&mdash; and I am quoting directly &mdash;&ldquo;the very safety and security of the State.  The power of those highly sophisticated weapons to maim, destroy and kill, was on a scale that we have never before encountered&rdquo;. I take it that he was referring to the certain existence in the cargo of the <i>Eksund</i> of SAM-7 armour piercing antiaircraft missiles and a very sinister development, that is, a considerable quantity of Semtex explosive which, as I understand it, has a proportionately far higher explosive value than other more primitive forms of explosive, thereby rendering it a far more efficient method of taking human life and destroying property.</P>
    <P>It is a very serious matter when the Minister for Justice of this State states categorically that this importation of arms seriously threatens the existence of the State itself, in other words, there is the capacity to undermine the democratic institutions of our State.  His view it seems was echoed by the Minister who, I am very glad to see present here this evening, Deputy Lenihan, who is reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 24 November as stating after a meeting with Sir Geoffrey Howe that the advanced nature of the weapons involved in this cargo represented &mdash; and I quote Deputy Lenihan as quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i>&mdash;&ldquo;a real threat to our Government as well as a real threat to the British Government&rdquo;.  I take this opportunity to remind the House &mdash; no, I do not have to remind Deputy Lenihan &mdash; of his speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations on 25 September 1987, exactly two months ago, when he said, dealing with terrorism:</P>
    <P>Despite widespread condemnation by the United Nations and other international organisations and improved co-operation in implementing measures to deal with it, the serious threat posed by terrorism to human life and to international peace and security remains.  Ambivalence with regard to <Col N="1846" /> terrorism and its perpetrators still persists. Along with our European partners, we have repeatedly and unambiguously condemned all acts of international terrorism, irrespective of the identities of those responsible or their motivations.  We must all ensure that the obligations that we have assumed under international conventions are fulfilled; we must also pledge ourselves further to intensify existing bilateral and multi-lateral co-operation on practical anti-terrorism measures.  Much of this can be carried out within the framework of the UN and its agencies, as exemplified by the work currently under way in the ICAO and the IMO.  It behoves us all to do our utmost to see that terrorism ceases to be a threat to the orderly conduct of international relations.</P>
    <P>In the light of those admirable sentiments and considering the developments of this week, I have no hesitation in adding my name to the motion calling upon this Government to break off diplomatic relations with Libya.  I say that with the greatest regret because of my respect for the Arab nations and for the Libyan people.  I may, however, point out that Senator Lanigan, the Leader of the House, was incorrect in his speech when he referred to two heads of State.  He instanced one as being democratic and so on; he instanced Colonel Gadafi who arrived by means of a coup and Yasser Arafat who is not a head of State, who does not have a State, regrettably though that may be, of which to be head and who in recent weeks was denied this status by King Hussein of Jordan.</P>
    <P>In calling upon the Minister to implement these signed statements I must draw the attention of the House to what I consider to be the very clear identification of Libya as a source of these weapons.  Some of the weapons found earlier this year were identified clearly as being of Libyan origin and it is useless for Members of this House to raise the question of the method of marking.  I note that even Ministers of this Government <Col N="1847" /> have referred to this marking.  It is quite clear.</P>
    <P>I would also like to say that the <i>Eksund</i> left Malta empty, was photographed by satellite in the harbour at Tripoli, then again took to the high seas; was, I think, photographed at sea and was certainly intercepted by the French Navy, full to the brim with arms.  I may remind the Minister of an old country saying: &ldquo;If it walks like a duck, if it swims like a duck, if it quacks like a duck, it is highly likely that it is a duck.&rdquo;  In this instance Colonel Gadafi has been making suspiciously duck-like noises both personally and through his international diplomatic representatives for a very considerable time.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the House in support of this to the fact that Colonel Gadafi's apparent interest in and support for the IRA really began in June 1972 with a highly inflammatory speech in which he chose to meddle in the internal politics of this island and espouse the cause of the IRA.  This naturally attracted some attention in those circles and the Provisional IRA dispatched representatives to Tripoli who were well received.  The information I have is that the Provisionals sent full time representatives to Tripoli at the behest of the Libyan Government and were given semi-diplomatic status.  It was agreed that economic aid would be given to IRA diplomats My information is that a teacher from County Monaghan &mdash; three, rather &mdash; another teacher from County Down and an Iraqi-American went to Tripoli under cover of taking jobs as English teachers and that one of these, the most senior of them, was housed in a villa at the centre of Tripoli's foreign embassy area.</P>
    <P>This attracted the attention of another group, the UDA, the Ulster Defence Association.  It is well known that in November 1974 a deputation from this other terrorist body led by Glenn Barr and including Tommy Lyttle, Andy Robinson and Charlie Chicken arrived and made &mdash; I am not responsible for his name.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not interested in that at this stage.  A group arrived and whatever their names, the thing that interests me about this &mdash; and this is from highly researched work by two distinguished journalists employed in <i>The Sunday Times</i> when it was a really good newspaper &mdash; is what they said.  In this work Mr. Lyttle is quoted as follows: &ldquo;They&rdquo;&mdash; that is the Libyan officials &mdash;&ldquo;had the impression that the whole of Ireland was occupied by British troops and they were surprised to hear that there was an independent Southern Ireland.  We also got them straight about the Provos.  We told them that the Protestants didn't want the British out at that time and that the Provos weren't just shooting military targets but ordinary Protestant people as well.&rdquo;  Lyttle felt, however, that their trip was successful in opening Libyan eyes to the scale of the Irish problem.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister is he satisfied that this kind of remark can be made seriously.  What is the current status of our relations with the Libyans?  Is it not the case that we have an Embassy at Rome at which the Ambassador is also accredited, although non-resident, to Tripoli?  How is it that the UDA can apparently effectively put a stopper on the flow of arms but our Embassy appears impotent to do so?  I will refer him again to where he said in his speech to the United Nations that we must be unambiguous in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conclusion that one must draw is that the impression given to Colonel Gadafi is not as unambiguous on these matters as it might be.  The most unambiguous message we can give to Colonel Gadafi at the moment is to break off diplomatic relations with Libya.  It seems extraordinary that we can tolerate a situation in which both the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice accept and state in a public forum that the arrival of this enormous quantity of arms of a very sophisticated nature is sufficient in quality and in quantity to <Col N="1849" /> precipitate danger to the very fundamental institutions of this State in a situation where there is virtual certainty that this material originated in Libya.  I do not accuse Colonel Gadafi of being anti-Irish.  It is perfectly clear that he is attempting to pay off Margaret Thatcher for being implicated in the bombing raids on Tripoli which I deplore and which this House, before I was a Member of it, condemned unanimously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened with considerable interest to Senator Norris' speech I now wish to take the motion before us as far as the motion goes but not to pursue it as far as the amendment.</P>
      <P>I spent some time in Libya about ten years ago and became well aware of what an under-developed area of the world it was then.  In fact, at that time and shortly beforehand it was on record that there were fewer than 30 Libyan graduates in spite of the great potential the country had.  Most of the key positions in the country and in the kingdom which were in any way involved in production or organisation were held by expatriates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point I would like to make before I deal with the motion is that many of us forget that Libya had a very unfortunate history and within the past 50 years it has been trampled upon by Italians, Germans and by British armed forces to such an extent that one could argue that the Libyans themselves were in a sense incidental to what was going on in their own country for quite a number of years. We had the Eighth Army, the Afrika Corps and Mussolini's armies fighting in that country.  After that war and especially since it became known that there were great resources of oil there, it became the playground of those countries who wished to have oil or the power <Col N="1850" /> accruing from oil.  It was out of all this that Colonel Gadafi emerged.</P>
    <P>It must also be pointed out that the Islamic culture was looked upon as a second rate culture in Christendom for a very long time.  It is only in recent times that we have come to appreciate what Islam has to offer the world in terms of its art, its culture, its history, and so on. It would be surprising if we could expect the same maturity in a country and its leader emerging so rapidly out of a very deprived situation which existed in the sands of North Africa.  In spite of that, of course, the people have a very rich history and the Toureg especially in the southern parts of Libya are a fascinating people.</P>
    <P>However, we must not use that as an excuse for what is happening in relation to Ireland and we must focus, therefore, on the effect of these arms shipments. Senator Norris was correct in drawing attention to the fact that there are certain aspects of Libya which look as though the ducks are quacking.  He alluded to the relationship between the IRA and Libya and, indeed, to the UDA.  He did not enlarge upon the latter association but it was at the time when the first efforts were being made to promote some new independent political ideas for Northern Ireland that the political branch of the UDA went to Libya.</P>
    <P>The effects of these arms, as we have only recently seen in Ireland &mdash; and two weeks ago the Seanad debated this effect in one isolated incident &mdash; have been dire and I do not think it is too much to say that many Irish people would be killed, maimed and many places in Ireland destroyed if four times the arms captured on the <i>Eksund</i> were to be suddenly released on the unsuspecting people, particularly of Northern Ireland, but indeed of any part of Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is easy to say, as I am sure Colonel Gadafi would say, that western democracies have been practising violence for centuries, with their armies, air forces, nuclear weapons and so on, but we have all come to realise that if the world is to have any future we have to struggle through all that and come up with some <Col N="1851" /> type of pro-life peacemaking philosophy to give mankind some hope.  I see no hope whatsoever if we see the answer to everything in terms of role reversal brought about by violence or the implicit use of violence which is implied in &ldquo;force&rdquo;.  It should be made clear to the Libyan people that we now have understandings, structures and methods of communication which can, albeit at a reasonably slow pace, bring about the change which everybody in this House would like to see.  It may be a very painful procedure and it may take time, but for certain it will come about.</P>
    <P>For those who argue that there is no movement without violence I would argue quite the contrary.  If we are seeking movement by violence we are not seeking liberation but role reversal and as one great philosopher in Paris emphasised, the dominant theme of the late part of the 20th century was &ldquo;domination versus oppression&rdquo;.  He said the counter to that must be liberation, not just liberation of the oppressed but liberation of the oppressor so that the oppressor no longer has a fear of the oppressed.  That is not brought about if the ruling group feel they are going to be subjected in the same way as they originally subjected the oppressed.  In any case, we are not talking about domination and oppression in that degree of severity in the context of Ireland or, indeed, of Northern Ireland. There are very strong arguments against any use of violence to bring about political change in Ireland and the strongest of all is that it is quite abhorrent to 95 per cent or more &mdash; probably 99 per cent &mdash; of the people who live in Ireland.  What we must do is what so many people in this House have been trying to do &mdash; reach across the divide and understand each other better.</P>
    <P>We must send the message clearly to Colonel Gadafi that we understand the difficulties he has had in the past in relation to colonialism and the way in which his country was so ruthlessly intimidated and, indeed, ignored and his people so marginalised, and their religion <Col N="1852" /> not given the respect it was due, but we see the way forward in Ireland not through revenge for what was done in the past but rather by looking in a more constructive way at our politics and new ideas for those politics in the future.</P>
    <P>Therefore I suggest that, if we vote for the amendment to this motion we are, in fact, giving no possibility for Colonel Gadafi to understand the position without feeling threatened even more threatened. If we take the motion as it stands which asks the Government &ldquo;to convey to the Government of Libya the demand that it desist forthwith from its policy of interference in this country and failing such assurances to break diplomatic relations with that country forthwith,&rdquo; this implies the possibility of explanation. It also implies the possibility of obtaining a response, freely given, within the context of what the Provisional IRA are doing to the people, within the context of the need for movement, but not to be brought about by violence because violence eventually is counterproductive to what it is trying to achieve, and it is not necessary to bring it about by revenge.</P>
    <P>Finally, the ultimate end for us all if we pursue change through violence is the obliteration of all life on the planet, another factor which I think the Colonel should take on board.  Therefore, I appeal to the Seanad to reject the amendment and to vote for the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs is present for this debate because, in the final analysis, it is he and his Department who will have to brief the Government on advisability of the text of the motion or its amendment being put into operation. It is appropriate that the Minister has listened to the views expressed by Senators on all sides of the House on this very topical motion and certainly one that has evoked much public opinion which has been expressed to us in our various constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I congratulate the Government on the action they have taken in the last number of days to ensure that all our security forces were put on <Col N="1853" /> alert throughout the country in the event of the information being correct that shipments of arms had been landed on our shores which would put the security of our own State and Government at risk. The Minister would have the support of everyone in this House for the actions the Government have taken in that regard. How successful or otherwise the operation will be depends on the support the public will give to the armed forces and the security forces of the State.  In the kidnapping incident over the past two or three weeks it was questionable as to the amount of sympathisers there were throughout the country for people involved in extraordinary acts which somehow get romantically linked with support for the freedom fighters and other such names given to these subversive organisations.  It is in that context that we must at least reprimand Colonel Gadafi for his public statements of support for the IRA.  Financial and material support have been given by him, attributed to him and it has been confirmed verbally by him on our media that he has sympathy for the freedom fighters in this country.</P>
    <P>It is also rather unfortunate that in the interview he attributed a friendship with our present Taoiseach.  We cannot hold it against the Taoiseach if some foreign leader, self-appointed by a coup or otherwise, says he is a very good friend of the Taoiseach.  That may or may not be the case, but it behoves the Taoiseach, if that is not the case to put the record straight. That would satisfy many people who have concern in this area.</P>
    <P>Further to the comments made by Senator Norris, any comments I make on this issue are certainly not anti-Arab but are the opposite.  With the Leader of the House, Senator Lanigan, I have had the closest co-operation with democratically elected Arab Government leaders over a number of years.  I compliment Senator Lanigan on his efforts, through the European Euro-Arab dialogue group, which is a parliamentary group, to bring peace to the Middle East over a number of years.  He has used his good and influential offices in many ways and in many <Col N="1854" /> countries to bring the unfortunate situation in the Middle East to a satisfactory conclusion.  He has used his influence in America and has tried to foster the concept of an international peace conference in the area of the Middle East crisis. Never once was Colonel Gadafi present at any of those meetings because, as Senator Norris said, he is a self-appointed military leader following a coup and has nothing whatsoever to do with diplomatic or parliamentary dialogue groups in the Middle East.  It is appropriate that the record of the House should show the efforts of Senator Lanigan in that regard.</P>
    <P>Many of us realise the importance of trading with any nation and in particular the amount of trade that goes on fairly regularly with the Libyan nation.  Many agricultural producers in this country welcome the type of efforts which stimulate markets for agricultural products.  We consider that we are a very open and friendly nation and would like to deal with everybody.  Certainly we were all at one in condemning the Americans for their indiscriminate bombing of Libya, and other countries which were used as bases. There is a price to be paid for everything and all reasonable people consider that the price of support in a material way for Irish producers who trade with Libya is too great if the Libyans are guilty of condoning the actions of the IRA and supplying arms to them.  I am not privy to any information that might be available to confirm it one way or another.</P>
    <P>Everything we read in th public press confirms that there is a definite link between the <i>Eksund</i> and the arms found on it which came from Libya and originated in Russia and other arms discovered both in England and on this island. If there is a definite link between them, this Government have a duty to decide whether it is appropriate to have diplomatic relations with such a country.  I quote a headline from the <i>Irish Independent</i>, 24 November, page 8:</P>
    <P>Gahdafi supplier of arms to the Enniskillen murderers.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be absolutely truthful with this House and with the other House, where my party have a motion <Col N="1855" /> down for the withdrawal of diplomatic relations.  The Minister should reject what Libya has claimed and proclaim the fact that we want nothing whatsoever to do with anybody who will assist any nation, Arab or otherwise, to undermine the security of this State by way of support for freedom fighters.</P>
    <P>Perhaps Gadafi has a romantic idea that the Provisional IRA and Sinn Féin are in some way freedom fighters.  All of us in this House realise that is not the case and that episodes like Enniskillen and other atrocities in the past are in no way linked to the concept of freedom fighters.  At one time this country was overrun with Black and Tans and other such militia.  This created major problems for many of our people in this part of the island.  There is a fundamental difference between what is happening now and what happened when people were really freedom fighters and tried to do everything possible to free our country.</P>
    <P>I have no problem with either the motion or the amendment but I would welcome a statement from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, or the Government, or the Taoiseach who has been named in the amendment, which would set our minds at rest.  I opened my comments by congratulating the Minister on the efforts the Government have made over the last two days to trace arms if they were landed in this country.  If that is confirmed it is appropriate that the Minister would publicly condemn the leader of the Libyan nation.  If Colonel Gadafi has been involved the Minister should make a statement.  I would be disappointed if the Minister did not make such a statement. I am not aware yet of what information our agents or representatives who went to talk to our accredited Ambassador in Rome on this issue might have or any other information we might obtain from the French police following their arrest of the ship.  Whatever information is available I hope the Minister will act on it instantly because the ordinary people want the Government to be unambiguous in this area.</P>
    <P>In bringing forward this motion and <Col N="1856" /> the amendment for discussion in this House we are indicating to the Government our concern in this area.  Following the views that have been expressed on all sides of the House I hope the Minister will take effective action.  If that means breaking off diplomatic relations, that is what we should do.</P>
    <P>It is good to have friendly relations with people.  It is better still to have diplomatic relations because then you can have dialogue with people.  Otherwise you would have no means of communication.  If there is any effort whatsoever by Libya to undermine this State we should certainly have nothing to do with them and we would not need dialogue with them.  We would not need associations in trade or in trade missions or anything else because that would be too high a price to pay for the innocent people who would suffer from the illicit use of arms that are apparently entering our country and have been so far attributed to Libya.  They have not denied publicly that they have been involved in this episode.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to the Seanad for the opportunity to debate this matter.  It is a matter which merits debate.  I feel this debate has been constructive up to now.  The Government's view is that we should treat this matter with a certain caution.  Breaking diplomatic relations is a very serious step.  It is one that may be warranted in certain situations but when you look at this particular situation in relation to Libya you see that most countries within the European Community, North America and other democratic countries throughout the world are doing substantial business with Libya and have diplomatic relations with Libya.  I want to make that point first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Breaking diplomatic relations is the sort of step you take only as a very last resort.  We have made our point of view known to the Libyan authorities.  The trade visit that was envisaged to go to Libya has been cancelled and Senators are aware of that.  We feel very strongly that no sensible person in this country can stand over any State running guns, <Col N="1857" /> munitions and armaments into our country at present, North or South.  I want to repudiate that absolutely.  Let us reject it.  That point of view has been made already by our Ambassador to Libya who travelled from Rome to Tripoli to make it known in a very positive way.  That has been done and in my view the further step of breaking diplomatic relations is another day's work.</P>
    <P>Trade continues with Libya not just by Ireland but by Britain and by most other countries throughout the world in one way or another.  Let us be practical as a small country.  We have made our point of view known very clearly.  We have told the Libyan authorities that we view with displeasure and we totally reject any attempt to undermine our democratic institutions here.  I know that our Ambassador has gone in and made that aspect quite clear to the Libyan authorities.</P>
    <P>The debate tonight has been excellent. I read the transcript of the earlier debate last week and I would like to emphasise certain essential principles on which we view our foreign policy in regard to Libya and elsewhere.  I want to dispel some of the misapprehensions which some Senators appear to be under with regard to the Government's attitude on this matter and other matters affecting the security of the State.  The debate in the Seanad has reflected in a very clear and direct way the widespread public concern which has arisen as a result of the threat posed by the <i>Eksund</i> find to the peace and security of the State.</P>
    <P>We have had opportunity in the Dáil also to express our sense of horror at the recent tragic events in Enniskillen.  It is clear that the Provisional IRA in seeking to assemble a very substantial and sophisticated arsenal of weapons in this country pose a threat to authority generally North and South.  They pose a threat to us as well as they pose a threat in the North.  We reject absolutely any attempt by them or anybody else to promote political objectives by violence or by the threat of violence.  Recent events have shown our total commitment in that direction.  I had occasion yesterday to talk <Col N="1858" /> to the British Foreign Secretary and he appreciated the steps we were taking here which are being taken by the British also within their jurisdiction to ensure that any such assemblage of weaponry in both jurisdictions will be sought out, found and people connected with them also sought out, found, apprehended and charged.</P>
    <P>The total scale of the recent security operations mounted earlier this week by both the Garda and the Army demonstrates the seriousness with which we view this problem.  It is one which was discussed by my co-chairman and me, Secretary of State King, last week in Dublin.  The whole potential threat in this matter poses a serious problem to democracy on this island and on both islands.  I want to emphasise that.  The substantial nature of the landings that have already taken place, apart from the <i>Eksund</i> which was apprehended on route &mdash; and I pay tribute to the French authorities for that &mdash; of similar scale armaments and ammunition in these two islands give rise to very serious views, by the security people in charge in the two jurisdictions, that something must be done conjointly by the authorities concerned, that there is no real barrier in this respect and that there will be the utmost and maximum co-operation.</P>
    <P>Our response is a very careful and measured one and I can assure the Seanad that that sort of careful assessment and balance will be applied in regard to our bilateral relationship with Libya and our bilateral relationships with any other country.  It is a question of being measured and balanced in our reaction to it and I respond to the Seanad resolutions in the spirit that we have already made our point of view known to the Libyan authorities.  Breaking diplomatic relations is another day's work. Trade aspects will continue between entrepreneurs here and elsewhere and, as I say are being undertaken by most of our partner countries in the EC and throughout the world.</P>
    <P>As a first step the Ambassador went to Tripoli, sought a meeting, and put what I have said in hand.  Our view is to deal <Col N="1859" /> with the reaction to that decision at a later date.  We have made our view known in a very positive way and in a very unequivocal way.  I can assure the Seanad that on that visit on 7 November the Ambassador reiterated our unequivocal view as a Government that any support for the Provisional IRA from any source, and that includes Libya, is totally unacceptable to us as a Government.  I want to assure the Seanad that that was made known by Ambassador Fogarty who went specifically from Rome to Tripoli to make that known on 7 November.  The fundamental position of principle was referred to in the course of this debate by the Leader of the House, Senator Lanigan, when he spoke here on 18 November.</P>
    <P>I am concerned to note that certain Senators feel it necessary to suggest that the Government handling of the situation indicates a degree of ambivalence.  It does not arise as far as I am concerned or the Government are concerned.  There is no ambivalence in this matter.  There is no uncertainty, ambiguity or lack of resolve on the part of this Government in dealing with this matter.  We have already made it quite clear that any support, material or moral, for the Provisional IRA, or any off-shoot of the Provisional IRA, is unacceptable to a democratically elected Irish Government.  I underlined this fact earlier in the Dáil this year and I do so again here.</P>
    <P>I ask Senators who have questioned our bona fide to recognise the specific manner in which we have presented our position in this respect.  Any suggestions to the contrary are harmful and are against our national interests.  This Government are totally unambiguously committed in the direction I have mentioned. Anybody who questions that is doing a dis-service to this Government &mdash; that may be an indulgence &mdash; a dis-service to the Irish nation and the State as a whole.  What I am expressing is the view of 99 per cent of the elected representatives of both Houses of this Oireachtas and the view of the great majority of the Irish people, particularly at present when we have a very wide <Col N="1860" /> ranging agreement on the fundamental matters among our people.</P>
    <P>All 12 members of the European Community are seeking to develop a European strategy to deal with international terrorism in so far as possible in that type of combined way.  That is the purpose of the Bill which is before the Dáil and which, as Senators are aware, will be coming up for further discussion.  We recall, and Senators can recall, that in 1986 following clear evidence of Libyan support for international terrorism the Twelve adopted a series of measures to discourage Libya from such support in the future.  It was made clear to Libya that states which expect to maintain normal relations with them must be totally outright in their renunciation of support for terrorists.  We have been careful to reflect this concern in our bilateral relations with Libya.  The Twelve dimension is of particular importance in seeking to examine ways and means by which we can collectively work to halt the type of operation engaged in by the <i>Eksund</i> and its crew.  At the most recent meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Twelve in the European Political Co-operation context on 23 November &mdash; only the other day &mdash; I urged that we apply ourselves to further consideration of this matter.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that what will come before us for ratification inside the next few days, by 1 December, is a European Convention for the suppression of terrorism.  It is not about extradition.  That has been there since 1965.  People North and South and in Britain have got their perceptions or images, or their mirrors mixed up in this respect.  We have had extradition within our community between Ireland and Britain and enforcement of warrants procedure for 100 years.  The Extradition Act was codified in 1965, 22 years ago. What we are talking about on 1 December is a European Convention for the Suppression of Terrorism, particular and specific offences listed in that measure.</P>
    <P>The Government continues to monitor closely developments in the <i>Eksund</i> case. The Garda are in touch with the French <Col N="1861" /> police.  The primary purpose of this co-operation is to ensure that all relevant information is made available to the Government as the investigation develops.  We are certainly aware of the fact that this is a practical example of co-operation and the French Government are due our gratitude and that has been conveyed to them by the Taoiseach. Their legal constraints restrain me to some degree in commenting further on the matter but it is under control as it were there.  As soon as the matter was brought to our notice and brought to my personal notice, there was complete co-operation between our authorities and the French authorities.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that Senators have been motivated by a sincere concern to ensure, in terms of our foreign policy, that everything possible will be done to reflect the wide degree of public disquiet which has naturally arisen in this matter.  We have made the Libyan authorities aware of the disquiet which exists here and emphasised to them in the course of that representation that any support for the Provisional IRA or any subversive body in this island is anathema to the whole democratic process on this island and to the Government of this country, not just our Government but whatever government are legitimately elected by the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Some of the remarks made last week seem to indicate in some way that we are not pursuing this matter to the fullest extent.  I want to reject that.  We have a trading relationship with Libya.  We have a trading relationship with Algeria, with Tunisia, with Morocco, with Egypt and the Middle East.  Most of the export payments that we secure from our common market involvement arise out of business we do in that area of the world.  It is important to look after that too, as other countries do.  That is a separate matter. It is notable that, within the framework of agreement among the Twelve that they will not undercut measures taken by the United States, all our partners in the Twelve continue to maintain trading relations with Libya.  I want to emphasise that that all our partners within the 12 <Col N="1862" /> members of the Community continue their trade and commercial relations. That is a fact of life.  That is a matter that must be maintained.  I would also regard any attempt to abandon such trade relations or break diplomatic relations with Libya or any other country as an illiberal type of measure.  I am rather surprised to hear a liberal Senator like Senator Norris suggesting &mdash; sometimes I think there is nothing as illiberal as a liberal in pursuit of his particular point of view&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I feel very strongly that we must continue to talk to people and have dialogue with people, to trade with people and indicate our point of view and debate it strongly with people; maintain our point of view and argue it and try to push our point of view as hard as possible. I am a total devotee of that style of international politics &mdash; and I am a devotee of it in national politics as well &mdash; because it is very important in international politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has emerged here in the course of a very good debate is that the Taoiseach has already made his point of view quite clear.  It has been conveyed quite plainly to the Libyan authorities.  I want to emphasise that the management of our diplomatic relations with Libya will continue to be given this careful and sensitive consideration on my part.  I appreciate the spirit in which the motion and amendment were put down.  They require careful consideration.  I would like very much if the Senators did not push the amendment.  I am fully aware of the spirit <Col N="1863" /> behind the amendment.  All I say is that we must assess the situation on a day to day basis and give it the sort of sensitive consideration that it deserves, assess the situation properly and make our decisions by way of response in a calm and balanced manner when that is required.</P>
    <P>I take on board fully the point of view that have been expressed here in the Seanad.  I fully take on board the spirit of the points of view in the motion.  I am very glad of the occasion we have had for this debate.</P>
    <P>What I am really saying here to Senators is that, while we fully recognise, as a Government, what is involved, we deplore any attempt to encourage violence in our society.  At the same time I feel that the Seanad should recognise that it is a matter for the Government, at the right time, to take the final drastic step which at the moment is not justified, and that if trade &mdash; and fruitful trade &mdash; is to continue, it should continue on a private basis.  It is not the time yet to break diplomatic relations.  We have indicated our displeasure to the Libyan authorities and we should leave it at that and make sure that normal business can take place and that they will take cognisance of the fact that we have indicated that displeasure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of the day the bottom line in this debate is how we can approach it on a practical basis.  There is a lot of merit in what has been said here with regard to the suggested motivation in the framing of the motion.  During the course of the debate this night week people like you <Col N="1864" /> and I were described as &ldquo;lunatic backwoodsmen&rdquo;. If concern for the wellbeing of the people qualifies one for that I suppose I qualify and accept it.</P>
    <P>The Minister's general approach to the debate has been well reasoned and sensible. At the end of the day this is the approach that will have to be taken.  We in the Houses of the Oireachtas have a responsibility to be consistent in our approach.  Obviously as a party and a Government we abhor and reject vehemently any involvement by the Libyan Government in the importation of arms into this country.  The comments made by the Libyan Ambassador to France were quoted here last week.  He said: &ldquo;My country is quite open in its policies towards national liberation movements.&rdquo;  This comment could have been made by President Reagan when he made his submission to the House of Congress in the United States and sought their assistance to fund the Contras so that they could bring down a legitimately elected Government in Nicaragua.  We should pursue that very obvious line of debate which we are not doing that here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivianOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if we want to be consistent.  Unfortunately there is not great evidence of this.  Senator Norris correctly quoted from a book in relation to visits by the UDA and the IRA to Libya in 1974.  That is quite a long time ago.  All of a sudden people in this House have an inordinate concern that at this given stage in our history we should break off diplomatic relations with Libya, despite the fact that when that party were in Government their Minister for Agriculture went to Libya &mdash; as he should have done &mdash; in an effort to boost our trade with that country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said this evening that we have to be balanced in our approach to this debate.  The obvious vehicle for this is in our access to the European Communities and the approach they have taken in this regard.  We should be mindful of the fact that France have not <Col N="1865" /> broken off diplomatic relations with Libya even though they are fighting them in Chad at present.  We should also be conscious of the alleged Libyan involvement in the atrocities of the Bader-Meinhoff group in Germany and in the explosion at an American servicemen's disco in Germany last year.  Neither of those two countries has yet seen fit to break off diplomatic relations with Libya. Nor have the Government of the United Kingdom, despite the fact that one of their police constables was shot down in cold blood in London not so long ago.</P>
    <P>We should endeavour to be consistent. There is an effort in this debate to put the Fianna Fáil Party in some kind of spotlight, to suggest that we are soft.  The actions of the Government during the past few days to redress what appears to have happened in relation to the importation of arms into this country during the period of office of a different Administration are proof positive that they are not soft on the Provisional IRA and never have been.  Our concern for the wellbeing of our citizens in other administrations should not be confused with our hardline approach to the Provisional IRA in this case.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Foreign Affairs on his very comprehensive coverage and response to the motion.  I should like to be associated with his comments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is not an exercise in party point scoring.  The very fact that the motion we put down does not call for the immediate breaking off of diplomatic relations with Libya is evidence of that.  Like Senator Ferris, I accept fully the bona fides and tremendous efforts on the world stage made by the Leader of this House in promoting better relations in trade, culture and political matters.  I should like to make those points very clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate is about a very important principle: the invasion of our sovereignty by a foreign power on an unprecedented scale.  It is very strange that those groups who were so vociferous about the dilution <Col N="1866" /> of sovereignty threatened by the Single European Act are so silent on this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>It is strange that those who were so vocal about cross-Border transgressions or aerial overflights are totally mute on this subject.  This is strange because what we are talking about is direct interference by another country in the internal affairs of this country. It is interference of a murderous kind.  It is as simple and unambiguous as that.</P>
      <P>The reaction of Fianna Fáil members to the motion has ranged from embarrassment to resentment that it was put down at all.  The reason for this is one which must be addressed and it was mentioned by the Minister in his reply. Members of Fianna Fáil, like many other people in the country, are not aware of the precise relationship between the Taoiseach and the leader of Libya.  The Minister went some of the way tonight in his text to clarify this issue but the view is widespread that there is a close relationship or friendship between the two leaders.  In truth, Fianna Fáil in the past encouraged this view when it suited them.  I remember well the outlandish claims made in the other House in this regard.  Until the Fianna Fáil Party first of all, and the country at large, are put in the clear about the exact nature of the relationship between this Government and Libya &mdash; and the Minister has gone part of the way this evening &mdash; the ambiguity on this question will continue.  I can assure the Minister that in the public mind there is a widespread belief that that friendship exists and that it embarrasses and hinders the Government from taking a stronger line on this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic facts as far as Libya is concerned are very well established.  Libya is one of a small number of countries which actively, and as a measure of state policy, promote terrorism in other countries.  It is the only country which publicises its policy of financing and often planning indiscriminate terrorism regardless of the waste of human life involved.  As late as <Col N="1867" /> April of 1986 Colonel Gadafi, on Libyan television, reasserted Libya's right to incite popular revolution more or less where he wishes.</P>
    <P>In recent years Libya's trade in popular revolution has taken many forms.  Principally these have included the direct organisation, through the Libyan equivalent of diplomatic channels, or specific acts of terrorism abroad such as the murder of a woman police constable in London, the bombing of the La Belle discotheque in Berlin and so forth.  It includes assassination at home and abroad of individual Libyan critics of the Gadafi régime.  This was described by him as &ldquo;the elimination of stray dogs&rdquo;.  It includes the alleged financing of selected revolutionary parties &mdash; and this is what concerns this country &mdash; the financing and arming of terrorist organisations such as the Abu Nidal group, other extremist Palestinian murder squads in Lebanon and also the Provisional IRA.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that we are a pawn in the continuing row between Libya and the UK and to a lesser extent between Libya and the US.  If Colonel Gadafi can embarrass, discomfort or destabilise these countries through arming and training the Provisional IRA then his objectives have been met.  He does not care about this country.  We are a pawn in his global strategy.  If the consequences of his involvement here are death, destruction, suffering and terror, then it matters not one little bit to him. There has not been one expression of sympathy from him to the relatives of those who were killed by material that came from his country over the years. There can be no friendship between this man and our country.  There can be no co-existence between our democratic philosophy and his messianic zealotry and disregard for basic international law and decency.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the background.  As far back as June 1972 he outlined his basic position when he said:</P>
    <P>We support the revolutionaries of Ireland, who oppose Britain and who <Col N="1868" /> are motivated by nationalism and religion.  The Libyan Arab Republic has stood by the revolutionaries of Ireland.  It maintains strong links with the Irish revolutionaries.  There are arms and there is support for the revolutionaries of Ireland....  We have decided to move to the offensive.  We have decided to fight Britain in her own home.  We have decided to create a problem for Britain and to drive a thorn in the side so as to make life difficult for Britain....  She will pay a double price.  She will pay dearly.  We will give her two blows for one received.</P>
    <P>That was broadcast on Libyan radio on 11 June 1972.  Other speakers here this evening have detailed the visits of the Provisional IRA to that country and the relationship established there.  We all remember the <i>Claudia</i> incident where, thanks to the vigilance of the Irish Naval Service, attempts to import an enormous amount of arms to this country were arrested.</P>
    <P>Right throughout the seventies the Colonel has made further references to his support for the IRA.  In August 1973 he told a conference of Libyan students who were going abroad that he was determined to carry the battle in defence of the Arab nation to the heart of Israel, Northern Ireland and the USA.  At a press conference in Paris in November of that year he said Libya intended to continue aiding the IRA because they were representatives &ldquo;of a little people fighting for their liberty against a great State&rdquo;.  Reference has been made here to the visit by Irish parliamentary delegations to Libya to try to dissuade Colonel Gadafi from this evil course. Clearly, their efforts were totally in vain. After the Provisional IRA bombs exploded in London in March 1976, <i>Al Fajr Al Jadid</i>, the Arabic daily paper produced by the official Libyan news agency, claimed that:</P>
    <P>These bombs which are convulsing Britain and breaking its spirit are bombs of the Libyan people....  We <Col N="1869" /> have sent bombs to the Irish revolutionaries so that Britain will pay the price of her past deeds after we have liquidated her presence from our land.</P>
    <P>Surely that language is unambiguous and represents an enormous intrusion in the internal affairs of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1980 at a time when Anglo-Libyan relations had again deteriorated, statements were made by representatives of the Gadafi régime in London &mdash; On 3 November 1980, which is only seven years ago, in a broadcast by the Voice of the Arab Homeland &mdash; I am coming closer to home, Minister &mdash; they gave the reasoning behind the interference. They said:</P>
      <P>...it permits us to achieve three objectives simultaneously.  It helps us to entrench ourselves in the line of support for all liberation movements. It helps us to prove to the whole world that the Arab revolution is capable of moving from a position of defence to that of attack.  Finally, it helps us to pay Britain back for a small part of the harm it caused and causes to our Arab nation.</P>
      <P>Later in 1984 &mdash; and I am coming closer to the present &mdash; at a time of further terrorist attacks in Britain and in parts of Europe, the Voice of the Arab Homeland in a commentary on 22 April 1984 talked about setting up people's committees to form alliances with the IRA and so forth.  At that same time the chief Libyan diplomat in London, so-called diplomat, talked about the relationship with the IRA.  He said:</P>
      <P>The Libyans knew the IRA and its leaders because we co-operated with them in the early 1970s...</P>
      <P>If Britain was able to co-operate with mass terrorists &mdash; i.e. enemies of Gadafi:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>-and stray dogs escaping justice and law, how can we not meet or recognise noble strugglers like the leaders of the IRA.  At any rate, we consider their <Col N="1870" /> cause just and we can support it as best we can.</P>
    <P>I could go on in the few moments left to me to detail other examples.  At the beginning of last year the Garda discovered two caches of arms in Sligo and Roscommon and these were mentioned earlier.  It was the largest store ever discovered North or South and the weapons seized there are believed to have originated in Libya.  In recent days arms have been seized from the <i>Eksund.</i>  This has been covered by my colleagues in this debate.  There has been a major police effort during the past couple of days to trace other weapons which have come into this country over the past few years. I thought it was unworthy of Senator O'Callaghan to equate the getting in of these arms with any failure on the part of the previous Government.  The fact that the <i>Eksund</i> was captured &mdash; and thankfully so &mdash; had nothing to do with this Government: it had all to do with the surveillance of France and other countries against terrorism.  Everybody in this country welcomes what happened.</P>
    <P>The basic point is that the evidence is very clear that the Libyan Government are engaged in the export of terrorism. The evidence is clear that the Libyan Government have no respect for the sovereign rights of other countries.  The evidence is clear that we are seen as a pawn in the relationship between Libya and Britain and the US.  If Libya can destabilise or embarrass those countries, then we are a very useful pawn in all of that. This is the basic situation in which we find ourselves with Libya.  That country continues to export arms to this country on a scale so potentially destructive that it baffles imagination and description. Enniskillen would be merely a back page story compared to the potential of what was in the <i>Eksund</i> and the other boats which are reported to have landed arms in this country.</P>
    <P>It is clear there has been interference on a massive scale in the internal politics of this country by the Libyan Government. It is clear that the consequences of that interference are murderous.  Even if <Col N="1871" /> a country was interfering in a peaceful way we would resent it, but interference of that sort is clearly unacceptable.  It is unacceptable to any sovereign state that their sovereignty should be breached in this way.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to the Minister.  I understand his thinking but I am not persuaded by the case he made here this evening.  He expressed his concern, which we all share.  He used soft words and diplomatic clichés but there was no evidence of any strong intent on the part of the Government to take the sort of strong action against Libya for which the ordinary people are asking.  They signed the books of condolences because they were outraged by what happened in Enniskillen and who were outraged at what could have happened if those arms had come to this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister expressed his displeasure this evening.  In this case displeasure is not enough.  A majority of decent people in this country will applaud the motion before the Seanad this evening.  There are many people in the Fianna Fáil Party who would like to be able to support us because they are uneasy at what is <Col N="1872" /> happening.  They share the unease.  They cannot understand why the Government have remained mute, even if they are working feverishly behind the scenes. They cannot understand why in the face of such evil interference in the internal affairs of this country our Government give us soft diplomatic clichés and talk about normal channels and about not rocking the boat.  All of these clichés mean that very little is being done.</P>
    <P>For that reason I cannot, with respect, accept the Minister's invitation this evening to withdraw our motion.  Our motion is in the interests of the Irish people at this particular point.  We have to send our message loud and clear from the sovereign representatives of a sovereign State that no interference in the internal affairs of this country will be tolerated from any quarter and most especially that no interference which leads to the death and destruction of Irish people and Irish proprty will be tolerated. For that reason we will be pressing the motion.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House to answer the matters which I want to raise on the Adjournment.  First, I will deal with the various schools briefly as I want to detain the House as long as needs be only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clonegal national school is situated in County Carlow.  It was built in the fifties as a result of an amalgamation of the schools at Parkbridge and Clonegal in Carlow.  Parkbridge national school was closed in the late sixties.  Therefore, we have a three teacher school in Clonegal at the moment with one pre-fab which is 15 years old occupied by one teacher and a teacher in a parochial hall in that area. <Col N="1875" /> Approximately 170 pupils are expected to be educated in the best way the teachers can, but unfortunately the conditions there, as in other schools, leave a lot to be desired.  The parents and board of management of this area have facilitated amalgamation over the years.  In the late 1960s they facilitated the amalgamation of Parkbridge and Clonegal in order to bring about the necessary co-operation between both ends of the parish, as it were.  No provision was made for this amalgamation except the provision of a pre-fab.  An extension has been required for a good while.  They need three extra classrooms because of the increase in the number of pupils in that area and there are plans for a physical education hall and a staff room.  I hope the Minister will be in a position to place this project for tender as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The second school to which I would refer is Ballyhale Vocational School in County Kilkenny.  Ballyhale Vocational School was opened in 1959 for 42 students and they had their first Intermediate Certificate examination there in 1969.  About eight or ten years ago they developed their school to such an extent that they were able to offer Leaving Certificate Examination to the students.  Enrolment at the school has increased to 220 students and I would be very much afraid that some of the students who are at present at Ballyhale would start to drift to other schools if there were a rumour of closure of the school or if the Department of Education were not in a position to give a commitment that they were serious about building a new school for Ballyhale. There are 15 teachers there, if you include the principal and vice-principal, and they give a full range of subjects in a very exemplary way.  A new school was sanctioned in 1981 for Ballyhale and presently it is at stage four.  Recent negotiations were entered into by the board of management at the vocational school at Ballyhale and by Kilkenny VEC for the purchase of an additional site in order to accommodate the new school.  They ran into some difficulties in relation to planning permission <i>et cetera</i> because of <Col N="1876" /> its location on a very bad road bend. I understand that a deputation met the Minister and the Minister of State and officials from the Department some time ago in relation to the sanctioning of this particular site and agreement, as I said, has already been entered into and I would hope that the Minister would be in a position to give Government commitment and Department commitment to buying this site.  It will indicate to the parents, to the pupils and to the board of management that the Government are serious about building a new school at Ballyhale and dispel any rumours that might be surfacing at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Minister will agree that the condition of Ballyhale Vocational School is probably one of the worst in the country. They have 11 pre-fabs and most of them go back to 1965.  They have only, in effect, two classrooms, one for woodwork and one for domestic economy.  The Ballyhale people have been very patient and the teachers and pupils have been extremely patient in waiting for this new school to be built.</P>
    <P>I must also refer to the fact that there is a hairdressing course being conducted in Ballyhale and in order to establish the proper facilities for that course they had to convert existing shower units into a classroom facility.  In this day and age it should not be necessary to convert shower units into a classroom for the purpose of carrying out any school course.</P>
    <P>In Ballyhale they have had tremendous trauma over the last few weeks in that a number of their teachers have been redeployed.  Where redeployment has to take place it should take place at the beginning of a school year rather than in the middle of a school year.  Students are upset by the fact that a teacher has to be redeployed in the middle of the year and courses like applied mathematics, which were being offered in this school, are now curtailed because of the redeployment of a teacher who has to spend so many days in Ballyhale and other days in nearby Graiguenamanagh Vocational School. The Minister would need to examine the financing of the vocational education <Col N="1877" /> system in the context of Ballyhale Vocational School.  I look forward to hearing from the Minister in relation to the site at least.</P>
    <P>Mooncoin Vocational School in south Kilkenny is the other school I want to refer to.  This school was built in the early 'forties and it also has a large number of prefabricated buildings very much in need of replacement.  Mooncoin is a very large catchment area and many residents of that area are commuting daily to Waterford.  It is a growing area and one that is likely to continue to grow.  There are in the region of 300 pupils there at the moment and the number is increasing yearly.  It is not surprising it is increasing because of its very close proximity to the city of Waterford.  I again appeal to the Minister to consider that if the pupils and their parents consider that a new school at Mooncoin will not be established shortly, they will look around their immediate area for better facilities and a better standard of education.  There are 16 teachers there at the moment and there is no excuse for the Minister in relation to this school because 1987 was the year in which Mooncoin Vocational School was to commence.  The various stages have all been gone through and all that is needed is something that is very scarce in the Minister's Department at the moment, that is, finance.  I know she has had some difficulties in recent days with finance and I hope she will not have the same difficulty in providing the structural facilities that are needed.</P>
    <P>Educational facilities like these are very important to places like Mooncoin. The development of different schools in County Kilkenny was forecast some years ago by Department of Education officials and there is an established need for a school here.  I appeal to the Minister, with the limited resources she has in her Department, to consider giving some indication to the board of management of Mooncoin Vocational School of a commencement date for the construction of this school.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke) Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Senator <Col N="1878" /> Hogan for the very excellent way in which he defends his home county.  I am sure Kilkenny is very proud of him and the fact that he has a forum here in the Seanad to bring up the various cases for his area is as important to him as it is to the community.  Indeed I used my own Seanad time very much in the same fashion.  I will go through the three schools in the order in which the Senator spoke of them and the first was Clonegal Primary School.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point in my going back over the historical data because, of course, the Senator has given the facts very well including the fact that it has a staffing level of five teachers and it dates back to 1953.  The Office of Public Works produced a plan for the extension following its usual feasibility study but, as the Senator said, revised plans had to be prepared when it was found that the average enrolments were going up and that a five classroomed school would be required. This produced another difficulty in that an extension of the site then became necessary.  The Department and the Office of Public Works went about that and all documentation was completed in March, 1987.  There is good news at the end, so do not get too despondent about this school.  The further news in relation to the Clonegal scheme and indeed other ones is the lack of finance to which the Senator has referred.  The positive thing is that recently the chairman of the school's board of management &mdash; the Senator possibly knows this &mdash; came to see officers of my Department's primary building branch and it was agreed that the possibility of the Department grant-aiding a modest extension to replace the pre-fab and the parochial hall would be investigated. What would be in question here is a basic type of structure which, if the price was right, could be offered to the school for the moment to make it do with what they have while waiting in line with the other schools which need tackling. More and more people are finding, in difficult economic circumstances, that they can be inventive in how they go about what they need.  I am hopeful about the discussions at present going on with <Col N="1879" /> the chairman of the board of management who took the initiative himself to come to the Department.  I cannot give any more details about it because it has not reached that stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that a Lisdowney-type formula?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I know about Lisdowney of course but it is apparently an idea which has found interest with the chairman and the board of management and they are at present discussing it with the Department on that basis.  I hope their discussions will be fruitful and indeed I would think that the Clonegal people, as I am sure all Kilkenny people, are very reasonable and have decided that they may have a solution to offer to the Department which we would gladly embrace as well.  I am interested in those discussions and I am going to follow them up with my Department officials because I think there may be scope for further developments on those lines.</P>
      <P>The Senator spoke next about Ballyhale, and gave the historical situation at Ballyhale.  He said it had 220 pupils; 219 is what my brief tells me so we will not quibble about one pupil.  The Department are very aware that the present accommodation at Ballyhale Vocational School cannot be regarded as fully satisfactory comprising, as it does, the temporary prefabricated accommodation with a small amount of good permanent accommodation.  It is intended in the overall plan to retain that small amount and to work around it.  The acquisition of the additional property has caused great difficulty for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The acquisition of additional property adjacent to the school has been found necessary as the local planning authority indicated that no new buildings would be allowed in front of the existing permanent school.  That is because of the road frontage. The problem of securing the additional land has not yet been finalised and I believe all efforts are being made to do that.  In that context, even if it were finalised, the money would not be there <Col N="1880" /> right now to proceed with it but that will not stop them going ahead with their investigations into the further ways in which they could obtain this land.  The previous Government decided to carry out a major review of all projects at post-primary level at various levels of planning and to see the need for them as they arose.  That review is still going on.  That was the previous Government's decision and we carried it through.  That review is still going on and we hope to have it completed shortly, perhaps by Christmas or January.  I know Ballyhale has a very good record of a range of subjects.  The Senator spoke about the trauma of redeployment.  I think it has a shared teacher with other vocational schools.  I heard of the case in another context.  I am of the opinion that the teacher hours are working out fairly satisfactorily but I take the point that it is difficult for students in the middle of a school year to alter their schedule.  If there is any particular difficulty the Senator has in mind about that I would be glad to hear from him.</P>
    <P>With regard to Mooncoin Vocational School, again he talks about its extensive needs and the curriculum which it offers for the area and I am sure that is so.  The Department have approved in principle of a proposal to develop the vocational school so as to bring its pupil capacity to 275 places in permanent accommodation. Then there is the architectural planning of the project; the estimated cost is £1.3 million and the project has reached the bills of quantity stage.  This project is one of the large number of second level school building projects where architectural planning has been completed.  The next step in the normal way for such projects would be to sanction the seeking of tenders.</P>
    <P>Because of the difficult financial situation which we have and because of the fact that the capital financial allocation for post-primary building for 1988 is extremely limited, most of which will be taken up by the contractual arrangements already entered into in 1987 and requiring further funding in 1988, it will not be possible to proceed to tender with this <Col N="1881" /> project at this time.  However, we are preparing in the Department a list of what we would consider would be priority areas when we would receive our funding in the middle of 1988 which would be for the following year.  I will certainly undertake in the light of that to keep those two post-primary schools in County Kilkenny under review at that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one question in relation to Ballyhale.  The Minister stated that the question of the additional property that is needed to build a new school is not finalised.  Two acres were purchased at a price of £12,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department have to sanction this purchase.  It has been agreed with the officials and it has been agreed with the principal of the school who is actually the vendor of the property so there is a vested interest there on the part of the principal to ensure that the Minister agrees to this matter as soon as possible.  Hopefully, she will not let the principal down.  If the Department could sanction the agreement of this price for the property it would indicate the commitment of the Department to proceed with the school project as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Senator's point.  I would not be able to give you that commitment because my brief does not contain that information.  The Senator obviously has more up-to-date local knowledge of Ballyhale than I have but I will have that matter investigated and I will communicate with him.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.45 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 2 December 1987.</P>
