      <P>I have notice from Senator David Norris that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The implications of the closure of Dr. Steevens' Hospital.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Joe O'Toole of the following matter:</P>
      <P>Publication of Bills in Irish before discussion in Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Philip Hogan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The present position regarding building projects for the National Schools at Lisdowney, Graiguenamanagh, Mooneenroe and Castlecomer Community School.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2" /> I also received notice from Senator Nuala Fennell of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The severe underfunding of the Council for the Status of Women which represents 250,000 women and 55 affiliated organisations.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Katharine Bulbulia of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to restore funding to the County and City Infirmary, Waterford in order to ensure that the people of that area have an adequate surgical and medical service.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Norris, Hogan, Fennell and Bulbulia as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator Norris' <Col N="3" /> motion and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.  Senators Hogan, Fennell and Bulbulia may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.  I regret I have to disallow the matter raised by Senator Joe O'Toole on the grounds that it is a matter for the House itself in that it falls within the ambit of Standing Orders.</P>
    <P>During the last session there was a lot of repetition.  I remember, as Cathaoirleach, on two occasions reading out 14 motions for the Adjournment and 13 on another occasion.  I want to make it clear that Senators will have to give notice in writing on the matters they want to have raised or else these will lapse.  I stated that before.  This evening we will take Senator Norris on item No. 1, the implications of the closure of Dr. Steevens' Hospital.</P>

      <P>On matters arising on the Adjournment, it would appear the machinery is there to enable Members of the House to raise matters of grave urgency that arise from day-to-day and it would appear over the last period that there are matters of urgency arising daily from positions taken by the present Government.  One does not know from day-to-day what will be gone the next day and it is difficult to put down all these matters of urgency in time.</P>

      <P>Order.  Before I call the Leader of the House on the Order of Business today, I want to make an announcement for the information of all Members of this House on the progress report from the Office of Public Works on the Seanad Chamber which was considered by the Committee on Procedures and Privileges yesterday.  Members will recall that on the occasion of the first progress report on 1 July, I made a similar announcement to keep all Members of this House up to date as far as possible on the progress of the work.  At that time I undertook to make an announcement on each progress report as it arose.  This report is a bit earlier than I thought would be the case.  The second report covers repair work to the north wing of Leinster House, which includes the Library as well as the Seanad Chamber.</P>
      <P>Briefly, the Office of Public Works summarise the work to be done as follows: (a) taking down and rebuilding all the bow and gable wall to the underside of first floor level, strengthening the new work, repairing and cleaning the stonework; (b) repairing and strengthening main roof structure over Seanad Chamber; (c) strengthening Chamber floor; (d) repairing cracks in Oireachtas Library; (e) modernising mechanical and electrical installations; (f) restoring plasterwork in Seanad Chamber and Oireachtas Library and refitting both.</P>
      <P>A contractor has now been appointed and work commenced on 21 September. The Office of Public Works expect the work to be completed towards the end of 1989, maybe some months earlier.  I am happy that the contractor is on site and that the work has commenced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the noise factor in the work, I would like to quote from a letter of 25 September 1987 received from the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Treacy on the project which <Col N="5" /> sets out the position clearly and speaks for itself:</P>
      <P>The Commissioners are working to a very tight budget on this project, on the instructions of the Minister for Finance.  Consequently speed is of the essence and the co-operation of everybody concerned is essential.  The contractor has been instructed to schedule his operations so as to cause the minimum possible interference by noise, dust or otherwise to the remainder of Leinster House and adjoining buildings. It is imperative that the work proceeds without it being necessary to disrupt the contractor's programme and I am looking for your support and indeed patience while the work is in hands.  Needless to say if the contractor is required to suspend work for any length of time the cost of the project increases and the finishing date is extended <i>pro rata.</i>  Between us all we must ensure that this is avoided even if it means that we are discommoded a little.</P>
      <P>I quote further from the Minister's letter:</P>
      <P>Questions have been asked about the Commissioners plans for the Seanad Chamber ceiling.  You can take it that every effort will be made to save this ceiling in keeping with the Commissioners acknowledged track record in this area.  I can tell you however that the ceiling is in a very bad way and is disintegrating.  Experts are being consulted and a solution is being sought. In making a final decision the Commissioners principal concern will be the structural adequacy of the restored ceiling so that the business of the Seanad can be conducted in a secure and safe environment without the need for further works in the foreseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will see from the progress report and the Minister of State's letter, which I have quoted, that every effort is being made to ensure that our Chamber will be returned to us with all possible speed. Here, I ask for the co-operation of <Col N="6" /> Senators and, indeed, I ask for the co-operation of other members of Leinster House, including Members of Dáil Éireann, in ensuring that this project can be finished on time.  I will report to the House when I receive the next progress report.</P>
    <P>I have been in this House for several days of each week, except for two weeks, and before I finish on this I want to pay a tribute to Jeffrey Johnson of the OPW for his co-operation in having contractors on site in order to get our old Chamber back.  I trust that Senators feel most comfortable in the new chairs here today.  I sat on the other chairs for four years and I do not know whether it was because of my long legs but I certainly did not find them comfortable.  I decided that we should change them and have at least that much comfort.  The atmosphere of the Seanad today is a little bit more senatorial.  Having paid a tribute to Jeffrey Johnson I would also like to pay a tribute to the Superintendent of the Houses and the staff of this House for the work they undertook during our absence in the summer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with you in paying tribute to the personnel of the OPW, to the Superintendent of the Houses and to the staff and also to express on behalf of the Fine Gael group our pleasure at being back again in this temporary Chamber.  I would also like to pay tribute to you, a Chathaoirligh, for your devotion and dedication to this House and for the facilities afforded to its Members.  It is indeed much improved, albeit, a temporary Chamber, and I am sure Members will appreciate and enjoy the facilities which you have overseen during the summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to endorse the comments that have just been made by Senator Bulbulia and I couple them with my appreciation of what Senators did on my behalf at the end of the last session. I can assure them that what was said here and the way in which it was conveyed by the Leader of the House to where it matters was in fact of great assistance in <Col N="7" /> producing an effect which made my work place much improved.  I would like to put on the record of the House my appreciation and thanks.  This Chamber today is well adorned by the flag which is behind the Cathaoirleach &mdash; Tomás Meagher's great flag representing peace between the orange and the green.  It stands very suitably behind you, a Chathaoirligh.  It is an added feature to the attempt to try to make our Seanad appropriate for the debates we hope to have in the forthcoming session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my voice to those of the two previous speakers and also to congratulate you, a Chathaoirligh, for your skill in providing such comfortable surroundings for us. This is a talent of which I was unaware. I wonder whether it would be possible for you to inform the House as to who are the experts who will be involved in the advising of the restoration programme, not that I wish in any way to question their expertise but I hope that some degree of that expertise at least will be in the area of preservation and restoration of 18th century plaster work. If this is not the case, perhaps you could use your good offices to make sure that that degree of talent which does exist unquestionably in this country in this matter is tapped so that the greatest possible care can be taken to ensure that this beautiful ceiling is preserved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, I also had the reservations that each Member of this House had that the work on our Chamber had not proceeded as it should have in the previous two years.  I had these anxieties despite dealing with and talking at length with the Office of Public Works all through the summer.  I cannot name the experts now but I certainly will find out who they were and will convey that information to you and to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a firm believer that every Senator in this House should know what is going on and what I am doing as Cathaoirleach. I am inclined both here and in other places to refer to what I have done or <Col N="8" /> said, with the emphasis on the &ldquo;I&rdquo; but I have been pulled up on that.  I can recall times when I was not told here in the early seventies things which I would have liked to have known as a serving elected representative.  That is why I like to keep every Senator informed and why I try to bring reports here.  I will find out who the OPW are in consultation with and will so inform Senator Norris.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that the situation of Senator Robb has improved as a result of the intervention of the House and of the Leader of the House.  I was pleased to hear this from the Senator during the summer recess.</P>
      <P>I also wish to put on record my appreciation of your own personal commitment not alone to defending the flag, which now stands behind you, but also to defending the Members of the House and their facilities.  Throughout the summer I was aware of your dedication in trying to get on with the job which needed to be done and also to ensuring that this particular Chamber was improved.  I would suggest to all those Senators who have an interest in what is happening behind the closed doors that they go to your offices and examine for themselves those details of the work which can be found there particularly in regard to the ceiling which has evoked the interest of An Taisce and other prescribed bodies who have an interest in our heritage.  Any Senator who avails of that opportunity or who may be concerned about the competence of the Board of Works, a body to which I often paid tribute even in tougher days, will be able to see that the problem in regard to the damage to the ceiling is serious. Anyone realising the extent of the damage would be anxious that the work proceed with all possible speed and with the benefit of all the expertise available so as to ensure that the magnificent ceiling is protected and kept as intact as is physically possible.  I wish to pay a tribute to you, a Chathaoirligh, for the dedication you have shown in this regard during the summer months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with <Col N="9" /> other Senators in congratulating you on the stand you have taken in the interests of the Seanad.  I hope your efforts will eventually pay off and that all Senators will join with me in saying how gratifying it is to learn that the comments which were made here in this House towards the end of the last session had a positive bearing on Senator Robb's difficulties at that time and he should acknowledge it. Therefore, perhaps the other Members of the House will join with me in condemning the harassment by the UDR of an elected Member of the Northern Ireland Council over the past few days.  I am calling on the Minister for Foreign Affairs to raise this at the Anglo-Irish Conference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very gratified that Senator Robb's situation has been improved.  I would like it to go out that not only does Seanad Éireann have influence on the Government of this country but it obviously has influence on the Government of another country and I am very glad it happened.  I would be much more sympathetic to Senator Mooney if he had said something about the arrest and detention of a Member of this Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>While being associated with the complimentary remarks on your efforts, a Chathaoirligh, during the summer to provide better facilities for us, I would like to raise the matter of the lack of a facility which we had in the past. I would like to inquire through you why we do not have post office facilities today. It was my understanding that on a sitting day of either House the post office would be open and available to Members and anyone else who wanted to use it.  I have made two attempts to use the services of the post office today and I have failed to do so up to this hour.  It certainly was not available at 2.30 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been many tributes, endorsements, congratulations and expressions of gratification and it is time we decided to get down to the Order of Business.  Even though our physical comforts are important, the business of the House is even more important.  I would like to compliment you, a Chathaoirligh, on the work you did during the summer to ensure that we are sitting in comfort.  I am not sure what the other Members feel, but I do not think this is not a working bench.  In particular, I would like to join with Senator Robb in complimenting you on the fact that we have the national flag for the first time in the Seanad.  It is about time our flag was brought into the Seanad Chamber.</P>
      <P>Complimentary remarks have been made about the Office of Public Works. Sometimes they come in for a lot of stick in many places but I have seen the restoration work carried out by them throughout the country and there is no doubt that they have retained the services of some of the best craftsmen in wood and stone.  I have no doubt that the job that will be done on the Seanad ceiling will be an excellent one.  I have seen the work they have done in the restoration of ceilings in Butler House in Kilkenny which is the headquarters of Kilkenny Design Workshops.  The ceilings there were as important as the ceiling in the Seanad and they did an excellent job in restoring and renovating them.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to take Items Nos. 1, 2 and 3 on the Order Paper.  Item No. 1 is the order for Second Stage of the Customs and Excise (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, 1987 and it will be taken next week.  It is an important Bill and it will be circulated.  The Bill was put on the Order Paper so that Members would have a chance to read it before it comes to the Seanad.  There was pressure to have the Bill introduced and to take Second Stage today but because it is an important Bill I think it should be circulated before we discuss it.  Committee Stage of the Abattoirs Bill will be taken today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="11" /> Item No. 3 on the Order Paper is a Government motion on roads and amendments have been put down to that. We will give the Members proposing the amendments time to make their propositions but there is no objection on this side of the House to the amendments as proposed.  I do not think we should extend the debate or keep it too short because it is a motion that has connotations for us all.  If the Senators who want to speak on it keep their speeches short we can get everybody in and we will not cut them off by restricting ourselves to the actual time limit of three hours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackDaly" hpid="Mr. J. Daly Mr. J. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House about the position of the Joint Committee on Small Businesses. When the Leader announced the setting up of committees I asked him about the Joint Committee on Small Businesses and he replied that when the six committees which had been nominated were established that committee would then be appointed.  This is a very serious matter.  A committee on small businesses would deal with the practice of below cost selling which has had tragic consequences for many people.  Can the Leader of the House tell me now when he will set up that committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Daly in what he has said about the Joint Committee on Small Businesses.  I want to ask the Leader of the House when is it intended to bring before us proposals for the formation of a foreign policy committee. I know he is committed to the formation of this committee and the Seanad has already expressed the opinion that it would be desirable to have a foreign policy committee which would involve Members of the House.  I hope the Leader of the House will use his good offices with the Government to get agreement on the principle of a joint Oireachtas committee to advise on foreign policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like your guidance, a Chathaoirligh, on whether we will be <Col N="12" /> allowed time to raise the very serious issue of the strike in the Irish Sugar Company at present.  While respecting the rights of workers to go on strike I appeal to them to get back to work in the national interest because over £300 million worth of crops, our quota for future years and the jobs of workers' on the land and in the factories are at stake.  I appeal to this House for time to discuss this serious issue because it is in everybody's interest to find a solution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Leader of the House if he has given any consideration to allotting time for a debate on the Constitution.  It was raised on a number of occasions in this House during the last session and perhaps the Leader of the House would indicate if he has allotted any time in the current session for such a debate.</P>

      <P>Some motions have been on the Order Paper for two months and I would like to know if they will be dealt with during the present session and if so, when.  Most of us are members of local authorities and motions which we raise would be dealt with faster by sending them to the Minister rather than raising them here.  When will they be moved or will they be moved at all?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I also agree with Senator Doherty on that point.  Item No. 24 states &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann should not attempt to solve its present accommodation problems by encroaching on any part of the space of the National Museum&rdquo; as tabled by Senators Murphy, Ross and J. O'Toole.  In the light of your remarks at the opening of the Order of Business and added to what Senator O'Doherty has said, a number of motions seem to be irrelevant to the business, and perhaps they should be removed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to clear a point.  What you are talking about is not the responsibility of the Cathaoirleach.  I do things and get things done to protect the Seanad but the responsibility for ordering and for dealing with what you are just talking about is not the responsibility of the Chair.  I have enough on my shoulders and I am not taking any more. I want to explain this so that everybody <Col N="14" /> will be satisfied.  What I do not want &mdash; and it was happening during the last Seanad &mdash; was to come in at the commencement of the sitting of the House and reading down ten or 14 items for the Adjournment, when actually I should only be reading two and taking the first one.</P>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle in the other House and my predecessor &mdash; for whom I have the greatest respect, the former Senator Pat Joe Reynolds &mdash; took each motion as it came and gave priority to no one.  That is what I am doing now.  The only reason I referred to it again today was to bring it back to people's minds that I do not want to be reading out this long list every day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">

      <P>Senator Doherty, first of all, I resent your last implication about this House and our responsibilities. What Senator Lanigan, as Leader of the House, has discussed with you outside here is no concern of mine.  Actually, I would prefer for your own sake and for Senator Lanigan's that you did not quote it.  I am still being helpful and I will take the items as they come to me.

Could I ask the Leader of the House when he is replying to give an indication, if he has the information, as to what legislation we can <Col N="15" /> expect to come before the Seanad over the next few weeks.  I am pleased that he has alerted us to the Customs and Excise Bill which is item No. 1 on today's Order Paper.  There are also three Bills on Committee Stage remaining on the Order Paper but obviously Senators would wish to know what legislation is likely to come before this House in the next number of weeks.  Perhaps the Leader could give some indication as to the sitting pattern we will have, at least over the next four weeks.</P>

      <P>I am not too sure where I should start but I think I should start where a little bit of sense came into the debate when Senator Bulbulia asked what type of legislation we could expect before the House in the next few weeks. I can assure her that there will be quite an amount of legislation.  As I said next week we will discuss the Customs and Excise Bill.  It is hoped that there will be two pollution Bills circulated within the next couple of days and we will be ordering those Bills for the next or following week.  There is a possibility of a new insurance Bill coming in.  I do not want to say that it will be in the next fortnight, but there is an insurance Bill to come before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with some of the suggestions that have been made about companies and the problems in companies &mdash; Senator J. Daly mentioned this &mdash; it is important that we take the Companies Bill and that we get that Bill through this House as expeditiously as possible.  I do not mean we are going to try to rush it through but it is important in the national interest that that Bill should go through. It is intended that starting next week we <Col N="17" /> start Committee Stage of that Bill and at least that we will get through the first 50 sections as soon as possible.  The first 50 sections are ones that will eliminate a lot of the problems that have been experienced by people in business and outside business over the past few months.</P>
    <P>Senator Doherty asked about the relevance of some of the motions on the Order Paper.  A large number of these motions are in my name and are as a result of committee reports.  In the previous Seanad it was understood that we would take legislation on Wednesdays and reports from Committees on Thursdays.  Thankfully, since the new Government came in they have given the Seanad the opportunity to introduce legislation here in the House and because of the number of Bills that have been introduced in the House &mdash; the Opposition will have to agree that this is the case &mdash; we have not been able to get down to dealing with motions.  It is the intention of the Government that this House will be used to introduce legislation, as has been the case since they came to power.  While I can see there is a need to debate the motions, legislation is more important.  Members will agree that the more legislation that is introduced here the more relevant the House becomes.  I will make no promises on the motions.  If we reach the stage at which we do not have Government business we will take the motions on Thursdays.  If the House feels there is a need to sit three days in order to clear some of the motions on the Order Paper the Whips can discuss that matter when hopefully we can accommodate everybody.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly mentioned that I promised I would set up a small businesses committee.  I am afraid Senator Daly's memory must be a little inaccurate in the sense that I cannot promise to set up any committee.  We can set up a committee of the House on small businesses.  I think what the Senator is talking about is a joint committee on small businesses.  It is up to the Government to set up that type of committee.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris also mentioned the need for the establishment of a foreign policy <Col N="18" /> committee.  The Government have been alerted to the fact that quite a number of people are interested in the establishment of both a small businesses and a foreign policy committee.  I will report the expression of interest from this House on the establishment of these committees. I am not saying we will be successful. However, the Government have stated that committees will be set up, as needed, and that no committee established in the past will remain solely on that account. Committees can be set up to deal with specific problems obtaining.  That is the best way to go about the matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Seán Byrne mentioned the Irish Sugar Company.  All Members would agree with the sentiments expressed by him.  It is something that the Government are taking into account. His sentiments will be reported to the Government.  I hope all parties will take what he said into account.</P>
    <P>On the allocation of time to be devoted to the Constitution mentioned by Senator Hogan, I am afraid that at this stage no time has been so allocated.  That wish was expressed at the Magill summer school in County Donegal.  I have read the only book I could find written by Patrick Magill, entitled <i>Moleskin Joe.</i>  I do not think Patrick Magill would have any great interest in the Constitution.  Rather he was more interested in obtaining a bit of bread in the morning and a drop of tea in the evening.</P>

      <P>Senator Connor mentioned the Committee on Co-operation with Developing Countries.  Because that committee was not re-established people are inclined to think we are not co-operating as much with developing countries.  This is not true.  Senator Connor's wish to have that committee reinstated will be reported to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="19" /> I do not think any Member of the House would disagree with Senator Cassidy's sentiments about bank charges, inflation and so on.  There is concern about banking operations in the country. If Senator Cassidy puts down a motion I am sure the House will debate it in due course.</P>
    <P>While the position regarding the post office mentioned by Senator McMahon might not appear to be of any great consequence I should say that were it not for the fact that the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges did not agree with the Dáil Committee on Procedure and Privileges, the post office in Leinster House would now be closed.  Thanks to the work of the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges the post office will remain open.</P>
    <P>I am glad the remarks made in the House were beneficial to Senator Robb's work schedule.  I am delighted to see him back here.  I know it is his wish to serve his community as a highly professional doctor in his hospital.  Equally he feels he has something to offer all of the people of Ireland through his attendance here.  I am glad there has been an endorsement of the wishes of the Members of the Seanad that he be so accommodated.</P>
    <P>I do not want to prolong my remarks but I should say we appreciate the work of the staff of the House although we do not often express it to them.  Senator O'Toole mentioned the wish of the House to have matters of importance discussed. There is a procedure under Standing Order No. 29 of the Seanad which allows Members to raise matters of urgent public interest.  In that way we may be able to discuss urgent matters of public interest in the House.</P>

This is in respect of animals which are allowed to be slaughtered for human consumption in a place situated on a farm.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>On the same section and on the point raised by Senator Mullooly, on Second Stage I asked the Minister to explain further the definition of the word &ldquo;animal&rdquo; because on page 6, section 2 (1)  (b)  &ldquo;animal&rdquo; means cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, horses and all other equine animals.  There are other animals which are disposed of at butchers shops for human consumption and they are not in the bovine, ovine, porcine or equine species.  I am worried that the definition <Col N="22" /> is so tight that it might not be possible for a butcher who would have a demand for other animals, game in particular, which are not defined in this section, to be precluded from selling them under this section.  As the Cathaoirleach is aware and as I hope the Minister of State is aware also, there are certain parts of the country in which there are demands for animals to be sold, butchered and offered for public sale apart from those defined in this section.  Perhaps the Minister in his reply would confirm that the animals I have mentioned are not specifically precluded because there is a growing demand for other animals in certain parts of the country.</P>

There is concern that the proper hygiene is not adhered to when killing an animal on a farm.  It is in the interest of the farmer and his family that this concern is expressed &mdash; to ensure that they would not be subjected to any lack of hygiene <i>vis-á-vis</i> those who would be buying meat over the counter.  I appeal to the Minister to take the necessary steps, under section 2, to ensure that if animals are killed by a farmer a health stamp is provided on the meat for the benefit of the farmer and his family.</P>

The day has long gone &mdash; this Bill will take it further down the road &mdash; when people killed animals in their own backyards for their own consumption and without any proper facilities. Most modern day farmers and anybody using the meat for their own consumption would welcome the animal being killed by a competent butcher.  I welcome the section where provision is made to ensure that all animals for consumption are killed in a properly supervised abattoir that has been licensed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this section is to allow traditional slaughtering of an animal for consumption on premises, or on the farm or in the place where the animal is held. There is a home slaughtering concession provided for in the definition of abattoir. Traders in discussions with the officials in the Department of Agriculture expressed their concern that there could be abuse of this facility.  While traders were anxious for the total abolition of this concession I would not go that far because suitable modification of the concession confining it to the slaughtering of a pig or an animal injured by accident where slaughter is necessary to prevent suffering would best meet the case of all concerned.  I propose at Report Stage to introduce an appropriate amendment.  I do not want to see any large scale slaughtering at home.</P>
      <P>More and more people are going to their local abattoir or their local butcher to have slaughtered an animal for household consumption and to have it suitably packaged for deep freezers and so on. It is not a very widely used occupation nowadays but nevertheless there are isolated areas where an individual might want &mdash; and tradition may take a hand there from time to time &mdash; to reduce suffering.  I would not like to prohibit that completely and so I propose at Report Stage to introduce an appropriate amendment.</P>
      <P>In relation to what Senator Ferris said regarding game animals, they are covered by hygiene regulations and butchers would not be precluded from selling them.  Such animals are dealt with in an abattoir and section 39 (3) of this Bill will cover them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his commitment on Report Stage to suitably tidy up this section which would be a reflection of the views of the Members on all sides of the House.  We do not want to preclude people from having the facilities on the occasional situation, particularly for private purposes, but we do not want it to be so loose that the <Col N="24" /> overall thrust of the Bill and our concern for the consumer as expressed by Senator Hogan, would be lost sight of.  If there is a standard to be achieved by anybody slaughtering animals for anybody's use, in the interests of public hygiene everybody who kills an animal in that way should be subject to the same type of regulations.  There are exceptions and the humanitarian exception is important.  On section 42 on which I have put down a suitable amendment I will deal with this further.  It tightens it up and still requires the authorisation or approval of the inspecting veterinary surgeon to be also responsible to private killing.  This would eliminate an abuse of the section.</P>

      <P>I am not convinced by the Minister's assurance about the slaughter of animals on the farm.  The Minister was the first person to refer to abuse.  It is all right to say you would allow a man to kill a pig because it was traditional in some places to kill a pig twice a year but that tradition has gone now nearly everywhere, as we all recognise. When somebody wants to kill a lamb, a heifer or any other animal for a deep freeze he employs the local butcher. It is more to do with packaging than killing.  How will we be assured, if this section goes through as it is, that the law will not be abused?  If you allow a man to kill one animal for consumption on the farm without having regulations about stamping and so on, what is to stop him from killing two or three animals and giving them to his neighbours and what is to stop his neighbour from giving them <Col N="25" /> to somebody else?  The proposed legislation is pretty loose and should be tightened up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it would help at this stage if the Minister would indicate the type of amendment he intends to bring forward on Report Stage.  The fundamental weakness in this section of the Bill is that it allows farmers to kill animals for home use.  The fear is very real among consumers and among people involved in the industry that this leaves the toe in the door and could lead to widespread abuse. I understand the arguments along humanitarian lines which the Minister has advanced and I do not quarrel with them. It would be a great pity to see an animal left in pain for a great period of time if it was not possible to arrange for the speedy killing of such an animal.  It is very important that we should have strict and rigid controls and that the consumer could be perfectly satisfied about the bona fides of all meat on sale.  It would be a pity if excellent and welcome and long awaited legislation were to be left with what is an obvious area of weakness.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could allay the fears expressed by Senators from all sides of the House and indicate the sort of amendment which he intends to bring forward on Report Stage.  I welcome the Minister's open-minded approach to this legislation.  I am very pleased that he has had such extensive consultation with all the interests who are obviously concerned about this legislation and, in keeping with that spirit, perhaps he would give us the indication which I request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased that the trade have been so positive about this legislation and have called to the Department regularly to discuss it in a very positive way.  They put great pressure on me to expedite this legislation and to get it through because, of course, people in the trade are generally traditional people and are very proud of their profession and the job they do.  The fact that there are some operators in the business bringing it into disrepute is of no advantage to anybody.  I pay tribute to <Col N="26" /> the people in the trade who were so generous in their attitude to the legislation.</P>
      <P>The whole idea of this section is to facilitate the occasional killing of an animal in a remote area or perhaps on an island off the coast.  Certainly from my own knowledge I do not think this activity is by any means widespread.  It could not be carried out to any great extent.  I propose to introduce an amendment on Report Stage allowing the farmer to slaughter a pig or an animal injured by accident, where slaughter is necessary to prevent suffering.  That will tighten the controls.  I do not envisage any widespread use of this activity.  Certainly the meat concerned is for household consumption rather than for retail outlets because under this Bill meat which is made retail outlets will have to be stamped.</P>
      <P>Concern has been shown by the trade and by individuals in remote areas who traditionally have been killing animals for household use and this legislation will allow them to carry on that tradition.  If any abuse occurs I will, by order, disallow the activity but I do not think that will be necessary.  The controls will be tightened up sufficiently to allay any fears which anybody might have in this regard.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not answer the question raised by Senator Ferris.  I presume he was talking about the slaughter of deer.

      <P>As I understand it food and hygiene are covered by separate legislation.  I want the Minister to define the word &ldquo;animal&rdquo;.  I did not wish that a butcher would not be able to sell this meat, but he can do so under other legislation.</P>
      <P>This is a section dealing with interpretations and definitions.  I want to check with the Minister on the definition of the word &ldquo;knackery&rdquo; which is included in the interpretation section.  It states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;knackery&rdquo; means any premises used for and in connection with the collection, delivery, supply, slaughter, storage, skinning or cutting up of animals or parts of animals which are not intended for human consumption, and &ldquo;knackery&rdquo; shall include any premises which are used&mdash; (a) as a knacker's yard, or (b) for the cutting up of dead animals, or parts of dead animals, for sale as dog or pet food.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister explain the difference between a knackery and an abattoir? There are people who will use abattoirs and will also want to use some of the products of an abattoir for sale not for human consumption but as pet food or other such foods for which there could be a demand in a particular area.</P>
      <P>I am not suggesting that all butchers would be in a position to provide certain foods that could be prepared as dog food. I hope the Minister for Industry and Commerce does not think I am trying to disturb his particular bailiwick because I am not.  Congratulations to him and his family on producing a firm that makes dog food.  Demands are made on local butchers in some areas for cuts and pieces of meat which are specifically for animal use and not human use.  Perhaps the Minister would redefine the word &ldquo;knackery&rdquo; in that context.</P>

      <P>The main point in the definition of &ldquo;knackery&rdquo; is that a knackery is a premises which handles animals or meat not intended for human consumption. By way of inserting this in the Bill the provisions in relation to knackeries are contained separately in the Abattoirs Bill, Part III.  Arising from a 1982 survey of abattoirs and knackeries conducted by the Department of Agriculture and Food the premises listed at (a) to (b) of this definition were found to be the main types of plants engaged in the handling of dead or casualty animals. Meat and bonemeal and rendering plants are also, of course, heavily involved in the handling of animal waste.  They are not, however, being included in this definition as they will be the subject of a separate statutory provision in a Processed Protein Order to be made under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966.  This Order will embrace such matters as the transport, reception, handling, processing and storage of animal waste. These processing plants are, at any rate, a step up from the common knackery and the controls in this Bill alone would not adequately cover their operations.  Similarly, registered swill premises are being excluded from this definition so as to avoid duplicate sets of controls.  A survey conducted by the Department in 1982 indicated that there were 112 knackeries in existence.  The main definition of a knackery is that it is a premises which handles animals or meat not intended for human consumption.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his clarification of that point but can he give me the opposite side of the story?  Is an abattoir which is registered for the killing of meat intended for human consumption not precluded from producing meat which finally might find its way into a preparation for dog food?  Is there anything to preclude a butcher from deciding that particular cuts of meat which was perfectly killed, bled, hung and so on are more suitable for a client who would require it for dog food or otherwise?  Is there anything in that definition that would preclude him from doing that? <Col N="29" /> Some butchers have a sizeable trade in that kind of food outlet for pet owners which would not be intended as the meat would come through an abattoir.  I want to be quite clear that nothing in that definition would preclude meat which has come through the process as eligible for human consumption being used by the butcher for dog food.  This is legislation and I want to see that it is done properly.</P>

      <P>I can imagine what Senator Ferris has in mind.  If a portion of an animal which is killed in an abbatoir is condemned by a veterinary inspection later, then no doubt that portion of meat in another process would be known as offal and would go to a knackery and be used as pet food.  That might be what Senator Ferris has in mind.  That can and will arise if inspection of meat is to be carried out by a veterinary surgeon.  Portions of meat will be found to be not fit for human consumption because of laceration or otherwise of the animal prior to killing.  It may have a blood tinge through it that would not be presentable for people.  I see no regulation in the Bill to prevent that from happening.  I am not pre-empting the Minister.</P>

      <P>The section does not exclude public abattoirs.  It refers to existing abattoirs.

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="31" /> In page 10, lines 11 and 12, to delete subsection (6) and substitute&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(6) The amount of the appropriate fee shall vary each year in accordance with the percentage increase or decrease, as the case may be, of the Consumer Price Index for that year&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We have had discussions with people involved in the trade and with people generally in the agricultural sector and they were anxious that this type of amendment would be put into legislation. In the past the experience of most people with Governments of all shades was that when a Minister for Finance was in difficulty he usually looked at the most likely area of income, usually related to the doubling of levies or the increasing of fees.</P>
    <P>The trade, who are so co-operative with us in this area of legislation, are anxious that by amending it in this way we provide that the appropriate fee would vary each year in accordance with the percentage increase or decrease.  The Minister and his Government are promising every day that the cost of living will go down and that the consumer price index will reduce, and they are basing all their philosophy on that.  On that understanding I hope that these fees can be reduced.  However, I am more anxious that they be not increased over and beyond the normal accepted CPI for any year.  The reason that other amendments are bulked with this one, particularly amendment No. 13, is that they are consequential on this one, and I hope that the Minister will concede this in other sections.</P>
    <P>Our experience with all Ministers has been that it is easy with the stroke of a pin to double levies.  Levies have been doubled.  The farming organisations complain that their disease eradication levies have been doubled, often without consultation. While we have the opportunity to debate them in the House when a regulation is made, it is presumed that if the Government have sufficient votes in either of the Houses they can decide to double levies for any reason.  That is why <Col N="32" /> I am anxious that in legislation we should put some limit on what powers the Minister might take unto himself by way of regulation, to increase fees.</P>
    <P>It is not unreasonable to have it indexed linked.  I put down the amendment in the hope that the Minister would understand the concern of people in the trade that they could find themselves agreeing this year to a level of fees agreed in consultation with them but that next year or the year after it could be doubled and so put smaller butchers in rural towns out of business, irrespective of the fact that the Minister might come back, by way of regulation, before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The trade accept that to have the Bill up and running and to allow councils to employ veterinary surgeons and inspectors, some income is necessary. This acceptance is based on the premise that if requirements are pitched at a certain level, generally speaking, that level would be contained.  I am concerned that we legislate for this philosophy of trying to pin things down to a consumer price index.  In view of Government commitments in this area the Minister should not have any problem whatsoever in conceding what is an amendment in principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Ferris in this amendment.  The first amendment deals with the licensing of abattoirs.  The licensing of the 800 or so private abattoirs in the country, it is estimated, will bring in about £40,000.  We do not quibble with that.  Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 refer to section 44 of the Bill which relates to the veterinary fees.  The Minister stated on Second Stage that the amount of money generated under these headings, that is, the collection of slaughter fees from the farmers, was estimated at £1.4 million annually.  I expressed misgivings on Second Stage as to whether that £1.4 million would be adequate to finance the inspections as laid down by the Minister, because the new level of inspection is far more intensive and involves far more working hours in terms of professionals and back up services than applied heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="33" /> It is estimated that it will take £600,000 to pay the salaries of 26 or 27 local authority veterinary inspectors.  In addition, all these veterinary inspectors will have a corps of veterinary surgeons working with them carrying out the inspections. We find that about £0.8 million is allocated towards that.  That amount cannot pay the corps of veterinary inspectors needed, about 150 throughout the whole country.  It is costing at least that amount of money to pay the corps of veterinary surgeons who operate for the local authorities under the present regulations. Under this legislation we are creating a new post and we are expanding the role of the corps of veterinary inspectors, those veterinarians who will go to the abattoirs and carry out the ante-mortem inspections and post-mortem inspections. Ante-mortem and post-mortem inspections were no part of the requirement under existing legislation as operated by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Our fear is that the Minister will find that in the first year of its operation the expense will burgeon out of all proportion, in terms of what he has laid down here, and he will have to come back to the Houses of the Oireachtas to increase these fees quite drastically.  These fees will bear very heavily on the people in the meat trade and on the farmers.  At the moment farmers are paying two-thirds of the cost of disease eradication.  Disease levies are yielding about £20 million and the annual expenditure on disease eradication here is about £30 million.  While there is a good deal of public comment about the cost of these schemes, it is often overlooked that farmers nowadays are bearing the greater part of the cost.  Our party will support Senator Ferris' amendment because we have the misgiving that the amount of money the Minister specifies in this Bill to finance this is totally inadequate.  There will be no way out other than for those fees to be greatly increased in the very near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments seek to vary the level of veterinary inspection fees each year in accordance with the consumer price index.  The fees are <Col N="34" /> intended to provide a self-financing basis for the departmental and local authority veterinary service to be provided and it will be determined solely on that basis. The veterinary inspection fees are the same as those currently applicable at the export plants.  The export plant fees are not linked to the consumer price index and were last increased in January 1984. Separately linking the fees for domestic abattoirs to the consumer price index, as suggested, would give rise to an anomalous situation between the home and export sectors and more particularly, the cost factor would be lost sight of in that the actual cost of inspection would not be taken into account and there would be an annual increase irrespective of the cost.</P>
      <P>In 1985, the Government in giving their approval for the drafting of this Bill stipulated that this measure should be self-financing.  The main costs arising under the Bill will be the funding of an additional corps of full time veterinary inspectors to be employed by local authorities. Their employment is provided for under Section 35.  The most economic and simplest way of covering this cost is to provide for a veterinary inspection fee to be charged on each animal slaughtered. This is the system in operation at the meat export plants where this Department provide the veterinary supervision. The system has now been adopted for the home trade under this section with the same scale of fees applying to the home and the export plants.  A similar scale of fees for both the home and the export sector will ensure no distortion in supplies and price, particularly in the case of pigs. The estimated revenue to accrue to local authorities from these fees is £1.4 million annually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the estimated additional cost of employing full time veterinary staff in the 23 areas now without such staff is £0.6 million annually, the balance in receipts of £0.8 million will enable local authorities to provide such back-up services as are necessary, as well as covering the remuneration of the corps of part time veterinary inspectors employed in the local authority veterinary services.  The <Col N="35" /> cost of the latter is estimated at £0.4 million per annum.  While overall, the proposals in the Bill will be self-financing, there are nine areas, Cavan, Laois, Leitrim, Longford, Monaghan, Offaly, Roscommon, North Tipperary and Waterford County where revenue from veterinary inspection fees will be insufficient to finance full time staff.  It is anticipated that suitable combinations of areas can be made to finance the cost of full time staff from the aggregrate revenue on inspection fees in these areas.  In this connection, section 35 of the Bill allows for such combinations.</P>
    <P>A small number of local authorities, Dublin, Cork and Waterford, currently charge veterinary inspection fees on slaughterings under the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1983.  I oppose the amendments concerned. They are not relative to the costs involved.  Under the legislation, if there is an application for an increase, the application would come before both Houses of the Oireachtas and would have to be debated and passed by the Oireachtas.  There will be sufficient safeguard for any major increases of any kind.  In fact that situation is adequately covered.  Rather than having annual increases I would hope that there would be no increase for a considerable length of time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill provides that the scheme be self-financing.  According to the information I have, the same level of fee applies to the export meat factories and that sector is not expected to be self-financing.  According to figures at the Minister's Department, as I understand it, they only pay about 70 per cent of the total cost of the veterinary examinations of animals in meat factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not a like with like comparison between what takes place in a meat factory and what would take place in an ordinary butcher's abattoir because it is bound to be much more costly to carry out the inspection in a whole series of butchers' abattoirs as against in a meat <Col N="36" /> factory where one has the long runs and the economies of scale, where vets are there over a single day to inspect four, five or six hundred slaughtered animals. To translate that number of animals into the ordinary family or high street butcher's abattoir, to inspect the slaughter of 500 or 600 animals, one would need many more veterinarians because of the scattered locations and it would mean also many more man hours of work. Consequently, the costs of this kind of inspection have to be much greater than would apply in a meat factory.  It is from this that our fears arise.  We feel that the amount of money that has been allocated in this regard is totally inadequate but since the Minister feels it is adequate, we are entitled to ask that he so amend the Bill to provide that any increase in the future would be linked to the consumer price index.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>First, we want it to be absolutely clear to the Minister that all of us, those of us who are legislators and those in the trade, accept the principle of self financing to improve the standard and reputation of our products at butcher level.  In other words, the trade is prepared to pay by way of levies and fees for the implementation of the scheme. Rarely in the history of this State have a particular sector openly come forward and accepted that principle of self financing. The Minister has at his disposal the figures to show the amount of fees required to give that service.  He has confirmed that there are 23 local authority areas which with full time veterinary inspectors will require an input of £0.6 million.  We all know that it is imperative to have back-up services available as well because it will not be physically possible for one veterinary inspector in any one county to be able to give the kind of service that the trade will need.  Back-up services will be required.  The Minister and his Department have also costed what they anticipate that fee will be, that is, £0.8 million.  That is a total of £1.4 million.  All those figures, including the cost of veterinary surgeons and the cost of back-up services, will be index-linked <Col N="37" /> in that they will not be allowed, by Government policy on pay and otherwise, to exceed the cost of living or the consumer price index.  Because of the points made by Senator Connors and our experience in other areas, we are worried that fees might be doubled, not as a source of funding under this particular legislation but as an easy way to improve the coffers of the State because the legislation allows it to be done.  That is our only worry.  Our experience with the last Government and with this Government has been that levies for disease eradication were just arbitrarily doubled despite political promises to halve them. The man who pays all that at the end of the day is the farmer.  In accepting the Minister's figures the trade are prepared to put in this money to ensure that it is self financing but we want to make sure that that would be increased in the future in line with the consumer price-index.  I accept that in three or four years' time it may be necessary to actually double the amount of permanent staff involved and then certainly the Minister would require to come back to the House with a new regulation giving the reason for increasing the levels above and beyond the consumer price-index, whether it is based on increased demand or the fact that the existing services as the Minister projected would not be capable of giving the kind of coverage, service and inspection that we want and that the trade wants.  It is in that context that we are anxious to pin this one down.  We are accepting the figures the Minister produced in the beginning. The trade are accepting them too. We are accepting that the only reasons they could be increased at all would be because of increased wage demands.  We cannot just leave it wide open as a Government could, for the purposes of increasing their own overall tax take, use this section of the Bill, as they have used other levies, as a source of funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I agree with Senator Connor that in the other area of inspection the Minister has always, both in this House and in the Dáil, assured the farming organisations that the amount of levies were never sufficient to cover the actual <Col N="38" /> cost of veterinary inspection at the factory. One section is being subsidised but the Minister is expecting the private sector here, the smaller butchers, to be responsible for their own funding.  They have accepted that principle but we want to pin it down so that in future this section will not be abused.  I am sure the Minister will not abuse it but we are anxious to pin it down.  If the Minister wants to go over and beyond that for a specific purpose he is welcome to come back into the House and we will discuss it.</P>

      <P>My concern is with those abattoirs which are not involved in the meat export business.  Those factories which market their meat abroad come under very strict inspection and as a result the standard of hygiene is very high.  It seems that the standard of the non-exporting companies &mdash; these would include the small local licence holder &mdash; is much lower.  These so-called abattoirs are not subject to the same rules of inspection as those exporting their meat.  Some do not even meet the basic standards of hygiene and I know that some do not even have hot water which means that they cannot sterilise their equipment.  As for disposing of the offal, in some cases this is at times dumped on the beach and left for the sea to carry away.  I would be very concerned at the health hazard in these establishments. Indeed, were it not for the fact that many Irish people like crispy rashers, many of us would be suffering from a dose of tape worm.  If we were to compare the standards of the exporting meat factories with some of these local establishments, one could get the impression that as long as we keep the foreigners healthy, it is quite acceptable to poison the nation.</P>

      <P>I am well aware of the concern of Senators Ferris and Connor in connection with the levies charged but there is very little between what they are saying.  Senator Connor is worried that sufficient moneys are not made available in the levies that are being provided for in this Bill to cover the implementation of it.  Before the Bill was drafted I am sure some guidelines were issued and I have no doubt that regulations relating to the export trade were the first to be considered.</P>
      <P>In my view the levies mentioned in the Bill are no more than estimates.  The provisions of the Bill will have their teething problems and there is no doubt that it will be necessary to review the matter within a year and consider the amount of money required.  It is suggested in the amendment that the levies should be index linked but we must remember that the consumer price index may drop or escalate in the coming year.  Therefore, the Department have no way of ensuring that they will have sufficient money to implement this scheme.  The only way to ensure that sufficient money will be available is to use the levy that applies to the export trade as a guideline.  When we see how much money is recouped after one or two years we will know by how much we should increase or decrease the levy.  As matters stand we have to accept that the levy will be increased in the future.  I agree with Senator Connor that this scheme will cost more to implement than the export scheme because of the need for inspections throughout the country.  Until the Bill has been in operation for some time we will not be in position to assess the cost.  There is very little between what is proposed in the Bill and what is suggested in the amendment and in view of that I appeal to Senator Ferris to withdraw his amendment.  In my view it is not fair to link a levy to the consumer price index.  In the final analysis money must be made available to implement the provisions of the Bill whether through levies or subsidisation by the Department.</P>

The officials in the Department must have done their sums when preparing the legislation and had a fair idea of the amount that will be collected.  It is proposed that the scheme will be self-financing but if the levy is to be index linked there is no guarantee that there will be sufficient funds at the end of the day to implement its provisions.  It is important that the Minister be given power to increase the levy by way of regulation if he finds that the scheme is not self-financing.  We should wait some time to see how the scheme is operating and if it is found that sufficient money is not being raised the Minister can increase the levy as he sees fit.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment. I was interested to hear Senator O'Toole say that there was nothing much between the amendment and the provision in the Bill.  I cannot agree with that.  There may be a lot of pounds, shillings and pence between what is suggested in the amendment and what is in the Bill.  The people who have to bear the brunt of that phenomenon in Irish life, the creeping levy, will be directly affected by this estimated expenditure. In my view it is more a guesstimate than an estimate.  The consumption of meat is dropping and it is extremely difficult for those engaged in the trade to make a reasonable livelihood.  While we recognise that this scheme must be self-financing the new levy amounts to a further charge which will make it all the more difficult to run a profitable business.  The Minister should give some guarantees, such as those suggested in the amendment, to those who are prepared to cooperate in the implementation of the provisions of the Bill.  I firmly support the amendment.</P>

We must remember that farm organisations <Col N="41" /> tried to link the emotive farm tax to the consumer price index and that eventually, they achieved their aim.  That amounted to a precedent in regard to levies. Senator Hussey, a former Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, gave the best reason why the Minister should agree with the amendment before us, that the officials of the Department had costed the scheme.  If those officials are happy with the costings there should be no problem in linking the levy to the CPI, unless those officials have plans to breach Government guidelines on pay. We must accept that the figures contained in the explanatory memorandum were arrived at following an investigation of the level of activity in the trade.

They are concerned about the ability of Ministers to impose a dramatic increase in levies for any reason.  The attitude of those involved in the meat trade to the Bill has been responsible.  They have indicated that they are willing to operate its provisions and will co-operate in any effort to eliminate any problems that exist.  However, they are concerned about the levy and, as they have been fair in their reaction to the Bill, we owe it to them to consider their views.</P>

      <P>I appeal to the Minister to be as fair as possible to those involved in the meat trade.  Most of the concerns are owned by families who have given a great service down the years.  The people involved are responsible and I would not like to see any of them put under pressure by the imposition of levies.  We have sad memories of other levies.  VAT, which was introduced in the early sixties, has got out of control.  Those involved in the meat trade are not like some of the super stores that disappear overnight and leave a lot of blood in their trail.  They are all very responsible people and respected in their various areas.  I appeal to the <Col N="42" /> Minister to be as flexible as possible because, as previous speakers have said in connection with the various levies on farming, they have snowballed in the past.  I would not like to add any further burden onto those people.  As I said, they work long hours and they are well known by their customers to be very responsible people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one other fear.  In a statement last week by the leader of the largest farming organisation in the country he said that his organisation would be in favour of the complete abolition of all disease levies and that farmers themselves would pay for at least one round of testing each year.  As spokes-person for my party in this House, I could not agree with that because of the impact it would have on small farmers.  Obviously, it is a very attractive proposal to a Government very badly stuck for cash.  It is a sign of the times we live in.  I would like the Minister to comment on the proposal that, if the Government were to take up this suggestion of the farming organisation that there should be an abolition of all of these fees &mdash; and as I said, that would be very attractive to the Government &mdash; it would be passed over to the farmers.  Certainly it would be very attractive to small farmers, but what guarantees have we, if that were to take place, that these fees proposed in this Bill would be abolished?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The fundamental theme of this Bill is to establish confidence and introduce a new set of regulations to make sure that the home market is on a par with the available export market.  For long enough there were two standards, one for export and anything would do for the home market.  I am glad all concerned with this legislation, for example, the trade, were most responsible in their consultation with the Department, as also were the consumers, the farmers and everybody else.  The legislators here generally welcomed it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The upgrading of standards requires monitoring by veterinary inspectors and that costs money.  In preparation for this <Col N="43" /> legislation, the Department carried out a surveying exercise last year on the estimated costs of this legislation.  It was found that the rates which are applicable would be adequate.  I have outlined the amounts to be brought in annually under this and the annual costs as well.  As Senator O'Toole said, we will not know the detailed costs until the legislation is in operation for some time because it is new legislation.</P>
    <P>For the reasons I instanced in my earlier reply to Senator Ferris' proposed amendments to these sections, I cannot agree with the request for a linkage of fees to the consumer price index.  As I said, it is arbitrary and it bears no relation to the costs.  At any rate, any proposal for an increase would have to come back into this House and into the Dáil and I am sure that the trade, who at all times have been facilitated in their consultations with us, when their request for an increase comes before the Seanad and the Dáil again, will make their views known in relation to it.  The legislation requires that it be self-financing and that is what it sets out to do.  If we want requires that it be self-financing and that is what it sets out to do.  If we want it done properly, we will have to have adequate fees.  There is no question of making money out of this legislation.  It is so important that we monitor the whole operation properly and a requirement that an increase in fees should be brought before both Houses should be adequate. For that reason, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not disagree with the Minister's preamble to his reply.  I think he would agree that the contributions made by Senator Hussey and Senator O'Toole, if anything, are proof positive of the absolute requirement that there should be some stop put on future Governments or future Ministers using this legislation.  There is no way any of us can visualise what future demands might be made on the trade in this area.  I have to congratulate my colleague from South Tipperary, Senator Seán Byrne, who is a farmer and knows exactly what this means.  We know from our experience, <Col N="44" /> working together on opposite sides of the fence but at least working in the same interests, that there is a dread in people's minds about the words &ldquo;levy&rdquo; and &ldquo;fee&rdquo; because they have been used by Governments to get in additional funding.</P>
      <P>Nobody from either side of this House would deny the Minister's need to have the power to get additional funding if that is required in the future.  As a compromise, I suggest that he should put down an amendment of his own on Report Stage that if, through some unforeseen circumstance additional funds are required in an administrative capacity which his Department and himself and the trade do not now foresee, that should be facilitated.  We could have a debate at that level if in the future additional demands arose that we know nothing about now.  I think the people in the trade would accept that, too.  We are talking here about what is included in the legislation now and the level of fees that have been set, based on an examination done by the Minister and his Department over the past 12 months and, indeed, by the previous Government and by interdepartmental groups with which I worked in preparing this legislation.  We put up what we considered were reasonable figures, based on what we thought the need was.</P>
      <P>In fairness, I cannot withdraw the amendment on principle.  I ask the Minister to concede it and to consider putting in a suitable amendment on Report Stage to protect his own interests in the long term.  That could then give him the facility to bring a regulation before this House for a special reason, which we do often.  We did so under all sorts of legislation dealing with the State sector and the semi-State sector, bringing in resolutions requiring additional capital to be put in.  Generally speaking, the Minister would have had support in this House for increasing certain figures that were included in legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not taking any powers from the Minister but we are putting down the amendments as a matter of principle so that he will realise that these headings <Col N="45" /> alone should be index-linked to something. We could think of no fairer linkage than with the consumer price index because that is the only index that could create an additional demand in these three fee headings that are mentioned in my amendments.  We are asking the Minister to accept these amendments or put in an amendment of his own on Report Stage to give himself the other overriding power.  However, it would need then to be substantiated by a genuine reason.  If for some reason outside his control or his knowledge he might have to have twice as many permanent veterinary surgeons, we would have to look at the matter.  He is basing it now on the required amount with the back-up service and we feel that he has researched it well and that the figures are as close as possible to what he might need and the trade have gone along with him.</P>
    <P>Our experience in this area is that if you do not put a lid on it, Governments can ignore the overall consequences of what they are doing and, as Senator Byrne has said, enough people have gone out of business.  We certainly do not want to put the small butchers in every town and village in Ireland out of business. They would feel they would have no control over these fees or licence charges or whatever in the future.  We do not want to be calling divisions on this Bill because it is a non-political Bill.  It is a non-contentious Bill, in a way, and we want it to be as applicable as possible to the sector that will operate it on the ground.  If the Government do not have co-operation, they can legislate until kingdom come to no avail.  Now that we have the trade on our side, let us be reasonable with them. If the Minister concedes this amendment, he will have gone a long way towards getting the confidence of the trade that has been so supportive of what he is trying to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be repetitive but, like my colleague, Senator Ferris, I appeal to the Minister to see the arguments that we are making.  I tried to point out that this Bill requires that the fees collected be enough to finance the <Col N="46" /> working of the Bill.  The fees collected in factories carry no such requirement.  As I pointed out, 70 per cent of the cost of inspections at factories is funded from the fees collected at factories where it is economical to do so.  We are moving into an area where it is much less economical to do so and obviously these fees, the same as those which apply in a factory, cannot carry the full economic cost of these inspections.</P>
      <P>Our party do not quibble or disagree with the amount of money that it would take to pay the salaries of 23 additional veterinary inspectors, £0.6 million, but one area where the cost will burgeon out of control is the corps of veterinary inspectors who will have to assist the county veterinary inspectors.  At present with much less work to do, it costs the local authorities almost that amount of money to pay them.  You are going to double, treble and probably quadruple their workload and their travelling but you have not provided an adequate amount of money.  We must try to defend the people in the trade and the farmers who are quite prepared to have the additional bill passed on to them when the total cost of that aspect of the Bill is fully realised.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the case made for the amendment it is clear that there is complete acceptance of the fees laid down in the Bill by the people on the other side of the House. Everyone in this House accepts the fees as laid down.  The only issue which divides the House is that if this Bill is to be implemented sufficient moneys must be provided to do so.  The Bill seeks to give the Minister power to introduce regulations in both Houses of the Oireachtas to do that if necessary.  Linking it to the price index, as has been suggested in the amendment, may not be sufficient.  What you are saying is that you agree with the Bill, but if a sufficient amount of money is not provided you want it linked to the price index so that it cannot be implemented.  That is the difference between what you propose in your amendment and what is proposed in the <Col N="47" /> Bill.  I ask the proposers of the amendment to withdraw it at this stage because of the very small difference between it and the Bill.  What you are saying is that you accept the Bill and the fees contained in it but that you only want them increased from here on in according to the price index at the time.  That may not be sufficient to finance the implementation of the Bill.  Therefore you are preventing the implementation of the Bill by pursuing the amendment and I ask you to withdraw it because the Bill cannot be implemented if it is linked to the price index.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the Bill cannot be implemented.  We are accepting the figures which have been presented by the Minister and the Department as being the moneys required to implement the Bill and to provide the service.  To ensure that the service can be continued at the same level in the future we are asking for the fees to be index linked.  We are proposing that the Minister increases the fees having regard to the cost of living and consumer price index and to every other norm used by every other sector, particularly the sections that are most likely to cause an increase in the administrative costs.  So far from inserting an amendment that will make the future operation of the Bill impossible we are inserting an amendment that will ensure its efficient operation.  We are trying to protect the legislation and we do not want to leave it open to any Minister to bring in a regulation that will double the fees next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to remove any powers from the Minister.  If the Minister can come back with a good case and a proper amendment which will allow him in certain circumstances to make certain increases &mdash; which could only come about if he has not researched his original demands properly &mdash; we are prepared to listen to it.  The Minister can protect himself by tabling a Report Stage amendment. The principle of licence fees is included in this amendment and that is a good thing.  It would be most reassuring <Col N="48" /> for people in the country, for farmers and everybody else, if for the first time fees were linked to the cost of living and consumer price index.  If this had been done before we went into a budget deficit we would not have the problems we have today.  The different sectors tended to forget the consumer price index in the demands they made.  We are all guilty. There was a lack of regard for the overall good of a nation, for Ireland Limited. The sky was the limit for many people in their demands and in the concessions which were given to them.  Here is one way of ensuring that in the future some regard will be shown.  I cannot withdraw the amendment.  I hope the Minister will accept it in the spirit in which it is suggested and that our colleagues on the other side will support it in the same spirit.</P>

      <P>We all realise that this legislation is very important and urgent for the protection of butchers and victuallers and that it needs to be financed.  I would not like to see any undue financial hardship being put on people who will have to pay the fees.  A levy is to be introduced and the word &ldquo;levy&rdquo; is not liked by many.  Having it index-linked could be dangerous.  If the Minister finds at some future stage that he has to increase the levies and increases them in relation to the price index and still finds he has not enough money, where would the extra money come from?  I believe the Minister will be very reasonable if he has to increase the levy and will not put any undue hardship on those who will have to pay it.</P>

      <P>This section has been very well discussed.  In response to Senator O'Toole, there is a major difference between what the Minister has stated so far and what my party feel.  We genuinely feel adequate financing has not been provided to implement the provisions of the Bill.  We are particularly worried, as I said before and I do not wish to repeat it, that there is a variable, which is very difficult to predict, which allows about £800,000 for the payment of the corps of veterinary inspectors.  We <Col N="49" /> are talking about 160 vets.  On top of that a clerical or administrative back-up must be provided in order to have the necessary administrative work carried out.  We find great difficulty in accepting that that can be financed nationally by a sum of £800,000.  We feel that it will wind up costing several million pounds because there is no doubt that when you increase the workload to the level envisaged in the Bill, which is needed and we fully support the idea of post and ante natal inspections&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I can see a certain amount of merit in the case Senator Ferris has been making.  Certainly, he has argued it very well but I can see problems arising from index linking the fees because we are also discussing amendments Nos. 13 and 14 with amendment No. 1.  Amendment No. 1 refers to the licence fees and amendments Nos. 13 and 14 refer to the inspection fees.  In the Bill the inspection fees are pegged at the same level as the inspection fees applicable in the export meat plants and the inspection fees in the export meat plants are not index-linked.  If the inspection fees for animals slaughtered in abattoirs were index-linked and the inspection fees for animals slaughtered in export meat plants were not index-linked then two different levels of exports fees would apply to animals depending on the premises in which they were slaughtered.  If this amendment were accepted in relation to both the licence fees and the inspection fees we could finish up with a very anomalous situation <i>vis-á-vis</i> the meat export plants.</P>

      <P>Every regulation which has been brought out, and in particular, those brought out during the past 20 years, in relation to a local authority, health board, the Department of Agriculture or whatever the case may be, turned into a monster within about five years regardless of what Government were in power. What we have in this country is a creeping bureaucracy.  It has gone mad.  It is like a vulture, eating up the taxpayer's money as if there was a machine in every little corner of the country to print money.  I appeal to the Minister when this Bill is passed to see to it that much of the unnecessary &mdash; and I stress the word &ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo;&mdash; red tape is eliminated. Regardless of who operates a scheme for a road grant, house grant or the inspection of a public house for cleanliness there are fleets of officials involved and in case one of them has to slip out of a car he has to have one or two assistants with him.  This is where the money is going.</P>
      <P>Politicians of all parties shed crocodile tears about the poor taxpayers and our national debt.  Let us get our own house in order.  Let us cut out a lot of this red tape and the end result might be to help someone to stay in business and lighten the tax burden for the people who are crucified.  I appeal to the Minister to have as little red tape as possible in connection with these regulations.  Cut it out.  We are the laughing stock of Europe because of the bureaucracy we have set up in the past 25 years at enormous expense and at least 50 per cent of which is unnecessary.</P>

      <P>I see very little between us in this argument.  Senator Connor said the financing proposed would not be sufficient to meet the costs and that he could visualise an increase of maybe 300 per cent in a year or two.  If that is so index linking the fees is not going to solve the problem either and the Minister will have to go back to the meat trade and the farmers and increase the fees if this scheme is to be self-financing.  The Minister will not go to the Minister for Finance and say: &ldquo;We are so many million pounds short.  What are you going to do about it?  Are you going to give us the <Col N="51" /> money?&rdquo;  He will have to go back to the trade and to the farmers to try to make up any deficiency that might be there.  I see very little dividing us on this amendment because all accept that it has to be self-financing.  I would be afraid that index-linking the fees may not solve the problem and, at the end of the day, the Minister will have to go back to the trade to get any shortfall that might be there.</P>

      <P>The proposed fees under the Bill were set following a survey by the Department last year.  The fees were set to ensure that the measures under this Bill would be self-financing and there is no question of making any money out of it.  If we accepted the amendments we would be opening the door to the creeping bureaucracy Senator Byrne spoke about.  Although he used the analogy of a vulture I think the analogy of the octopus is more commonly used.  I will not go into the details here but merely say that there is a colleague of mine down in the south western part of the country who is a trade unionist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Should it be found necessary to increase the fees at some future date to <Col N="52" /> keep in line with costs, this House and the Dáil will have an opportunity to debate the increase.  I go along with what Senator Ferris said in that whatever party feel obliged to increase the fees and bring in a measure to this House and the Dáil will have to have very good reasons in circumstances which would warrant an increase and it would have to be justified. There would be no question of any party in Government coming in in a few years time and saying: &ldquo;We want to increase the fees by 100 per cent or 500 per cent.&rdquo; The increases in the fees will have to be justified and the circumstances surrounding them will have to be made known to the Members of the House and voted on.  I gave an assurance when introducing this legislation that we would facilitate the trade in vetting proposals before any regulation may be introduced here in the future.  Those safeguards will ensure that whoever comes into the House to increase the fees will have to outline in very great detail and justify the reasons for the increase.</P>

In relation to Senator Hussey's query, subsection (2) is necessary to ensure that premises which may not be large enough to have proper facilities for the slaughter of certain species of animals such as cattle or pigs will either not be allowed slaughter such species or, alternatively, be required to slaughter such species at time different from the slaughter of other animals. This is particularly important in the case of the slaughter of pigs where their screaming could terrorise other animals. Further pig slaughtering or some other operations might very well contaminate the meat of other animals.

      <P>Section 11 (3) states:</P>
      <P>The Minister may assign to each abattoir in respect of which a licence is granted under this Act a distinctive number or letter, or number and letter.</P>
      <P>Another section provides that meat slaughtered in a licensed abattoir will be stamped with a health mark.  Will that distinctive number or letter, which is assigned to the abattoir, be incorporated in the health mark with which the meat originating in that abattoir will be stamped?</P>

      <P>I could visualise a problem arising here.  There could be confusion if there is not liaison between the veterinary inspectors and the people who will take their animals to an abattoir for slaughter.  Has the Minister envisaged the provision of, say, holding pens in the event of animals arriving at an abattoir for slaughter having to be kept for a length of time by butchers, farmers or whoever delivers them.  If there is not <Col N="56" /> proper timing of kill at that abattoir there could be confusion about the holding of animals for any given length of time. I would welcome liaison to ensure that specified times be arranged by the veterinary inspectors, to ensure that killing would take place from the hours of, say, 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. or within the assigned hours so that there would not be people waiting in vehicles with animals lying about in abattoirs for hours without having the veterinary people there.  If there is no veterinary person there, is it possible for a kill to take place?  I understand from the provisions of the Bill that an animal will have to be inspected and clinically examined prior to and again after kill.  Such liaison between the veterinary people on timing will be crucial to the proper implementation of the provisions of the Bill.</P>

      <P>First, I should like to assure Senator Martin O'Toole that there will be liaison between an abattoir, the veterinary inspectorate and owners of animals.  Subsection (3) is linked with the arrangements for the stamping of meat as contained in section 40.  While the type of health mark has yet to be determined under the regulations, this subsection will permit an identifying number or mark relating to the abattoir to be incorporated in the health mark.  This will be very important for tracing purposes and also for the prevention of any abuse that might otherwise occur.  It will be possible by means of this mark to identify the abattoir, the veterinary surgeons and the owner of the animals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome that assurance. I will leave my comments on the marking of meat and the killing times, in respect of which I have put down a specific amendment to the relevant section.  I am anxious that confirmation would be forthcoming where the actual mark on the meter would be put because problems have arisen in the past but I will leave it to another section.  I welcome the fact that a distinctive number or letter or both could form part of the actual health stamp in the future.  It would be ideal for tracing <Col N="57" /> and the butchers would like it as well if they achieved a standard.  It would be identified with them and they could not be blamed for other people's mismanagement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 11, subsection (2), lines 24 to 26, to delete &ldquo;for the period of two months, or such longer period as the Minister may allow, after the death of the licence holder&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;for the remaining period of the licence&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will be in total agreement with what I am suggesting in this amendment.  The section, as it stands, would require a widow or widower of a licensee &mdash; in some circumstances &mdash; to apply within two months for a continuation of the licence.  The length of period could be at the Minister's discretion. In order to tidy up this section, would it not be better if the Minister agreed to my amendment which would allow the period of licence to continue up to the expiration of the licence as would normally happen if the licensee was still alive.  That two months period is the time a widow in particular would be in the most traumatic period of her life and the last thing she might think of would be to reapply for the continuation of the licence although she might have, and probably would have, a qualified butcher or staff on hands to continue the business which would be part of her livelihood.  I see absolutely no reason why the licence should die with the licensee.  There is probably an exception in that a driver's licence would die with a person who had it &mdash; I do not think they are required in heaven yet, or in hell for that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A butcher should be treated the same as a publican or anybody else in that the premises themselves are the places that <Col N="58" /> are licensed.  The licensee is the responsible person but there should be absolutely no reason whatsoever why a widow or widower of a deceased person would be obliged to apply again within two months of the death to have a licence continued.  It does not make any sense to me.  Perhaps the Minister might give his reason for it.  I take it that all these licences are annual or whatever period a licence would last for irrespective of the fact that the licensee might unfortunately die in the meantime and, of course, the premises will continue to be subject to veterinary inspection in any case.  It will be obligatory on the personal representative to continue the same standard as would have applied when the licensee was alive.  In my opinion it is a reasonable amendment.  I sincerely hope the Minister can see the reason for it, that the period would be a very traumatic period and somebody might just lose their means of survival by default.</P>

      <P>What Senator Ferris has said is fine if a situation were not to arise where the licence holder died within a matter of weeks or days of the date of the expiration of the licence.  If that happened and if Senator Ferris' amendment were to be adopted then the licence would expire possibly in a matter of days after the death of the licence holder.</P>

      <P>I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment in relation to the section.  The Minister will have to understand that we are talking mainly about family businesses, particularly in rural Ireland, where the spouse or another member of the family is involved in the business.  The annual review of the licence is a sufficiently tramatic experience for many people in a family business, and rightly so, in order to adhere to the necessary hygienic standards which the consumer requires and which as legislators we require.  We could have a situation where after the death of the owner of the business the spouse or the member of the family may not want to continue with the business and they would be left with no licence and, therefore, would <Col N="59" /> not be able to dispose of the particular slaughter house involved.  A slaughter house is only operable or only as good as the necessary licence available to the person operating it.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.  There should be the same treatment in this case as in given to the family publican or the family grocer who can transfer their businesses without any impediment of this sort. There should be a safeguard for the spouse or the member of the family in disposing of that particular asset at a very important time in their lives.</P>

      <P>I am concerned about this section because the family butchers, especially in rural parishes or rural villages like my own, are actually diminishing throughout the country.  I would like to see him protected especially if his son is an apprentice in the trade.  To suspend or terminate a licence after two months would be very hard on those people.  I hope the Minister will take that person into account.  I know he has his reasons for inserting this section and he will probably give them to us but he should not make it hard especially on the family butchers in rural parishes where they have maintained the identity of rural places in case they are wiped out completely.</P>

      <P>Without being repetitive I agree with the amendment put forward on this side on the House by Senator Ferris and indeed what has been said on the far side of the House.  Of all licensed types of livelihoods I do not know if this kind of requirement is applied anywhere else.  Say, for instance if a publican dies, his licence does not automatically cancel, abolish or abrogate two months after his death.  I feel that it is eminently reasonable to ask that at least the licence be allowed to run its full course.  Senator Mullooly makes the point &mdash; I do not quite understand it &mdash; about a licence coming up within a few weeks of the expiry of the licence on the decrease of the licence holder.  The Department of Agriculture will be notifying each licence <Col N="60" /> holder each year that the expiry of their licence is coming up.  They will be giving them due notice that it is time to reapply for the renewal of their licence. Regarding the death of the head of the family who may be the licence holder, it has been pointed out that it would be a very traumatic period of mourning for these people and they might automatically lose their licence through an oversight because of their pre-occupation with a very dramatic and traumatic event in their life.  I plead with the Minister that he would as a matter of reasonableness see that the argument we are making and the reasoning behind that argument.</P>

      <P>I am full of reasonableness and I am going to be very magnanimous in relation to this amendment. This amendment proposes to substitute for the words &ldquo;for the period of two months&rdquo; the words &ldquo;for the remaining period of the licence.&rdquo;  If the remaining period of the licence is only a few days or a few weeks it would be to the disadvantage of the holder.  I propose, to avoid that kind of situation, that a more appropriate amendment would be &ldquo;for a period of two months or for the remaining period of the licence whichever is the longer after the death of the licence holder&rdquo; and I will bring this forward on Report Stage.  A similar amendment will be necessary under section 28 and, as a consequence a similar provision will apply to permits granted under the Bill. Assuming acceptance by Senator Ferris to the addition to his amendment, the appropriate changes to section 13 and section 28 will be brought forward on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  I am prepared to accept the Minister's suggestion on this because it will now allow the personal representative of the licensee to hold his or her licence for the remainder of its period or two months whichever is the longer.  It would be up to the licensee's representative to have it as long as possible in that traumatic period.  I accept that as being a genuine effort to ensure that no unreasonable demands are made on <Col N="61" /> the representative.  If the Minister gives me an assurance that he will introduce a ministerial amendment on Report Stage to do what is suggested in my amendment and what he suggests, I would accept that as being the better way forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 12, subsection (1), lines 17 and 18, to delete &ldquo;Circuit Court&rdquo; and substitute the &ldquo;Abbatoir Licence Appeals Board established under subsection (2)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is only appropriate that when an amendment is consequential on other amendments we would take them together.  I hope the Minister will accept my amendment.  The following legal process is set out at section 16 (1):</P>
      <P>Whenever the Minister refuses to grant or renew, or revokes, an abattoir licence, the applicant for, or the holder of, such licence may, within 21 days after the date of the service of the notice of, as the case may be, the refusal or revocation, appeal to the Circuit Court against such refusal or revocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am suggesting a different formula from that suggested by the Minister.  I do not think it is necessary to legislate for somebody's civil rights.  Anybody would have the civil right to go to a Circuit Court in the event that they felt they had been treated unjustly by Minister or anybody else.  The Office of the Ombudsman is available in the event of public officials not treating a person justly.  There is no <Col N="62" /> need, therefore, for separate legislation in that respect.</P>
    <P>In the event of a butcher having made his case for the granting of a licence and for some reason unknown to him or because of some stipulation laid down by an official, a veterinary surgeon or whoever might have inspected his premises, the licence is refused, he will be required to go to court in order to be able to avail of his rights.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting the use of a non-statutory forum as opposed to the need for legal proceedings.  I suggest a type of abattoir licence appeals board.  If the Minister accepts that principle, it will involve representatives from the county council, from the Irish Domestic Meat Traders Association, from the Department and from other such butchers' organisations that exist.  I specifically mentioned the Irish Domestic Meat Traders Association because I have been in touch with them and I know they represent the smaller family type butchers. My proposal would not rule out any other registered butchers organisation should the Minister wish that they be included on the board.  If problems arise, they could be discussed at such a forum.  The Minister could have the power to nominate to that informal board some independent chairperson who might look at the case for and against.</P>
    <P>The reason for my suggestion is that if for some reason a butcher is unable, in the ordinary course of events, to have his licence granted or approved he would be required to go into court to make his case.  The moment any family butcher has to go to court to prove his case he has automatically lost the credibility of the public on the basis that he was in court. You would have the banner headlines &ldquo;Butcher appears in court over licence&rdquo;. Everybody would think there was something desperately wrong with the premises while the matter involved might be very simple.  It might be an administrative matter or it could be that the inspector in question was suffering from the effects of the night before and refused to approve a licence.  He could, for instance, have had a row with the butcher on the <Col N="63" /> local football field or at the golf club.  We are all human.</P>
    <P>When somebody is given authority I would like to think that authority would be used in the common good.  I am asking that a non-statutory appeals system be set up.  I recognise that the Minister and the veterinary profession will have to have overall regard for the good of the consumer.  I would not rule out that cases might arise in which the Minister might avail of this non-statutory role.  I am quite sure that the local authorities &mdash; I am a member of two local authorities &mdash; would welcome this type of forum in which we would discuss with people the opportunity of having their case made in a confidential way and which would not put them out of business by having to go to the extremes of taking a civil court action.</P>
    <P>I realise that common law exists and will allow a butcher that process if he feels that all the other systems have been stacked up against him and that he is unable to get his way.  He might find that he has to go to court and I think civil law would allow for that.  I am asking the Minister, under this section, to set up a non-statutory group of people who would consider impartially whether a person should have his licence renewed, revoked or withdrawn.  The Minister will have the co-operation of everybody in the meat trade, the local authorities, his Department, the Department of Health and so on in making appointments to such an appeals tribunal.  The tribunal would look at the problems arising and try to keep people out of court.  Every day many people have to go to court.  It is a very expensive process.  It is so expensive to go to a higher court that it would make it almost impossible for a family butcher to get his rights.  He would have to expend a lot of money to get somebody at senior counsel level to advise him.  I am suggesting, as an interim procedure, that the Minister accept this amendment in the spirit in which it is made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to try to bring about a situation where bringing people into court could be avoided.  As Senator Ferris said, the expense alone is frightening.  They have an open door to charge what they like.  If a case goes to a higher court it costs more. Because a butcher is dealing with food, his reputation could be destroyed by having to go to court.  It would be a different ball game if the owner of a licensed premises was in court because of serving drink after hours.  The pint of Guinness would not be open to question in such a situation but in the case of a butcher the quality of the meat he was selling would be open to question.  Having regard to the nature of his business and also to the cost involved, I appeal to the Minister to bring about a situation where a butcher would not be hauled into court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment and reiterate what Senator Byrne has said about the expense of going to court over, perhaps, a minor offence.  The situation could arise where a dirty cloth is left lying around an abattoir or a licensed premises. The Department official in question might deem that sufficient reason to bring a case against the butcher involved.  As <Col N="65" /> Senator Ferris pointed out, there is tremendous danger of putting the butcher out of business because of the detrimental publicity such a course might receive.  In regard to the tribunal alluded to in this amendment, a tidier tribunal might be required, a tribunal of not too many people.  This would ensure that matters do not end up in court because no decision can be made.  A representative of the Department of Agriculture, a representative of the local authority and a nominee of the various butcher's organisations &mdash; in any town in rural Ireland anyway a nominee of one of the butchers' organisations would be sufficient; perhaps it would be different in the larger cities &mdash; would meet the case.  In a minor case like that three people could resolve the situation without bringing the matter to the expense of a court hearing and putting the family business in jeopardy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>We are attracted to Senator Ferris's amendment.  We read later on in the Bill that the Minister will make regulations that will give powers to officers of his Department to implement the conditions laid down in this Bill.  We know what happens.  An officer is given a statutory duty to carry out a certain task and that officer can interpret that statutory duty as statutory authority to do it.  If he does not like a certain member of the meat trade there is nothing at all to prevent him perhaps expressing some little vindictiveness against that person, saying he was carrying out his statutory duty and his statutory authority by refusing the grant of a licence.  In his report to his superior he could state that a certain premises was unsuitable not because the premises was unsuitable but because for his own reasons his relationship with that person might not be very satisfactory. For that reason we find the provision very limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not altogether happy either that, even on an appeal, a member of the trade will have to take extremely drastic action in having to go to the Circuit Court with all that implies and all the cost it involves.  Under section 16 (4) (a) the Circuit Court has power to dismiss an <Col N="66" /> appeal with or without costs.  Under paragraph (b) the court may allow the appeal, with costs, and direct the Minister to grant or renew the licence, or to cancel the revocation.  The part of the subsection we are worried about is: &ldquo;and the decision of the Circuit Court on an appeal under this section shall be final save that, by leave of that Court, an appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court on a point of law&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure it is not the Minister's intention that anybody would have to go before the Circuit Court or, indeed, before a board as proposed by Senator Ferris in his amendment.  In section 11 the Minister sets out quite clearly the guidelines necessary.  If the applicant for a licence adheres strictly to those conditions very few cases will go on appeal to the Circuit Court.  That should be the aim of the Department's officials who will be carrying out the inspections and so on.  So far as possible dialogue should take place between them and the owners of the abattoirs and it should not be necessary to go before the Circuit Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies I want him to know my view on a couple of points.  While I accept the case made by Senator Hussey, we are dealing in a real world.  It will happen that on the morning of a visit by one of these inspectors some matter for which we cannot legislate could arise through no fault of the applicant.  We want to make sure that in such a case a person is not put to the trouble of going to court, because he might as well close down and go away if he has to do that to get the licence.  The reason I put down the condition of voluntary basis was that it should be an optional matter in areas but at least there would be a process in between where a person would have been refused a licence and rather than go to court there would be some intermediary body to consider the application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On amendment No. 4 I talked about membership of the board being voluntary. It would be tight and should not be more than 11 for obvious reasons.  In <Col N="67" /> some administrative areas you could have more than one butchers' organisation.  I want to be very impartial.  I have mentioned that one organisation I want included is the Irish Domestic Meat Traders Association, but I do not rule out the right to representation from organisations like the Irish Master Butchers Federation.  They may require to be represented on the board and rightly so. I would think that the Minister would require his Department to have access to such a non statutory appeals process.  You can keep the numbers as tight as you like and not more than 11, but within that 11 you will be able to have representatives of all the people who would be involved. That process would take place before it would be necessary to go to court. Nobody can take the right from a butcher to go to court if his livelihood is in jeopardy. It will be in his own interest to have that provision.  I am suggesting an intermediary body.  Let us hope that they will never have to be used but in the real world any day anything might happen and some people might be unfortunate enough to be at risk regarding the renewal of their licence through some unforeseen circumstance on a certain morning.  Anybody who knows about retail outlets, slaughtering houses and all sorts of places which are hives of activity knows that something can happen, perhaps on the very morning the inspector is coming.  I want a fail safe situation.  I do not want to have everybody shepherded into court.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendment on that basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments concern the establishment of an abattoir licence appeals board for each local authority area, that is 32 boards consisting of members of the local authority concerned, the Irish Domestic Meat Traders Association and the Department of Agriculture and Food.  It has been proposed that these boards will first hear appeals against refusal or revocation of licenses from which, should the need arise, there <Col N="68" /> will be a further appeal to the Circuit Court.  As public health will be the overriding consideration, it is felt that recourse to the Circuit Court as proposed in the Bill is the proper way to cater for appeals or refusal or revocation of licenses.  A series of individual appeal boards, 32 in all, as suggested, could give rise to diverse rulings, and here we are talking about standardised regulations and standardisation of premises and facilities for the country.  Indeed, one reason for this &mdash; that is, responsibility for licensing of premises is being granted to the Minister under the Bill &mdash; is the different approaches to licensing which obtained by the sanitary authorities in the past.  One could anticipate similar divergencies in the case of the suggested appeals board.  Moreover, the constitution of such boards could prove contentious having regard to the existence of three separate trade organisations. It is not unusual in Irish circumstances to have more than one organisation.  There is the Irish Domestic Meat Traders Association, the Irish Master Butchers Federation and the Irish Meat Wholesalers Association.  Refusal or revocation of a licence is a serious matter and any decision in that regard will not be taken lightly.  In fact, it is a very serious matter and there is no question of the Minister or an authorised officer of the Minister, simply because he does not like somebody, revoking that person's licence.  The matter is far too serious for that.  We are talking about upgrading legislation so that the interests of the public and the consumers are protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In certain circumstances, where refusal is concerned a permit under section 17 in lieu of a licence will be granted to allow time for the premises to be brought up to standard with appeals to lie to the Circuit Court.  In this case it will have to receive careful consideration before a decision is taken to refuse or revoke a licence.  The revoking hierarchy within the Department will ensure that all the facts are established before the application comes to the Minister for a decision.  Here, we are talking about extreme circumstances. If an officer goes into a premises and finds <Col N="69" /> rats crawling all over the place and all over the meat, he is entitled to take a serious view of it.</P>
    <P>In relation to publicity I cannot see how an individual who is abusing the regulations and his position could be saved from any publicity by a tribunal because I assume that the same publicity applies to that as to any court.  I hope that, given a sense of responsibility, this will not arise. In the event, the fairest thing is to have recourse to the Circuit Court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister is still relying on the courts.  My amendments have not ruled out the courts. Indeed, I have been very specific in ensuring that people's rights are still protected, by their being able to go to court.  Nobody on this side of the House or the other side of the House would advocate that a butcher who had rats running over his meat should get a licence.  I do not suggest either that he could get a licence by going to court.  It is a wrong example to use. None of the people in the trade to whom we have spoken wants to defend a person of that character.  We are thinking about reasonable family people.  I am suggesting this on a voluntary basis in each county.  My amendments do not affect court procedures that can be availed of at present.  I am asking for this on a voluntary basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The alternative is that the Minister's local butcher will contact him as his local TD to ring up the county manager to make sure that the vet does not take away his licence because something unusual happened that morning.  Public representatives will be able to be judgmental in relation to butchers.  I would rather see professional people involved in that kind of non-statutory or voluntary area which would have a semi-formal basis.  The butchers, meat traders or meat wholesalers could nominate one of each of their people so that their interests would be protected and the Minister could ensure that the county council would be involved along with somebody from the health board if the Minister wishes.  Let us have some way in which people can make an ordinary appeal on the basis of a genuine <Col N="70" /> case of misadventure.  We should not legislate that somebody could lose his licence without recourse other than to go to law.  That is the last thing anybody would want, particularly in the area of the selling or killing of meat for human consumption.</P>
    <P>We want to achieve a standard of which we can be proud.  We have higher standards than any other country in Europe and we are aping them every day. Anyone who knows anything about how meat is killed, transported, produced or delivered in Europe will realise that our standards surpass most of theirs.  We should be proud of this.  In this section we are prepared to send people into court to get their rights.  The Minister should realise that we are looking for voluntary non-statutory control, so that people could talk, and sit down and listen. Maybe at the end of the day they will still have to go to court because the evidence from the inspector will be such as to warrant that decision.  That will not remove from the Minister or his office the right to revoke or refuse to renew the licence.</P>
    <P>Nobody wants to take that power from the Minister and so make this Bill ineffective. We are protecting that power, but we are suggesting that there should be a mechanism, an in-between house, to give people the right to make their case confidentially.  It would have to be confidential because we have to have the confidence of the consumer.  This is a voluntary way.  Only butchers who want to use this process would be expected to use it.  I would like to legislate for the possibility of using that voluntary basis rather than depending on the court.  I hope the Minister will see it in that light. Putting that process in does not remove from the Minister the overall responsibility he has to ensure that standards are maintained.  Let us be reasonable.  We are dealing with the ordinary real world. I hope the Minister can meet us on this.</P>

      <P>In several other walks of life there is a non-judicial appeal system through which people who get into trouble in the licensed trade can appeal <Col N="71" /> rather than having to go through a very costly judicial appeal system.  At Second Stage we expressed the view that people other than officers of the Department might have a say in the implementation of these regulations.  Heretofore, the environmental health inspectors had a major role and that has been eliminated in this legislation.  The officer of the Department, armed with statutory powers which he will get when this Bill is enacted, can attend at a premises and for a personal reason can revoke a licence. This would only happen in the rarest of cases but it should never happen.  If that kind of thing happens it becomes an absolute tyranny.</P>
      <P>We appeal to the Minister to see the reason for the arguments we are making. The power in this legislation &mdash; a lot of power is involved because we are talking about somebody's livelihood &mdash; is too narrowly confined in the hands of a particular officer of the Department.  The Minister knows how the system works, and he knows that he could not revoke the officer's decision if that officer insisted that, in his professional opinion a premises was unsuitable, even though that might not be the same standard he is applying to another trader just down the street.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the previous speakers in relation to the provision of an intermediary in order to decide whether a person should be sent to court for a minor offence.  We are talking about minor offences.  If a major offence is committed all of us here would certainly condemn it and would abhor any effect that would have on the consumer.  We would not support any butcher who had rats crawling over his meat or a more serious offence than that.  We must take this section in the context of the fines the Minister is imposing under another section of the Bill.  You can be fined up to about £10,000.  If the court to which you resort imposes serious fines up to that amount for minor offences like dirty cloths lying around a slaughterhouse or an abattoir, it will create tremendous <Col N="72" /> fear in the family businessman who is willing to set up in a butcher's shop. There will be no incentive for such a person if he is to be bogged down with bureauracy and regulations, if he is to be inhibited by a vet with whom he does not get on or by the fact that he might be saddled with fines of up to £10,000 for minor offences.  Either we meet the offence with the appropriate fine or we provide this third party.</P>
      <P>The Minister fails to see the damaging effect which even minor publicity can have in a matter like this.  In rural parts you do not have to put it on the paper for bad news to get out about a family business.  I would not like to see any undue publicity being given to a minor offence which would jeopardise the family business and put it under severe pressure if the level of fines were imposed to their full extent of up to £10,000.  I appeal to the Minister to give discretionary powers to the local authorities, or to the independent tribunal proposed by Senator Ferris, as a first effort to resolve a minor infringement of the regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in this section is that we are trying to up-grade premises.  We are trying to protect the consumer.  We are trying to insist on public health regulations being recognised and, rather than closing down premises, the officials of the Department will be in consultation with the trade in trying to up-grade them.  There is a period of up to five years to do so under permit. I had representations made to me that a period of five years was too long.  Every facility will be there, in consultation with the trade, to allow people to up-grade their premises.  I would have very little mercy on persistent defaulters or offenders under this regulation because the revocation of a licence will not be taken for a minor offence.  It would have to be a serious and persistent matter.  I cannot, therefore, accept the amendment. The present system under the section is the best under the circumstances.</P>

      <P>No, it is not.  The Bill still allows what the Minister wants.  The amendment does not remove the power and the importance of that power of the court.  It just adds in this piece.  That it is not unreasonable.  I am surprised the Minister does not agree to this in principle because it is a voluntary arrangement. I had hoped that the Minister <Col N="74" /> would agree to it.  I am sorry he does not.  On that basis I cannot withdraw the amendment.  It is voluntary; it is not obligatory and it does not remove all the other sections about courts which are there in common law.  I am sorry I have to disagree with the Minister but I feel we should leave it in as an interim measure and I think that the House would support that.</P>

    <Title>National Primary and Secondary Roads: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann expresses the need to enforce the law to control all traffic using our National Primary Roads and National Secondary Roads to ensure that (a) all vehicles are roadworthy; (b) vehicles are not overloaded; (c) drivers observe the statutory speed limits and parking by-laws.</P>
      <P>First, I appreciate having an opportunity to raise this matter here.  A number of colleagues asked me if I wanted to make life more difficult for the motoring public. My answer is very simple.  That is not the intention in bringing this motion before the Seanad; on the contrary.  Our traffic laws are a bit out of date and are in need of looking at.  Hopefully, I shall make a contribution here which will help to convince the Minister for the Environment and those involved with him in Cabinet that this motion is timely.  Our road traffic laws are outdated and it is time we had a serious look at them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe there are a large number of unroadworthy vehicles on the road and that those vehicles are overloaded and totally uncontrolled.  I say this as a driver with experience who is on the road seven days a week.  I drive through fairly difficult terrain from Donegal to Dublin and I meet every kind of traffic on the road. Some of it gives me concern and it is <Col N="76" /> about time that we took a very hard look at the whole traffic code.</P>
    <P>It is time that we looked at the size of vehicle, the type of driver and the speed at which heavy vehicles are being driven. It is not uncommon on the roads between here and Northern Ireland to meet very heavy juggernaut vehicles and to be passed out, even when travelling at 60 miles an hour, by those very heavy vehicles, certainly, in my opinion, driving very dangerously.  This cannot be allowed to continue.  Speeding in heavy vehicles has caused many deaths.  I do not know how you can console families where the bread-winner, or child, or some member is wiped out of existence by reckless, or careless, or dangerous driving.  I do not know the explanation for it.  We in public life have a responsibility to express our opinions and to influence, as far as possible, the implementation of law and in this case I would say we are long overdue in doing that.  One of the things that comes to mind is that recently there were eight road deaths in five days in Northern Ireland.  We all express a lot of concern and have a lot to say on the many unfortunate deaths that the troubles in Northern Ireland have caused but the slaughter on the roads seems to be taken for granted and goes practically unnoticed.  That cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>One of my principal concerns is the number of vehicles, mostly from Northern Ireland, which enter this country very heavily laden and which are driven by young drivers.  They are causing serious problems in this part of Ireland and the authorities can do very little about it.  I have seen those in charge of very heavy vehicles on the road, 40 tonners, playing with them like dinky toys.  They pass out all traffic and have no regard for white and unbroken lines or speed limits in towns.  That cannot be allowed to continue. That is my experience in this area and it influenced me to bring this motion before the Seanad.</P>
    <P>We have no real awareness of or concern for the whole spectrum of traffic laws.  If one drives from here to Stillorgan or on any main throughfare one will find <Col N="77" /> that vehicles will pass just as easily on the left-hand side as they do on the righthand side.  There is no lane discipline and little concern is shown for other vehicles, even to the extent of not even giving a signal.  The Minister probably drives a lot more than I do and I am sure he is aware of how much our traffic laws have deteriorated.  It should be a very serious offence for someone to use a vehicle over a very long period without a speedometer and without having the vehicle registered. It should also be a very serious offence to then sell that same vehicle as an unregistered vehicle or as a new vehicle to somebody who does not have technical knowledge.  Somebody will buy the vehicle as a new vehicle with no mileage on it when in fact it may already have covered 50,000 miles over a two to three year period.  That is one aspect of vehicle and traffic law which has to be looked at.</P>
    <P>It should be a criminal offence to buy a vehicle that had been involved in a crash or written off by an insurance company and then to reinstate and sell that vehicle without the new owner realising that the vehicle had, in fact, been written off on some previous occasion.  That is a very serious problem and one that not only endangers the life of the motorist but also the lives of others.  It is a problem which needs to be looked at, it should be a matter of serious concern.  If you look at any newspaper you will see crashed vehicles for sale.  These are bought up, reinstated and put back on the road as new vehicles.  It is a problem that has got to and which I hope will be looked at. Positive and effective action is long overdue in this area.</P>
    <P>It should be a serious offence to overload a vehicle and here again I am talking about commercial vehicles.  It should be a serious offence to overload a vehicle either with plant machinery or with any dangerous substance.  A danger is automatically created for the public and for the general road user if this is allowed to happen and at present this is about the only country in Europe that allows this to happen.  This problem was forcefully brought to my attention by the many commercial vehicle users in my county <Col N="78" /> who take fish to Europe.  The driver of any vehicle from this country who passes through a UK or European port is liable to have his vehicle and load checked.  If, in fact, his load is found to be overweight he will not be allowed to move the vehicle one yard until he gets a relief vehicle to take part of the load.  To my knowledge, many exporters have been pulled in and were not allowed to go to the nearest garage.  They had to stay on the spot until a relief vehicle arrived and removed part of the load.  Very strict laws in regard to overloading vehicles exist in most European countries and I do not think that the same laws are applied here.  It is an unfair disadvantage for our truck users here as any of them on the European run tell you.  They will tell you that it is something about which they need to be aware as there is a very costly fine and it is a very costly experience, if they are pulled in and their load is found to be overweight.</P>
    <P>All secondhand vehicles imported into this country, and here I am mainly talking about commercial vehicles, should have to undergo a mechanical test before they are allowed onto the road.  My information is reasonably accurate.  I can say here without any fear of contradiction that I can go abroad, buy a commercial vehicle, import it and then go to the local tax office to get a licence for a period of one month.  I can put on the road a vehicle that has come off a scrap heap in England without the need for any log and without any restriction.  I think that is totally wrong.  All too often the vehicle is bought cheaply and it is not roadworthy in the first instance because it has failed the MOT test in England or it would have cost too much money to put it through the test, therefore, it was put up for auction.</P>
    <P>The vehicle may look reasonably good but it may have been run into the ground by a trucking company or commercial operation in England.  If one goes to a local tax office and taxes that vehicle for a month even though it is in a non-roadworthy state it is let onto our roads. That is a serious problem which should not be allowed to continue.  I ask the Minister to take a serious look at it and, <Col N="79" /> if it is within his power, the law should be amended to prevent that sort of thing happening.  It is another source of serious concern for road users.</P>
    <P>The law should be enforced when vehicles which deliver food are found to be dirty.  There have to be standards for vehicles which deliver food such as bread, meat, etc.  I am not looking for laws to persecute those who are in business and to make life more difficult for them, but the trade and those involved in it can only benefit if there are standards which are easy to observe.  It costs very little to keep a vehicle clean.  In other countries vehicles are kept well; they are washed and cleaned.  I would like to see that kind of interest taken in vehicles here.</P>
    <P>We do not have the best roads in Europe and I do not know why we should have the most relaxed traffic laws in Europe.  I venture to say that there are stricter controls in Counties Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan and in the other Border counties than there are in the rest of the country.  One is about ten times more likely to have a vehicle checked and looked at in any of the Border counties because of the number of gardaí on the ground and the large number of vehicle checkpoints.  There are not the same number of checkpoints in the rest of the country.  The people who live in Border areas are accustomed to checkpoints.  It is very important that there is uniformity in the law and that it is implemented in all areas and not just in Border counties.</P>
    <P>The overall situation with regard to vehicle control has got to be looked at. We are now very much Europeans and we should have no simple and lax laws about vehicle control.  The safety of our people is important.  Unfortunately many people from outside realise that our laws are a bit lax.  For instance, in Northern Ireland one cannot drive a vehicle that is over-laden or is in a bad condition.  Some firms in Northern Ireland who send goods to the Republic send them on a Saturday when it is likely that their own traffic inspectors are not operating.  An overloaded lorry or a lorry that is not roadworthy can deliver goods into the <Col N="80" /> Republic on a Saturday.  I am very concerned about this.  On my way back to Donegal from the Seanad I was overtaken by a very heavy vehicle at high speed.  I went to a barracks and I reported the incident.  The garda in charge took me very seriously and said he would have to do something about it but another garda reminded him that he could not do anything about it because he could not get a district justice.  Effectively to charge somebody from outside the State he would have to bring him before a court and have a district justice on the spot. There was no district justice available and even though the garda accepted that the driver of the vehicle was driving at a high speed and in a dangerous fashion and was prepared to arrest the man, he could do nothing about it because there was no judge to try him.  That cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>We must take some positive action because the general public are at unnecessary risk.  It is unfair to the vehicle users who comply with the law, who buy good vehicles, who are forced to do a test and keep their vehicles roadworthy and drive in a manner that respects the law and the safety of the general public.  It is unfair to them to let people in from outside the State who know well that there is no law to prevent them from doing what they like.  They can drive any size of vehicle at any speed and with any load and they cannot be charged or brought to justice without having a district justice ready to charge them on the spot.  The gardaí know this and they know that their task is nearly impossible.</P>
    <P>I am glad I had the opportunity to put down this motion and I am glad the Minister came in to listen to the debate.  Even if I have not put the case as eloquently as it could be put I have expressed my views honestly on an area about which I am very concerned.  I am certain the Minister has views and experiences which are like mine.  I hope that ultimately some good, positive action will be taken and that the law will be implemented as a result of this motion.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete the words &ldquo;National Primary Roads and National Secondary Roads&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;roads&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I agree completely with Senator McGowan and I compliment him on what he said.  I had intended to speak at length on the problem of the importation of non-roadworthy vehicles from the UK into the Republic and I think he has covered that more than adequately.  I concur with everything he said in that area because it is a scandal.  I want to make one minor suggestion in that area which the Minister might consider taking on board.  If cars are to be imported from the UK into the Republic there should at least be a requirement that they had passed the MOT test in Britain before they were accepted as suitable cars to be put on Irish roads.  I served for a long number of years on the Dublin County Council Road Safety Committee so it is an area to which I am well committed and have been involved in for a long number of years.</P>
      <P>It is fine and well to talk about the national primary and secondary roads but the Minister and I as teachers would be concerned about the thousands of young people on their way to school &mdash; and who are still going to school &mdash; not just on the national primary and secondary roads but also on the boreens and lanes all over Ireland no matter what condition they are in.  It is important that the same law applies to those roads as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to a point that is worrying me.  I do not want to discuss Government cutbacks as I know people are sick and tired of hearing about them but much as I regret it I have to refer to them in this instance.  The best way to make the point is to pick an example and prove <Col N="82" /> how it works.  For the past number of years in many counties the county councils have operated a road safety programme in conjunction with the primary schools.  There is one successful example of this in the County Dublin area where thousands of pupils in the most junior classes in school worked on a programme which was devised by the county council in consultation with practising teachers. The county council after piloting and assessing programmes in different schools around the county finally came to a programme that they decided to implement in the schools.</P>
    <P>This programme has been operating for the past three or four years in the schools.  It has been supported by the county council and by the road safety section of the county council over that period of time.  It involved teachers from different schools around the county giving up their time to do a number of brief in-service courses on the application of this road safety programme and it has been a highly effective programme.  Part of the credit for this must come from the schools' programmes.  We have seen a marked reduction in the incidence of fatal and non-fatal accidents on Irish roads over the past number of years.  To give an instance of that, the incidence of fatal accidents fell from a figure of 186 in 1983 to 151 fatal accidents in 1984 and to 129 fatal accidents in 1985.  The figures for 1986 have not been published but fortunately I got them.  The figures for 1986 show a further reduction to 104.  This is something everybody involved in the programme should be proud of.  Teachers and schools had a major input to make in that.</P>
    <P>The programmes put forward by the different county councils and by the national road safety campaign also have had a major input in this.  In the Dublin area the figures show a reduction from 94 fatal accidents in 1984, 92 fatal accidents in 1985, to 81 fatal accidents in 1986.  The improvements in the figures must be put down to something.  I am sure the Minister will agree that if you ensure that young people are responsible and understand the dangers of road travel when <Col N="83" /> they become older road users, whether they be drivers or otherwise, they will also become more responsible.  They will have a sense of responsibility towards fellow road users which is what Senator McGowan talked about in a number of examples he gave about the lack of consideration of one road user for another. This must be started at a very early age.</P>
    <P>The county councils, and Dublin County Council in this instance, decided to cut back on that programme.  They say we must stop that programme for seven months and we will start it off again sometime next year.  It is all very well to do the audit on that and say it has saved us X number of pounds but I would put it to the Minister that this type of cutback may save money but it costs lives. Whether by earmarking of allocations or whatever, there should be an insistence that there is responsibility on the State to see to it that this situation does not continue.  I ask the Minister to act on that issue as I know his sympathy would be with that area.</P>
    <P>If we look at the area of drink related accidents, it is very difficult to come up with figures, but it is an accepted fact that the highest incidence of such accidents that take place over a certain period of hours around pub closing time would relate to driving while drunk.  In 1985 there were 10,000 breath tests carried out by the Garda.  Figures tell me that this was reduced to 8,000 last year.  I think that is scandalous.  It is scandalous because we have just reached the point of responsibility as a nation where it is no longer tolerated or tolerable to take a risk with drinking and driving.  More and more people have learned that they should pay for a taxi or make arrangements that some person will not drink and be responsible for getting the party home.  One of the reasons for that, apart from the sense of responsibility that people feel to others, is that it concentrates the mind wonderfully, as the Minister will be aware, that they might have to blow into a bag on the way home and this helps them along the way to make that decision.  That kind of cutback <Col N="84" /> hits us in a very definite and negative way.  In those two areas cutbacks save money but they cost lives.  I ask the Minister to move on those two areas.  I do not want to labour the point any further.</P>
    <P>I want to clarify one point.  The figures I gave earlier were not the total number of accidents for the year.  They were figures for parts of the country.  They indicate the reduction that took place over a period of years.  While we may continue with that reduction and continue to improve what used to be a terrible record in international terms of road accidents, I do not know whether it is good or bad to be able to say that there are other countries which are much worse than us. It should be noted that even though there are very strict laws in the Six Counties they have a much worse record of accidents per thousand than we have in the Republic.  I refer to that point not in any denigratory sense but to say that legislation alone does not solve or ease the problem.  It is legislation with education, a point that I am sure the Minister will support.  I ask the Minister to look at that in the broadest possible way to ensure that all groups, including local authorities, take this matter on board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be extremely brief in deference both to the Leader of the House and to my colleagues.  I wish to second Senator J. O'Toole's amendment and to address myself to my own amendment. I add my voice to what Senator O'Toole has said and what is the view of many Members of this House that in tightening up the law and regulations in respect of the Road Traffic Act we have to do two things.  We have to change our own attitudes and enforce what is there. We have to change our own attitudes by looking at the way we advertise so many events and functions around the country with the bar extension emblazoned heavily in the advertising.  I say this as one who is neither anti-drink or poorly disposed towards it.  I do not think campaigns about drinking and driving are effectively carried out by people who do not drink themselves.  It behoves those of us who drink to advocate a severe <Col N="85" /> collective view by our society on those who behave in that most irresponsible fashion of consuming alcohol and driving at the same time.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole discussed some of these issues.  There may well be a certain element of the psychological attitude that we all have a litle bit of about drinking and driving and the fact that the reference to drink was omitted from the original motion.  I am not saying it was deliberate or anything like that.  But all of us are much more inclined to be eloquent about certain areas of misuse in the area of road traffic than we are on the issue of drinking and driving.  I think, for instance, of the extraordinary, often justified, crescendo of concern about joyriders and their victimes and the appalling accidents that have happened.  The truth is, of course, that of the hundreds of people who are killed every year on Irish roads a considerable number would not be killed were it not for the abuse of alcohol on the part of the victims or the people who drive the vehicles which are responsible for their deaths.</P>
      <P>If we were really to be consistent about the issue of misuse and abuse of motor vehicles and of the roads we would primarily target those who drink and drive. They are responsible for far more deaths than the joyriders who create so many headlines and are given so much attention by the more sensational branches of the media.  The single most dangerous threat to human safety on the roads is not occasioned by the people who steal cars and joyride.  Very often it is the respectable, solid, family-loving citizens who choose to mix drink and driving.  It is not an offence that one can associate with one particular class of society.  It appears to me, to be one that is more an offence of the affluent than of the less affluent for the very good reason that by and large it is the affluent who can afford to indulge both habits at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have got to move in the direction of enforcement so that, as well as expressing our collective horror at the irresponsibility of such accidents, the probabilities of being caught are increasingly heavily loaded against the abusers.  We <Col N="86" /> should begin to think about the penalties imposed for this misuse.  In any other area of life the coincidence of alcohol consumption and many other activities very often results in people losing their livelihood.  If somebody is working in a responsible job and is found to be affected by alcohol he or she will probably lose their job on the spot.  If somebody working in an industry is found to be under the influence of alcohol he or she will probably lose their employment. Admittedly, the penalty imposed on somebody who is found to have an excessive amount of alcohol in his or her blood leads to the withdrawal of their licence. I wonder is it a sufficient penalty.  Does it really represent the sense of moral outrage most of us feel at the risk that is being taken with other people's lives by somebody who carries on like this?  I say that not in any sense of moral superiority. I do not feel in any way morally superior on these matters.  At the same time one has to stand and look at the objective facts, the objective horror of the results of abuse of alcohol by drivers. It results in carnage, death, serious injury, on a scale which were it to happen anywhere else, would have the whole nation assembled in horror.  I am sure more people die every year in this country because of the abuse of alcohol by users of road traffic vehicles than have died in five years from the misuse of drugs.  Quite rightly we are outraged at the misuse of many other substances.</P>
    <P>It is time we took away this curtain of respectability around the misuse of alcohol.  As I said about another areas of human activity, drinking is quite good fun.  But, like all activities that are pleasurable, it needs to be indulged in with a considerable degree of responsibility. That is not being done in our society.  Here there is a question to be asked of ourselves.  Do we really regard the person who abuses alcohol as being in the same category as the person who abuses another substance?  Have we thrown a certain cloak of respectability over that activity because it is one with which we are familiar, one that is associated with reasonable people, people who <Col N="87" /> are perhaps models of society in many other areas of life?  Do we tend therefore to forgive that fault in a way that we would not forgive other faults?</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to take whatever steps he deems necessary to ensure that the regulations prescribed for drinking and driving are severely enforced. For instance it is true that some of the most libertarian countries in the world, countries we would describe as the epitome of permissiveness like the Scandinavian countries, have regulations about drinking and driving most of us would regard as horrific in their severity. These are countries we choose to describe as permissive.  Perhaps we should look at their priorities, their values and consider ours.  I appeal to the Minister to do whatever is necessary, to introduce amending legislation, if necessary.  I am in favour of the Garda having power to carry out random checks of people's blood alcohol content, as distinct from the position obtaining under which they are obliged to have a reasonable suspicion that the person has consumed alcohol.  Random checks on a grand scale, at particular times of the evening and of the year, would be a considerable disincentive to people.  We need to re-order our national values fundamentally to deal with what is a type of a collective immorality &mdash; the acceptance and toleration of the abuse of alcohol by drivers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>At times it is frightening to drive on country, county or national primary roads and observe the conduct, not of all lorry or articulated truck drivers but quite a number of them.  They drive along in convoys.  On a wet day in particular it is almost impossible to overtake them, two or three together and they have been the cause of many accidents. The speed limit is scarcely ever observed <i>vis-à-vis</i> their tonnage.  Something will have to be done in that respect.  Our roads are over-used by prevailing amounts of traffic, their condition leaving much to be desired.  Reckless driving in heavy trucks or lorries means that there is a good chance of bumping into them and <Col N="88" /> losing your life or being seriously injured. The Garda are doing a good job.  Indeed they have many urgent matters calling on their time in every area.  However, the drivers of articulated trucks should be brought to heel.  Their conduct on the roads is scurrilous particularly in winter months when it is frightening to even attempt to pass them.  Indeed they do not observe the law <i>vis-à-vis</i> their condition or lighting.</P>
      <P>I might mention another problem. Garages should be obliged not to allow any vehicle to be taken onto the roads unless it is registered and displaying a registration plate, whether it be a car or a truck, big or small.  We have the problem at present occasioned by what I might describe as the new rich.  They are the travelling people.  They travel around the south every year in Mercedes, jeeps and trucks which are not registered.  It is unknown from where such vehicles emanate.  But, if they are involved in robberies or accidents, it is almost impossible for the Garda to track them down.  The obligation should be placed on garage owners that no vehicle should be released until registered and displaying a number plate.  In this day and age there are many cowboys around who engage in all kinds of activities, particularly at night, such as robbing old people in their homes, stealing livestock of all kinds and being involved in car accidents. It is impossible for the Garda to trace them if they do not display a number plate.  That problem is widespread around the country.  If that regulation were enforced it would resolve much unsolved crime.  It could then be ascertained from where vehicles emanated, whether from across the Border, imported or whatever, because it is a growing problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel very strongly about the conduct of a high proportion of our lorry drivers. Some lorry drivers will tell you they are in a hurry and that they are heading for the boat at such a time.  That is a lot of blarney.  The lorry drivers should observe the law of the land.  The people who employ those drivers should give them sufficient time to get to their destination. <Col N="89" /> It is unfair to everybody, the driver as well as to the public.  I feel very strongly on that issue.  I ask the Minister to do something in relation to this matter as soon as possible.  They are not observing the law.  The motorist, the cyclist or the person walking on the side of the road are scared of their lives.  No matter what the standard of the road, whether it is the main road or a country road, it is the same.  They are just laughing at the law. I appeal to the Minister to do something about it.  We know that many families have been left without their father due to reckless driving on the part of some of those cowboys.</P>
    <P>In order to curtail the abuse that is taking place in connection with unregistered cars and trucks, an obligation should be put on the garage owners and the Garda should round up the people who are driving around in unregistered vehicles.  This would tighten up many loopholes where the vehicles came from; if the excise duty was paid on them and also the tax and insurance.  Those vehicles are probably not insured either and may also be involved in robberies.  The Garda feel helpless.  These people are a law unto themselves.  They invaded my constituency during the summer.  I am sure Senator Ferris will know what I am talking about.  They can sell anything from colour television sets to computers.  They laugh at the law because they are driving around in unregistered vehicles.  It is terrible to see a man in a small town paying rates and taxes of all kinds who is trying to make a living and these people can do what they like.  They are in every part of the country.  It is hard enough on the small family business today to exist without trying to compete with those cowboys. I know the Garda are overworked at times but these people must be brought to heel and also the reckless drivers of those articulated trucks.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that this motion was introduced.  It was the brainchild of Senator McGowan.  This is something about which I have felt very strongly for a number of years.  These drivers treat the motorist and the person walking as if they were not human beings at all. <Col N="90" /> Convoys of trucks travel at 80 miles an hour.  I was coming back to Dublin not so long ago and I trailed a truck as I could not overtake it.  Near my constituency at Rockwell College an articulated truck was travelling at 80 miles an hour on a wet evening.  If he had to brake suddenly, he would have killed all before him. There is an abuse there.  There is too much emphasis on the man taking a jar. I am not condoning that people should drive when they have too much drink taken.  Very often when people have taken a few drinks they are more careful than when they are sober.  The reckless cowboys are far more dangerous.  I would appeal to the Minister to get something done about that urgently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>We can all agree with certain sentiments in the motion that vehicles should be roadworthy, that vehicles should not be overloaded, that drivers should observe the statutory speed limits and that parking by-laws and that Road Traffic Acts in relation to driver drinking should be obeyed.  The motion in the name of all the members of the Fianna Fáil Party in the Seanad opens with an expression that Seanad Éireann expresses the need to enforce the law to control all traffic using our national primary roads and national secondary roads, In stating this, are they implying that the law is not being enforced, that there should be better enforcement or that the law needs to be strengthened in relation to the three specific areas mentioned in the motion? Listening to Senator McGowan &mdash; and I thank him for bringing this motion before the House &mdash; he has the whole three in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In doing some research on this issue, I was surprised to find the volume of legislation that has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas under the Road Traffic Acts and also the number of statutory instruments which have been introduced from time to time by Ministers for the Environment and especially the statutory instruments which have been introduced bringing our laws into line with the EEC regulations.  The EEC have <Col N="91" /> introduced a directive requiring all member states to introduce compulsory vehicle testing for goods vehicles, trailers, large passenger vehicles, taxis and ambulances.  The only area that does not come under this compulsory testing at present is the private motor car.  I find it hard to understand when member states have that kind of legislation that the things that Senator McGowan said are happening in Northern Ireland are occurring in the southern part of our country. If we are of the view that there are a number of private motor cars using our national and primary roads that are not in roadworthy condition &mdash; and I would subscribe to this view &mdash; then I feel that the Government should pass the necessary legislation to deal with the aspect of road testing which is at present left uncovered in relation to the private motor car.</P>
    <P>The motion speaks about the need to enforce the law, to control all traffic and to ensure that all vehicles are roadworthy. Under the heading of road-worthiness the most important categories would be tyres, steering and brakes.  I was interested to find in the Garda Commissioner's report on crime for 1986 under the heading of &ldquo;defective tyres&rdquo; the number of offences in which proceedings were taken amounted to 8,957. Under the heading of &ldquo;defective steering&rdquo; the figure was 104 and for defective brakes it was 791.  In Construction Equipment and Use of Vehicles Regulations, 1986, under the heading &ldquo;other offences&rdquo; the number of offences in which proceedings were taken amounted to 20,799. Unfortunately there is no breakdown of the categories of these offences.  The numbers which I quoted prove that there is strict enforcement by the Garda in relation to Construction Equipment and Use of Vehicles Regulations.</P>
    <P>Under the Road Traffic Acts offences against lighting regulations, the number of offences in which proceedings were taken amounted to 18,815.  I am sure all Members of the House will agree that the lighting of public vehicles is a very important aspect of road safety.  There <Col N="92" /> were 208 convictions in relation to dangerous parking, 6,081 convictions in relation to dangerous driving and 3,240 convictions in relation to driving without insurance.  Under the heading of drink and driving &mdash; I will only mention one statistic that is in relation to driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle with blood, urine, alcohol concentration above the prescribed limit &mdash; there were 4,348 convictions.  The purpose of quoting these figures is to show to the House that the law has been enforced in relation to traffic offences.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate the Garda for their work in this area. What we need in this country is not just to enforce the law: the public should be educated and informed of their need to uphold the law.  Senator O'Toole referred to that and I fully agree with it.  The scant respect that people today pay to our Road Traffic Acts frightens me.  People have a moral duty to drive cars that are roadworthy. They should have good tyres, good brakes, good steering and so on. This is an individual responsibility that people have to face up to and it applies to the private motorist as well as to those who drive juggernauts.  In certain circumstances people seem to make a mockery of our laws.  They boast sometimes about the number of parking tickets they receive.  In order to bring home to the public their need to uphold the law, when people commit minor offences &mdash; I would ask the Minister to bear in mind illegal parking &mdash; there should be some kind of points system in operation and that when they have committed a certain number of offences their licence should be taken from them for a short period of time. They would then take far more seriously the laws as we have them.</P>
    <P>I am frightened by the amount of illegal parking in our cities, especially in the city of Dublin and the number of people who fail to obey speed limits.  A new phenomenon in the city of Dublin &mdash; I am sure it applies to other cities &mdash; is the number of people failing to obey the traffic lights when they are against them.  This is a most serious offence.</P>
    <P>The two areas I want to mention are <Col N="93" /> driving without insurance and driving under the influence of drink.  These are criminal offences.  They are offences against society itself and society should see them in that way.  The offence of driving while under the influence of drink has been addressed by Senator Brendan Ryan but I consider driving without insurance to be equally as serious.  It is a criminal action for somebody to take a car out on a road and not be covered by insurance.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to relate to a local problem. We have spoken in this debate about the consideration that people who use the roads should have for one another.  They should also have consideration for people who live by the roadsides.  In my own area, in Bath Street-Pembroke Street, people are frightened out of their wits by the huge juggernauts, heavy vehicles and buses passing by at high speed.  The people have started blocking the roads.  I cannot support their illegal action but I understand their emotions.  I will give an example of a lady who lives in one of the houses in this area.  Her son returned from England on the mail boat after a very choppy crossing and went to bed for three or four hours.  When he awoke he felt he was still on the mail boat, the house was shaking so much.  These people live in fear and terror.  Heavy traffic could use alternative routes.  It might not be as convenient for them or there might be a charge on a toll bridge but in such circumstances our laws should be made in such a way as to encourage, maybe force, drivers of heavy vehicles to use alternative routes.  As I said earlier, we can have all the laws we like but the people must have the will to respect and to obey them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to speak largely on behalf of the Irish Road Haulage Association whom I have represented for some time in this House.  As one who drove a truck in my younger days and has been in constant touch with that business I know some of the problems facing the legal hauliers.  There are two laws in this country, one for the official legal haulier who must work within the law and one <Col N="94" /> for bigger companies and some of the cowboys too, who are working with overloaded trucks in order to cut prices.  The legal hauliers believe that something should be done in this area.  There are a number of weighbridges in operation but they are only manned for spot checks. They should be manned at least during working hours and there should also be an emergency service.  If the Garda stop a truck driver and suspect his vehicle is overloaded there is no emergency service whereby they can call out the weighbridge personnel to weigh the vehicle.  If that vehicle coule be weighed there and then we could impose the same restrictions as are imposed on Irish hauliers who travel to the Continent or to England.  In those countries there are spot checks and weighing facilities on tap 24 hours a day. We do not have that service but it is something we will have to consider.</P>
      <P>The standard load for a five axle vehicle in Ireland is 38 tonnes.  On the Continent it is 40 tonnes.  The standard load here should be the same as that on the Continent. Problems arise for a truck driver travelling with a load to the Continent. Naturally he wants to bring the maximum load so unless he has a pick up truck carrying two tonnes following him to the Border he is more or less compelled to overload by at least two tonnes in order to make his trip worthwhile.  The price he gets depends on the weight he can carry.  The hauliers ask me to implore the Minister to increase the standard load from 38 tonnes to 40 tonnes.  That would be a very important move and would help the haulage business to operate in a much more satisfactory way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter to which I wish to refer and to which Senator McGowan also referred is imported trucks.  You can import a truck from England or Northern Ireland, use it for a month without having it tested and at the end of that month you can tax it.  You do not have to have it tested for another 12 months.  You can tax it on the import dockets and documentation and that is unfair to our businessmen who are in the trade here.  The Irishman will have to give at least £15,000 for the same truck here and will have to <Col N="95" /> have everything in order from the word go.  The person who imports his truck is not tied to specific contracts, he has time for this type of manoeuvring.  He will get 18 months work out of the truck for £5,000 and at the end of that time he can sell it for £2,500 to £3,000 for scrap.  The person here who is living by the law has to pay £15,000 for a truck so he is beaten on price and competition.  The law should state that someone who imports a truck should have to put it through a test before the duty is paid and before it is allowed in legally or certainly within a month of coming into the country.  That would cut out much of the irregularities so far as imported trucks are concerned.</P>
    <P>Another bone of contention is cabotage which is where a truck driver comes in from Northern Ireland, delivers a load in Ballyshannon, picks up another load there, delivers it in Dublin and then drives to Dundalk either with or without another load.  He can pick up the load in the State and deliver it in the State and there is no way that our people can compete with that.  We must come to grips with this problem.  At present the Garda are powerless to do anything about the matter.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the Revenue Commissioners who are doing their best to come to grips with this problem. Our laws should be amended so as to stop illegal haulage within the Twenty-six Counties.  This is a very big bone of contention with the road hauliers and this House is the proper place to make this point.  I hope the Minister will take notice of it.</P>
    <P>Our laws seem to over-emphasise the tachograph.  This device is checked regularly because it is easy to do so but the loads are not checked because we do not have a service to check them 24 hours a day.  We have no service to check illegal haulage which I referred to as cabotage. These are some of the main problems we should come to grips with.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay a special tribute to the legal road hauliers of Ireland.  All the licensed hauliers keep a good quality and a good standard of truck and they rarely, <Col N="96" /> if ever, violate the law but it is nearly impossible for them to keep within the law when other boys can come in and use trucks and overload them to cut prices. This price-cutting is affecting the livelihood of the needy and it is costing this country dearly in maintenance of roads. If the weighbridge system was operated on an eight or nine hour day constantly and provided emergency service, overloading and short haulage would be forgotten. Trucks running short distances with big loads and driving very fast are playing havoc with our roads, particularly our county roads.  If we had a proper weighbridge service those trucks could be pulled in at any time of the day.  Trucks would have to keep to the regulated weight and that would in the long run save the Government and the country much money and many problems.</P>
    <P>In all fairness, the drivers of those trucks are great men.  Take the number of trucks that are on the road, the loads they have to carry and the frustration of enduring various regulations.  We talk about them speeding, but I would not like to see that being carried too far. When a man comes up to Dublin, it could take him an hour to get from Lucan down to the docks.  Is it fair that that tachograph time should be booked up against him? What does he do?  Does he stop at Castlebar on the way home if he has to go to Westport, or at Boyle if he has to go to Sligo?  He can be held up going through Longford, another bottleneck as regards time.  We should consider truck drivers who are caught so frequently in rush hours in traffic.  We should have a system designed on the hours a haulier is driving, not on the hours between when he gets into a truck and when he gets out of it. In that way we could be of great help to people concerned in truck driving.</P>
    <P>This matter needs careful consideration. I would not like to see too much harassment, so to speak, of lorry drivers.  Until such time as we make our laws so watertight that men coming from the Continent, from England or elsewhere all have the same advantage the position will remain unsatisfactory.  At the moment the man who is operating <Col N="97" /> from here with the price of trucks as it is and so on is working under a grave disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Information I have here indicates that 35 tonnes is the load for a four axle truck. I am reliably informed that if the same load were carried by fixed truck with a trailer this country would be saved millions of pounds.  The articulated trucks and juggernauts should never have been permitted to come in here.  Even at this late stage it might be wise of us to consider how we might rearrange the whole truck scene.</P>
    <P>This motion takes into account also the private motorist, and in this regard we should have a very close system of monitoring. I agree with the Senator who referred to crashed cars.  At present we have a big problem with crashed cars being brought in from England.  They are being sold cheap, but are they cheap? Are they cheap when you go through them with a fine comb after they have broken down and you realise that you are not buying one car cheap but three cars put into one and no car in the end?  We will have to come to grips with the question of importation of cheap cars.  Cars that are written off should be written off here, in England and in every country and should not be allowed back on the market.  We will have to look very seriously at that problem which is facing the Irish motorist and the Irish motor traders.  The trouble is that a man thinks he is buying a car, but he is not getting a bargain.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider those matters, maybe to relax a little on the tachograph and give consideration to hold-ups, etc.  Let me ask him again to bring in the 40 tons regulation and enforce it rigidly.  I hope he will see some way to have not alone spot checks for the weighing of vehicles &mdash; those are not sufficient &mdash; but a stand-by service when a truck is required to be weighed.  Within one month of coming in to this country an imported truck should have to pass the MOT test.</P>

      <P>I have no problem with the motion or the amendments.  I am pleased that the amendments are put in because they put the motion in context in that if we have a law applying to any road it will apply to all of the roads.  From the occasional accusations made against the Minister about county roads or roads which are maintained by the county council solely he will be aware that the condition of some of these roads does not lend itself to safe traffic and particularly the heavy trucks that are using the roads nowadays, be they milk tankers or school buses.  Many of the county roads and non-route roads are totally unsuitable for the demands made on them and our job as local authority members to keep them up to the standard required for the kind of vehicular traffic on them is rendered impossible.  If I had my way I would allow no juggernauts or high load traffic on any of our roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The loads such vehicles carry should be on the railways &mdash; considering that we have an integrated national rail network for carrying goods to docks for export and otherwise.  If we could keep as much goods as possible on rail we would cut down overall expenditure on the national primary routes.  It has become popular in recent years to transport everything by road and, as my colleague Senator Byrne has said, it is impossible at times for ordinary vehicular traffic to use the roads safely and in comfort because of the speeds of some of this heavy traffic, the type of loads which it carries and the obligation on carriers of some loads to declare publicly the substances they are carrying.  I was amazed recently at some of the scares that had been created by containers bringing toxic substances and pulling up for a lunchtime break in the middle of a rural town without a declaration to that effect.  If an accident occurred, much damage could <Col N="99" /> be caused by such vehicles parked in public places.  That is why I am anxious to have the largest volume of such goods carried on rail.  It would be safer and CIE are now geared to do this kind of work.</P>
    <P>I am not sure whether the motion infers that there is no enforcement of the existing laws.  Within the limitations on the Garda they are pretty diligent about enforcing the law in all the areas mentioned in this motion and in the amendments particularly in the areas relating to drunken driving and tax and insurance. We have come a long way in this regard. The obligation to put an insurance certificate on the windscreen of motor cars was a welcome change in the law, because people can immediately know whether a vehicle is insured.  The fact that there is mandatory loss of licence for people who are guilty of drunken driving must be a disincentive to people to drive a vehicle in an unfit condition.  Recently, because of technicalities in the Department of Justice summonses issued in this area were quashed.  Thankfully that was also tidied up.  Generally speaking, we want road users to be conscious of their responsibilities to other road users and indeed to pedestrians and children.  One dreads the thought of tragic accidents particularly for public representatives who drive thousands of miles per week scurrying around between clinics and meetings.  Whereas the Minister may be exempt in his ministerial car driven by a Garda driver&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I said &ldquo;Whereas the Minister may be.&rdquo;  I did not say he was exempt, because I know of some junior Ministers who were not and who discovered it to their grief.  When Ministers have a Garda escort it is presumed that they can scurry along; but we know that we have to be cautious and careful in our constituencies over the week-ends even when we are so busy.  We would like to know that it is safe to be out on the roads, <Col N="100" /> as we are required to be on the roads late at night.</P>
      <P>There have been some excellent contributions on this Bill from people like Senator Farrell who is an expert in the area.  We talked about the lorry driver and the lone juggernaut driver, the man who drives late at night and sleeps in the cab.  I however, am worried about the responsibility of the employee in regard to tax and insurance.  If an employer does not adequately tax or insure his vehicle the driver is technically at fault.  I have one driver in my constituency who is perpetually in court as a result of the inability of his employer to do the right thing.  It is the employee who ends up in court. The employer is never taken to court although he is the owner of the vehicle and he is responsible for it.  The law should be specific as to who is responsible for having tax and insurance on the truck and for having it roadworthy.  Is it the responsibility of the driver or of the owner?  From my experience with summons to employees, the responsibility is obviously the drivers.  Naturally, a driver working for a company cannot tell his boss that he should do such a thing, and he would not be capable of doing it himself. I have strings of appeals to the Minister for Justice to ensure that ordinary working people are not submitted to jail sentences for non-payment of extraordinary fines, for not having carried out the basics in the area of the provision of tax and insurance.</P>
      <P>Senator Byrne mentioned another phenomenon of recent years, that is the nondescript trading that seems to go on on the national primary route.  One never sees it on the country roads because customers are scarce on the country roads. All these elite itinerants who are not tinkers and who are not poor, sweep in and out of areas on the national primary route, and set up shop on the roadside creating a traffic hazard, and the planning law cannot stop them.  We have requested the Customs and Excise people to come out and check the vehicles.  We do not know whether they are taxed or insured or whether the goods for sale have VAT applied to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="101" /> One of the problems in relation to enforcing the law is the number of people we have on the ground to enforce the laws.  Other countries have electronic equipment which does not need manpower to operate it, to monitor vehicles breaking the speed limit.  Here we all flash our lights to warn on-coming cars that a Garda is on the road with a blue striped car; so the Garda is wasting his time.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about carriers of offensive offal driving through towns and villages.  They are required under legislation to have these containers airtight, watertight and covered to avoid annoyance, and spillage in towns and villages. This is not happening.  In my constituency the town of Cahir is plagued with this. Unless we can get the number of the offending vehicle it is very difficult to do anything about it.  Under the Road Traffic Act we should be able to tidy up the responsibility of the Garda in that area. At present the responsibility rests with the local authority.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister in the overall parameters of the budget, will tell us that he will not be able to double the Garda force, which is the only way to meet the sentiments expressed by Senator McGowan and his colleagues.  But at least, this motion has allowed us an opportunity to remind the Minister of his responsibilities in the area of the non-routes and the county roads, to try to bring them up to the standard that would be required to make them safe for the use of vehicular traffic.  At the moment with the bad condition of the roads and because of uncut hedges and so on such traffic as articulated trucks, milk containers and school buses are unsafe at any speed.  I hope, as Senator Joe Doyle said, that road users will behave responsibly when driving a machine that could be deadly if not driven properly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not attempting unrealistically or from a sentimental point of view to oppose the closing of Dr. Steevens Hospital even though this is an institution with a very ancient, venerable and distinguished history in serving the needs of the poor of the city of Dublin.  I think it is worth looking a little bit at the history of this hospital because it is one of the voluntary hospitals.  It emerged during a period of our history when there was a polarisation between those who had access to some degree of medical services and those who did not and I might, for the Minister's enjoyment and erudition, quote from a very exhaustive history of Dr. Steevens Hospital something I am <Col N="103" /> sure he will wish to bear in mind to communicate to his Cabinet colleagues.  I refer to page 4 of the History of Dr. Steevens Hospital where the following passage occurs:</P>
      <P>For well-nigh 200 years these institutions have given to the poor shelter and assistance in time of sickness, have helped to enlarge the boundaries of our knowledge, and have done much to alleviate the catastrophies resulting from the mistakes and ineptitude of politicians.</P>
      <P>It would seem to some people that there has been at least a degree of ineptitude in the way in which the fate of this hospital has been handled.  What I wish to do during the 20 minutes allotted to me is to demonstrate a principle I have consistently sought to uphold in this House, that is, that the underlying philosophy regarding cuts, which may very well be necessary, is an important duty of politicians to ascertain and to lay down these guidelines for those involved in implementing any such cuts.  I do not believe, and I am certainly not convinced by the evidence that has been presented to me, some which I have with me tonight, that this has been done in this case.  Certainly the public and the media do not seem to feel that this has been the case.  I refer to an inch high headline in the <i>Evening Press</i> of Thursday 24 September &ldquo;Government U-turn Means Hospital Reprieve&rdquo;.  It may or may not be a U-turn.  A U-turn may be an emotive title but it does come from a paper that is not noted for its trenchant criticisms of the Government party.  It is less surprising to find in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the following day, 25 September, a short report concerning &ldquo;Department `blunder' over hospital&rdquo;, the first paragraph of which reads:</P>
      <P>The decision to allow Dr. Steevens Hospital, in Dublin to remain open for three months more, just a week before it was due to close, showed up a complete lack of planning by the Department of Health, it was claimed last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="104" /> It is to this apparent lack of planning that I shall address my remarks and I hope the Minister will address his remarks to the same subject at least in some detail.</P>
    <P>It is particularly appropriate that this debate should have been called for this evening because this very day, 30 September 1987, is the day on which the hospital was scheduled to close and yet a reprieve has been granted for three months.  Whatever about the details of the political inter-play, the medical politics involved &mdash; and I recognise that this whole area of medical politics is very much a minefield &mdash; it seems that there has been some confusion.  Certainly I would feel that the interests of patients must have suffered because they have been left in a very indecisive state.  It seems to me that it is a test, and a very important test, of a civilised society to determine how it treats those who have the misfortune to be sick and vulnerable.</P>
    <P>I should like, in parenthesis, also to say I recognise that this is only one of a number of hospitals that has had to close. There is some concern about the fact that the era of the voluntary element in hospitals appears to be drawing to a close, this amateur aspect of hospital life which many people feel had a positive social value.  With regard to that I would like to say &mdash; and I hope this will be communicated to the Government &mdash; how very disturbed I was to hear last week reports on Radio Éireann broadcasts of the closure of what was described as a Protestant hospital in Cork.  I am very sorry indeed that there should be Protestant hospitals or Roman Catholic hospitals.  I note that part of this process of the closure of Dr. Steevens Hospital is part of a process towards a centralisation, towards a rationalisation, towards a concentration of medical resources on behalf of the whole community.  I look for an assurance from the Minister that, in this process of concentration, when these great new hospitals at Beaumont and Tallaght and so on are established they will be established for all the people and that no such intolerable excrescences as ethical committees which preclude citizens of <Col N="105" /> this country from a legitimate medical procedure will be tolerated at the expense of the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I should like to go through a brief history of what I understand has occurred in the matter of Dr. Steevens Hospital. In 1978 in concurrence with the report of Comhairle na nOspidéal it was decided to locate as much federated hospitals orthopaedics in Dr. Steevens Hospital as possible.  The document, &ldquo;Development of Orthopaedic Services &mdash; A Discussion Document&rdquo; concludes on page 12 that there are plans to centralise elective orthopaedics in one centre, namely, Dr. Steevens Hospital.  For the benefit of those who like myself until recently were not quite sure what elective orthopaedics might entail, as I understand it, it means hip replacements, treatment of backs and so on, in other words non-traumatic, nonlife threatening procedures.  At the same time it would be unwise to regard these as not serious because my information is that if this report had been fully followed through and if the orthopaedic unit at Dr. Steevens Hospital had been made what it very well could have been, the best and most centralised site for this kind of work, it would have been possible to turn round somebody who had a serious back ailment inside six months and return them to work instead of as at present taking longer than two years.  My information is &mdash; and I could back this up statistically &mdash; that somebody who is out of work for over two years with serious back pain is very unlikely to return to productive work.  So there is a loss to the economy by virtue of the fact that our procedures are not sufficiently efficient in this regard.</P>
    <P>I should like also in passing to remark on the fact that investment in this hospital was apparently continuing until very recently indeed.  I can produce some facts and figures which will demonstrate that this is not just some academic speculation of my own but actually does have substance. For example, over the past ten years a casualty facility was provided costing £300,000; new operating theatre costing £1,250,000; a physiotherapy unit, £200,000; a burns unit, £150,000; an <Col N="106" /> intensive care unit £100,000; ward renovations, £500,000.  In other words, £2½ million of public money was invested.  It seems to me that it was remarkably poor housekeeping to invest this kind of money if there was a long term intention to close down this facility.</P>
    <P>This seems to be something on which the Department have never been sufficiently clear.  This is made manifest by the fact that it is precisely this kind of problem that they addressed belatedly in a letter dated 22 September 1987 to the Chairman of the Board of Dr. Steevens Hospital.  The Secretary of the General Hospital Services Division, Mr. Phelan, stated:</P>
    <P>It is now clear that the capital works needed to receive the services at St. James's and the Meath/Adelaide will not be completed until late November/early December.</P>
    <P>It is rather late in the day to discover that when the hospital is supposed to close on 30 September.  It took them until 22 September to discover that the facilities intended to receive these patients at the other hospitals to which they were to be directed would not be ready for at least three months.  My information is that it is very likely to be considerably later than that.  There is evidence here of some degree of U-turn.</P>
    <P>The report of Comhairle na n-Ospidéal also suggested that it would be improper procedure to have one elective orthopaedic centre for the entire system of Dublin, the population being so large. They recommended, and this was not contradicted by departmental information, that there should be two such centres, one on the south side and one on the north side.  It is also clear from the figures that the cost of treating a patient in Dr. Steevens Hospital represented a very efficient factor.  I do not wish to spend too much time reading too many statistics into the record but figures are available to prove that.  I have before me figures which show that Dr. Steevens Hospital were very efficient in their handling, in a financial sense, of the patients under their care.  In January 1987 there <Col N="107" /> was a meeting with the Department of Health which confirmed the continuation of orthopaedics at Dr. Steevens Hospital until the Tallaght Hospital was built.  I have confirmation of that in a series of letters, particularly one of 26 January 1987 from J. O'Dwyer, Assistant Secretary of the Department of Health in which he stated:</P>
    <P>The role of Dr. Steevens as the nucleus of a regional orthopaedic unit pending transfer to Tallaght, including clarification of the number of beds in the medium and long term, should be determined as soon as possible.  A small team representative of the hospital and the Department should assess the implications and develop an outline plan for implementation once the role has been clarified.  We will take the initiative on this matter.</P>
    <P>No such initiative was taken.  The letter continues:</P>
    <P>Planning of facilities for the nucleus of the regional orthopaedic unit at Dr. Steevens, or one of the hospitals to be vacated circa 1993, might proceed on the basis that it will remain in service for about 20 years.</P>
    <P>Therefore, at the beginning of 1987 the Department of Health certainly appeared to give Dr. Steevens Hospital a tentative assurance at the very least that the forward planning was that for 20 years these facilities were going to be concentrated, improved and made excellent on the site of Dr. Steevens Hospital pending a transfer somewhere in the nineties to the new hospital at Tallaght which, as we know, has not commenced.</P>
    <P>In April 1987 the allocation to Dr. Steevens Hospital for the year was reduced by 18 per cent which, in real terms, taking into account inflation and some other factors, comes to about 25 per cent.  Hospital boards consist of responsible people and it is not possible for them to continue providing services for the community on this kind of basis. In other words, they were instructed to trim their sails and there were very clear <Col N="108" /> conclusions to be drawn from the method in which their sails had to be trimmed.  In May 1987 the board wrote to the Department saying that accident and emergency units would have to close in order to keep inside the budget as directed by the Department of Health.  In June 1987 the accident and emergency services were transferred to the Meath Hospital.</P>
    <P>The correspondence to which I have been given access indicates clearly that the board of Dr. Steevens Hospital were placing themselves in a negotiating posture. I have a letter from Mr. Hope, Secretary-Manager of Dr. Steevens Hospital, dated 6 May 1987, in which he said that these services should be sustained but they had been taken into the hospital's plan because funding had not been made available to sustain them.  His letter continued:</P>
    <P>In the matter of the proposal for closing the accident and emergency unit, the date of its closing would be Sunday 31 May which will be confirmed by the Governors of the hospital at their regular meeting on 27 instant.</P>
    <P>It does not take a great deal of decoding of the kind of to and fro between hospital officials and departmental officials to realise that this was an invitation for discussion and that the decision had not been made finally.  The letter stated that it was to be confirmed later.</P>
    <P>In July 1987 a letter arrived from the Department of Health requesting the transfer of other services out of Dr. Steevens Hospital.  The board of the hospital replied saying that they wished to retain orthopaedics in line with departmental policy.  I want to underline that. The Department of Health, however, replied by a further cut in the allocation of £600,000 in order to pay for accident and emergency facilities to be provided at the Meath Hospital.  In other words, having attempted to live inside their budget, the board of Dr. Steevens Hospital were rewarded by having implemented a further cut which made the question of survival extremely problematic.</P>
    <P>In August 1987 there was quite a lot of <Col N="109" /> fairly frenetic activity on the part of the Department to find alternative accommodation for the specialities in Dr. Steevens.  It is worth nothing, in parenthesis, that Dr. Steevens Hospital represented a valuable asset in the sense that it was a concentration of specialities.  By this time the Department were finding difficulty in providing alternative sites and resources.  Considerable action was taken with regard to redeployment and redundancy but no provision was made until 23 September for continuing services while alternative accommodation was prepared.  Doctors and patients did not know where treatment was to be continued. This is a serious matter.  I speak about this with some feeling because for the past couple of days I have had a back problem.  I can understand and sympathise particularly with people who are ill and are not quite sure where they are going to wind up at the end of the week. That is the position in which the Department of Health appear to have left people in Dr. Steevens Hospital.</P>
    <P>In September 1987 the Department of Health asked the board of Dr. Steevens to continue the services until 31 December 1987 and promised to fund them until then.  The officials of the Department say they are now anxious to meet the Institute of Orthopaedics to discuss rationalisation of the orthopaedic service. That has been described to me as the stable door mentality by a distinguished surgeon.  I understand him to mean that this is closing the stable door after the horse has bolted but it seems more like trying to back a frightened horse in through a stable door that has been already closed.  I do not think it is a particularly productive line of action for the Department of Health to be engaged in.</P>
    <P>I should like to tell the Minister that I do not intend just to criticise cuts.  I have spoken on the health cuts on a number of occasions principally from the point of view of patients and I am sure the Minister and the Government will agree that it is the interests of patients that must be served in the long term.  I am not demanding that Dr. Steevens Hospital be kept open.  I am not making a plea about <Col N="110" /> the beautiful and famous Worth Library or the architectural merit of the building because I am sure they will be looked after, but we are entitled to a rational, coherent and consistent policy on the part of the Department of Health.  The closure of the hospital is a clear example of some confusion in the Department which I hope will not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>My final comment is that everything appears, in a curious way, to have been planned backwards.  The planning for this development should have been decided before the decision was taken, and it was clearly taken, to close the hospital.  Then, if closure was inevitable, that closure should have been taken like a military retreat, in an orderly and responsible fashion.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Minister should meet with the Institute of Orthopaedics. This is a body representing professional orthopaedic surgeons and consultants and they must be taken into account. They are a very valuable asset to this country.  The plan totally contradicts &mdash; to the layman, at least &mdash; all previous policy, including various documents which I have introduced as evidence this evening.  The cost of implementing the closure of Dr. Steevens Hospital could be at least as great if not greater than keeping it open and there has been, as I have indicated, a very substantial investment in plans and equipment, particularly, for example, a sterile air unit which is necessary for hip replacement operations.</P>
    <P>The Minister should put this plan on hold until consultations with the Institute of Orthopaedics are complete and then carry out this procedure which, regrettable as it may be, may very well be in the best interests of the health service.  I would not criticise if this was done in this fashion.  In the meantime, there should be an undertaking from the Minister and from the Government that the services that exist in Dr. Steevens Hospital should be maintained at an adequate level.  It is a fine hospital.  There is a tradition of excellent nursing and care there and excellent medical attention and as a tribute to all the medical staff and the <Col N="111" /> patients who have traditionally been well treated in this hospital, it is not a great deal to ask that some degree of security should be given to those patients and some undertaking be given that adequate services in the meantime will be maintained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden) Terry Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to express my thanks to Senator Norris for his contribution.  Indeed, I appreciate the concern expressed by the Senator and I would like to take this opportunity to explain the short-term difficulties which have arisen and the need to rationalise hospital services, particularly in the Dublin area.  We have to face up to the reality and the need to bring expenditure into line with what we can realistically support and what is sustainable.  I am satisfied from my own experience that the many reports which have been completed on the subject and from the information available to the Department that there is scope for a reduction in the number of acute beds in the system.</P>
      <P>We have embarked in this country over the past decade on a major development programme in our general hospital system.  This has culminated in the upgrading of many existing hospitals and the building of a number of major new hospitals.  The underlying rationale behind this programme has been that in the interests of efficiency a lesser number of larger-sized hospitals was preferable to a large number of small hospitals.  It was also envisaged that the programme would entail the closure of a number of older hospitals to enable the new development to come on stream.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of Dr. Steevens Hospital it was always envisaged that the burns unit and related element in the hospital would be transferred to St. James's Hospital when the appropriate facilities became available on completion of phase 1C of the new hospital on that site.  It was also planned to transfer the orthopaedic unit at the hospital to the new Tallaght Hospital to form the nucleus of a south-side regional elective orthopaedic unit. <Col N="112" /> For a number of reasons, not least of which is the need to concentrate essential activities in a smaller number of locations and eliminate avoidable management and maintenance overheads, it is now necessary and appropriate to advance this programme.  While this advancement has created difficulties for all concerned in the short term, it is the best option available in creating a rational, cost effective arrangement of services in those hospitals which will become the new Tallaght Hospital.  It will enable all the key services planned for the new hospital to be brought together, hopefully under unified management, in the facilities now occupied by the Adelaide, Meath and National Children's hospitals.  This will have the benefit of providing a more effective and efficient service in the interim and of easing the problem of transfer to the new site at Tallaght.</P>
    <P>Dr. Steevens Hospital is now due for closure on 31 December, 1987.  With the co-operation of all the parties it will be possible to effect the closure with minimal disruption of services and without imposing hardship on staff.  It was always envisaged that time would be needed to adapt the accommodation at St. James's Hospital and the Meath and Adelaide Hospitals for the transfer of services from Dr. Steevens Hospital.  A technical assessment of these works could not be undertaken until the hospital board had agreed to transfer these services.  In the event, the board set the date of 30 September as the closure date with consultation with my Department.  The board of the hospital has agreed to allow services to remain at Dr. Steevens Hospital until the new facilities are available. There was no U-turn as the Department of Health and the hospital management had agreed in August that this situation was likely to arise.  The alternative would have been to leave patients without services &mdash; a situation which the hospital, the Minister, and I am sure the Senator, would not wish to see arise.</P>
    <P>As Senators will be aware, the Government have now taken decisions in relation to the terms which will apply to the health <Col N="113" /> services staff in relation to such matters as redundancy, early retirement and redeployment.  It is the Government's wish that any essential reductions in staff required by the health agencies should be made on a voluntary basis.  Redeployment is being used to the maximum to preserve employment.  The terms decided are aimed to allay the fears of staff who are understandably concerned about the implications for them of the rationalisation of the health services.  The terms are generous, particularly having regard to the very difficult financial situation facing the Government.  This clearly indicates the Government's concern that the staff of the health services who have served the community well and will continue to do so should be treated fairly and that the management of the process of rationalisation should be as orderly as possible.</P>
    <P>Since the board of Dr. Steevens Hospital announced closure of the hospital and agreed to facilitate the transfer of services to James's, Meath, Adelaide and National Children's hospitals, officials of my Department have been meeting regularly with all concerned to ensure a quick and smooth transfer of services.  A very broad measure of agreement has now been reached and the final details of the necessary adaptation in the existing hospitals and the future distribution of beds are being determined this week.</P>
    <P>Plastic surgery, maxilla facial surgery and burns treatment are to transfer to St. James's Hospital.  The transfer should be in place around the end of November. Accident and emergency services recently provided in Dr. Steevens Hospital have already transferred to the <Col N="114" /> Meath and Adelaide hospitals.  Orthopaedic services will also be provided at these hospitals with the transfer taking place before the end of the year.  In the interim, services other than accident and emergency will, by agreement with the Board of Governors of Dr. Steevens Hospital continue to be provided on the Dr. Steevens campus up to 31 December 1987.</P>
    <P>The future use of the hospital building is a matter which will be examined closely by the hospital board and my Department. I am sure that when considering the future of the building everyone will bear in mind the historical significance of the main hospital building and its unique library &mdash; the Worth Library.  I would like to assure Senators that every effort will continue to be made to protect the interests of patients, staff and management in effecting the transfer of services from Dr. Steevens Hospital.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to put on record the co-operation which the Department have received from the boards and managements of the hospitals, the medical consultants and the many categories of staff involved in planning and carrying out what has been a very difficult exercise under considerable constraints.  I have no doubt that the services offered by Dr. Steevens Hospital will continue to be held in very high regard in their new location and that the historic contribution which Dr. Steevens Hospital has made since its foundation will continue to sustain the spirit of caring and innovation in health services in this country.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 7 October, 1987.</P>
