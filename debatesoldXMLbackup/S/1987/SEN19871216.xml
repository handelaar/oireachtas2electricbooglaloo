      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Order of Business, I should like to express sympathy to the families of Dónall Ó Conalláin and Seán Brosnahan, two former Members of this House who served both this House and the nation extremely well for quite a number of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to be <Col N="2" /> associated with the vote of sympathy.  I worked closely with the late Seán Brosnahan. He will be sadly missed.  He made a great impact on Irish education and the development of education at primary level over the past 40 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with the tributes that have been paid to the late Seán Brosnahan and the late Dónall Ó Conalláin.  I join in the sympathy that has been extended to their families.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with the expression of sympathy to both families.  Seán Brosnahan was elected in 1961 on the same day as I was elected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to <Col N="3" /> be associated with the expression of sympathy to the families of both former Members.  Like my colleague, Senator Willie Ryan, I had the pleasure of working and serving with both former Senators for many years here.  One can say without any doubt that the tributes paid to them are well deserved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with the expressions of sympathy to the families of the two former Senators.  I knew Seán Brosnahan as general secretary of the Irish National Teachers Organisation of which I was then a member and during the time when the general secretaries of that type of organisation were held in high esteem.  I would like to remember&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like to be associated with the two votes of sympathy. I, too, knew Senator Seán Brosnahan through his activities in the Irish National Teachers Organisation.  I would like to endorse what my colleague, Senator O'Toole, said.  His contribution to Irish education was immense.  Go ndéana Dia trócaire ar a anam dílis.  Go raibh maith agat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with the other speakers on the vote of sympathy to both families.  Jackie Brosnahan, as we knew him affectionately down in Tralee, came from my town and it is very sad to see him pass away from us.</P>

      <P>I would like, as Cathaoirleach, to be associated with all the remarks and with the votes of sympathy. I knew the two men.  I did not have the honour to serve with either but <Col N="4" /> I knew Jackie Brosnahan more closely as an executive member of NAMHI.  He and I served for many years and we were good friends.  May God rest both their souls.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator Michael Ferris that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>In view of the killing in recent days of a number of Palestinian people on the West Bank and Gaza, the need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to make a statement regarding Government policy on the matter.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Patrick Kennedy of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The abolition of An Foras Forbartha.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Paul Bradford of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to ensure the continuation and development of Mallow General Hospital's acute facilities and to insist that the necessary level of funding is provided to it.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Katharine Bulbulia of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to indicate his attitude towards the granting of statutory registration for physiotherapists in view of the fact that assurances have been given by successive Ministers that such registration would be forthcoming.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Brian O'Shea of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to rescind his decision to abolish the local health advisory committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="5" /> I also received notice from Senator Joe Doyle of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The urgent need for the Minister for the Environment to make financial assistance available to facilitate the introduction of smoke free zones under the Air Pollution Act in view of the very serious deterioration of air quality in Dublin city.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator John Connor of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Energy to provide or seek sufficient funding to ensure the continued development programme under the Bog Development Act of 1981.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Ferris, Kennedy, Bradford, O'Shea, Doyle and Connor as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Ferris' motion and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Kennedy, Bradford, O'Shea, Doyle and Connor may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>
    <P>I regret I have to rule that the matter raised by Senator Bulbulia is not suitable for discussion on the ground that it involves legislation.</P>
    <P>Therefore we will take the matter raised by Senator Ferris at the conclusion of business tonight at whatever time that may be.  The Leader of the House, Senator Lanigan, on the Order of Business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Items Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 15.  It is intended to take all stages of Item No. 2 today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not opposing the Order of Business or anything like that but I am complaining about the way in which business is presented.  This is what happens at this time every year.  Suddenly we are asked to take a whole series of business through all stages in the last two <Col N="6" /> or three days of the session.  Most of the Bills coming before us this week could well have appeared before us over the past number of weeks.  We are being asked to rush through them.  This is not the way in which we should order business. My criticism is not of the Leader of the House or of his Whip.  It is of this Government and the former Government and all Governments who dump in legislation on the last couple of days of every session.  It is not good enough.</P>
      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House at what stage are a number of important Bills which now seem to be in limbo: the Adoption (No. 2) Bill, the Companies (No. 2) Bill and the Insurance Bill?  The Companies (No. 2) Bill started off here last April or May and it now seems to have disappeared.  If I could have information on those I would be grateful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed to see that the Leader of the House has once again failed to order Item No. 14: the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1987.  The Leader of the House in discussions with me gave me an undertaking that the matter would be ordered.  It seems to have in some sense been overtaken by events.  I would point out to the Leader of the House that the Bill seeks to amend the 1987 Act whereas what we discussed recently was amending a former Act.  It seems to me that, first of all, there has been a breach of faith on the part of the Leader of the House in that he gave me a firm guarantee that this matter would be ordered and that it would be discussed.  I recognise his party have had difficulties in that direction but the internal difficulties of a party must be subservient to the need to legislate and to examine legislation.</P>

      <P>Could I ask for the protection of the Chair?  It is disgraceful we got guarantees three times in the last month from the Leader of the House that the Companies (No. 2) Bill would be dealt with the following week.  We got similar guarantees at various stages about the Adoption (No. 2) Bill and the Insurance Bill.  It should be seen as bad management on somebody's part that we are not discussing them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Also on a different matter altogether I would like to inquire why it is that we sat for one day two weeks ago when all this business was in front of us.  There has been a change and we are not faced with trying to rush through matter which we had plenty of time to debate at an earlier stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Item No. 15 is a formal proposal to introduce a Bill.  The Leader of the House has listed it last on the Order of Business.  May I ask, as it is a formality, that it be taken at the commencement of business?  If the Leader of the House would agree I would be very grateful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support what my colleague Senator Joe O'Toole has said about Item No. 14, the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) (Amendment) Bill.  I was the seconder of that Bill, I totally concur with what he says.  I would also like to have a ruling on an important matter which I have attempted to have a <Col N="8" /> ruling on before, that is, that when this matter was urged by me previously the House was told that it could not be discussed because it was being discussed simultaneously in Dáil Éireann.  A very important point arises and requires to be clarified on the record of the House and, that is, that there is no prohibition on this House discussing matters that are being discussed in the Lower House.  I would like a ruling placed on the record.  Otherwise the record of the House shows something that I believe is inaccurate.  I would like also to ask if I could have from the Leader of the House some information as to when Item No. 46 will be taken. That is the motion on the Soviet Refusniks because in a similar way to the way in which Senator O'Toole feels he was misled about the timescale within which the Extradition (Amendment) Bill would be produced, I was given a number of undertakings by Senator Lanigan with regard to this motion.  Over four weeks ago I was told it would be taken within the next three weeks.  I would like to have some indication so that I can prepare a proper brief.</P>
      <P>May I ask for information on one final point, that is, with regard to the Government's programme of legislation?  My attention has been drawn to the fact that we are in breach of our obligations in a technical matter by virtue of the fact that the Government have not introduced legislation on the regulation of semi-conductor topographies.  We were obliged, by agreement with the United States of America, as part of our obligations to the European Community to protect this technical data in this country, to enter legislation before 7 November which has now passed.  I am simply outlining that we have an obligation to introduce this so I wish to know when the Government will do it because otherwise Irish industry will suffer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem with the Order of Business but on the point raised by Senator Manning, the Leader of the House has indicated the items we are taking but he has not indicated the Stages on which we will take them.  In view of <Col N="9" /> all the comments that have been made by the Senators on this side of the House, could the Leader of the House tell us whether it is his intention to sit up to and including Christmas Eve to facilitate us?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris, you will not be allowed to answer me back but for your information what goes on in the other House is of no importance to me here.  The Seanad is master of its own business.  The Leader of the House to reply and to conclude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is as I have said.  I think it would be useful if we took item No. 15 first, the Control of Clinical Trials Bill can come next and then the Valuation Bill and the Transport Bill.  Whether or not we conclude the business ordered depends on the progress of the work in the House today.  It is highly unlike that we will be able to finish No. 5 and No. 6.  Number 1 will be concluded and No. 2 will be concluded.  We will deal with Second Stage of Item No. 3 us far as we can.  We will definitely take Item No. 4 because it is an order in draft which should go through without very much time being taken.  On the question of semi-conductors raised by Senator Norris, I will express his viewpoint to the Government and we will see what the Government have to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the rushing of business through this House at this stage, nothing in particular on the Order of Business is being rushed.  The Transport Bill went through the Dáil yesterday, so we could not take it until today.  The Valuation Bill is being presented here and the Control of Clinical Trials Bill is back here as a result of a minor amendment that was made to a Bill passed here.  The Social <Col N="10" /> Welfare Bill will be taken tomorrow. There is a fisheries Bill which will be concluded before Christmas.  There is the Science and Technology Bill which will be concluded before Christmas.</P>
    <P>There is the Transport Bill which will be concluded before Christmas and the Appropriations Bill.  It is intended that we should take that on Friday when the Dáil has finished its business on it and, by agreement between the Whips it can be dealt with in the usual manner whereby we pass the Bill and discuss it during the next session.  On Item No. 46, due to the fact that there is a certain amount of Government business before us which has to be got through before Christmas, all I can say is that we will take Item No. 46 as soon as possible.  Item No. 14 is not being ordered.  We will not be sitting on Christmas Eve.  Items Nos. 8, 9 and 10 are Bills to which there has been a huge input by interested parties, particularly Nos. 8 and 9.  There are continuing implications for business, for the insured and the insurers in the Insurance Bill and the Companies (No. 2) Bill has to be very carefully considered.  We will be taking them as soon as possible.  We will go back to the Government and get them as soon as possible.  We will take Item No. 10 as early as possible in the New Year.</P>

      <P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil.  In accordance with Standing Order 82, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question that the Bill be <Col N="12" /> received for final consideration, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil and this is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad.  The only matter, therefore, that may be discussed is the amendments made by the Dáil.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to bring this important Bill back to this House.  This complex and technical Bill was initiated in the Seanad where it was discussed at great length by Senators. As a result of the constructive contribution of Senators, 56 amendments were incorporated into the Bill and it is widely acknowledged that the in-depth debate in the Seanad greatly facilitated its passage through the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The Bill, as it now stands, provides comprehensive safeguards and constitutes a solid framework for the control of clincial trials.  A small number of amendments were made in the Dáil and I am sure Senators will agree that the nature of these amendments further underlines the dual goals of the Bill which are to provide an effective system of control over clinical trials to protect participants in such trials and, at the same time, to facilitate legitimate research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the discussion on Committee Stage in the Dáil on the Bill the Minister undertook to re-examine section 2 as drafted.  He referred to the need to bear in mind that the protection of the interests of participants in trials was of the utmost importance.  To this end it was proposed in relation to trials specified in subsection (2) of section 2 to include an additional safeguard to the extent that the National Drugs Advisory Board had to satisfy themselves with the <Col N="13" /> compostion of a committee appointed to consider the justification for the conducting the proposed clinical trial and the circumstances in which the trial is to be conducted.  The committee would in effect, be an ethics committee but not one to which the statutory requirements for ethics committees specified in the Bill would apply.  The need to build into the Bill a requirement that a third party would have a vetting role in relation to clinical trials using medical products which have a product authorisation has been mentioned by a number of competent organisations and persons on a number of occasions.  The first amendment was, therefore, incorporated in the Bill to further strengthen section 2 (2).</P>

      <P>It is a complex Bill.  I do not think this will take long.  It would certainly be simpler to take each amendment and make a brief contribution on it.  I accept totally the objective of this amendment as inserted in the Dáil.  I <Col N="14" /> simply wanted to ask the Minister how the National Drugs Advisory Board would be expected to satisfy themselves in relation to the composition of the committee. What would be the criteria that would be applied by the National Drugs Advisory Board?  Presumably the type of person who sat on this committee would be the normal type of person on an ethics committee.  I am just concerned to know the scope of the power because it is rather generally phrased and, as the Minister said, it is a third party satisfying itself on the composition of a committee.  It would be helpful if there were some indication of what the criteria would be for being satisfied about the composition of the committee.</P>

      <P>The Department will be preparing guidelines for the National Drugs Advisory Board in connection with the composition of the ethics committees and may I remind the Seanad that, in fact, 56 amendments were actually accepted by the Seanad.  I would like to compliment the Seanad.  This shows the justification for having technical business of this nature debated by this House because of the number of amendments that came from here.  It meant that the passage of the Bill through the Dáil was far more speedy than it would be normally. The amendments coming back are very small amendments to the Bill.  They do not change it that much.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the amendments passed by the Dáil.  As the Minister has rightly said, in the Seanad it was seen as a major Bill.  It received a great deal of attention from all sides of the House.  I enjoyed debating it.  At the time I can recall visiting ICP and other places that engage in clinical trials to find out the best way forward for the business. We are confirming that the National Drugs Advisory Board are satisfied with the composition of the committee.  It must be remembered that this is a major victory for the National Drugs Advisory Board because in the original Bill they were not mentioned.  There was no formal recognition of the National Drugs <Col N="15" /> Advisory Board who were recognised world-wide as an authority in the field. This amendment further improves the Bill.  Many of us were anxious that there should be formal recognition given to the National Drugs Advisory Board.  It is more than that now.  They are accepted, and rightly so, as being very much an authorative grouping in this area of clinical trials.  I support the amendments.</P>

      <P>When this section was debated in the Dáil my party put down an amendment asking for statutory protection or a framework for the ethics committees.  Having read the Minister's reply I was not persuaded that was necessary. The first amendment goes a great deal of the way towards meeting any of the worries people may have.  I am always a little bit worried about ethics committees if they do not have sufficient protection. I wonder if after a certain period of the working of this Bill, given the very grave consequences of any possible abuse, the Minister would ask his Department to have a look at the role of ethics committees to see if they are constituted as both Houses would like them to be constituted and have the strength and protection which we would like to have. Otherwise, I think the first amendment goes a great deal of the way to meeting any reasonable worry anyone could have.</P>

      <P>I would like to assure the Senator that we will very carefully monitor this Bill.  This is a new piece of legislation which was required.  We will check with Department officials and keep a very close eye on it to see if there is any lack in the Bill and if at any stage we feel it should be strengthened in any way we will have no hesitation in bringing forward proposals.  We are satisfied with the amendments which were debated at such length here.  They have made the Bill very strong.  I am confident after listening to the debate in the Seanad and the debate which took place in the Dáil that I need not anticipate any changes because it has been so well studied and debated.</P>

      <P>Just for my own purposes and to put everything in order, I circulated that document for the benefit of Members of this House.  I would like to explain to Senators that the amendments made by the Dáil are not before this House as they have already been made to the Bill by the Dáil.  The Bill is now before the Seanad <i>en bloc</i> and the practice is that the amendments made by the Dáil are taken in total on this Stage.  It is not necessary to single out every amendment made in the Dáil.  We had another piece of legislation last week which went as it should go.  That was why I stated &mdash; and I am putting it on the record again now because there are rules for me as for the other Senators &mdash; that we should be discussing all these amendments which were made in the Dáil together and not individually.  That is usually the way this House deals with amendments to a Bill that comes back to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall act under your guidance.  There are only a few amendments involved.  If you wish me to go through all the amendments I will do so.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 2, while discussing the provision of section 2 of the Bill during Committee Stage in the Dáil the Minister gave an undertaking to re-examine section 2 with a view to safeguarding the interests of participants in trials while at the same time ensuring against undue impeding of legitimate trials on products which have been authorised. The trials in question are done to determine new uses for products which have a product authorisation and which are in extensive use in medical practice. These trials are generally undertaken by hospital consultants and are of considerable benefit in determining new and beneficial uses for a widely used product on the basis of experience in using the product clinically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering how best to develop an appropriate mechanism for clinical trials under section 2, the Minister found it necessary to restrict any deviation from the full requirements of the Bill to certain trials for new uses only.  Trials involving <Col N="17" /> a preparation which has a product authorisation where the purpose of the trials is to determine a new use for the preparation are now exempted, subject to certain conditions, from the requirements set out in section 3 to 6 and 8 to 11 of the Bill.  The amendments governing the exemption includes the following stipulations: where the National Drugs Advisory Board have been notified in writing of the proposal and have, not later than six weeks after being so notified, made a recommendation to the Minister on the proposal and the Minister has granted permission for the proposed trial to be undertaken and, in respect of the substance or preparation concerned, the conditions relating to dosage and form contained in the product authorisation so granted are complied with while the clinical trial is being conducted and the dosage administered in each case does not exceed that specified in the said authorisation.</P>
    <P>When assessing the application for the trial the National Drug Advisory Board have to be satisfied with the arrangements made by the applicant.  These would include an independent committee to &ldquo;vet&rdquo; the trial.  I feel that this amendment goes a long way towards meeting the legitimate demands of individual researchers conducting clinical trials while, at the same time, protecting those participants in such trials.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 3 and 5 to sections 8 and 10 of the Bill were moved by the Minister for Health on Report Stage in the Dáil.  Under section 10 of the Bill a policy of insurance is required to ensure that adequate funds are available to provide appropriate compensation for each participant who may suffer injury or loss as a result of the trial, before a person can conduct a clinical trial.  Under section 8 (4) (e) the ethics committee were to have regard to the insurance arrangements entered into.  The requirement of a policy of insurance did not reflect the <i>de facto</i> position as regards the availability of various forms of financial compensation and security which are currently available to compensate persons who suffer injury or loss as a result <Col N="18" /> of a clinical trial.  Persons who conduct clinical trials at present have available to them arrangements which vary from policies of insurance to bonds and other financial guarantees from financial institutions and insurance companies.</P>
    <P>It was necessary to recognise in the Bill that these arrangements exist.  It would not have been appropriate to include a restrictive provision in the Bill which has as one of its objectives the facilitation of legitimate projects.  Section 10 was amended to require that a person conducting a clinical trial must establish to the satisfaction of the ethics committee that he can provide sufficient security to ensure that adequate funds are available to provide appropriate compensation for each participant who may suffer an injury or loss as a result of the trial.  Section 8 (4) (e) was redundant as a result and was deleted.  It is the Minster's intention to include in guidelines for ethics committees the need for availability to such committees of expertise in the area of compensation for personal injuries.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 to section 8 was moved by Deputy Mac Giolla in the Dáil. The purpose of this amendment was to further safeguard the rights and interests of those participating in clinical trials by requiring the ethics committee to have regard to the method or methods by which volunteers are recruited.  Amendment No. 6 to section 19 is a technical amendment.  Section 19 (2) provides for the coming into force of the provisions of the Act.  This was a technical amendment which arose from an incorrect reference in section 19 (2) to sections of the Bill. Section 19 (2) now reads as follows:</P>
    <P>This Act, other than sections 16 to 18 and this section and so much of sections 1 to 15 as are necessary to give effect to section 3 (3) shall come into operation on such day as the Minister shall by order appoint.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that we are finally about to get this legislation out of the Oireachtas.  It is a badly needed piece of legislation.  At the risk of flattering myself, I am particularly glad that <Col N="19" /> amendment No. 4 was inserted, because that is an amendment I endeavoured to introduce in this House.  The then Minister met it in some way but not completely. I am very glad it has now been introduced because, at the core of an enormous amount of public concern about the operation of clinical trials, in this city in particular, were the allegations &mdash; and in my view true allegations &mdash; about the methods by which participants are being recruited.  There were uncomfortably large amounts of evidence that people were touting clinical trials in night shelters and hostels in this city and amongst people who were on very low incomes and who were, to say the least of it, susceptible to the offer of what was described as easy money for undertaking trials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very satisfied with this Bill.  I would like to compliment the former Minister for Health, and obviously the present Minister, on their work because this is an important Bill which arose out of the tragic circumstances in which a volunteer died.  I am very grateful to the two Governments for pursuing this matter.  It will not guarantee that vulnerable people will not be abused because this would be impossible to guarantee, but the safeguards built into this will ensure that in the future vulnerable people will not be nearly as open to being exploited as they were in the past.  Therefore, I welcome the amendments. I welcome, in particular, amendment No. 4 because it ought to concentrate the minds of ethics committees on methods of recruitment of volunteers and ought to ensure that the old methods of going out to people in night shelters are gone.  A parish priest of one area in Dublin who was visiting a night shelter in his pastoral capacity was asked by one of the residents of the night shelter who was paid &ldquo;a tenner&rdquo; for every volunteer he could recruit if he would do a clinical trial.  These days are now over and I am very glad.  I want to compliment the Minister on the fact that we are seeing this legislation.  I would be interested to <Col N="20" /> know if he has any idea of how quickly the Bill can be brought into force.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have to admit freely that Senator Ryan was very vocal and very responsible in the long debate we had here in the Seanad.  The first day it was brought in I suggested that it might be withdrawn totally.  The Fine Gael side came in strongly and supported that.  But for the behind-the-scenes activities of Senator Robinson perhaps it would have been withdrawn.  She urged that perhaps we should leave it and amend it sufficiently. We did so and there were massive amendments, as has been said already by the Minister and others.  I am satisfied at the end of it all that we have a much better Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very important Bill.  I know many of the people who take part in these trials. They are vulnerable; they are social welfare people; they are people with low wages who take these trials to get money for a bit of extra furniture or to pay an ESB bill that is coming up, or whatever. Certainly they have to be protected and that is what the Bill is all about.  I did not agree with Senator Ryan on some aspects of it but, by and large, I think we have got a better Bill.  An amendment which he referred to regarding details of the proposed method or methods by which participants are to be recruited, is one I welcome.  In fact, I wonder why do the companies not come clean and advertise in the papers.  I know one of them is doing this now.  There is nothing wrong with that.  They have to come clean and tell the <Col N="21" /> people of this country and the National Drugs Advisory Board and whoever else is involved how they propose to recruit the participants.  I see nothing wrong with that.  It should be open.  The various companies engaged in clinical trials would welcome this as they would have nothing to hide.  As a result of this Bill they can have nothing to hide.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question raised on section 10, I recall that the original Bill almost suggested that because of the imposition of the insurance clause it was almost a no-fault policy of insurance which is not freely available and is quite expensive.  The worry then was that the companies engaged in trials at university and medical school level would be severely handicapped and that they would have problems in getting insurance.  We did not mind about the bigger ones that we felt would be able to look after that aspect of it anyway.  This amendment by the Minister on Report Stage in the Dáil further strengthens the Bill.  While it strengthens it in one way it gives some liberty &mdash; if you like &mdash; to the medical schools, to the universities and to doctors throughout the country who might be engaged in clinical trials, and to health boards and so on, in that they are now asked to establish to the satisfaction of the ethics committee that they can provide sufficient security.  That will allow clinical trials and research generally in this country to proceed satisfactorily. That was foremost in our minds: we had to have a balance as between the safeguards for the participants, and the impositions for the people engaged in clinical trials.</P>
    <P>The Bill generally has come right and set a proper balance for both the people engaged in clinical trials to allow research to develop in this country with proper recognition that safeguards should be there for the people the Bill is all about, the participants.  I welcome the extra changes that have been made in the Dáil. They strengthen the legislation and I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward and accepting these new amendments.</P>
    <Col N="22" />
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Ryan and Senator Fallon, I would endorse the view that this Bill did undergo a substantial improvement through the detailed Committee Stage and Report Stage in this House.  The Bill as it left this House, was a very substantially improved measure.  I agree with my colleagues that the further amendments made by the Dáil are acceptable in that framework and that they have, in fact, in one instance, as Senator Ryan has said, carried through an amendment which he had tabled.  They also deal with one or two of the difficult issues that were considered at some length when this House was dealing with the Bill initially.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister for clarification on one or two aspects of the amendments which the Dáil has made to the Bill.  First of all, in amendment No. 2 and the proviso in relation to the National Drugs Advisory Board being notified, it says that &ldquo;the National Drugs Advisory Board have been notified in writing of the proposal and have, not later than six weeks after being so notified....&rdquo;  I wonder if that is a very strict cut-off.  If it so happened that the National Drugs Advisory Board, for one reason or another had not, in fact, made a recommendation to the Minister, are they unable to do so later than six weeks?  The reason I pose that is that under the next paragraph there is no time limit on the Minister giving permission.  It says: &ldquo;... the Minister has granted permission for the proposed trial to be undertaken&rdquo; but there does not seem to be any time limit within which the Minister would have granted that permission.  It is simply a matter of clarification.  Could the Minister explain why there is such a strict time limit on the National Drugs Advisory Board making the recommendation and can they make a recommendation if they are outside that six weeks?  How does this square with the Minister apparently not being under any time limit in relation to granting permission for the proposed trial?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the amendments in relation to the provision that it would no longer be necessary to have a policy of insurance <Col N="23" /> by and large, I agree with Senator Fallon that, for reasons which were discussed at some length, it is better not to impose in all circumstances a policy of insurance. We identified in this House a number of instances where it would not be possible to proceed with the particular study or examination, particularly in a university context, or even by an individual practitioner who would not normally have and would to be able to obtain in any reasonable form a policy of insurance. However, it is important for this House that the necessary protection and safeguards should be there and it was implicit in the Minister's speech explaining the substance of the amendment that he is anxious that that protection would be there.</P>
    <P>It would be helpful if we could have further clarification of the proposed explanation in the guidelines which the Minister has mentioned as to how a person would establish to the satisfaction of the ethics committee that he can provide sufficient security.  Will this be dealt with in the guidelines by saying he can either have an insurance policy, or bond, or will itemise what would be sufficient security?  The Minister, in referring to this amendment, said that it would be necessary that ethics committees would have expertise in the personal injuries field.  Is it envisaged that ethics committees would have access to actuarial advice and expertise?  This is a very difficult area.  The ethics committees are being asked to perform an extremely technical and highly complex task and it is important that we maintain the balance so that the research work can go on in the interests of medical science and that the persons concerned who are participating are adequately protected.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would be grateful if the Minister in his reply could give as much information to the House as possible as to what assistance will be given in the guidelines, what additional expertise will be available to ethics committees and how a person would establish, to the satisfaction of the ethics committee, that that <Col N="24" /> person can provide sufficient security in the circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I think these questions were mentioned in Senator Fallon's contribution as well and also in Senator Ryan's.</P>
      <P>First, all Senators have contributed greatly to this Bill and have put a lot of work into it.  In relation to the coming into force of this Bill, it is our intention that the Bill will be operational before the end of March 1988.  We hope that the President will have the Bill signed before Christmas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, thank you Senator, that is correct.  The guidelines are being worked on at the moment but until the Bill is passed we cannot finalise them. The non-statutory scheme will be in operation until the Bill comes into force at the end of March.  We will bring the Bill <i>in toto</i> into operation at the end of March. It will not be phased in sections; every section will come into operation then.</P>
      <P>In relation to the questions raised by Senator Robinson, the requirement is that the Drugs Advisory Board have six weeks to give clearance and that is a reasonable length of time.  I want to put on record that it is our intention that within one week of the clearance the Minister will give the appropriate clearance also.  That is not written into the Bill but that is our intention because there is a certain urgency involved in relation to clinical trials and, in fairness to applicants, they should not be left waiting for approval.  This will be reflected when the guidelines are provided by the Department to the various applicants.  Therefore, people will be aware of the requirements and of the fact that it is our intention, within the guidelines, that within one week of the National Drugs Advisory Board giving their decision the Minister will also give his <i>imprimatur.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="25" /> On Senator Robinson's point about having a policy of insurance, the ethics committees will have available to them an actuarial expert to advise in relation to the type of security needed, depending on the type of trial involved.  It is very important, of course, that they would be satisfied that if, for instance, insurance was not available the company itself would be in a position, through bonds and other means, to provide security for the participants.  It is our intention within the guidelines to make advice available to the committees to check the security being given, whether insurance or bond, by the companies involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important point.  Would it be envisaged that the actuarial expertise would be provided by the Department to ethics committees or would it be a question of the ethics committees having to devise and find and fund their own actuarial advice?  This is not really a sub-question of that; it is another question: will the guidelines be made available to the public or to Members of this House?  The guidelines are very important in a Bill of this nature because, as the Minister has acknowledged, they will flesh out the statutory provisions and it is important that we should see the guidelines in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="26" /> In relation to the insurance coverage, amendments Nos. 4 and 5 strengthen the Bill.  As drafted, sections 10 and 8(4)(e) were weak as regards the role of the ethics committees in relation to satisfying themselves about the adequacy of the security available.  The guidelines will make quite clear that it is a responsibility of the ethics committees to have actuarial experts available to these committees to advise in relation to security for participants in clinical trials.</P>

      <P>As Senators are aware, property valuations as determined under the Valuation Acts provide the basis for rates revenue raised by local authorities.  The revenue to be raised from rates in 1987 is estimated at £175 million, a major element in local budgets.  Clearly it is important that the valuation system is operated on a cost effective basis and that we have flexible and efficient procedures for listing properties for valuation, determining valuations and the hearing of appeals.  The bulk of the existing valuation code dates from the mid-19th century, the Act of 1986 being one of the few valuation statutes in this century.</P>
      <P>During the passage of that Act, Members of both Houses expressed their disappointment that the Act did not go far enough in reforming and updating the valuation code.  In responding to these views the then Minister for Finance explained that the Valuation Acts were being reviewed and that further legislation of a more wide-ranging nature would be introduced in due course.  The proposals in this Bill must be seen as a stage in that process.  The examination of other aspects is continuing and my objective is to bring the entire legislation into line with modern requirements and to have a single modern statute at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is: first, to establish a valuation tribunal to hear appeals against rateable valuations determined by the Commissioner of Valuation in the course of first appeals to him, to replace the present system of appeal to the Circuit Court; secondly, to introduce continuous revision of the valuation lists throughout the year in place of the existing single annual revision; thirdly, to provide for the valuation of public utility undertakings on a global basis and the apportionment of the valuation between the functional areas of local authorities, and fourthly, to provide for the delegation of functions by the Commissioner of Valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="28" /> Before dealing with the individual sections of the Bill, I would like to make some general points about the need for the measures proposed and their effects. First, I will deal with the valuation tribunal. Under the existing procedures for appeals in the valuation areas a first appeal can be made to the Commissioner of Valuation and a second appeal against his determination can be made to the Circuit Court.  Valuation appeals raise specialised questions about technological progress, investment returns, property uses and commercial practices, issues which are best decided by a specialised tribunal.  The interested parties in the valuation professions actively support the establishment of a specialised appeal authority.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, proposed to establish a valuation tribunal to determine all second appeals in the rating area.  It will consist of a chairman, deputy chairmen, professional valuers and others with special competence in valuation and legal matters. Determinations of the tribunal may be appealed to the High Court on a point of law.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the second measure proposed in the Bill, namely, the introduction of continuous revision of valuation.  At present the valuations of properties listed for revision are notified to local authorities for publication on the statutory date of 1 November each year. The process of appeal against the valuations then begins together with the listing of properties, including any new property for first-time valuation, for the following year's revision.  Such requests for revision, which must be submitted to the Valuation Office by 14 February, average 60,000 per annum and form the largest part of the workload of the Valuation Office.</P>
    <P>Under present legislation all of these requests for revision have to be submitted during the same short period, forcing both local authorities and the Valuation Office to complete various tasks at particular times or within prescribed periods, <Col N="29" /> irrespective of the workload.  Under the proposed system of continuous revision, a ratepayer, a local authority or an officer of the Commissioner of Valuation may, at any time during the year, seek a revision of the rateable valuation of property entered in the valuation lists or the inclusion of new properties.</P>
    <P>The commissioner will appoint persons from among his staff to investigate the requests for revision.  Such requests will be dealt with within six months of receipt or as soon as possible thereafter.  The results of the revision will be incorporated in a list of valuations which the commissioner will issue to the rating authorities at quarterly intervals throughout the year.</P>
    <P>The commencement date of continuous revision will be fixed by ministerial order.  The provision for continuous revision will promote greater efficiency in operating the valuation system and it will also ensure that revisions can be quickly and regularly entered in the rate books.  It can be confidently expected that the chance will be welcomed by local authorities and the professional valuation bodies.</P>
    <P>The Bill also includes provisions relating to the global valuation of public utility undertakings and to the apportionment of such valuation across local authority areas.  The term refers to those public or private concerns, which supply services of the public on a national or regional basis in areas such as electricity (Electricity Supply Board), gas (Bord Gáis Éireann), telephones (Bord Telecom Éireann), piped TV networks or any other service.  A distinctive feature of these undertakings is that they consist of one or a few main production units such as an electricity generating station but, in producing and distributing the service, they comprise a network of lines, pipes, cables or wires.</P>
    <P>These &ldquo;appendages&rdquo; are an integral part of the undertaking and must, therefore, be included in the valuation.  Apart from the technical problem of valuing, <Col N="30" /> the properties extend into many local authority areas and the apportionment of their valuation across such areas is complicated.  A formal statutory basis for determining the global valuation of utilities, together with a means of apportioning such valuation across the local authority jurisdictions, is a prerequisite for progress in this area.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Bill provides for delegation of functions by the Commissioner of Valuation. Under the present legislation the commissioner has virtually no discretion to delegate any of his functions.  For instance, there are about 4,000 first appeals each year but all of these appeals must be personally determined by the commissioner.  Many of these appeals could be dealt with by either the chief staff valuer or one of the staff valuers in the Valuation Office if the commissioner had authority to delegate appropriate authority to his officers.  Delegation of functions where appropriate will improve the operational efficiency of the Valuation Office.  It will give the commissioner more scope to concentrate on the complex valuation cases, the overall management of the valuation system and the examination of valuation legislation.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the detailed provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 defines the terms used.  Section 2 provides for the establishment of a valuation tribunal to hear appeals against determinations of the Commissioner of Valuation on first appeals against rateable valuations. Details of the constitution and procedures of the tribunal are set out in the First Schedule to the Bill.  The decision of the tribunal will be final subject to a right of appeal to the High Court on a question of law.  Appeals already lodged and pending before the Circuit Court at the time of the establishment of the tribunal will not be affected.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for continuous revision of the valuation lists throughout the year.  The section provides that a ratepayer, a local authority or an officer of the Commissioner of Valuation can seek a revision of the rateable valuation of <Col N="31" /> property at any time an that the Commissioner of Valuation will issue the results of the revision at quarterly intervals to local authorities.  The owner or occupier of any property listed for revision will be so notified by the rating authority which will also notify him of the outcome of the revision and his right to appeal against it to the Commissioner of Valuation.  The section also provides for appeals to the valuation tribunal against decisions of the Commissioner of Valuation on first appeal and sets out the procedures involved.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the valuation of public utility undertakings on a global basis by the Commissioner of Valuation. The global valuation will be based on an estimate of the effective capital value of the undertaking as a whole.  The effective capital value is defined as the aggregate of: (i) the site value(s); (ii) the depreciated replacement cost of other property of the undertaking; (iii) the value of any rights or easements owned or occupied by such undertaking; and (iv) the value of any right of the undertaking to transmit radio, television or telecommunications signals.  The section also provides that the global valuation may be apportioned by the Commissioner of Valuation across local authority areas. Any undertaking valued on a global basis will have the right of appeal to the commissioner and the valuation tribunal.</P>
    <P>Section 5 sets out the procedures to be followed in the case of an appeal to the High Court in relation to points of law arising from decisions of the valuation tribunal.  Section 6 provides that the Commissioner of Valuation may delegate any of his functions under the Valuation Acts to any officer of the commissioner.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides authority to set fees in respect of appeals to the Commissioner of Valuation or to the tribunal or in respect of an application to the commissioner. Section 8 provides that the form of various documents required for the purpose of the Valuation Acts can be prescribed by the Minister for Finance in <Col N="32" /> consultation with the Commissioner of Valuation.  Section 9 contains the usual provision for the payment of expenses incurred in the administration of the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides appropriate authority to deal by regulation with unforeseen administrative difficulties which may arise in bringing the Act into operation. Any regulation made under this section must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  Section 11 provides for the laying of certain orders and regulations by the Minister for Finance before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Section 12 gives the short title of the Act.</P>
    <P>The First Schedule to the Bill provides for the constitution, membership, terms and conditions of office, staffing, powers and procedures of the valuation tribunal to be established under section 2.  The Second Schedule relates to the property of public utility undertakings for the purposes of valuation under section 4.  I believe that this is progressive legislation. I commend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive and very clear introduction to the Second Stage of this Bill.  It certainly went into every detail.  I look forward to Committee Stage when we can, perhaps, have some good dialogue on it.  We in Fine Gael welcome this Bill.  It is part of a process begun in 1986 in streamlining procedures and getting rid of what could be described as cumbersome procedures. For that reason it is to be welcomed.  It is a further step along the line in a process initiated by the last Government to bring the Valuation Acts into line with modern requirements.  I note that the next stage will be the introduction of a single modern statute covering all aspects of valuation for rating purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the objectives of the Bill. It is good that we, as legislators, are introducing reforms and greater clarity into the valuation code.  I understand that there is an ongoing review in relation to the valuation code.  While I have been <Col N="33" /> clear and explicit in my welcome for this measure, nevertheless I must express a certain disappointment that we have not yet had presented to us a consolidation of the 1852 and 1860 Acts into new legislation. It is a pity that while the change is welcome we are approaching it in something of a piecemeal fashion.</P>
    <P>I look forward to comprehensive consolidated legislation because we are dealing with legislation which is more than 100 years old.  The pace of change has been quite extraordinary in the past 25 years not to mention the past 100 years so that a lot of this legislation is beginning to appear anachronistic, which is the reason for the reforming measure we are speaking on today.  It is also time to consolidate and bring forward one comprehensive statute covering all aspects of valuation.</P>
    <P>There must be a complete codification of the existing legislation and also recognition of the interpretation of that legislation by our courts.  Of course, much has happened in the area of valuation.  In recent years the courts have commented on the constitutionality of certain aspects of valuation.  The valuation base is the most significant source of locally raised revenue for our local authorities and, of course, it has been the focus of very much attention over the past weeks as local authorities throughout the country have got to grips with their estimates and have discovered that they are all, in the main, very strapped for the necessary revenue to run the essential services for the communities they serve.</P>
    <P>There has been a massive shortfall in the rates support grant from central Government and local authorities are already working on very slimmed down projects indeed and on a greatly reduced base for rates since the abolition of rates on domestic property which occurred, as we all remember to our cost, in 1977.  As a consequence of a relatively recent court decision we have the valuation on agricultural lands dropped, as such a rate was adjudged unconstitutional so we are left with an industrial and commercial rate.</P>
    <P>The people involved in that sector bear the total burden of the rates.  At a time of <Col N="34" /> economic recession this tax is becoming more and more unpopular.  No tax is popular.  That is a <i>sine qua non</i> but this tax has become more and more vexatious because the local authorities increase it annually.  In the case of my local authority, Waterford City Council, we gave a 4 per cent increase in our annual estimate this year.  That is burdensome on people who are struggling to make do at a time of economic recession.  It is all the more difficult for them because while we are delighted to have a designated area, and while there is a lot of development going on in Waterford, nevertheless these people who have now got to face the additional burden of a 4 per cent increase will have to watch their competitors in business operating under the disadvantaged area package which allows them a rates remission and attractive rent situations.  The inequality and the lack of fairness in relation to the whole business of rates becomes even more highlighted by this.</P>
    <P>The local authorities should have the power &mdash; and they have the responsibility &mdash; to raise revenue locally.  My party were the first since the 1977 abolition to introduce the notion of local taxation, and we paid for that.  It was intelligent and necessary but it was politically most unpopular.  It is fascinating to see Fianna Fáil dominated local authorities having to eat their words in so many instances particularly in some of the urban councils. Waterford City Council saw a complete U-turn when charges were introduced, unwillingly but necessarily, and without my support for political reasons, which I do not apologise for in the slightest.  It was necessary to introduce them on this occasion in Waterford City.</P>
    <P>I hope that the current chaos in that area will be dealt with swiftly by the Government.  We have been hearing for a long time about reform in the area of Local Government financing.  There is talk about a property tax and there is talk about regionalising local authorities but it is getting to a stage where I do not think it is fair to let local authorities go into their 1988 estimates without having <Col N="35" /> concrete legislation concerned with the financing of local authorities and the services they provide.  The whole system of raising local finances is in urgent need of review because in many counties, as opposed to towns, the industrial and commercial valuation is so small that the yield from it is barely worth while and it makes only a very small contribution towards the cost of supplying essential services at local level.</P>
    <P>The time has probably come to review the entire valuation system as an equitable means for raising revenue at local level.  There are anomalies and they will surface.  I know they say that hard cases make bad law but this is one that should be taken on board in the context of valuations and local authority finance.  It is very hard to separate the two.  If is impossible.  I imagine many of the people who will contribute on the Second Stage of the Bill will stray into the area of local authority financing and then back again to the measures contained in the legislation before us.  I am quite unapologetic about doing so because I think it is necessary.</P>
    <P>One of the anomalies I would like to refer to is that of a business person or a small shopkeeper who find himself or herself very often doubly taxed because that person must pay a commercial rate on the business part of the premises. Then on the dwelling portion of the very same premises he or she is obliged to pay water rates and refuse charges.  Those people quite rightly feel aggrieved by that sort of thing.  It is not fair and it is not equitable.  When things are like that they should be changed.</P>
    <P>It is important, in the context of this legislation before us, to compliment the staff in the Valuation Office.  It is a little sung and a not too often praised office. When we have legislation before us, the second reforming measure in over 100 years, it is important to pay tribute to all of those who work in the Valuation Office and who have worked there down through the years.  They have given quiet, unobtrusive, necessary and sterling service and have interpreted the Acts in a <Col N="36" /> broad and in a reasonably fair manner I would like to acknowledge that and pay tribute to them.</P>
    <P>Coming to the actual legislation before us I understand that it was drafted in consultation with the people on the ground who administer the Valuation Acts.  That is good and it is the way it should be.  I understand that it has won wide support from the people involved. I know the local authorities will be vastly relieved to know of this measure.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is the establishment of a valuation tribunal to hear appeals against rateable valuations determined by the Commissioner of Valuation in the course of first appeals to him replacing the present system of appeal to the Circuit Court.  That is a welcome development.  I will be interested to hear the Minister talk about the composition of the membership of this tribunal.  In the past the whole situation has been dominated by legal expertise.  I hope that on the tribunal it will be possible to have people with a sound knowledge of property and property values.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a substantial number of women involved on the tribunal.  I look to the Minister in a most hopeful fashion because there are women with knowledge in the areas of property and valuations and, indeed, in the legal area.  I would like to think that he would redress an imbalance that exists in every sphere of activity in this country when he is deciding who will sit on that important valuation tribunal.</P>
    <P>The second main purpose of the Bill is the introduction of continuous revision of the valuation lists throughout the year in place of the single existing annual revision.  It seems incredible to think that there were something like end of term tests every year when the Valuation Office were absolutely swamped with this deluge of work.  I can quite see how this second measure will be viewed as a major area of reform by anybody who was forced to confront this deluge that descended once a year and had to be dealt with in a given timespan.  That is sensible and intelligent and I welcome it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="37" /> The third significant point is the adoption of special procedures for the valuation of public utility undertakings on a global basis and the apportionment of the valuation between the functional areas of local authorities.  This is interesting and it gives some idea of the complexity and the extraordinary task people have to confront in valuing public utilities such as the ESB or Bord Telecom.  The Minister in his Second Stage speech referred to the whole paraphernalia of cable, plant, machinery and an extraordinary list of things.  I have one query and I expect public utilities are considering it too.  It would be interesting to hear the Minister expand on how this will be done.  It is a slightly controversial area.  The big fear, of course, in any measure of change, is will it lead to higher charges at the end of the day.  I hope the Minister can allay the fears and apprehensions of public utilities and that this will not necessarily be so.  We can discuss that on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The fourth measure is the delegation of functions by the Commissioner of Valuation. That is good and sensible and a welcome provision.  The Minister said that the commissioner had to deal personally with something like 6,000 appeals.  Even to read it, it sounds so crazy and so daunting that it is a very welcome reform to think that he can delegate functions.  That is worthwhile.  I wonder if the fourth report of the Commission on Taxation and the recommendations in relation to valuation and local government charges were looked at in the course of the preparation of this legislation.  I do not necessarily feel that they were.  The Minister might like to comment on that in the course of his reply.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Taxation felt that the responsibility for administration of the valuation system, including audit of understated values, should be allocated to local authorities and that the most efficient method of doing this may be for them to employ private consultants to assist them.  They went on to say that industrial and commercial property should be valued on a rental basis and <Col N="38" /> capital and rental values should be related by formula.  That is on page 45 of the fourth report of the Commission on Taxation.  On page 44 one of the recommendations appears to have been taken into consideration because it talked about the necessity for frequent revision which ensures that valuations are kept up to date.  That is obviously part and parcel of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I am very pleased to see this updating measure, the second in over 100 years.  I look forward to a single modern statute covering all aspects of valuation for rating purposes.  I hope the Minister can give some indication when that single modern statute might be forthcoming.  It is important to press for it because all legislation must be relevant. We have enough difficulty in facing up to legislation and in complying with it.  It makes the whole business of complying with legislation a lot easier if it is seen to be modern, up to date and relevant to the needs of the people it is designed to serve.  I look forward to other contributions from Members of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speaker I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for bringing this legislation to the Seanad.  We know it is part of the process of improving the Valuation Acts which, as the Minister said, date from the mid 19th century.  Rates will forever, I presume, be part of local authority taxation. At the moment rates apply to commercial properties only and are regarded by traders, industrialists and manufacturers as a major expenditure each year.  It is important from time to time that a critical look is taken at the various Valuation Acts and that somewhere along the way they are improved, which obviously this one will be, with a saving to the person paying rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Explanatory Memorandum, which I welcome and which I have found very helpful, explains the four main purposes of the Bill.  The first is the establishment of a valuation tribunal to hear appeals against rateable valuations determined by the Commissioner of Valuation <Col N="39" /> in the course of first appeals to him, replacing the present system of appeals to the Circuit Court.  We would all agree that is the most important change in this Bill.  Many people believe that the Circuit Court is not the most appropriate body for appeals in what we all rightly agree is a very specialised area.  However, there are a few queries on that section on which the Minister might comment.  The present system of appeals is to the Circuit Court which operates at different venues throughout the country.  I wonder do the provisions of this Bill envisage the tribunal sitting in various provincial locations as this would avoid witnesses expenses, or whatever, and would make things easier for people who might have to travel long distances.</P>
    <P>Section 1 (3) of the First Schedule states:</P>
    <P>The terms of office of a member of the Tribunal shall be such period not exceeding 5 years as the Minister for Finance may determine when appointing him and, subject to the provisions of this Act, a member of the Tribunal shall be eligible for re-appointment as such member.</P>
    <P>Whilst it is clear that a person appointed for the five year term is eligible for re-appointment after the five year period, the fact that the original appointment is for the limited period of five years may well take away from the independence of the members of the tribunal.  It is a departure from appointments to the Judiciary, the Land Commission, etc. Generally these appointments are made on a permanent basis.  The tribunal is a final arbiter of fact.  This being the case, the threat to the independence of the tribunal by limiting the tenure of office to five years is all the more serious.  It is important to establish the full independence of the tribunal, bearing in mind that its decisions will be final, subject to a right of appeal to the High Court on a matter of law only.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the continuous revision of the valuation lists throughout the year instead of the annual revision <Col N="40" /> which now applies.  I join with Senator Bulbulia in welcoming this aspect of the Bill.  The requests for revision run at 60,000 per annum and it is obvious that we are heaping a huge workload on the staff of the Valuation Office at a particular time of the year.  I imagine that in September and October the staff do overtime so that the local authorities receive their valuations in time for publication on 1 November.  In addition there is provision for the ratepayer, the local authority or an officer of the Commissioner of Valuation to seek a revision of the rateable valuation at any time and the local authorities will be supplied with. the results of the revision at quarterly intervals.  When will this take effect and when is it expected that the local authorities will receive the revised quarterly valuation?  Perhaps the Minister would comment on that.  At present, as we all know, 1 January is the effective date of the revised valuation.  How will the local authority at an administrative level, cope with the continuous revision of valuation lists?  I am sure some explanation will be given to the various local authorities. That would be welcome.  I welcome the section very much.  The change is long overdue and will be of huge benefit to the staff of the Valuation Office, to the local authority staff and to the rate-payers.</P>
    <P>Section 4 introduces a global valuation of public utilities undertakings.  I am convinced that whoever compiled the Second Schedule must have been an electrician or an electrical engineer on secondment to the Minister's Department from the ESB because everything seems to be covered &mdash; electric lines, cables, poles, pylons and brackets.  Nothing seems to have been missed.  I congratulate whoever is responsible for that.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the global valuations of the various public utilities place the public sector at some disadvantage <i>vis-a-vis</i> large co-ops.  Large co-ops have as much plant and as many buildings throughout the country.  The global valuation is defined clearly within the Bill and will be based on an estimate of the effective capital value of the undertaking as a <Col N="41" /> whole &mdash; as defined in the Explanatory Memorandum.  I wonder whether the public sector might see themselves as disadvantaged in some way.  The global basis of valuation is an improvement because heretofore every single item of property owned by a public utility such as the ESB was noted and listed by each rating authority.  The global system which will examine all the property of the undertaking, taken together, will thus eliminate the previous tedious methods of valuations.  The section provides that the global valuation may be apportioned by the Commissioner of Valuation across the local authority areas.  I assume that the local authority may appeal to the tribunal against the apportionment of the global valuation.  Perhaps the Minister might refer to this later.</P>
    <P>Section 6 refers to the delegation of functions by the Commissioner of Valuation. I am amazed that we have to include that section.  I would have assumed that the Commissioner of Valuation had the right to delegate responsibility to any officer as he saw fit.  If that was not the case, this is what had to be done.  It is a welcome improvement.  As stated in the Explanatory Memorandum it will improve the operation and efficiency of the Valuation Office and will give the commissioner more flexibility to concentrate on overall management and the co-ordination of the whole operation. That should be welcomed.</P>
    <P>While this Bill introduces badly needed changes in a number of important aspects of valuation, I understand that a further Bill will follow at some stage in the future.  Further updating of the Valuation Acts is at all times necessary and should he welcomed.  I would welcome future changes which would recognise an obvious reduction in trading profits.  The ability to pay is clearly dependent on the trading performance of any venture.  If trading is not as good as it was over the past number of years and this can be proved conclusively to the local authority, there is a case to be made for a revaluation.  I wonder whether that can be done at some future date.  However, that is for another day.  I would like to <Col N="42" /> congratulate and thank the staff of the Valuation Office for their work over the years.  As Senator Bulbulia said, the quiet people behind the scenes are often criticised for doing what is basically their job of work.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing this legislation to this House.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier I welcome the Bill and all that it contains.  I wish it every success in the future.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire Stáit agus roimh an mBille seo.  There is no doubt that the Bill is very welcome.  Although the poor law valuation system operated very successfully for a number of years, unfortunately time has caught up with it.  The last straw came in the High Court where it was deemed to be an unfair way of taxing the farming community.  Quite honestly I always believed rates were fair although at the time there were commotion and marches against them.  When all is said and done rates were a very simple and fair way of collecting tax. There was a great deal of personality attached to them because the rate collector &mdash; and I am an ex-rate collector &mdash; had a personal relationship with everybody. He knew the time of year to call on people as he knew what suited them. It was a specialised type of work.  In addition under the rate collection system, there were very few sheriffs compared with the number we have now.  There was no need for them because the rate collector was able to get in the money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>We have moved on from those days.  On the old demand note there <Col N="43" /> were only two headings, land and buildings. Today there are many other ways of running commercial businesses.  We have the airwaves, water power, wind power and underground cables.  All of these businesses are making quite a considerable profit and we have to find a way of getting rates from them.  This Bill certainly sets out to do that in a very efficient and effective manner.  Senator Fallon referred to service charges. Indeed, I always thought service charges were not such a bad idea.  In Sligo we do not levy a service charge on the rate payers because we must have regard to people who are paying rates &mdash; a small minority of business people.  They are finding it hard to exist and the only thing they get for their rates are the services the local authority provide.  People get a water service for 75p or so a week.  You would not get a child to go to the well with a sweet can for that.  Rubbish is collected for less than £1 a week.  Where would you get anybody to collect and dispose of it for such a sum?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Service charges are not the worst thing in the world.  Local authorities have been starved of cash and this Valuation Bill will help to provide them with finance, particularly the global valuations. We have wires, cables and services throughout our county, and the county gets nothing as only the buildings are valued.  Buildings are only a small portion of the whole business operation. It is a very good idea that we are introducing a system whereby we will look at the services supplied by anybody now that we are moving towards the privatisation of so many things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal of State property was exempt from rates and valuations and it is a good thing that they will be included. A classic example is that with all the buses in Dublin and throughout the country CIE pay no tax.  If they were privatised, they would have to pay their tax.  The private operators are paying their tax and <Col N="44" /> making money which goes to prove that if you do not pay anything it does not necessarily mean that you will make money.  If that were the case, CIE should be rotten with riches but unfortunately they do not seem to be.  I welcome this Bill for all those reasons.  It would certainly bring the ESB, Bord Telecom, An Post and radio etc. into the net.  We will have a great many new radio stations whose programmes will be rebroadcast. The cable companies in particular are making quite a handsome profit.  Up to now all those services, which are really commercial services, were making quite a lot of money, and it is only right that we should have a system for putting a valuation on them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the tribunal although as an auctioneer I had no fault to find with the Circuit Court system because we got a decision there and then.  I hope the tribunal will not be like An Bord Pleanála, you can make a case listing all your salient points; everyone is very nice to you and they walk away after shaking hands; but unfortunately the result can be very discouraging and disheartening when you get it a fortnight, a month or three months later.  I would like to see the tribunal giving a decision on the day.  I do not agree with tribunals sitting and making a decision later.  They cannot write down everything.  They may make a decision only on what they have written down and many things they heard may not have been recorded.  I would be very happy to see some time limit on the tribunal. It is not true to say that under the old system all the valuations went in at the end of the year and had to be dealt with in a rush.  The local authority spent another year doing the valuations which meant that the rate collector together with the local authority listed the properties for valuation.  Two years would elapse before the rates were collected. The property would be listed one year and for the whole of the following year the valuation officers were out before the rates were struck.</P>
    <P>Under this system the local authorities should be able to bring in the rates within a year, which would be reasonable <Col N="45" /> enough, and it would be very helpful to the local authorities.  I would like the Minister to indicate how quickly the tribunal will work.  I would not like to think they would sit and spend quite a considerable length of time deciding on the valuation.  If you do not agree with what you get in writing from the tribunal you are faced with a problem.  There is a safety valve in that you can go to court afterwards, but this would prove to be a very expensive way of dealing with it. We hope the tribunal will act speedily and given us a quick decision.  I welcome the Bill.  I believe it will be of benefit to all of us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>First, on reading through the Bill it strikes me that it is a very well constructed piece of legislation.  There seems to be a great emphasis throughout on the fairness of the procedure so that people at the conclusion of the valuation will feel they have been fairly dealt with and that the various aspects of our valuation have been taken into account.  In that respect, and as far as it is possible for someone who is not involved in business to give an opinion, I welcome it. Listening to the contributions made, particularly the last one by Senator Farrell, it appears to me that those who pay rates on the valuation of a business are responsible for much of the revenue that comes to the local council.  I would like to ask the Minister &mdash; because I speak from a position of ignorance on this subject &mdash; how public is the valuation throughout the Republic?  When a valuation is being made locally, is this posted publicly so that people know who is paying what by way of rates into the kitty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be some means of expanding and sharing the load of financial responsibility for effective decision making at local level.  I just throw out again, as I have done twice before in the Seanad, the idea that at some point in the future, if we are serious about the decentralisation of power in Ireland, attention will have to be paid to gathering a proportion of the citizen's overall tax at local level.  He will know where his tax has gone and will wish those who are <Col N="46" /> making decisions on spending his money to be alert and accountable.  He will feel more responsible in relation to the spending of that proportion in his own local community.  We might see a much greater generation of vigour, enthusiasm and enterprise locally which I think most people now feel is essential to the development of Ireland both North and South.  In summary, it seems from the provisions which have been promulgated in this Valuation Bill, the access to the commissioner, the way in which the commissioner can delegate his authority, the way in which the workload is to be distributed throughout the year, the way in which people have access to appeal at any time throughout the year, the further possibility of an appeal to the valuation tribunal and finally the possibility of the High Court being involved, that the emphasis is to be on fair play.  I welcome that.  The only thing I come back to is the possibility of expanding responsibility at local level and questioning whether, beyond this Valuation Bill, we need as a society to look very seriously at the centralisation of tax collection as undertaken at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their very many excellent and varied contributions.  Senator Bulbulia opened the debate with a very constructive contribution. She said that this Bill may be piecemeal legislation.  I suppose one could say that about any legislation. There are pros and cons taking any legislation in its entirety.  We would prefer a complete consolidation of the whole valuation process and the effects of valuation on properties, on funding and on financing in our country.  However, if we want to make practical progress with urgent issues in order to alleviate the very tedious and cumbersome difficulties which have been foisted by the evolution of time and the technological and other changes on the staff of the Valuation Office we must change.  This is why we brought forward this legislation at this time.  However, we are actively pursuing bringing about a totally revamped and consolidated Valuation Bill to cover <Col N="47" /> many other matters.  Timing is a matter which has to be taken into account within the Government's programme of legislation, but we would see it as an important matter.  We must keep making progress and hope we will be in a position to bring forward further legislation in this area in the not too distant future.</P>
      <P>Senator Bulbulia also referred to local government financing and organisation. I want to reassure the House again &mdash; I think some of my colleagues did so over the past year and perhaps I referred to it also &mdash; that the Minister for the Environment is engaged in a fundamental review of all the functions and financing of local authorities.  I am sure this House and the other House of the Oireachtas, as well as all local authority members and the public at large, await the completion of this review with interest and will welcome it.</P>
      <P>The report of the Commission on Taxation has no direct relevance to this Bill. However, the recommendation contained in the report would certainly be considered as part of the review of the organisation of the Valuation Office.  The membership of the tribunal to which I referred in my speech will include a chairman, deputy chairman, professional valuers and others with special competence in valuation and legal matters. We expect to be able to appoint persons with expertise in property valuation.  The intention is that a person with legal training will be the chairman or chairperson of the tribunal.  Of course women will be considered for appointment to the tribunal. As a member of the Valuers Institute I have noted over the past number of years the excellent strides being made by women in the field of property and valuation and I look forward to their contribution in this area too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fallon made an excellent contribution also and he discussed the period of office of the tribunal which will be not more than five years.  I think he was referring to the fact that sometimes people are appointed to positions for their lifetime.  Like everything else, there <Col N="48" /> is for and against that too.  There is nothing sacred or sacrosanct about the five years appointment.  One has to be appointed for a reasonable period to ensure that there is consistency in the execution of one's duties and a fair and equitable balance in the valuations being decided.</P>
    <P>We feel that, if we went over the five years, it might deter people who have a contribution to make in this field from accepting an appointment to the tribunal. Of course a person may be reappointed, which will get over that difficulty.  At the end of five years the Minister for Finance will have the right to reappoint the tribunal in its entirety.  Members of the tribunal or any individual member will have the right to indicate that they do not wish to be reappointed.  On balance you would get the best out of people if they knew they were there for five years.  They could serve for five years and, if they felt they had made their contribution and were not able to work any longer, they could indicate that to the Minister.  They could be replaced on the tribunal or, indeed, the entire tribunal could be replaced.</P>
    <P>The operative date for valuations will be based on the revision lists which will issue quarterly.  For rates purposes the relevant valuations will be the latest ones available when the rate is struck in the relevant local authority area.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by Senators Bulbulia and Fallon to the fact that the global valuation to be placed on public utilities could lead to higher valuations and to higher charges by them in the provision of their services to the people. We do not anticipate this happening.  The intention is to have an equitable and practical system and the principle of comparability will continue to apply.  The valuations will have to be related to other similar properties and for similar reasons, as values on other properties will be based throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made by Senator Fallon to property revaluation as distinct from the revision of existing valuations. This will be considered when a further consolidating Bill is being drafted but, as <Col N="49" /> of now, the present Bill will not create such a situation.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell made many excellent points, some of which are now in an historical context due to the events to which he alluded.  He talked about the reports of the tribunal and the difficulty which could arise in that people could go before a tribunal in a nice atmosphere but have to wait for a long time before they got their report.  The difference between what is proposed in this Bill and the existing situation in the courts is that a person now gets a sudden death decision &mdash; an oral immediate decision &mdash; but the tribunal will be giving a formal written report on their decision and this will be to the advantage of people affected by that decision.</P>
    <P>There is no time limit, but the tribunal will have to draw up rules which must be approved by the Minister for Finance. The Minister will examine these draft rules to ensure that the production of reports, and their proceedings, will generally produce results within a reasonable time.  When those draft rules are put before the Minister for Finance I am confident that he will ensure that a reasonable time limit is put on the tribunal to ensure that people will not be left waiting for a long period wondering whether they have to adhere to the existing valuation or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I listened to Senator Robb for many years long before I came into this House. He always makes excellent contributions. He asked if the annual revision lists are displayed in public places.  The annual revision lists are displayed in local council and local authority offices throughout the country.  There is no general access to valuation data as such.  There is another Bill which will be, introduced later on pertaining to the protection of data information and data systems.  Whether it will have any effect on this situation I am not sure, but there is no general access to valuation data at present.  However, anybody who has difficulties pertaining to ratings or valuations will find both the Valuation Office and the local authorities very co-operative in providing personal information to the people affected.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="50" /> As I have said, the question of local taxation has been examined by the Minister for the Environment.  A major question was asked by a number of Senators, particularly Senator Bulbulia and Senator Fallon, pertaining to the global valuation to be placed on utilities.  This will be based on the capital valuation of the assets of the company.  The precise formula has to be worked out before the parameters are given in section 4 (4).  It will be based on the capital value of the assets, the use to which those assets will be put and the consumer service which they are giving in any particular area. Basically, they are the criteria which will be laid down.  The exact criteria and data will be put together by the Valuation Office after this Bill has been passed.</P>
    <P>I sincerely thank everybody for their contributions.  I am confident that this will lead to more equitable and fairer values, both from the point of view of the private sector and from the point of view of the public sector, being placed on properties throughout the country.  The fact that there is constant revision will be of major benefit to the public funding area for local authorities and in the private effect it will have in ensuring that an equitable contribution is made based on the resources and the assets of the people at any time to the Exchequer and in particular to local funding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 (4) states that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance may, from time to time, appoint such and so many <Col N="51" /> persons as he considers necessary to assist the Tribunal in the performance of its functions under this Act.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister envisage that the persons so appointed will be professional persons such as valuers, engineers, or architects and when such persons are appointed will they be the servants or agents of the Minister or the servants or agents of the tribunal?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister comment on the composition of the tribunal? He touched on it and made the point that perhaps the chairman would be a legal person but, like other speakers, I would like to think that reputable property valuers would form part of the valuation tribunal.  Could the Minister make a further comment on that?  Also, where is it proposed that the tribunal will sit and is there provision for them to move around the country?  In relation to reports, Senator Farrell raised a very important question as to when we might get a decision and the Minister replied that the report would be available as soon as possible thereafter, subject to the recommendations of the Minister.  Perhaps an actual time limit could be put into the legislation rather than leaving it &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo;.  If the Minister could request the tribunal to have a report available within a specified time it would be better.</P>
      <P>Finally, in relation to the question raised by Senator Mullooly section 2 (4) about people who assist the tribunal in the performance of their functions under this Bill, is there any provision whereby they could or ought to declare their interests?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would like to thank the Minister for his response to my suggestion that women of the necessary calibre to serve on this tribunal should be considered.  I interpreted what he said to mean that they would be very strongly and very favourably considered. He indicated that in his experience he has seen women make major strides in the area in recent years.  That is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="52" /> I am interested in the timescale of the establishment of the tribunal.  Perhaps the Minister would comment as to when this legislation will be taken in Dáil Éireann and give us some idea of the timescale because obviously it will have to be passed and signed by the President before the tribunal could be set up.  I would like to know what sort of timescale he has in mind.  I would also be interested, as somebody from outside Dublin &mdash; from Waterford which considers itself the major centre in the south east region &mdash; in the venues for sitting of this valuation tribunal.  I would be keen to hear the Minister state that the major centre of population in an area would be the place where the tribunal would sit.</P>
    <P>It is also important to refer to what Senator Farrell said when he talked about the delay in giving a judgment.  People who go before a tribunal do so on the basis of a certain anxiety to bring their case and appeal it.  It is important that people should be put out of their misery as speedily as possible with the hope of a favourable decision but, in any event, with a fair and equitable expectation and that there would not be any undue delay in giving them this decision.  In the past the Circuit Court has worked well.</P>
    <P>I am also happy about the Minister's assurances that people with a knowledge of property and the market will be represented on the tribunal in addition to legal people.  I await what the Minister has to say in fleshing out this portion of the Bill with some interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of points have been raised by various Senators.  Senators Mullooly, Bulbulia and Fallon raised the question of the tribunal sitting in different parts of the country as distinct from being based in Dublin.  It would not be necessary to enshrine that in legislation.  We hope this will be considered by the Valuation Office and by the Minister for Finance and that the tribunal will sit on a regional basis throughout the country in different provincial centres.  First, this would enable them to have first hand knowledge <Col N="53" /> of the actual property values and the evolution of property development in the provincial areas.  Secondly, they would be in close proximity and adjacent to the people who would be the subject of valuation revisions so that it would not be necessary to bring everybody to Dublin to make decisions.  This might only intimidate people.  We hope that that will be the position.  I will be recommending to the Minister for Finance that he give that directive.  It is not necessary to enshrine that in legislation.</P>
      <P>As regards Senator Bulbulia's question as to when the tribunal will be established, it is hoped that the Bill will get through this House fairly quickly and on to the Dáil in the next session.  It should be through the Dáil in February.  Thereafter the necessary arrangements could be put in train to set up the tribunal.  I am confident that the tribunal will be operating in the second half of next year. That is our ambition and our target.</P>
      <P>Senator Mullooly raised the question of the staffing of the tribunal <i>vis-a-vis</i> the question of the Minister for Finance in relation to section 2 (4) which states:</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance may, from time to time, appoint such and so many persons as he considers necessary to assist the Tribunal in the performance of its functions under this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Mullooly has suggested, it is expected that the appointments he will make will be of professional people, expert people, professionally practical people and professionally qualified people because there are the types of people in the property area who can make various contributions.  It also gives him the discretion to second people from various Government Departments who have particular expertise to assist the tribunal. That will be incorporated also.  The staff, once appointed, will be responsible to the tribunal and will become the staff of the tribunal.  The staff, both administrative and technical, will be made available by the Minister for Finance but, when working with the tribunal, they will be responsible to the tribunal and not to the Minister.  The tribunal will be responsible <Col N="54" /> to the Minister.  Indirectly, the staff would also be responsible to the Minister but directly would be responsible and report to the tribunal.</P>
    <P>I hope I have covered all the points raised.  When the Bill gets into the Dáil and once we have a reasonable assurance that it will pass all Stages, the preparatory work in selecting the tribunal and setting up its structures can come into place. When the Bill is passed the formal structures can be set up and the tribunal will be operating, I hope, in the second half of next year.</P>

      <P>The Minister will forgive me if he has dealt with the question I am about to ask because I have just come in to the House.  I take it that the Minister will be setting up this tribunal and that it will take effect.  He need not reply to this because I will get it in the Official Report if he has already dealt with it in the course of his reply to the previous question.  I presume the people who will be appointed to the tribunal will be qualified in property and valuations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the staff of the tribunal be full time or part time?  I always have a bit of a hang up when I hear talk about experts.  We in the west, in particular, heard all the experts say that Knock Airport could not work.  Knock Airport is the first airport in Europe to have made a profit in two years.  It is a typical example of what the experts say. I would like to see the tribunal staffed by people who have spent a considerable time in business, like the Minister and many more of us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and in courthouses trying to sell properties because those are the people who have experience.  I would like to see people of that calibre on the tribunal, people from the city who are dealing with the bigger properties going into hundreds of thousands of pounds and the smaller auctioneer who is dealing with the little bits of land and the smaller <Col N="55" /> business.  Those are the people who are experts.  They have spent ten, 12, 15 or 20 years on the sod bank trying to get bids for property.  I would like to see a good selection of people of that calibre on the tribunal.</P>

Perhaps the Minister when replying might state how soon he expects judgments to be given when they come before the tribunal.  I did not hear him reply to that question which I asked earlier. Will there be a time lag between adjudication on a matter and delivery of judgment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my own perception that there are many eminent people in this House who would be eligible for membership of the tribunal but I presume the demands of this House would constrain them from participation in the tribunal. In deference to Senator McCormack, Senator Farrell and others who have a long record of professional service in the valuation area, I must reiterate that we expect to appoint professionally qualified people and professional practically qualified people who have experience and knowledge of diverse property values.  As Senator Farrell said it is easy for one to be professionally consistent in a particular field but it may be the smaller property valuers who have the diverse and varied opportunities and qualifications from the type of properties they deal with.  It is people like those who must be part of the tribunal. I hope there will be a good cross-section of professionally qualified people, professionally qualified valuers and other property people who understand valuations and property considerations and who could make balanced judgments if appointed to the tribunal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely, Senator, at all times.  Senator Farrell referred to <Col N="56" /> full time or part time membership of the tribunal.  We have an open mind on that. One cannot make a definitive judgment at this time.  In trying to attract the right type of people on to the tribunal, if we tell them it is a full time appointment they may be discouraged and not accept. The most important consideration would be the amount of work that would be done by the tribunal or be generated for consideration by the tribunal.  The matter would have to be reviewed based on the number of appeals coming before the tribunal.  After some time it may be necessary to review and revise the situation but, as of now, we have a totally open mind.  It may happen that there will be some full time appointments, in particular, a full time chairman but that may not necessarily happen.</P>
      <P>Senator Bulbulia asked if there would be a time lag before judgments would be delivered.  I hope that in many cases judgments will be delivered within a few days, in some cases within a few weeks and, at the maximum, in very serious, difficult, complex cases, no later than three months.  I see no reason some judgments could not come in three days or seven days or at the maximum, for serious cases, in three months.  This is part of the criterion, and the consideration that must be given when the overall structures are being set up.  I hope that a reasonably defined time will be included in those definitions.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a couple of brief questions, Section 3 (3) states:</P>
      <P>The Commissioner of Valuation shall cause every application made to him under subsection (1) of this section to be determined within six months after receiving the application or as soon as may be thereafter...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the words &ldquo;as soon as may be thereafter&rdquo; will have the effect of leaving <Col N="57" /> it open to any length of delay in relation to an application made to the Commissioner of Valuation.  I would be much happier if the section were to say that each application would be determined within six months but not more than 12 months or something similar.  I feel that the words &ldquo;as soon as may be thereafter&rdquo; leave the section very open.  Subsection (4) (a) states:</P>
    <P>...the owner and occupier, if known, shall be notified by the rating authority of the application.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) states:</P>
    <P>The owner and occupier, where known, shall be notified by the rating authority of the determination of the application...</P>
    <P>I would like to know what steps the Minister expects rating authorities to take to ascertain the identity of owners and occupiers in these situations.  It would be very easy for a rating authority to say they did not issue a notice to an individual, an owner or occupier, because they did not know that person was the owner or occupier.  The rating authority should be expected to take all reasonable steps to ascertain the identity of the owner or the occupier for the operation of these two paragraphs.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) (c) states:</P>
    <P>The Tribunal shall transmit a copy of every notice received by it to the Commissioner of Valuation (who shall be the respondent in, and be entitled to be heard and adduce evidence at the hearing of, the appeal concerned), to the rating authority or authorities concerned and to any other person appearing to the Tribunal to be directly affected by the determination and any such person shall be entitled to be heard and to adduce evidence at the hearing of the appeal.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if other persons, that is persons who did not receive copies of the notice, will also be entitled to be heard and to adduce evidence at the hearing of the appeal.  It would appear from this paragraph that only people to whom <Col N="58" /> a copy of the notice was transmitted by the Commissioner of Valuation would be entitled to be heard at the hearing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 (1) states:</P>
      <P>An owner or occupier of any property, the rating authority or an officer of the Commissioner of Valuation may apply at any time for a revision of the valuation of any property entered in the Valuation Lists or for the inclusion therein of any property not so entered.</P>
      <P>The side heading reads: &ldquo;Revisions and new valuations.&rdquo;  Does that apply only to revisions and new valuations?  What happens in a case where somebody is not satisfied with the valuation on the property because from time to time circumstances can change.  A business property may be situated in an area and, for one reason or another, business changes to another area.  Parking laws could have a detrimental effect on the value of the property in that location.  What is the provision then for an existing valuation apart from revisions and new valuations? In a case where the tribunal makes a decision is the tribunal's decision final? In other words, is there any appeal mechanism beyond the tribunal?</P>
      <P>In relation to subsection (3) I agree with Senator Mullooly that there should definitely be a limit on the time in which a decision must be made.  It is all right to say six months; that would be a reasonable length of time but I do not think it should be anything greater than six months.  It should not be open-ended because people would not know where they were as regards the valuation on their property for a considerable length of time.  In view of the various speculations about property tax of one sort or another, valuations that will be fixed now could have a very serious effect.  Does it apply to valuations of all types of property such as private housing on which at present there are no rates?  There is considerable speculation that there may be such a property tax very shortly.</P>
      <P>Subsection (5) (c) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tribunal shall transmit a copy <Col N="59" /> of every notice received by it to the Commissioner of Valuation (who shall be the respondent in, and be entitled to be heard and adduce evidence at the hearing of, the appeal concerned), ...</P>
    <P>Like Senator Mullooly I too seek clarification. In other words can anybody else adduce evidence that might be helpful to a person's case in an appeal situation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers I had a clear note taken that section 3 (3) was somewhat vague and needed some clarification. I would like to ask the Minister if there is an ultimate time limit of six months.  Does the word &ldquo;thereafter&rdquo; refer to the period after the date of application or does it refer to the six months? It needs clarification and perhaps amending if three Senators have the same points to make on it.  It may need to be amended at some stage later on.</P>

      <P>This section has aroused an amount of interest and a number of questions have been raised by quite a few Senators.  On section 3 (3) the principal question has been raised regarding the six months situation.  It provides that the Commissioner of Valuation shall cause every application to be determined as far as possible within six months of receipt of same and shall issue a list of these determinations on a quarterly basis. Once the six months limit is mentioned, if he is not in a position to determine the valuation at the end of six months the commissioner would be under an obligation to explain the delay beyond six months to all the parties involved.  We do not envisage that will happen very frequently.  It is a legal term to allow the commissioner to have the flexibility in the event of legal complications pertaining to intestate situations, or documentation not being available as a result of somebody dying while the valuation is going on, or things like that.  Information would be sought and for certain reasons that information could not be brought forward and, until such time as the information was available, and all the <Col N="60" /> information that the commissioner felt he needed and could be made available to him was available, he could not determine the valuation.  Consequently it is to allow that flexibility to the commissioner that this is inserted.  As far as we are concerned that situation will occur very rarely.  We would not envisage much difficulty there.</P>
      <P>Senator McCormack raised a point on section 3 (5) (c).  It provides that the tribunal shall transmit a copy of every notice of appeal to all affected parties and such parties shall be entitled to be heard and to adduce evidence at the hearing of the appeal by the tribunal.  So anybody affected by the decision would have to be notified and they would be entitled to be heard and produce their documentation and their oral evidence there. Senator McCormack also raised a matter on section 3 (1) pertaining to revisions and new valuations.  This refers to revising existing valuations and new property which has not yet been valued could now be included.  An application could be made by the property owner, the local authority, or an officer of the Commission of Valuation to have this new property included and it is to allow that flexibility that subsection (1) exists.</P>
      <P>Senator Mullooly mentioned identifying the owner or the occupier.  One must take all reasonable steps to verify the owner or the occupier of the property. Local authorities have a vested interest in ensuring that this system works well because, if they cannot identify who owns the property, or who is using the property, or for what purpose the property is being used, levying rates on it would be absolutely futile because they would not be able to collect the rates.  They would co-operate and the Commissioner of Valuation would be obliged to try to establish within reason the exact person, or persons, or company, or otherwise, who own or occupy properties and for what purposes the properties are used.</P>

      <P>When an appeal is before the tribunal it should be open to anybody to apply to the tribunal to be <Col N="61" /> heard in relation to that appeal and not confined to those people who have received a copy of the notice from the tribunal.  I agree that the tribunal will send a copy of the notice to all persons who appear to them to be directly affected by the determination of the appeal, but there may be other persons directly affected by the determination of the appeal and, as the section now stands, it would not be open to such persons to be heard by the tribunal at the hearing of the appeal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am slightly confused as to what the Senator has in mind because the onus would be on the tribunal to utilise all resources available to them, their own office, own staff, the Valuation Office, the local authorities, I presume the Land Registry Office, if necessary, and whatever information would be available to the tribunal when serving notices. If the tribunal had to sit in judgment and somebody not directly affected by the case to be determined was allowed to come in to make a case the tribunal would probably never get through the valuations. If the tribunal then had to communicate the reports or their decisions to other people who might have only superficial interest or a public interest the thing would get far too bureaucratic and cumbersome and there would no systematic decisions arriving.  Consequently we will have to be clear on exactly who would be affected, exactly who could make their submissions.  I presume the appeal system would allow other people who felt aggrieved by any decision and might not be communicated with regarding the decision to be made to make their case to the tribunal and, on a point of law, to the High Court.</P>

      <P>I do not believe anybody and everybody should have the right to be heard by the tribunal but persons should have the right to apply to the tribunal to be heard in connection with any particular appeal which might be before the tribunal.  When applying to the tribunal they would have to state the reasons they felt they should be heard in relation to <Col N="62" /> that appeal and it would then be a matter for the tribunal to decide whether they should be heard in relation to that particular appeal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>What criterion is used in relation to those valuations or how do the Valuation Office arrive at a set figure?  Is there a criterion used because I have a feeling that valuations, particularly in the West of Ireland, are very excessive.  They are far too high especially in the case of business houses.  The turnover in some of those places is very very small and the Valuation Office are being guided by the business being transacted in the bigger centres where you have a bigger population and a higher turnover.  Is there a set criterion for arriving at valuations or how do the Valuation Office arrive at those figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are various criteria laid down for valuations.  I know this is a very important matter for public representatives and perhaps I should read all the information I can give Senators on this matter.  Rateable valuations are based on the net annual value of particular property under the provisions of section 11 of the 1852 Act and section 5 of the 1986 Valuation Act.  In practice the majority of valuations have over time departed from the annual value-letting value-annual rent concept of the 1852 Act and the 1986 Act has not been in force long enough to re-establish this as a basis for all rateable valuations.  The net annual value concept, if fully applied, would mean that all rateable valuations would be fixed at a fraction of the annual <Col N="63" /> value-annual rent of the particular property at a particular date.  This would, in effect, mean that the valuer would first establish the letting value of the property and the rateable valuation would then be calculated by applying a fraction to this amount.</P>
      <P>The principle is best illustrated in the ILAC Centre where rateable valuations are established on the basis of one hundredth of the 1981 annual rent.  This method of valuation is not, however, in widespread use and rateable valuations are in the main calculated by the comparative method of valuation.  Under the comparative method, similar circumstanced properties, that is, properties of similar size, location, quality and use, attract similar rateable valuations. In normal circumstances properties, particularly in the provincial and rural areas, which normally would not be properties that are let, the valuation would be based on comparisons with other similar properties in size, in location, that is, front street, back street and so on, quality, the quality of the property and the use of the properties.  In practice the valuer inspects the property, notes the location, the size, the quality, the use and the general structure and then seeks to find similar properties that are already valued &mdash; preferably with their valuations established at appeal &mdash; and basically values the subject property at the same price per square metre as the relevant comparisons.</P>
      <P>For the once off properties, that is, specialised properties where there are no direct comparative properties already valued, the valuer will normally base his valuation on the capital cost.  In these circumstances the valuer will first establish the capital cost and then seek to fix the valuation on the basis of a fraction of the capital cost.  Because of the lack of comparative evidence in these cases and the absence of an established fraction of capital cost, these particular rateable valuations are often finally decided in the courts.  I hope that helps to clear the air on how valuations are determined on properties.</P>

      <P>I am not surprised that Senator Hussey would raise this, coming from Galway, Glenamaddy I understand. This brings me back to my original query as to whether the fourth report of the Commission on Taxation had been consulted in the process of preparing this legislation.  The answer I was given was that it did not directly impinge on the particular provisions of this Bill but that it would more properly belong to a general revision, the kind of consolidation and codification that I already spoke about in my Second Stage contribution.  On page 102 of the fourth report it discusses defects in the operation of the valuation system.  I will read paragraph 24 of that report.  There must be an ancestral or folk memory lurking in the background of Senator Hussey's consciousness that he raised this here on this section of the Bill.  It reads:</P>
      <P>The defects in the operation of the valuation system are highlighted by the results of the revisions of buildings' valuations carried out in Galway and Buncrana.  In the period 1946-1950, comprehensive annual revisions, excluding land and railways, were carried out in Galway borough and urban districts on the basis of 1914 letting values which were substantially below the current letting values.  This resulted in an increase of 52 per cent in the total valuation of Galway borough.</P>
      <P>I think lurking there in the background &mdash; not that Senator Hussey would have been active politically at that stage or anything like that &mdash; is a folk memory of that sudden hike as a consequence of that revision.  I find what the Minister had to say about it particularly interesting.  I would exhort that when the revised complete statute sees the light of day very close attention should be paid to the analysis of this matter in the fourth report of the Committee on Taxation, that some of the recommendations will see the light of day in aspects of our legislation and that this report, like so many reports, will not merely be consigned to gathering dust on the shelf.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a small rateable property.  I saw the Minister looking in at it the other day when he was passing. The Minister referred to the quality of the property.  I do not think that should be a criterion because somebody may improve the quality of his property as I did myself with the property I have.  I had my valuation changed from £3.50 to £25 and that was a lot more than a 52 per cent increase in the borough of Galway for a very small property.  There should be some incentive for a person who improves his property and does it according to the now strict planning regulations which make you put in teak fronts and various other aspects in keeping with the area in which you are improving your property.  If a person is penalised in that manner through the planning process, he should not be further penalised on the valuation of his property.  Having improved the quality of his property for the sake of the area he is in, and for the sake of the upkeep of the area he is in, and for the sake of making property look right in that area and because of the planning regulations, even apart from his own initiative in doing that, I do not think that should be used as a penalty clause. I would like to hear the Minister's response to that.</P>

      <P>I can see merit in what <Col N="66" /> both Senators have said.  With reference to Senator Bulbulia's repeated querying pertaining to the report of the Commission on Taxation, we will be looking at this in the restructuring of the Valuation Office and it is something that will be borne in mind.  I am sure the new tribunal will also be taking the deliberations of that report into account.  This illustrates the need for a more modern code for the whole valuation process.  We admit that the present system is not absolutely perfect and this is why we need the modern code to take account of all the major changes that have taken place in property and in technology over the years.  Going back to Senator McCormack's point &mdash; I know the attractive property he has in the fine location near the city centre &mdash; I presume&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We had better not speak about that here.  We are only based here.  It does not matter what services are given; we are only based on this actual property.  I presume that capital allowances can be made under the tax codes for the input in upgrading the property but the Valuation Office's position would be that once you improve your property, improve your asset, make it attractive, it should create a better commercial operation and create more financial resources for the property occupier or the property owner, whoever is responsible for the payment of the rates and thereby warrants an increase in valuation.  Perhaps it is something that could be looked at in the future as an incentive and an acknowledgement of people's input into upgrading, improving and renovating their properties.  Maybe some allowance could be made for that similar to allowances made in the past under the old rating system.</P>

      <P>In the borough of Galway and in other boroughs there were special designated areas &mdash; it is a separate problem &mdash; but the people outside the special designated areas are at a serious <Col N="67" /> disadvantage now even though we all welcome the benefit of the designated areas in providing very generous incentives for people to develop in them.  However, it has meant that property outside those areas in the boroughs concerned &mdash; Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Galway &mdash; are at a severe disadvantage.  The same amount of money has to be spent in improving property outside the designated area as inside the designated area with none of the advantages attached. Those things must be looked at in the valuation of new property in the borough areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The main reason I have raised this point is because over the years I have seen a steady increase in the valuations particularly of businesses in small towns.  I know those people cannot afford to pay the rates that are being levied on them.  They went to the trouble of renovating the premises &mdash; in many cases those would be licensed premises where the trade is only a night one and no business being carried out there during the day &mdash; and they are finding it very hard to make ends meet when they have to pay rates, electricity and all the other bills they have to meet.</P>
      <P>We all encourage them to do up their premises, to renovate them and make them more attractive for tourists and for others who might like to use them, but yet after having carried out all that work and going to a lot of expense they find that in many cases the valuations on those premises have doubled, trebled and in some cases increased even more.  This has created problems for many businesses and it is for this reason I raise the point. I would like the Valuation Office to look at the local situation where you have in many cases a dwindling population and where you have not got the turnover of business.  There should be a special case made for those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The valuations in the small towns should not be based on the turnover you would have in a city like Galway or Limerick, Dublin or Cork where you have a large and expanding population. <Col N="68" /> In recent times we have a dwindling population in small towns as the young people are going away.  The Minister is aware that in our own area in County Galway there are many small shopkeepers and publicans who are finding it extremely difficult to make ends meet and they find in many cases that when they extend their lounge bar and carry out some improvements the valuer from the Valuation Office is down on them immediately and the valuation is doubled and trebled.  This is unjust and immoral in the present circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity there is such a major disincentive for people to improve their property, that they are instantly clobbered with a much higher valuation. I should like to quote again from the Fourth Report of the Committee on Taxation, page 102, paragraph 27.  It is from the section dealing with defects in the operation of the valuation system which is what we have been talking about.  It states that:</P>
      <P>It is often claimed that valuations are so out-of-date that they must inevitably lead to anomalies and inequities in the incidence of rates.  Conversely it may be argued that old buildings involve heavy outlay in repairs and are not only costly to maintain but to service with heat and light.  Since extensions and improvements generally give rise to revaluations, commercial and industrial buildings are more likely to be up-to-date than residential property.</P>
      <P>It goes for the argument that the valuation given to the revamped lounge bar and extension is the true valuation and that everybody else ought to catch up somewhere along the line.  This is the opposite of what Senator Hussey has been saying.  His point, at the present time of recession, has more of my sympathy than recommendations in this instance from the Committee on Taxation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to update the manner of dealing with valuation and bring it into line with <Col N="69" /> modern requirements.  I always get worried when we talk about things being done in the interests of so-called efficiency but even though I get worried I must say that the terms of section 3 have to be welcomed.  There is scope and opportunity in the section to improve the legislation as a whole, in other words, to carry on with the process that was begun in 1986 of bringing 19th century legislation closer to the 20th century.  We have over the years, not only in regard to this legislation, got so centralised that things are clogged and complicated and according to the social welfare commission report of 1986 there are 36 different rates of child allowance.  This may not seem relevant to the question of valuation but it is relevant to the way in which we deal with legislation and the way we are slow to amend it and take things out of the 19th century.  For example, there are 23 different bodies responsible for the agriculture industry, that is, according to <i>The Irish Times</i> of 2 October, 1986.</P>
      <P>The function of the commission, apart from taking a more global look at things and defining who the owner or the occupier might be of a premises, will be to make the whole question of dealing with rating more compact and more efficient. I am cynical about the efficiency side of it but when you see people making an effort you have to congratulate them.  All our experience has been that we are being progressively deprived of opportunities for spontaneity in local and regional areas.  This will give us an opportunity to get out of the situation in which we have found ourselves overrating in general. We have this mentality that everything has to be referred to central Government. Please God, with the commission being given much more clout and its scope widened and working in conjunction with the tribunal, it should do a good job for the people who are affected by rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The net result of all this failure to take ourselves out of the 19th century has been that all the linkages that should have been there and that were essential to development have been frustrated.  I do not know if it is appropriate to the section but perhaps another day will show that <Col N="70" /> perhaps it is not tribunals, or commissions with which we should be concerning ourselves with regard to rating but rather that we are badly in need of efficiency which can only be cured by a very severe dose of reforms, but reforms that will not check the energy and industry of people and will in fact bring about real standards of uniformity, real arrangements regarding classifications, etc., arrangements that are very defective at the moment.</P>
    <P>I will not go into the other areas where money is available at this moment because it is not appropriate to the Bill. The Commissioners and the Tribunal, will have to deal with this section as well as every other section and it is interesting to note that at the time of our independence we were, in fact, one of the richest countries per head in Northern Europe.  After 60 years we have fallen very far behind and we are in fact now dealing with the rating system as a whole. We are at the very wrong end of the league table with regard to this but I hope that the terms of section 3 and the terms under which the tribunal will function and also the terms of Schedules 1 and 2 will be wide enough to bring about a greater standard of uniformity and a fairer approach to the whole matter of rating whether it involves a businessman, a State-sponsored company or somebody who is in the fishing area, in forestry, mines, minerals, coal yards, quarries, etc.  Let us hope that this is a beginning. The section itself is worth commenting on for that reason.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had excellent contributions from a large number of Senators.  A number spoke about the disincentives for improving one's property and risking an adjusted valuation and increased valuation.  I can concur readily with the contributions of my colleague, Senator Tom Hussey, and indeed I can identify with many of the problems he has highlighted.  The high increased valuation can often be a disincentive and a discouragement to people in business particularly with a shortage of disposable income and not in a position to meet their <Col N="71" /> demands.  I think that the new Bill will create an opportunity for people in this situation to have a more expedient line to having valuations revised.  They can report their situation to the local authority who will notify the Commissioner of Valuation and he will determine the revised application.  This determination can then be appealed to the new Valuation Tribunal and this again may be appealed to the High Court on a specific point of law if a specific point of law exists.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, there are disincentives but this is part and parcel of a tax system all over the world, particularly of our own tax system, which must be equitable and be seen to be equitable, I do not think there is anyone who can say that he likes paying tax.  The higher the value of the property based on its size, location and quality the more income one should earn; <i>ergo</i> the more tax or rates one should have to pay thereafter, in order to ensure that there is equity in the tax system the factual position pertaining to income is taken into account and rates are set off as an expense to ensure overall equity in the revenue area.  We hope that now under the proposals contained in this Bill that it will be easier for people to have access to revised valuations, get a fairer and more equitable decision and, based on the equitable tax laws we have, that equality of decisions in the valuation area can be matched by equality of performance in the revenue area.</P>

Would the Minister be in a position to give an indication as to whether he feels that this will he a considerable sum of money or <Col N="72" /> is it a modest sum?  I understand it to say in the explanatory memorandum on the financial implications that the objective of the Bill is to provide a more effective valuation system without any additional net cost to the Exchequer and that the staffing implications are being considered as part of a review of the Valuation Office operations as a whole.  Could I knit that last point, the one that is in the explanatory memorandum, intersection 9 which refers to the usual provision for the payment of expenses incurred in the administration of the Act and ask if there is an anomaly there or could the Minister indicate what exactly is involved in funding the provisions of the Act?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>My own interpretation of the situation is that section 9 empowers the Minister for Finance or the Minister for the Environment or both to pay the expenses.  That would include the salaries and the expenses encountered by the Commissioners of Valuation and by the Valuation Tribunal and of course also the Commissioner of Valuation himself and his staff.  They would be paid out of either the Finance Vote or the Environmental Vote as distinct from a particular fund having to be created to pay those expenses and also as a protection to ensure that the expenses incurred in valuation, be it the commissioner's expenses or the tribunal expenses, would not be levied on those whose valuations may be revised.  It is intended to protect that situation and it is also a enabling mechanism to ensure that the State can discharge a statutory responsibility for discharging the salaries and expenses incurred by staff employed either on a permanent or temporary basis acting on behalf of the State.</P>

In order to guard against <Col N="74" /> this, the tribunal will have the right to charge a fee under regulations passed and sanctioned by the Minister for Finance for any requests for valuations.</P>

      <P>On Report Stage, on sections 10 and 11 I would like to welcome the democratic criterion contained in both of these sections because they both talk about any regulations made under &mdash; in the case of section 10 &mdash; this section will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and in the case of section 11 provides for the laying of certain orders and regulations made by the Minister for Finance under the Act before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is a change and a welcome change from the old formula whereby the Minister could make an order and lay it on the Table of the House and after a period of 21 sitting days the order would pass.  I understand there is to be an improvement on that situation and a welcome improvement and a soundly-based democratic improvement. I would like to register my comments on that matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill gives the House the opportunity to focus on some of the affairs of CIE.  The organisation is important for many reasons.  Its extensive transport network by rail and road makes it the backbone of the country's inland transport system.  Very many are dependent on the services of Bus Atha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann for their personal transport needs.  Industry and <Col N="76" /> commerce use the freight services extensively. In summary, CIE services make a substantial input into the social and economic life of the community.</P>
    <P>In passing, I began my working life with Córas Iompair Éireann and, on account of that and consequent on that, I have more than the usual interest in the affairs of Córas Iompair Éireann.  As taxpayers and legislators, we are interested in CIE because the Exchequer subvention to CIE, now well in excess of £100 million per annum, has to be met from the State's resources.</P>
    <P>The economy is passing through a difficult phase and this increases the emphasis on value for money, cost effectiveness and efficiency.  This is highlighted for the CIE organisation in the challenging targets which have been set for them by the Government for the period 1985-89. Iarnród Éireann are striving to achieve the railway target of reducing costs by close to 20 per cent over the five years. Bus Átha Cliath are seeking to halve their 1984 deficit in real terms and Bus Éireann's aim is to make provincial buses profitable.  The achievement of these targets has not been made easy for CIE by the State's inability over recent years to meet in full its financial commitment to the board.  This, in part, has generated the need for the Bill now before the House.</P>
    <P>The purposes of the Bill are: to discharge the obligation on CIE to repay to the Exchequer capital advances of £44,458,691; to enable the board to borrow up to £45 million on a long term basis for meeting its obligations and carrying out its duties; to allow the board the option of selling by tender property linked to abandoned railway lines; to increase the levels of penalties for various offences in relation to the railways, and to provide for arrest without warrant by the Garda in respect of certain offences.</P>
    <P>Although an explanatory memorandum was circulated with the Bill, I wish to explain the background and other relevant particulars to the House as well as the fact that the Bill before the House takes account of a number of amendments to it passed by Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="77" /> The particular arrangements which eventually led to the proposed change to the State advances date back to late 1985. At that time, the then Ministers for Communications and Finance settled, for 1986 and subsequent years, the timing of payment of the normal Exchequer subvention and interest charges on the capital cost of DART to CIE.  This involved the following: the deferral to 1987 of some payments due in 1986; the deferral to 1988 of substantial arrears due to be paid in 1987, and the payment in permanent arrears of some moneys due in 1988 and subsequent years.</P>
    <P>Pending receipt of the arrears, CIE had to have recourse to temporary borrowings in order to meet their liabilities from 1985 onwards.  The accumulated effect of the shortfalls in subvention and DART interest is that the Exchequer would need to provide an additional £45 million in 1988 in order to discharge the arrears.  Added to the subvention of £113.6 million which has been allocated to CIE for 1988, this would have brought the total Exchequer requirement for CIE next year to close to £160 million.  The allocation of £113.6 million includes £14 million to cover the total expected interest payment on DART in 1988.  The total allocation for 1987 is £107.4 million.</P>
    <P>When the Government came to dealing with the Estimates for 1988 it was obvious that there was no prospect in current economic circumstances of meeting CIE's needs in full.  At the same time, we recognised that, if the issue were not tackled, the Exchequer's indebtedness to CIE would continue to grow, with adverse consequences for the Exchequer and the CIE financial position.  Having examined the limited options available, the Government decided to write off against the shortfalls in subvention the £44,458,691 which had been provided for CIE between 1965 and 1982 in repayable advances.  The write off of the advances is provided for in section 2 (1) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As CIE are required to pay interest on the repayable advances, section 2 (2) of the Bill discharges CIE from that liability. The interest currently amounts to about £4.4 million per annum.  This <Col N="78" /> saving to CIE will serve as an offset against interest payable by the board on the borrowings generated by the deferral of the subvention moneys.  The board will, however, be required to finance the repayment of the borrowings from its own resources.  The net effect of this arrangement for CIE is that the additional costs for the board will be confined to the repayment of the sums borrowed to finance arrears of subvention instead of providing at some date in the future for repayment of State advances.</P>
    <P>The Minister would have liked to have met the Exchequer liability in full but this was not possible in current circumstances. The solution, while not perfect, is, nevertheless, better than any likely to emerge as a result of pushing the problem aside for another day.  It brings to an end the payment of subvention in arrears and makes CIE's position clear so that they can plan their finances for the future.</P>
    <P>To help CIE meet the additional burden, section 3 has been included to enable the board to borrow on a long term basis for the purpose of financing the arrears of subvention.  This will involve the conversion to term loans of temporary borrowings already incurred in relation to the arrears.  In that way, the repayments of principal can be spread over a longer period.  Section 4 of the Bill provides for the guaranteeing in the normal way of those borrowings by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill supplements the board's existing borrowing powers, under which CIE are authorised to borrow for capital purposes on a long term basis and to borrow temporarily for general operational purposes.  The statutory limit on borrowings for capital purposes is £250 million and that for temporary borrowing is £40 million.  At the end of 1986 the board's borrowings for capital purposes amounted to £157 million and the temporary borrowings stood at £30.7 million. The board's temporary borrowings are now close to the £40 million limit.</P>
    <P>Subsection 7 of section 21 of the Transport Act, 1950 empowers the board of CIE to sell land under and adjoining an <Col N="79" /> abandoned railway line, either by private treaty to the owner of the land on both sides of such line, or by public auction to any person including such owner.  CIE have requested that the additional option of sale by tender be provided for, because experience has shown that parts of abandoned railway lines which are not of interest to adjoining landowners are sometimes not sufficiently valuable to justify the costs of sale by auction. Section 5 of the Bill provides for sale by tender and CIE plan to use the tendering process, where it would be to the board's advantage to dispose of property in that way.  These tenders would be invited by public advertisement.</P>
    <P>Members of the House have been concerned with reports of offences and vandalism committed on or in relation to the railway.  The offences cover a wide range of problems such as wilful destruction of property, stone throwing at trains, placing obstacles in the path of trains, refusing to close gates at certain level crossings, trespass on the railway, and improper use of the communication cord on trains.  All these involve dangerous practices and can lead to loss of life or limb and damage to property.  What starts out as a &ldquo;lark&rdquo; can cause irremediable loss and damage.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the frequency and scope of many of these types of incidents have grown in recent years. We are now long past the stage where they can be treated as outbreaks of high spirits.  Many of them are obviously undertaken with malicious damage in mind.  At considerable cost, the board have been taking special measures to try to curb these objectionable and anti-social activities. Some success has been achieved but it is clear that further measures are needed to impress on those concerned that their misbehaviour is unacceptable. CIE have also to deal with people who refuse to pay or try to avoid paying fares.</P>
    <P>While the existing legislation provides for prosecutions and penalties, the courts are handicapped in applying penalties which match the gravity of the offences. <Col N="80" /> This is because of the impact of maximum permissible penalties has been eroded over time.  For example, it would pay a person to avoid paying his or her fare in the knowledge that the maximum fine on conviction is £2.  The penalties for some of the offences dealt with in the Bill were set as long ago as 1861.  Some of the penalties were revised between that time and 1971, but even they no longer match the potential grievousness of offences. Penalties have to be imposed which will convince offenders of the likely serious adverse personal consequences of their acts.</P>
    <P>Existing maximum penalties range from £2 to £25.  For the types of offences which are covered by sections 6 to 10 of the Bill, the Minister originally proposed to increase the maximum penalties to £300 and/or a maximum of three months imprisonment.  During the debate on the Bill in Dáil Éireann a number of Deputies expressed the view that the proposed penalties were not sufficiently severe and that they should be increased further. The Minister considered this matter further in the light of the debate and views expressed by his colleagues in Government. The conclusion reached was that there was a justifiable basis for even higher maximum penalties than those included in the Bill as introduced.  As a result, Dáil Éireann agreed amendments to increase the maximum penalties and the new levels are set down in sections 6 to 10 of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport (Mr. Lyons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take up where I left off before the intervention of a vote in the Dáil.  I was talking about the increased fines and penalties.  These increased penalties give a clear message to would-be offenders that their behaviour is unacceptable and will fall to be punished in a very substantial way.  Interference with railway property and the proper operation of rail services cannot be tolerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 22 of the regulation of Railways Act, 1868, provides for penalties in relation to the provision of communication cords in trains as well as penalties for misuse.  At present such cords <Col N="82" /> are required to be fitted in passenger trains which travel more than 20 miles without stopping.  The potential penalty for not having communication cords is £10 and section 9 of the Bill provides for increasing the maximum penalty which may be imposed on a railway company for the non-provision of these communication cords to £500.  The section also extends its application to all passenger trains so as to bring the legislation into line with existing CIE practice.</P>
    <P>Section 11, which provides for arrest without warrant, was introduced because the absence of these powers was hindering intervention by the Garda in the interest of enforcement.  This provision was not in the Bill as originally drafted but was introduced as an amendment in Dáil Éireann in the light of representations by Deputies during that debate.  The penalty provisions in the Bill are necessary in the interest of facilitating Iarnród Éireann to carry out their responsibilities of safe and efficient transport in an effective manner.</P>
    <P>No discussion of legislative measures in relation to CIE would be complete without some account of the general state of affairs of the board and their subsidiaries. The most recent comprehensive report on the affairs of CIE is the board's annual report and accounts for 1986 which were presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas on 8 October 1987.  The result shows that for 1986 there was a net profit of £3.648 million before exceptional items such as those of a non-recurring nature.  This took account of Exchequer subvention payments totalling almost £117 million.</P>
    <P>The railway subvention at £93.326 million continues to represent a huge cost to the Exchequer although the company recorded a profit of £2.925 million during the year.  Other figures of note for 1986 were: total railway passenger journeys increased by 8 per cent to a record 21.7 million, with DART accounting for just over 13 million; passenger journeys on provincial bus services increased by 3.8 per cent, and the Dublin city services passenger journeys increased 2 per cent to 165 million.  Despite CIE's best efforts, <Col N="83" /> rail freight tonnage dropped during 1986 by 7.5 per cent in comparison with the 1985 figure to 3.126 million tonnes.  The road freight results showed a profit of £324,000, compared to a profit of £195,000 in 1985.</P>
    <P>Overall, the board had a good year in 1986 and this represented a continuation of the progress of recent years.  I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to the chairman of CIE, the board, the management and the whole CIE workforce for their performance. It demonstrates continuing efforts in the board's various sectors for increasing revenue and providing cost effective and efficient transport responding to passengers' needs.  The level of Exchequer support required for CIE is still very high and there is a need to reduce it further.</P>
    <P>In February 1987 the three new CIE subsidiaries, Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, commenced operations.  The smoothness of the changeover to the new structures has been remarkable.  The board's report for 1987 will present, for the first time, the results under the new structures.</P>
    <P>The board's activities got off to a good start at the beginning of the year by achieving their budgetary objectives. More recently, however, there have been downward trends in the operating results against budget.  This is a cause for concern. I know, and most other Members of the House know, that CIE are making every effort to correct that situation and I hope their efforts will be rewarded.  I believe CIE have the potential to continue to improve their overall financial position but they will not do so without hard work and responsible attitudes throughout the organisation.</P>
    <P>An item which seems to have a recurring adverse effect on CIE are the localised labour disputes of doubtful merit which arise from time to time.  These interruptions to services are usually limited in scope but they are sources of major annoyance and inconvenience to the CIE customers who are affected.  They tend to draw public odium on the whole of <Col N="84" /> CIE.  That is very unfair to the vast majority of CIE employees.  It is a great pity that in these situations the minority becomes newsworthy, while those in CIE who continue to serve the public remain unsung and get no comment for their efforts.</P>
    <P>The Government are tackling the serious difficulties confronting the economy. I indicated earlier but it has to be repeated in case anybody is losing sight of it.  At a time when the general economy is going through a period of difficulty, the transport sector is as vulnerable as any other, and the CIE organisation have to face up to the challenges confronting them.  Success cannot be achieved without the active support of all CIE employees giving of their best.  The employees' own futures cannot be divorced from that of the organisation.</P>
    <P>Over recent years the CIE rail carriage fleet and bus fleets have been upgraded and CIE customers have experienced the value of these developments.  Most of the mainline rail routes have now modern carriages, very recent additions being those introduced on the Dublin-Westport and Dublin-Rosslare routes. Iarnród Éireann are modifying their carriage-building programme in order to improve the quality of services on radial and outer suburban routes.  The first of these carriages will be available next year.  The renewal of the provincial bus fleet was completed in 1986 and 50 new luxury coaches for use on the Supabus and Expressway routes and by the tours division were acquired.  The Dublin bus fleet has also been improved over recent years, but quite a lot remains to be done as anybody who uses that service will readily realise.</P>
    <P>From media coverage it is quite clear that the general image of CIE as a commercial organisation has also been changing. The improved profile which the CIE group have achieved through better marketing of their services and better use of resources is very evident.  We have the special DART events, including the cultural links with the theatre and poetry, the special Killarney weekend packages <Col N="85" /> for visitors travelling from Dublin by rail. I personally had the privilege of attending recently the &ldquo;Showtime Express&rdquo; as it is known.  Not alone are CIE to be complimented on the inauguration of that service but so also are the business people and hoteliers in Killarney, whose initiative was responded to by the people of Dublin simply because they were getting value for money.  That exercise in itself is a clear indication to CIE that with a little bit of marketing, and initiative they could improve their service, as has been achieved by the &ldquo;Showtime Express&rdquo; to Killarney.  Indeed a similar service could be run on other routes to the west and all over the country.  This would improve the image, competitiveness, and financial resources of the company.</P>
    <P>While the venture was prompted from outside CIE, we must acknowledge that CIE's response indicates that there is a new and a clear effort by the board and the company to achieve greater profitability and greater success.  They are improving the product and making strenuous efforts to attract more customers and so improve the utilisation of the rail and road fleets with obvious consequences for the organisation's revenues. These efforts and innovations in CIE reflect a customer-orientated approach which deserves to succeed and will do so.</P>
    <P>CIE's role in the tourist industry is a major one.  Not only are they engaged in selling abroad Irish holidays and in providing transport services and tours for holidaymakers in Ireland, but they are also responsible for Rosslare Harbour, one of our international gateways and the major sea access point from continental Europe.  First-class access transport and facilities for visitors at the points of entry are essential for a further growth in the number of visitors coming to spend their holidays among us.</P>
    <P>CIE have been working for a number of years on upgrading the facilities at Rosslare Harbour.  A major part of the development plan for the harbour is finished and next year when the new passenger terminal is completed we will have <Col N="86" /> at Rosslare a product of the highest international standards with quality for visitors. These are so necessary to remove for our visitors some of the frustrations which cannot but damage our image as a friendly and concerned people and to create the most favourable impression possible on our visitors as they arrive.  As the old sean-fhocal says &ldquo;your front door creates the first impression, and first impressions are lasting&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In summary, I have explained the background to the Bill and its provisions. I have outlined for the House the progress which CIE have made in recent years and touched on some of the problems facing the organisation.  I am heartened by what has been achieved but recognise that there are still many challenges facing the board and their subsidiaries. If Senators have questions arising from the issues raised in the Bill I will endeavour to answer them.</P>
    <P>The financial performance of CIE over the past three years inspires some confidence and I know that under the leadership of the chairman and board of CIE every effort will be made to achieve the targets set by Government.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has stated earlier in the course of his speech, the purpose of this Bill is to allow CIE to discharge their present obligation to repay to the Exchequer capital advances of approximately £44 million, to enable the board to borrow up to another £45 million on a long term basis to meet their obligations and carry out their duties, to allow the board the option of selling by tender property linked to abandoned railway lines, and to increase the levels of penalties for various offences in relation to the railways.  The Minister also referred to the new section which provides for arrest without warrant.  I will comment on that section later.  The Bill offers an opportunity to make some points in general about CIE and the whole question of public transport systems today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be said that when the public <Col N="87" /> hear of a debt of £45 million owed by CIE being written off and that they will be allowed to borrow further, they will not be surprised.  There is a general public perception that CIE as a State institution has been, and still is, rather costly and in many cases inefficient.  Unfortunately from time to time CIE actually seemed committed to proving the theory that State companies would be continual loss-makers but perhaps that is part of the past rather than the present.  This perception results from years of bad financial reports emanating from CIE.  CIE presented an image in many cases of a strike-bound, unhappy company.  The overall view was that CIE's approach was not geared to meet the needs of today's commuters in an effective, cost efficient, reliable and punctual fashion.  Against this background any discussions which we will have on CIE, or any new proposals or legislation regarding them, must be geared towards ensuring an improved overall service to the public.</P>
    <P>Neither can we allow to go unconsidered the question of private bus services, the setting up of which in some areas has been met with total public support. It also has resulted, not surprisingly in opposition and counter reaction by CIE, as the company were then known. All of us would agree with the old saying that competition is the spice of life and, indeed, it is certainly the spice of efficiency within life and business.  It is foolish to suggest or even think that any company engaged in any area of activity can totally fetter any opposition to it and, at the same time, remain effective and efficient and have full knowledge of what the public are demanding.  If you shut off the competition you are not fully aware of the public's demands.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, for many people the word &ldquo;privatisation&rdquo; leaves a bad taste in their mouth and once you start discussing anything such as private bus operations you hear shouts and screams from many sectors.  We do not claim to be, and fortunately I would say, we do not aspire to a socialist state, yet we have a plethora of rules, regulations and red tape in many <Col N="88" /> areas which would do justice to many a socialist state.  It is interesting and ironic that at a time when some of the so-called classical socialist states such as the Soviet Union and China are bending over backwards to remove some of the many layers of red tape binding up many of their industries, having realised they had not worked efficiently, we are not so willing to look at new methods of doing business. I hope we will not take as long as they took to realise some of our mistakes and rectify them.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I would like to make it clear that I am not making this speech here tonight as a major speech in favour of any sort of privatisation because I envisage a major role for public transport. However, we must ensure that side by side with public transport there is a certain controlled and planned level of private initiative allowed.  It will benefit us all.  Take for instance, the private bus services which run on a regular basis to Dublin, in particular , from many of the provincial towns and cities.  For many years nobody but CIE provided a bus service which was, unfortunately, expensive and under-used.  Then with private operators providing a cheap regular service, the public reacted and welcomed this service with open arms.  They use it. We were fortunate that CIE reacted to this by improving their service in many areas and by matching the competition £ for £.  In the long run everybody benefited as a result.</P>
    <P>This sort of development can only be good for the economy.  In those circumstances the people &mdash; the commuters &mdash; voted with their feet and they voted for their pockets.  They seemed to accept that the private bus services provided a good service and we cannot disregard the wishes of those people.  The more people we encourage to travel by public transport, by train, or by bus, regardless of who runs these services, the better.  In these days of pollution, lead pollution fumes from traffic, with poor and deteriorating road surfaces and a high danger level on these roads, it does not just make <Col N="89" /> economic sense but, indeed, commonsense to encourage the greatest possible utilisation of public transport. However, in order to ensure that the utilisation of public transport increases at a steady level, as we would hope, it is vital that reliable, punctual and economic services are provided.  Unfortunately these conditions will only be met where at least some degree of competition exists.</P>
    <P>As the Minister mentioned in his speech, you cannot gloss over the social aspect of public transport as it operates at present.  In fairness to the three companies that exist at present, this service is being provided by them on bus and train routes and other companies would find some of these routes quite uneconomic. Because of this we must ensure that anybody who tries to milk the system by removing from CIE the cream of the routes must also bear some responsibility for the rather sourer cream.  It must be accepted that some of the losses for which CIE became infamous resulted from the social aspect of their service.  As it is vital that these services should continue so also it is vital that we accept the losses which will accrue from them.</P>
    <P>This does not allow us to fool ourselves into believing we can accept losses of millions of pounds year in, year out in the State transport services.  These losses must be examined and we must ensure that any loopholes which exist are tightened up and that these services are run in the most effective and efficient way possible.  There are ways, however, in which CIE's present services can be improved and streamlined to help the public in general.  The whole question of their fares policy needs immediate attention and, in particular, this comment would apply to Iarnród Éireann as it is now called.  At present train fares are unjustly high and are the biggest disincentive to train travel.</P>
    <P>Surely it is time the simple economic reality of more people being prepared to travel when costs are low should be brought home to this company.  I know some improvements have taken place but, unfortunately, these improvements are restricted to such areas as one day <Col N="90" /> special tickets, bargain days, group and family rates etc.  In itself this is good but what needs to be done now is to introduce a general reduction in ordinary fares.  The present fares have too many anomalies. Why, for instance, is a family ticket for a family of five or six sometimes cheaper than a ticket for a husband and wife? Why are single fares not sold at what you would expect, half or nearly half the normal fare?  In that respect I must mention that the single fare between Mallow and Dublin is £23 which is the same as a day return fare.  That is very much open to a charge of being incorrect. It does nothing to promote the utilisation of public transport to have that sort of fare system in operation.</P>
    <P>I would hope the whole policy on fares will be addressed by the Minister as soon as possible.  The present policy seems to be based on the assumption that the numbers travelling by public transport will not change and, therefore, that rising costs must be met by raising the cost of travel.  Surely this train of thought must be altered.  Let us aim to reduce the unit cost of travel not just by gimmickry but by plain and simple fare reduction and a new powerful campaign of public transport promotion.  When the fares charged are seen to be fair, the benefit will quickly accrue to the transport companies.  This was never more clearly evident than on days of major GAA and soccer matches and, indeed, sporting events when the public react wholeheartedly to economic fares.</P>
    <P>There must also be a greater willingness on the part of Iarnród Éireann to allow flexibility on their routes.  For instance, in my own constituency one of the most popular and most important train routes was a late night service serving Mallow from Cork.  It was used especially by students and by people who were working late at night in Cork.  The service was provided simply by the addition to the mail train of the passenger carriage.  Yet CIE decided it was no longer necessary and decided to take off the passenger carriage from the mail train.  Even though the mail train still runs night in, night out, the passenger <Col N="91" /> carriage is not available for the public to travel.  That does not make any economic sense whatsoever and it certainly does nothing to increase public confidence in our public transport company, CIE.</P>
    <P>With regard to the social aspect of the service offered by the three constituent companies of CIE while we accept that the social role must continue, new ideas and initiatives can help these routes not just to continue but to prosper.  Surely some thought must go into the idea of providing smaller and more economic buses in country areas?  To see a 50-seater bus travelling around the roads of the west and other peripheral areas with three or four passengers does nothing to increase your confidence in the way the service is being run.  With new technology available on a daily basis we should aim for a special type of bus to service the rural areas.  The point has been made validly from time to time that there should be some thought given to using the buses from the school transport service in conjunction with CIE to provide services to rural areas.  This idea will be knocked on the head now, especially as the school transport system is under such pressure, but at least it was an idea which should have got more consideration that it did.</P>
    <P>Yesterday evening I spoke with people involved in An Post and I questioned them on the idea of the joint postal bus service, an idea which has been mentioned from time to time.  I was informed that there is a joint venture bus in operation on one route in County Clare and it is reported to be working quite successfully. This joint An Post-Bus Éireann type service is popular and prevalent in many areas throughout continental Europe.  This is something we should consider for some rural areas.  It would help provide two services in the most economic way possible.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate that the Minister is also responsible for tourism.  He mentioned in his speech that CIE play an important role in the tourist industry. That was noted by the Price Waterhouse group in their report on tourism.  They indicated that there was a failure by our <Col N="92" /> public transport industry to aid in any proper fashion the important tourist industry.  I agree with them in that respect and hope that this failure will be recognised publicly and reversed.</P>
    <P>It must be said in fairness to CIE that at present they operate a popular and good value system of bus touring holidays throughout the country which is used, in particular, by middle-aged and elderly people and indeed to a lesser extent by some of the younger people, who find it quite good.  There is a glaring lack of effort to encourage the tens of thousands of young people who trek throughout Europe on the cheap rail and bus system to use the buses and trains in Ireland.  We would be ideally suited to this market so we should encourage young people to come to Ireland by letting them know that we have a bus and train service that would be suitable for their needs.  It could transport them from point A to point B cheaply and reliably.  I would hope this point will be considered.  However, in order to ensure the success of any such service we would have to streamline further the rail and bus services from our airports and seaports.  The present system is too haphazard.  If you were trying to go from any of our ports &mdash; air or sea &mdash; inland and you had to depend totally on public transport you could run into the situation where a three or four hour journey by car could take a day.  This is a pity because it does not assist the tourist industry as it should.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the labour difficulties of CIE.  I agree fully with his comments.  He noted correctly that unfortunately it has always been the cause that a minority within the CIE group have been giving the company a bad name and image and as a result of this many peole have lost faith in public transport.  We have reached a stage that when a strike is called by any of the three transport companies, people in general are no longer surprised.  They just ask how long it will last.  When you reach this stage you know that the situation has deteriorated beyond all acceptable levels.  I hope we will see no more of these wildcat strikes and that the people <Col N="93" /> involved will be more mature in their deliberations and more careful in calling for industrial action.  The public transport system and the economy have lost too much as a result of it and, in addition, CIE's whole image has fallen too far because of it.</P>
    <P>Section 5 relates to the selling of abandoned railway lines by public tender.  I wonder why this section is included in the Bill?  If am not concerned about the section as such but I know from experience on the county council and from seeing houses and so on being sold by tender, that this is not a satisfactory situation. It was stated in the other House that the reasons for the section being before us is the fact that CIE found it difficult to sell by public auction small tracts of land adjoining abandoned railways. Changing over to public tender and allowing railways to be sold by public tender will not increase the attractiveness of the land.  Neither will it increase the number of people interested in buying these parcels of land.  It will only cause more confusion and add another layer of red tape to an already well bound up company.</P>
    <P>The major disadvantage of the tendering system is that it is long drawn out and cumbersome.  Also, you see at the end of every tender notice in the newspapers that the company usually reserve the right not to sell to the highest bidder and so on.  You also have people coming back to the public representative and asking about the people who got these parcels of land and wondering whom they knew and whether they could have known somebody we did not know so the famous Irish word &ldquo;pull&rdquo; seems to come into it again and again.  I am quite confident that this is not the case in any public body but I would be happier to see anything whether big or small being sold by public auction where everybody knows what everybody else is doing. Even if it was found more expensive to sell these small tracts of land by public auction I would rather it be done that way because it is a more upright, straightforward and open manner of doing things.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="94" /> Section 7 of the Bill increases the penalty for trespassing on a railway to a fine not exceeding £300 and/or three months imprisonment.  The maximum fine at present is £2.  The provisions of the new section 11 would apply basically to this section because up to now the Garda had no power whatsoever to do anything with people found wandering on railway lines. Under the new section 11, they will now have the power to arrest without warrant. This will help the situation.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that children are allowed by their parents to use railway lines as playgrounds.  From time to time we hear of the tragic consequences of this.  I know that these children are warned, probably on a daily basis, of the dangers of wandering on these lines but unfortunately in many cases it seems to be of no avail.  Obviously we cannot find a perfect system to fence off these lines fully.  While these railway lines exist we will have a certain degree of trespass on them.  However, it is proper that action is being taken to ensure that trespassing will be at a minimum.</P>
    <P>In general the people we are speaking about as trespassers on railway lines are from the younger generation but I am sure the fines are directed at adults who, for one reason or another, were trespassing on the railway lines.  Something which is lacking at present is a publicity campaign on the danger of trespassing on railway lines.  Down through the years there was not much publicity in any of the newspapers, on television or radio about the dangers of trespassing on the lands owned by the Department of Defence or any place where firing lines existed.  We have had one or two major tragedies.  We see, perhaps not on a weekly basis, but certainly on a monthly basis on television and radio, advertisements placed by the Department of Defence warning people to stay off these Army lands.  It would be helpful if the Department of Tourism and Transport would consider advertising on all sections of the media the danger of trespassing on railway lines.  Somebody might take note and it might help to save somebody's life. It would not be too expensive and, in the <Col N="95" /> long run, it should be beneficial in some way.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is designed to increase the penalty for the avoidance of payment of fares.  I welcome that section as I am sure everybody else does because it is disappointing to see a certain percentage of people continually trying to avoid payment on both bus and train.  One does not have to travel too often to note somebody trying to avoid paying for the service. There are times when people who travel on trains or buses genuinely find it difficult to pay the fare.  Many of the people to whom I am referring could well afford to pay.  It is no harm that this new provision is introduced.  It was quite ridiculous that the old fine, which was far less than even the cheapest train fare, was an incentive to break the law.  I am not sure what powers the Garda have in their dealings with such people.</P>
    <P>I saw two young fellows being pulled by the ears out of a certain railway station one day by a garda.  He had one in each hand.  They were screaming and roaring and I do not think they will try the same trick again.  They refused to give their names to the CIE official on the train who found they were travelling free of charge throughout the State.  Whether CIE were trying to give them a sharp shock, or whether it was the done thing to call in the gardaí in cases where people refused to give their names, I am not sure, perhaps the Minister would clarify that.</P>
    <P>I have little more to contribute to this Bill.  One could speak for ever on the transport question in general.  In fairness, the Bill is not designed to allow us to present a thesis on public transport.  I support the overall thrust of the Bill. There are a few points that I will raise on Committee Stage.  In general I welcome the Bill and I add my support to the Minister's comments that it should be accepted by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>CIE as the main internal transport system touches the lives of many people in this country.  As a company they are particularly relevant to <Col N="96" /> Members of the Oireachtas because they are subsidised to the tune of over £100 million per year.  The company have made some progress and I think that should be acknowledged, but they have a long way to go.  For many decades in the past, stretching way back into the last century, railways formed the basis of the transport system.  Today, however, CIE have only a very small proportion of the total market for both passenger and freight services.  Cars and other forms of private transportation have put railways, in particular, in a very difficult financial position.</P>
      <P>Turning briefly to the financial position of CIE, the Bill makes it possible for new financial arrangements to be put in place where CIE can, from this forward, plan their finances.  They will be expected to repay the borrowings from their own resources.  There is good and bad in the financial results for 1986.  The railways continue to be huge loss makers.  A figure of over £93 million was lost in 1986 as pointed out in the Minister's opening remarks.  It has to be said, however, that there is an important social dimension to the railway activities and therefore there are, of course, parts of the railway system that are uneconomic and have to be so. Nonetheless, it is more essential than ever for the railway end to redouble their efforts to increase traffic and try to meet the target that has been set for them of reducing their loss by 20 per cent over the next five years.  On the plus side the railways, in 1986, showed an increase in business of 8 per cent and that is to be welcomed.  Furthermore, anybody who travels on railways can only welcome and be heartened by the refurbishment and replacement of carriages.  A general upgrading is taking place which is important to domestic traffic and, of course, to tourism in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bus Átha Cliath have been set the financial target of halving their 1984 deficit.  Passenger journeys increased by 2 per cent in 1986.  I wonder what the trend is in 1987?  I notice from the current discussion that there has been a fall off in passengers and that has been a source of worry and a further pressure for the <Col N="97" /> rationalisation that is now proposed by the management in the Dublin bus service.</P>
    <P>In the context of industrial relations I will return to the Dublin city services. The aim is to make Bus Éireann, or the provincial bus services, profitable.  Again they show an increase in that category of 3.8 per cent in 1986 and that too is to be welcomed even though it underlines the need for a greater growth there too. Overall the financial position of the company is that it is still very serious but there are some promising signs that we can be heartened about.  I note that there is a continuing arrangement for the Minister for Finance to guarantee the borrowings of CIE.  I have been a member of successive Joint Committees on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies where the recurring issue has been the question of State guarantees for borrowings.  The fact is that CIE are not alone in having a State guarantee; there are hundreds of millions of pounds of borrowing in the commercial State-sponsored body sector that are guaranteed by the State.</P>
    <P>From the lending institution viewpoint the State guarantee is regarded as first class security.  I wonder whether lending institutions lend on the basis of the guarantee without applying the same rigorous evaluation that would apply to a loan proposal from a private sector company. Where possible the State should disengage from guarantees and let loan applications from the commercial semi-State bodies stand on their own merits. Short of that I urge that if a State guarantee is sought by a bank, the reasons for the guarantee requirement should be submitted to the relevant Department for their consideration.  If the Department feel that a guarantee should be given, it should be for a specific period, renewable if necessary.</P>
    <P>Following the Minister's invitation to raise specific questions in the case of CIE I would welcome hearing what monitoring arrangements are made by the Department in relation to State guarantees. Are the reasons for the continued need for borrowing, and indeed the items <Col N="98" /> that require the borrowing, actually spelled out from the Department and approved at that level?  Furthermore, I am personally keen that time limits should be set on guarantees before their renewal.  Again I wonder in the case of CIE whether there is any such arrangement along these lines.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn to the strike record of CIE.  The Minister quite rightly refers to the strikes in the Dublin city services and while only one section of the company is involved it gives CIE as a whole a bad name.  Having said that, the inescapable reality is that CIE have in fact, the worst strike record of all the commercial semi-State bodies.  In my own department in UCD we have a major research project on strikes and I must say with regret that CIE come out top of the league for the commercial semi-state bodies.  I would qualify it however, underlining what the Minister has said, by saying that the rail service and the provincial bus services are relatively strike free.  The problem is really focused on the Dublin city services.  Again, as the Minister has said, these bus strikes mean financial loss for the company, which is obviously important in the times in which we live, especially now.  The whole of CIE then tend to be tarred with the same brush which is rather unfair to the railway side of the business and the provincial bus services.</P>
    <P>We live in difficult times.  The need for value for money was never more urgent. The need for cost-effectiveness and efficiency are of paramount importance. It is a fact that in many companies operating in this country there is considerable change in industrial relations policy and practice reflecting the pressures of the time.  The recession, of course, has brought about a greater need for imaginative ways of holding onto business, and if at all possible increasing it.  The recession has also had a severe impact on trade union membership.  For example, in the years 1980 to 1985 there has been a 9 per cent drop in trade union membership in the country, with a total loss of 51,000 members in the Republic in that period.</P>
    <P>There is further pressure on the trade <Col N="99" /> unions now to search jointly with management for ways of preserving jobs and achieving progress.  It is in the interest of both sides to find the way forward to achieve the common objective of maintaining jobs and achieving prosperity. Furthermore, of course, there is a greater realism now in claims submitted by trade unions.  The link between the claims of trade unions and job security is now very clear compared to the growth days of the sixties and the seventies.  We are living in a new world in the late eighties.  The management for their part need to shake things up, too.  There is a need for them to be progressive and active in their policies rather than react to circumstances as they arise which characterised management practice for too long.</P>
    <P>The management must work hard at achieving employee commitment rather than relying on authoritarian ways of the past.  There is an ever-increasing need for more emphasis on customer service.  The Minister rightly gave credit to CIE for their marketing efforts and the attempts they are now making to give a better deal to the customer.  The response of management and trade unions that I referred to has gone quite some distance in the private sector, and indeed in certain cases in the public sector.  I am glad to be able to single out a commerical State, Aer Rianta, who are conspicious for the quality of their management style, for their genuine commitment to participate in structures and to give full consideration to customer service.  Being in the public sector is no handicap in achieving a better quality of management, and indeed a better quality of trade union leadership and behaviour.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the question of private sector involvement in CIE. My personal view on privatisation is that there is no room for ideological hang-ups of any sort in the difficult times of the eighties and it looks as if it will be tough enough in the years ahead.  That leads me, in turn, to perhaps partial privatisation of some of CIE's services.  The bus services and the freight services obviously spring to mind in that regard.  The <Col N="100" /> introduction of some competition would make for a healthy change and should lead to improved efficiency.  Private ownership of the services, or some of them, will have a favourable effect on two critical factors, namely, prices and service. There is clear evidence available that privately run freight and passenger services at present are able to offer lower prices than CIE.  We have an important precedent also in the transport field.</P>
    <P>The introduction of Ryanair to the aviation scene is a very important development. Aer Lingus, British Airways, Air France and so on, the major national carriers, had as their top criterion in the airline business service to the customer, not low cost.  The arrival of Ryanair on the scene here has made a dramatic impact with its low cost strategy.  It has shaken up the competition, it has brought down prices by the national carrier but, much more important, it has led to a bigger market providing a cheaper product. Knock Airport and its activities is a case in point, an untapped market which has now been made possible through a low cost strategy and good marketing.</P>
    <P>On the question of service, there are indications that job satisfaction and morale are lacking among CIE employees.  I suggest that some privatisation would provide a new deal for transport.  It would lead to a more efficient and cheaper service and, as in the case of the airlines, it would lead to a bigger market share that would follow upon a more efficient and cheaper service which should lead to the preservation of jobs, often a very big fear in the case of the introduction of competition.</P>
    <P>Given the background of a shortage of State funds, and the Minister has underlined that, several countries abroad are moving towards privatisation of public transport.  Germany and the Netherlands readily come to mind in this respect.  As I said already, competition would follow private ownership of some of the transport. This would mean that competitors would keep on their toes.  It would also mean that these competitors would have an intimate knowledge, of the markets which they serve and, more important, <Col N="101" /> it would mean that administrative costs would be saved because large bureaucracies would be reduced, if not avoided altogether.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn in the privatisation context to the question of school buses. At present a substantial number of school buses is in private hands.  CIE's school bus fleet is coping with a certain amount of competition.  I mentioned the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies of which I have been a member for some time.  An earlier committee in 1979 had the following to say on the issue of school transport:</P>
    <P>...it would be right for the unions concerned to accept the Labour Court recommendations on the use of school buses for other purposes so that private drivers can use them part time for private hire...</P>
    <P>The report of the joint committee goes on to state:</P>
    <P>unless this is done the Government should adopt a general policy of transferring school services to the private sector where there is an operator wishing to provide such a service and where established needs are not being met.</P>
    <P>I am aware there is a number of pilot schemes underway under the auspices of school management committees and I would be interested in any comment the Minister could make on that in the course of his reply.</P>
    <P>To conclude this very brief contribution, I think putting the customer first is a key criterion for the future of CIE.  Perhaps I could make another suggestion in that regard?  I wonder whether railway stations and bus stations are being fully utilised in this sense: thousands of people pass through bus and railway stations often with some time to spare; is there a case for the expansion of services within these properties?  From CIE's viewpoint they might either own them or lease them.  I am thinking in particular of gift shops, clothing shops and perhaps a variety of other activities that might be housed within CIE property where the waiting passengers could do <Col N="102" /> some shopping.  In other countries hospitals are providing such services now, not to mention railway stations to capture business that is passing through in the course of using the transport system.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would like to compliment CIE.  It is important that we should give credit where it is due.  I think the board, the management and the workforce are trying hard and there has been some progress to date.  It is imperative for the future that all &mdash; board, management and workers &mdash; continue to meet the huge challenges ahead on a joint basis.  Joint co-operation, with the dominant focus on customer needs, surely must be the way forward for CIE.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make a brief contribution. I welcome the Bill.  Senator Hillery made a magnificent contribution. He covered the various areas and the various aspects which I was more or less thinking about.  In relation to services at stations there is an enormous potential. Aer Rianta have proved it.  Many saw it in the newspapers today and the results in the Dáil yesterday.  There is enormous potential in most of those stations where hundreds and thousands of passengers are waiting.  Facilities are not being made available at those stations.  Valuable property and valuable centrepieces in most of our towns and cities could be put to better use.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Hillery on his magnificent contribution on this Bill.  We all know that the purpose of the Bill is to discharge the obligation of CIE to repay to the Exchequer capital advances in excess of £44.5 million and to enable the board to borrow up to £45 million on a long term basis to meet their obligations and carry out their duties.  It allows the board the option of selling by tender property linked to abandoned railway lines.  That is a very good idea.  While our colleague on the other side of the House did not agree with that, the tender aspect gives them an extra option and it should be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It also enables CIE to increase the level of penalties for various offences in relation to railways.  We all know that <Col N="103" /> legislation catches up with itself in time and that penalties have to be updated. This is a clause that must be welcomed and it will empower CIE to have greater control.  It is all about control and respect for property as well as for those who are using the services given by CIE.  Finally it provides for the arrest without warrant by the Garda in respect of certain offences.  Up to now, as we are all aware, the Garda had to be called on most occasions but now they can go in and pursue anyone who is abusing railway lines or anything in connection with the affairs or property of CIE.</P>
    <P>Every politician likes to look at Second Stage and see where he can make a short contribution on behalf of his local constituency or local county.  In the context of outlying provincial services, such as Mullingar or Athlone, we are conscious that the objectives of the train service are to bring business to the area by providing a commuter service to the busier eastern region and also so that people who choose to live in say, Westmeath, and commute to Dublin to work can do so.  In the last year or so we have experienced vast interest arising from the eastern plan in relation to the expected population increase in the Dublin and eastern region. In the context of such an uncontrollable expansion in population in this region, apparently at the expense of the rest of the country, it is important that the rest of the country at least should have an opportunity to link into this dynamism in the eastern region by having the very best commuter service.  We all know how successful the DART was in the city.  This is where we in Westmeath got the idea. As Mullingar is only 45 miles from Dublin, 20 miles of which are on the border of Dublin, there are hundreds of people commuting every day by motor car.  Hundreds more would live at home in Westmeath and use the train every morning and evening if it was available. In that context I ask the Minister to lend his weight to the project we are pursuing in Westmeath at present.</P>
    <P>In the context, let us say, of the Custom House Docks site, many people in <Col N="104" /> Westmeath would be interested in taking up employment there either on the construction, or on the permanent side when the project is up and going.  It is feasible to contemplate living in Mullingar and travelling to Dublin by commuter train. When the Minister sees the various facilities and the beautiful relaxed atmosphere and clean air in that part of the capital of the midlands, he will understand why I am appealing to him to give it the necessary consideration.</P>
    <P>In relation to the tourism aspect of the train, Dublin for long has been looking to Wicklow as a place to which people might take a trip.  With Dublin's expanding population and clogged roads Westmeath's beautiful lake area can and does increasingly provide people in Dublin with the opportunity for a day trip, not perhaps for the same reasons as one might go to Wicklow.  Nevertheless one can enjoy the fabulous water sports and angling facilities in the county, not to speak of the golfing facilities and the other various amenities of which long term membership would be impossible to obtain in the city.  We have all those facilities within an hour's drive, or perhaps less than an hour's drive, from the capital, depending on which side of the city you might be working or living in.</P>
    <P>I pay a great tribute to the local newspapers in the area which are using their space to advertise to the public that there is a possibility of ensuring a cheap and efficient transport system into and out of the area.  In relation to telecommunications in the eastern region, and right into a large area of Mullingar we have the facilities of radio phone contact right through the country.  I have taken the initiative to suggest to Irish Rail that we would welcome a commitment from them to investigate whether radio phone facilities, Eircall or Eirpage connection by phone could be installed in the trains. This would be a remarkable advantage for train travel and it would also give us a tremendous advantage over road travel.  The rail facilities at present are run on the basis of a costly social service. If we have more people using the trains we can be assured that the train service <Col N="105" /> will continue with all its attendant advantages and spin off facilities.</P>
    <P>I would like to finish by saying that, for the business community &mdash; and anyone who knows how long it takes to get to Dublin every day by, car &mdash; the phone service on a train would be a tremendous advantage.  I ask the Minister investigate it.  As I know we have many more speakers, I will conclude, by saying I welcome the Bill and hope it has a safe and fast passage through the House tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and take the opportunity very briefly to pass a few comments on it.  First, to take up a point made by Senator Hillery concerning strikes in CIE, I fully agree with and reiterate the sentiments expressed by him.  It is absolutely deplorable that one individual can hold the rest of the company to ransom.  It is something of which the unions within CIE should take very serious note.  Senator Bradford referred to prices and I agree with him on that point.  From my own experience of travelling from Nenagh to Dublin, a single journey costs £9; but if an individual wished to go down on a single journey from Dublin it would cost him £16.  There are many people who, for one reason or another, cannot make the return journey. They may be up on business for a couple of days, or something like that.  I know quite a number of people who would use the service if the price of a single fare was economical and within reason.  The alternative is to take one of the private buses referred to here earlier.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I could be parochial for a minute as this is an opportune time to be parochial.  I would like to mention one specific area about which I have already made representations and it is important to highlight the facility here.  Senator Hillery said the customer must have priority. The Minister mentioned responsibility for tourism.  I come from one of the most scenic areas in the country.  It stretches from Lorrha up to Killaloe; it is on the shores of Lough Derg and has fantastic potential as a tourist attraction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The train service between Limerick and Dublin is a complicated system.  The <Col N="106" /> station we used is Cloughjordan.  For some years there has been no ticket station at Cloughjordan and passengers get their tickets on the train.  That is not the problem.  This area was very well serviced at one time and used by quite a number of passengers.  In fact, it was a place of great sadness and of great joy with people emigrating and people returning.  There is a commuter train between Limerick and Ballybrophy.  People using the service between Limerick and Ballybrophy &mdash; that would include Birdhill, Nenagh, Cloughjordan, Roscrea and Ballybrophy &mdash; connect to a Cork train, an inter-city train.  That is fine in the morning because all the facilities are available on the train when you change at Ballybrophy. Anyone who wishes can have a meal or a drink at the bar.</P>
    <P>The difficulty is the return journey from Dublin.  It strikes me as most peculiar that on Platform 3 and Platform 4 there are two trains one leaving for Thurles which ultimately arrives into Limerick and the other one leaving for Limerick. Senator Cassidy mentioned the question of having telephones installed on a particular service.  The difficulty we have is that on the Ballybrophy service, where there is connection with the commuter train through to Limerick, there are absolutely no facilities available in the evening time.  This was not always the case.  Heretofore trains serving this area had all the facilities and amenities that were provided in other trains.</P>
    <P>Representations have been made to me on a number of occasions to see if something could be done about it because far more people would use the trains if proper amenities were available on the line.  I ask the Minister to take up that issue with CIE.  One train leaves at 5.40 and the other leaves at 5.45.  The only difference between the two is that the inter city train, which is the modern up to date train, does not stop at Ballybrophy. All we are asking is that the inter city train should stop at Ballybrophy.  I have used the train on a number of occasions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="107" /> The train that we use, once the passengers alight at Ballybrophy, is almost empty from there on.  It seems to me to be most peculiar to have two trains going within minutes of each other.  That is very false economy.  I cannot see why the inter city facility could not be made available to the people who travel through Cloughjordan, Nenagh, Roscrea and Birdhill.  There was a time, not that long ago, when we had a full service right through to Dublin.  Changes were made for a number of reasons.  There was a fall off in the number of passengers and that sort of thing.  Of late the number of people using the passenger service has increased by 8 per cent.  If proper facilities were made available the increase would be greater.</P>
    <P>To be parochial again, there is a pedestrian bridge in Ballybrophy which is from the iron age.  The steepness of that bridge is deplorable and old people or people who are infirm in any way just cannot use it.  It is impossible.  In the winter time particularly the iron steps are very slippery and hazardous.  I know of quite a number of people who now cross the track rather than use the pedestrian bridge.  That is a terrible situation.  It does nothing to encourage people to use the train service.  I would ask the Minister to take up that point.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the legislation proposes to increase the fines for all sorts of vandalism to trains.  I was using the train a couple of weeks ago when two of the windows on one carriage were shattered by stones.  It is dreadful.  I do not think any penalty is severe enough for people who would indulge in that type of vandalism. I welcome the Bill.  I give it my full support and I would hope that the Minister would take the few points I have made into consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to make what I hope will be a short contribution.  I have been very interested in listening to Senators Bradford, Hillery, Cassidy and McKenna.  There are a number of things that I would like to mention.  First of all, there is the social <Col N="108" /> obligation.  One of the dangers when you move from a public form of utility into privatisation, particularly where the morale is not high in the semi-State body or the public body, the best people will leave the State organised service to move into the private sector so that what may be a slightly rocky service becomes even worse.  The first thing we must be absolutely clear about is whether we want an efficient public service with State obligation to that service for certain essential aspects.  Some of these have been identified: schools, rural areas and hospitals. We have even heard the suggestion from Senator Hillery that perhaps schools are more appropriate for privatisation, whereas other Senators would have felt that in this area the State should have the prime responsibility.</P>
      <P>Before moving into the debate between privatisation and public ownership I would like to make one suggestion. There has been quite a lot of discussion here today about the need to bring management and workers together and indeed there has been considerable praise for those areas of CIE where this has been achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hillery extended this to bringing the board, the management and the workers into a joint co-operative enterprise. One very important element has been left out of this, that is, the consumer. I have recently been experimenting in the hospital field trying to bring hospital workers, the consumers who use the hospital and, for want of a better word, those who might be seen as the board, the State institutional aspect, together in tripartite co-operation.  If one focuses on board management and workers only centrally where the organisation of a giant corporation or a giant enterprise takes place, one misses the whole point of the involvement of these three dimensions.  What I suggest is that it is time throughout Ireland in the field of transport, as in so many fields, that we try, where possible, to bring together these three dimensions locally in order to take on board suggestions which could be made by the consumer and also to help those who are operating the service to <Col N="109" /> appreciate that they are giving a service which is valued if it is provided with goodwill and in a good spirit and efficiently and to allow them to point out to the consumer the difficulties which they face, be it in security, in relation to their future or insufficient job satisfaction.</P>
    <P>One has to try to think of novel ideas for bringing the consumer into the debate and also about how this could be effected locally as well as at national level.  Much has been made about the need to coordinate the transport service better.  I would agree with that.  In this day and age with all the potential of data processing and organising programmes and computers it should be possible, if one sees the central office of whatever transport system evolves as a co-ordinating centre rather than a controlling centre, to arrange for a much better dovetailing of all the services throughout the country be they on the waterways, airways, roadways or railways.</P>
    <P>In that context, when the new Belfast city hospital was built one of the novel arrangements which has been developed is the hospital railway station beside it. We are now trying to overcome a long standing problem in North Antrim in the triangle area of Portrush, Portstewart and Coleraine where there was very destructive competition between two hospitals. We are trying to interest the powers that be in building a new hospital to replace the two old ones and we have been thinking that the best site for it would be near the railway line.  That has potential in relation to the revenue that would accrue to the railway service.</P>
    <P>There is a great need to look at co-ordination and to involve the people who use the service and to involve people at local level.  There may be some scope for reintroducing what was once very important, pride in the local station.  A national competition might be held in relation to population drainage for the station &mdash; obviously the population drainage in a small rural area would be very small and nearer to the cities it would be larger &mdash; as to how many people can be brought back to use the rail service and the bus service.  When we are talking <Col N="110" /> about the use of these services one wants to try to target special types of passenger.</P>
    <P>I speak with some feeling, as Senator McKenna did.  When I set out by train from Ballymoney, I set out at 6 a.m. to go to Belfast by a rather circuitous route. I arrived just in time to catch the Enterprise and I reach Dublin and I get a taxi, If I want to go on to Cork it is another day's journey.  What I am suggesting is, if we are talking about co-ordination, is it not time that we were able to get on the train in Derry in this island and reach Cork without necessarily getting off the train at all, but if we have to get off the train that some special facility should be arranged to move us between the two stations in Dublin and there should be much better dovetailing.</P>
    <P>The train has a lot of attractions for people who are going to spend more than an hour travelling.  It is much less stressful, it is much less tiring but as yet there are not the facilities about which Senator Cassidy talked to enable passengers to use the train for the preparation of a speech in Seanad Éireann or for the consideration of business.  There is neither the quiet, the comfort nor the facilities. These are areas for special targeting but I do not think you will ever get those right until you engage the consumer and go out of your way to engage the consumer. We are not here to talk about community politics but I only raise that kite aloft for the Minister to consider.</P>
    <P>In the Bill there is considerable attention being paid to what is to happen to disused railway lines.  I would beg the Department before they dispose of those railway lines, to have some serious discussion with the tourist board because there is an enormous fascination in disused railway lines.  To many people Ireland is the main road and very often the main road between Belfast and Dublin.  It is only when you get into the side roads, into the trains, into the old disused track lines and down the canals that you begin to see the country.  I beg the Minister to have discussion with the tourist board before he disposes of what he has and see if some imaginative planning could be done to make use of what <Col N="111" /> could be a potential tourist amenity even if it was only for bicycle tracks.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I take up the point which Senator Bradford made in relation to tendering and auction.  It must be, in the more open society which most people here would like to see evolving, open and when we are tendering we want to know that it is fair, we want to know that all those who have applied are getting fair consideration and that there are not special arrangements made to meet special people's needs unless a very good case can be made to substantiate them.</P>
    <P>With regard to the problem of strikes, Senator Hillery made a distinction between the problems of Dublin Bus, the rail service and the provincial bus service. Strikes are a terrible source of irritation particularly to those who are immediately affected by them.  We have to stop and ask what is the job satisfaction, what degree of communication is there, what invitation is there in a rather large corporation style of operation such as CIE for participation so that members of the workforce feel they have a right to say and that when they have a say they feel that what they say is being listened to and that there is a possibility of action and that their opinion will be given due consideration in this teamwork which has been identified between the management, the work-force and the consumer.</P>
    <P>Morale cannot be high if you feel you are being controlled in some remote bureaucratic manner.  It is time we got trust into our organisations.  I do not see how we can get trust unless we revert to smaller units and unless we give those smaller units more opportunity to be flexible and more incentive through the sort of competition which I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>Flexibility has been highlighted and I would agree entirely that in a transport system above all else we must be flexible in relation to times, penetration and meeting consumer needs and marketing for that need in such a way that it will attract the consumer back into the service which he knows in his heart he would <Col N="112" /> prefer if it was provided for him.  No one can tell me that there is any pleasure in belting down the road for three hours from Ballymoney to turn around in Dublin and belt back up again in the morning because there is not a satisfactory service.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting then, in relation to the public service, that there should be increased local autonomy to help bring about flexibility.  Certainly privatisation does provide stimulus and privatisation will inevitably meet needs which cannot be met by an over-centrally controlled State service.  There again I would ask that those who are ideologically pushing towards more and more privatisation might stop and ask has there been enough thought given to the public enterprise working much more effectively and efficiently through devolving more and more autonomy to the local unit of management or have we become so bureaucratically-minded that it is impossible to run a centrally organised State service without so much bureaucracy that people feel strangled at local level and morale at the bus station level and railway station level is dropping as a result?</P>
    <P>When we talk about the failure of the State service or failures of the State service we need to ask if the people working in it have had the structures or the understanding to enable that service to work as effectively as I believe it could.</P>
    <P>Finally, may I say that as I have just read an article which appeared in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Wednesday, 6 December, I would hasten to reassure Senators, and, in particular Mr. Seán Whelan, that I am not a Unionist Senator.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivianOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Minister for his fortitude, fore-bearance and patience at this late stage of the evening.  I certainly do not intend to keep him too long and I will endeavour in the main to address myself to the tourism dimension of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to a few other facets of the Bill.  I appreciate the obvious efforts being made now in the area of the improvement of the rolling <Col N="113" /> stock of both the bus and rail services.  In the knowledge that this improvement has taken place there is a very positive onus on the public to reciprocate so that this stock will stay in good condition.  One only has to travel on the DART coaches &mdash; as I had occasion to do for the first time recently &mdash; to be quite astounded by the condition of some of them already. The public of that area of the city &mdash; I am not suggesting it is widespread but it is happening &mdash; exhorted public representatives and ultimately convinced CIE that this service should be provided. It is amazing to see that the stock is deteriorating already by virtue of the level of vandalism that is taking place.</P>
    <P>The same applies to many other aspects of CIE's rolling stock.  One despairs, if one has occasion to go on a school bus, for example, of any hope of salvation for this country when one sees the condition of even relatively new school buses that have been vandalised by children.  If there is any suggestion, as any representative here who represents a rural constituency particularly will know, that even one scintilla of a mile is to be cut off any route there is uproar among parents.  Yet we can see no effort being made to ensure that this rolling stock is preserved in the condition that it should be in if it is to reflect in any way any hope for the future of the children in our schools.  It certainly must reflect badly on our schoolchildren and indeed on our educational institutions that such is the case.</P>
    <P>Two years ago I was invited on board a spanking new school bus by a driver. This was adjacent to my own home.  He had taken possession of the bus that very day.  I would say without any exaggeration that there was at least £500 worth of damage done to the bus that day alone.  The seats were ripped with penknives and so on.  It was absolutely horrific.  There is an onus on the public now in view of the significant State investment in recent times in CIE to upgrade rolling stock to respond.  When I travel from here to Cork on the train I see the general indifference of the public with their feet up on seats and drinks being <Col N="114" /> spilled on carpets and so on.  I must say it makes me despair.  There is an onus on the public to respond in this area.  We should exhort the public initially and ultimately force them to co-operate in this area.</P>
    <P>Fining the passenger public must also be considered.  I am aware the Minister is addressing himself primarily today to vandalism from the outside, as it were, where stones are thrown on to tracks.  As Senator McKenna mentioned a moment ago, this is a regular occurrence on trains travelling in and out of this city.  Windows are broken regularly.  There is an onus on the public to respond in this area and that cannot be highlighted enough.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to fare disparities. I would also like to touch on that.  There are winds of improvement blowing through CIE.  The dismembering of the old company as we know it was a very welcome development and I think that if there is hope of salvation for CIE it is in this area.  They must operate effectively on a stand-alone basis.  I would associate myself with Senator Robb's anxiety that the organisation should be further decentralised on a regional or county basis so that there would be some degree of autonomy down the country, as it were, and we would not find workers being constrained by the type of stranglehold the trade union members of CIE find themselves in in this city from time to time.  Of course it ultimately permeates the country and it becomes a nationwide strike.  Quite often the rural numbers are totally divorced from the dispute.  There are winds of change blowing in the company and I think that we, the members of the public, must associate ourselves with that and support it.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day, debate on this Bill is useless if the public do not support the services.  There is a definite desire now among members of the public to travel mainline rail as far as possible. Senator Cassidy gave us an interesting dissertation on the attractions of Mullingar. I always thought that the only attraction in Mullingar was the heifer but there are obviously many others.  Unfortunately the Senator is gone now so we <Col N="115" /> cannot praise the kind of rolling stock they have in Mullingar.  It is becoming attractive for people to travel mainline now but the disparity in the fares bears a lot of questioning.  I had occasion to drive to Dublin last week and to travel back by rail.  It is £28 return and £20 one way to Cork.  Cork people tend when they come to Dublin not to go back.  So, I presume it is designed to encourage them to go home.  By charging £28 return they are making it attractive to go back whereas it is £20 to come one way.  These disparities should be eliminated.  Early last year there was a very interesting experiment by CIE where the fares were slashed very considerably.  I think it was only £10 return for about one month last year and trains were packed to capacity every day. That must beg the question that, if sufficiently attractive fares are introduced, they will get the desired results and the public will respond.</P>
    <P>In relation to my particular area of interest, if there is any section of CIE's activities where work practice difficulties prevailed it must be in their market share in the tourism industry where the loss is reflected.  It is not 1,000 years ago since CIE had a virtual monopoly of tourism traffic, of rail and of road traffic, indeed, and yet there has been a considerable slide in this area in recent years.  To cite an example, recently the Park Hotel in Kenmare was stated to be the finest hotel in these islands and they are to be congratulated on that.  This must beg the question that recently that hotel was CIE-owned and could not be run successfully. That was only about eight or nine years ago; in fact, in the heady tourism days in the seventies when we had none of the difficulties we have now.  CIE did not then appear to be capable of running that company on a profit-making basis, primarily as a result of difficulties with staff and so on.</P>
    <P>This proves the point, if it needs to be proved, that some form of privatisation will work in many of these areas.  Privatisation may not be necessary if work practices can be improved.  I am not in any way apportioning the blame for this <Col N="116" /> to any one sector of CIE because, as was seen on television recently, the agreement that was entered into recently by management on behalf of the company would make one despair.</P>
    <P>In relation to the whole area of tourism, CIE still have a sizeable share of the touring coach traffic and I will be asking the Minister to examine seriously some problems that have been cited by people in the hotel and tourism industry, generally in relation to this business because the problem of &ldquo;payola&rdquo; is still very much alive and kicking in this industry.  It is disconcerting for people in the hotel business, the souvenir business, shops or any business related to tourism to find that certain companies and certain hotels are patronised because &ldquo;payola&rdquo; is still in evidence.  This will have to be examined seriously in relation to the activities of the company which we are discussing here today.</P>

      <P>I am about to conclude because I appreciate the Minister's tight schedule on this matter.  The tourism dimension of this company needs to be examined in greater detail than it has been, particularly the aspect touched on by Senator Robb, which I had included in my notes also, in relation to the disposal of railway lines.  They should be retained in public ownership where possible. The value of this was proved in Kerry this year with the opening of a sizeable stretch of railway track between Tralee and Dingle, called &ldquo;The Kerryway&rdquo;, which was extremely successful.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I thank the Minister for the introduction of this Bill.  It is timely and I would like to subscribe to the sentiments expressed on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated earlier I will endeavour to reply to the various points raised by Members.  Senator Bradford raised the question of the private bus services.  The Road Transport Act, 1932, which is now over 50 years old, is the Act under which they operate.  An in-depth review is now almost complete.  It covers the liberalisation of bus licensing.  The Minister expects to come to a conclusion very shortly on this matter.  That conclusion could lead to amending legislation and if that is required I have no doubt that it will be brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Senator Bradford also spoke about promotional fares.  This is really the responsibility of the companies which are now separate elements within CIE.  They use them as a marketing weapon.  They require to do that &mdash; they should do it anyway &mdash; to maximise passenger carrying. This is part of their effort to make better use of their resources.  These are the areas that we have been encouraging them to develop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Bradford also referred to section 5, concerning keeping costs of selling to a minimum.  This was mentioned by other Senators also.  CIE are really asking for an additional option.  As I outlined in my Second Stage speech at times the amount and location of property for sale would not justify the expense involved in putting it into the hands of auctioneers and all the costs entailed.  I would like to assure Members in so far as I can that in asking for this extra option I feel every aspect of the matter was taken into consideration and in my view this section is justifiable.  I suggest in regard <Col N="118" /> to doubts expressed about tendering and auctioneering as mentioned by Senator Bradford, that management in CIE could be trusted in their judgment of which means they select for the disposal of properties, whether it be by auction or by tender.</P>
    <P>Senator Bradford asked about the power of arrest.  The provision in the Bill, section 2, is there in the interests of having legal certainty and to remove any doubt that may have existed on that score.  Senator Hillery spoke about State guarantees on the basis of monitoring needs and asked if they are automatically renewable.  Now, the actual borrowing is subject to the approval of the Minister and the Minister for Finance must give his proposal to such borrowing.  The legislation before us now does not automatically give CIE power to go off and borrow.  Any such borrowing must have the approval of the Minister for Finance. The question of giving guarantees is under continuous monitoring.  These are given only where they are absolutely necessary and the Minister for Finance under section 4 (4) is required to give an annual report to the Oireachtas on any such guarantees.  In a sense that requirement is guarantee enough.  Guarantees related to individual loans are treated on an individual basis.</P>
    <P>Senator Hillery also mentioned the fall in the Dublin bus traffic.  I explained in my Second Stage speech that there has been a downward trend in the operating results here in Dublin and it is regrettable. There are many factors contributing to that downward trend some of which were enumerated by Senators. I have some certainty, as to recent days in particular, that the board are striving to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>The matter of school buses is entirely one for the Department of Education. CIE in this instance merely act as agents for the Department with regard to school transport.  Any proposals or suggestions would have to be directed to the Department of Education on that score.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators mentioned the provision of facilities, shops and services at stations.  Again, as I said earlier, the <Col N="119" /> CIE mandate is to maximise the value of their resources, and that includes all their resources, not just the staff, as some people might think.  It is evident that CIE are very active in this area and as far as possible they use their property for transport purposes in the first instance but also for these other services where they are viable.  We are aware of many places where they contract them.  The point being made by Senators is that they should extend into that area.  That is part of the maximising of the resources they should develop.  Other Members mentioned that aspect also.</P>
    <P>Senator Robb spoke of efficient service within State obligations &mdash; State <i>versus</i> private &mdash; and the need to focus on customers as well as boards and staffs, the dovetailing of all services.  He also mentioned disused railway lines in the context of their disposal by auction or by tender. I have mentioned that already.  The emphasis is on service and on the need to be customer-orientated.  I accept that. In the earlier part of our discussions we omitted that very important point though I have a note made here before it was raised.  But it is well that the matter was raised.  Orientating the service towards the needs of the traveller is the important thing.  CIE strive to integrate their services in so far as possible.  Many of the points made by Senator Robb would be concerned with the integration of the various lines and services.  Perhaps more can be done and I hope it will be done.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the discontinuance of services.  In any area where services were discontinued this always arose from lack of consumer and customer support.  The decisions for abandoning are statutory functions of the board and decisions are taken only after possible options have been examined.  I am quite satisfied, and I am sure Members are also, that CIE do not rush hastily into abandoning any service but give it every consideration.  We hope that will continue to be the case.</P>
    <P>Industrial relations were mentioned by a number of Members and I just note <Col N="120" /> that the 1986 Annual Report says a total of 2,222 meetings were held with trade unions and third parties with regard to labour relations matters in that preceding year.  That is an indication of the scale of activity on that front.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Callaghan was concerned about vandalism on trains and the fact that the increase in penalties for breach of the bye-laws covering this dealt only with on the railways, outside and breaking glass.  Section 6 deals more elaborately with the matter.  Vandalism, as I said, on Second Stage is committed on or in relation to the railway.  Of course, when we say the railway we think of the actual track, the sleepers, ballast and all that.  It is covered.  The sort of area that he dealt with, vandalism involving seating and tables on railway property is all covered.  It is regrettable that we have to come to the stage of litigation rather than education of people in their attitude towards damage to public property.  It is as much our own property as it is that of the company.  I really do not know where we have gone wrong.  Is it lack of civic spirit, or education, or guidance at home? I think we are all to blame.  There must be something wrong.</P>
    <P>The point made by Senator O'Callaghan is frightening if it involves the school children we had hoped were keeping us on the straight and narrow with regard to pollution, discarding of wrappings, and so forth.  I found them like that.  Now we find they are vandalising new buses.  That is frightening for the future.  We have to relate that to people concerned about how dangerous a course it is for them to be on.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank Members of the House for their contributions to this debate.  The Senators who spoke were Senators Bradford, Hillery, Cassidy, McKenna, Robb and O'Callaghan.  It reflects their interest in the important question of the country's needs and the way they are met.  I also acknowledge that time constraints would not allow many more Members to contribute.  I am sure that all Members of the Seanad are of the same view as those of the Members who spoke.  I welcome the support for the <Col N="121" /> Bill and the support expressed for the chairman of CIE, the board, the board of the subsidiary companies, the whole CIE organisation and the consumers. Some Members of the House recognise the progress made in CIE over the years. Others, myself included, have recognised a great need for improvement as well.</P>
    <P>As regards the criticisms of the industrial disputes in Bus Átha Cliath and some CIE services, as I said earlier, I cannot but agree that there is great scope for a very large improvement in these areas.  The CIE organisation are working on their problems and deserve every encouragement in expanding the use of the board's extensive resources.  There were points raised of detailed operation and of a local nature, like those raised by Senator McKenna and others.  It is not possible to deal with them in the course of my reply.  I have confined myself to responding to queries on the proposals before the House and CIE issues in general. I will bring the report of this debate to the notice of the chairman of CIE so that he can take account of the many points made on the detailed matters relevant to CIE.  That is the fairest way I can deal with that.  Tá mé buíoch de na Seanadóirí go léir.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to get clarification from the Minister on this section: Section 21 (7) of the Act of 1950 is hereby amended by the insertion after &ldquo;auction&rdquo; of &ldquo;or tender&rdquo;.  I would like to know why CIE want to dispose of their property by tender because in the early years all the property they disposed of was by auction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two points I wish to make with regard to the tender.  Senator Bradford mentioned already that the highest tender may not necessarily be accepted. That is OK if the board of CIE feel a tender is not high enough.  They can refuse to accept it but CIE or anybody else selling by auction have the same option because they can have a reserve on whatever they are selling.  If it does not reach the reserve they can withdraw it and, if necessary, have a further option of taking bids after the auction.  It causes disquiet when one sells by tender because <Col N="123" /> it is a lottery.  People do not know whether they are putting in too much or too little and then they are not satisfied if they find out that somebody else got the property for less than they bid.</P>
    <P>The second point is far more serious. CIE must have millions of pounds worth of property lying useless around the country. I do not know if they are paying rates on it but it is lying useless.  They could sell it and the money they would get for that property would save such a large amount that CIE would be in a better financial position.  In Killarney they have property which could be sold as prime sites for housing worth up to £½ million but they will not sell it.  They will never use it.  It is not attached to the railway station and they will never want it.</P>
    <P>In Castleisland a railway station is closed down that will never be opened up again.  They have let part of that property &mdash; the old goods store and the stationmaster's house, which was a valuable property but was let fall into decay.  It is bordering on criminal for a semi-State body responsible for the taxpayers' money to let that money lie there, not realising the assets and saving colossal interest which at the end of the day, the bottom line, the taxpayer picks up.  I would like to get clarification from the Minister on those two points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the points raised by Senator Daly.  First of all, I object to the fact that any railway line or the land it is on should be abandoned.  As a principle, no Minister responsible for transportation should allow railway lines to be abandoned any place.  If West Clare railway was still in operation, it would be worth a lot on money to CIE and to the taxpayer because it would be of tremendous advantage as a tourist attraction alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section is giving CIE power to dispose of land which becomes available by abandoning railway lines.  I have the same reservations that Senator Daly has about public tender.  It is an unsatisfactory process of disposing of public property.  Perhaps the Minister is worried <Col N="124" /> because this land is of importance to some landowners.  Sometimes, as a result of previous powers or wayleaves, it divides existing property belonging to one landowner. For that reason it would probably be inappropriate that somebody could possibly go into an auction and push up the price of a piece of land dividing two fields belonging to the same man.  If it was done for that purpose it could distort common justice.</P>
    <P>The responsibility of the board is to realise the best possible value for the taxpayer.  The points raised by Senator Daly are valid.  If they are dealing specifically with land and adjoining landowners, perhaps that is the reason.  I would be concerned about it because county councils, forestry people and others use this system and it is quite difficult to operate it in a fair manner. People are literally bidding in the dark, not knowing whether they are doing the right thing or the wrong thing, and the element of open competition is eliminated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 proposes that section 21 (7) of the Act of 1950 is hereby amended by the insertion after &ldquo;auction&rdquo; of &ldquo;or tender&rdquo;.  We are not changing.  We are giving an extra option to CIE.  Under the same section of the Transport Act, 1950, the board are empowered to sell land related to abandoned railway lines by public auction or by private treaty to the adjoining landowners.  That needs to be indicated for clarification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill would extend the option available to the board for disposing of such land by allowing also for the sale by tender following public advertisements. There are two options there already and we want to include the others.  CIE have explained that the public auction option is used in cases where the property in question is considered sufficiently valid to warrant the cost and expense of such a transaction. Experience over the years has shown that parts of abandoned railway property which are not of interest to the adjoining owners but which have direct access to the public road are often not sufficiently <Col N="125" /> valuable to third parties to justify the expense of holding an auction.</P>
    <P>It is limited.  The use of the other option of private treaty is already being limited in the way we have expressed it.  CIE wish to have the option to offer such property for sale by tender following public advertisement in cases where it would be to the board's advantage to try to dispose of the property in that way.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point made by Senator Daly about CIE owning property all over the country and not realising the full value of that property, I said in introducing Second Stage, and I said in conclusion, that with the pressure on CIE and their constituent bodies, to shape up by Government direction, they are working on their problems and deserve every encouragement in expanding the use of the board's extensive resources.  I emphasised that the resources of the board are not confined to the personnel, the employees and the rolling stock.  Half of their resources could by what Senator Daly mentioned.  CIE are being put under more pressure than they were ever before to get their financial affairs in order.  I am sure if they have some valuable property like that under-utilised or unused throughout the country, they will almost be compelled &mdash; if not we will advise them &mdash; to make the best use of all their resources.  That will include properties such as Senator Daly mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackDaly" hpid="Mr. J. Daly Mr. J. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the Minister's answer.  He said and it is in the Bill, by &ldquo;auction&rdquo; or by &ldquo;tender&rdquo;.  I cannot see why they want a tender.  They are saying they want a tender where the property is small, is not very valuable and it would be more expensive to sell it by auction.  There are big auctioneers, multinational ones, small ones, and auctioneers at crossroads.  You can go into the shop and buy a pig's head, or a bucket; you can insure your car; or he will auction your property.  It is the auctioneer's function to advertise at his cost so there is no cost to CIE should the auction be held and nothing happens. The only condition is that the auctioneer <Col N="126" /> has the right to have that on his books for 12 months.</P>
      <P>Senator Ferris referred to the rolling stock and spoke about the West Clare railway.  He was quite right.  It would be a great tourist attraction because of Percy French's famous &ldquo;Are you right there Michael, are you right?&rdquo;.  There was the Lord Tighe railway in Ballybunion. There were only two like it in the world. If that was retained it would have been a terrific advantage because that was a monorail.  The trouble was they always had to balance their load because it was a monorail.  When it was set up the first day between Listowel and Ballybunion somebody had to have a cow transported from Listowel to Ballybunion and the railway company had to get the loan of another cow to balance that.  Then when they went to Ballybunion they had to get the loan of another cow to bring it back. They were getting the loan of a cow from the day the railway opened until it closed.</P>

      <P>I can tell the Minister, without fear of contradiction, that in the town of Killarney for the last 50 years valuable property was never used.  That property is away from the station and is worth at least £500,000 for building sites in a town that is starved for building sites. CIE are starved for capital and the people are starved for houses.  Why cannot the two get together and save the taxpayer money?  I am not satisfied with the Minister's answer.</P>
      <P>Senator Ferris made a point about abandoning railway stations.  The EC brought in a regulation, no thanks to any Government, that a railway line cannot be taken up for ten years after it ceases to operate.  The railway station I am referring to has been closed for 20 years. The Minister would know a bit about that because his people come from near Castleisland.  I would like to get more clarification from the Minister about property that is not being disposed of properly.  I see no explanation for the auctioning of the property.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two elements in the Senator's contribution: first, the added option being sought and given in the Bill to the company and, secondly, the maximisation of the property that is lying dormant or idle throughout the country.  In this respect I will restate what I stated earlier.  Much of that activity is related to the day to day running of the board.  I can guarantee, as I have done already on other matters that have been raised about the ordinary day to day affairs, that the one raised by Senator Daly will have to be brought to the notice of the chairman.  I give the guarantee that I will do so personally.</P>
      <P>I know the station the Senator is talking about.  It is between two roads, the Killarney road and the Tralee road in a strategic location.  To think that it has been lying idle for 20 years without its value being maximised &mdash; we are not being parochial when we are talking about that one &mdash; is an indication of other property in similar circumstances there may be throughout the country.</P>
      <P>This matter will be raised by me in the strongest possible manner with the chairman of the board.  Let that be an indication that we want all the resources maximised for the benefit of the company.</P>
      <P>I am almost disappointed that the Senators, Deputies, councillors and auctioneers have doubts about section 5, where this Bill is giving a small option to CIE in addition to the power they have under the 1950 Act to sell by auction or by private treaty.  It is operational within their terms of reference but maybe they feel some way hogtied in dealing with the disposal of small properties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will have to pass on to CIE that Members have some reservation about this extra option.  In doing that we will be putting the board on notice that the Seanad has noticed this and they should take notice of it.  In that regard, I do not know when next we will have a Bill coming back in here, when we think that we are only amending the 1950 Act now. We could not give any guarantee of whatever in practice would require to be changed.  I certainly could not give any <Col N="128" /> indication.  The best way we could deal with it is to convey the reservations expressed by Members about this extra option and to ensure in so far as they can that any fears they may have will not be justified in the years to come by any actions that the board would take.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackDaly" hpid="Mr. J. Daly Mr. J. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The section states:</P>
      <P>Section 5 of the Regulations and Railways Act, 1889 is hereby amended by the substitution in subsection (1) of &ldquo;£300, or at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months, or to both the fine and the imprisonment for &ldquo;forty shillings&rdquo; and the substitution in subsection (3) &ldquo;to a fine not exceeding £300, or at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months, or to both the fine and the imprisonment&rdquo; for the words from &ldquo;to a fine not exceeding forty shillings&rdquo; to the end of the subsection.</P>
      <P>Senator Bradford referred tonight to gardaí removing two young fellows from a train who had not paid the fare.  The Railways Act, as I understand it, and this is also the case in England &mdash; it may have been changed &mdash; states that any person who boards a train without a ticket may travel to the end of that journey without the ticket.  When the ticket collector comes to him if, in exchange for the ticket, he gives his name and address the railway company will apply to him for the payment and if he does not pay the fare then, they can take the action to court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had experience of it in the UK and here.  It was a good few years ago, after the war.  I do not believe the Minister was referring to the Act of 1950 when he talked of the last time the position was altered.  I am sure it is not altered.  If it is <Col N="129" /> still in the Act it should be made quite clear that a person can board a train, can travel from say, Cork to Dublin, and if he does not have a ticket, he gives his name and address to the ticket collector at the end of the journey.  The point is that the passenger cannot be put off the train until he reaches his destination. Then the railway company have the option, as any business company would have, for any debt that is due to them to collect it through the legal process of the District Court or whatever court is involved.</P>
    <P>In extending that fine to £300 it would want to be made clear that such a person cannot be fined if he goes on the train without a ticket and if the Act I am talking about still exists and is willing to pay afterwards.  People have numerous reasons for not paying.  Sometimes they go on holiday and run out of money, sometimes they lose their money, sometimes their money is stolen and they have to get on the train to get home.  They are entitled to do that.  It is wrong to talk about inserting a fine of £300 for what was 40 shillings before this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision the Senator is talking about is still in the Bill.  The elements of it are in section 5 and it is based under the regulation of the 1889 Acts.  That is not being changed but we are increasing the fine of 40 shillings, which was there when that Act was introduced in 1889 and we are increasing the penalty for fare evasion by train passengers from a maximum of £2 to a fine not exceeding £400.  I indicated earlier that Members in the Dáil even put in stronger recommendations and that the Minister accepted those, providing for a higher amount and including a term of imprisonment.  To answer the Senator's question, the relevant points he raised about a passenger having failed to produce a ticket, are all there in section 5 and that is being retained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair and the House for allowing me to raise this very important matter on the Adjournment of Seanad Eireann.  I wish to indicate that other leaders of the groups in this House want to be associated with this Adjournment motion.  If it is agreed, and if time permits I propose that Senator Lanigan, Leader of the House who also happens to be the international chairperson of the Euro-Arab Parliamentary Dialogue Group which has done a lot of work in this area, Senator Manning, Leader of the Fine Gael group, Senator Brendan Ryan and Senator Eogan who has expressed an interest in this particular problem indicate their concern to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  In his reply I hope the Minister will reaffirm the concern of the Government in this area.</P>
      <P>It is sad there is a need to bring a motion on the Adjournment on this subject before the House of the Oireachtas. It arises out of the loss of lives of Palestinian civilians over the past week in Gaza and the West Bank in particular and indeed throughout the occupied territories in Palestine.  This follows outbreaks of civilian disturbances and responses to that civilian disturbance by the Israeli army in what has now become internationally accepted as a most brutal fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would have to visit the occupied territories and the refugee camps in the Middle East, particularly in Gaza and the West Bank, to appreciate and understand the wealth of feeling and frustration the <Col N="131" /> Palestinian people feel following the occupation of the territory by the Israelis and the iron fisted approval of the Israeli Government and their army in dealing with what would normally be considered acts of minimal violence.  As I have said, that violence follows on the frustration that I witnessed when I visited the West Bank and Gaza.  The Palestinians fail totally to understand how any civilised nation in the world could treat human beings in the manner in which they are at present being treated.</P>
    <P>I know UNRWA &mdash; the United Nations Relief and Work Agency which is subscribed to generously by the United Nations and by members of the United Nations including Ireland &mdash; do great work.  This Government and previous Governments have supported UNRWA in trying to ensure that refugees have some semblance of a life in what is a false division of their country.  Were it not for the United Nations agency who provide schooling, health and other social services for refugees a revolution would have happened many many years ago in Palestine because of the extraordinary circumstances in which people have to survive.  I saw school children who at most were guilty of stone-throwing because they feel only hatred for an army that treats them as if they were not human beings and I saw the army arresting all the children in a school because one or two unidentifiable children were purported to have thrown stones at passing army vehicles.  Those children were taken without the knowledge of their parents and often were never returned or if they were returned were mishandled and mistreated. The force acted with no regard for human behaviour; they might have been arresting somebody for a very serious crime.  I was amazed that any army in this day and age would do that to school children.</P>
    <P>A feeling of resentment has built up over the past 40, 20 and ten years.  Ordinary peaceful people who are engaging in breaches of the law so to speak are being dealt with as if they were terrorists. They are being subjected by the army to <Col N="132" /> the most atrocious killings and maiming. There have been stories and television coverage of children being strapped to the front of army vehicles and used as buffers in dealing with civilian riots.  The last time that anybody in Ireland saw that type of action was during the period of the Black and Tans.  It would be awful if this Government and this House of the Oireachtas were to stand idly by and allow a situation to develop in a part of the world which affects all of our lives.</P>
    <P>A peaceful settlement is required as a matter of urgency because there is not a military solution to that problem.  There has to be a political solution to it.  I hope this Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs &mdash; and I thank the Minister for personally attending this debate tonight &mdash; will show the political initiative they have been capable of in this particular area in the past.  It is a matter of urgency because over the past ten or 12 days up to 12 people have lost their lives and hundreds of people have been hospitalised. People who have been hospitalised have died from has been described as extraordinary wounds and beatings.  I am sorry that the matter needs to be raised in this House.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate as a nation that has suffered from occupation by other forces that we should express concern.  We should use every political effort at our disposal at the United Nations and at European Community level to further the process of an international peace conference towards which all of us have tried to work.  This has been dealt with today in <i>The Irish Times</i> in their editorial which states &ldquo;Gaza, a case for political action,&rdquo; and which outlines in detail what they feel is the proper process to overcome this difficulty.  This has been the subject of a speech recently by the Permanent Representative of Sweden at the United Nations who has stated categorically the feeling of all the Scandinavian countries who are outside of the European Community. I quote from a speech of Mr. Anders Ferm in which he states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Israel refuses to negotiate with representatives of the PLO.  If there is <Col N="133" /> a genuine will to achieve a peaceful solution to the conflict, parties to that conflict should not simply refuse to sit down and negotiate with one another. If it has been the policy of parties to conflicts to exclude their enemies from peace negotiations, no peace treaties would ever have been signed.</P>
    <P>That sums up the situation.  We realise the Minister for Foreign Affairs cannot achieve a political settlement tonight or that we cannot, acting alone, stimulate the great powers, the USSR, and the United States of America or indeed members of the Security Council to do it.</P>
    <P>We must add our voice to that of other small peace loving nations which have a certain credence in what we have been doing in the area of finding peaceful solutions. We have sent our Army into the occupied part of Lebanon as a peace keeping force.  From the reports of missionaries, and people who have worked in the refugee camps, we are quite conscious of the major problem that has to be addressed in this area.  By highlighting the extraordinary level of violence engaged in by the Israeli armed forces when dealing with civilians, and by giving the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Members an opportunity to express our views, our concern and our utter condemnation of this atrocity, we will heighten the awareness of other nations in Europe and at the United Nations that an international peace conference is now of cardinal importance and that we should all work together towards achieving such a conference.  If we can do that and if UNRWA are allowed to continue to carry out unobstructed their mission of mercy in the Middle East a political settlement could be furthered.  We would hope that that process would eliminate the necessity for the widespread and indiscriminate killing of innocent civilians. Most of those killed are really only children.  Such a process, too, would achieve a level of identification with the Palestinians and their cause and their legitimate representatives, the PLO, and show them that somebody is concerned <Col N="134" /> about them at a level outside the Middle East, and that might take demonstrators off the streets and might allow sufficient time to elapse in order to achieve some settlement.</P>
    <P>I want to allow other Members to express their concern about this.  I hope the Minister will be positive in his response on the Government's attitude to the present catastrophe.</P>

      <P>I join with Senator Ferris in thanking the Minister for Foreign Affairs for coming into the House and thereby allowing us have a discussion on this matter.</P>
      <P>The problems being confronted by the people on the West Bank and Gaza over the past fortnight or three weeks could have been foreseen if we go back into the history of the occupation of these areas. The sevens are the important landmark numbers in the history of that area: the Balfour declaration of 1917, the Partition Plan of 1947, the Occupation of the West Bank of 1967 and this year, 1987, it would appear as if at last the people on the West Bank and in Gaza are being motivated to fight back against the atrocities of the Israeli State.</P>
      <P>Abba Eban the Leader of the Labour Party in the Israeli Parliament said during the week that the only way in which the problem could be resolved was by disengaging the army.  He is right.  There is no question that Mr. Shamir was wrong when he said that the occupants of the West Bank and Gaza were mindless in their attitude, that they were committing atrocities against people in the area and that they had to be put down.  Young people in the area have got fed up of the lifestyle they have.  They live in a deprived area.  We hear a lot about the conditions of the black population in South Africa but people in the refugee camps in the West Bank and Gaza live in far worse conditions than those of the black population in South Africa.  There is no semblance of normal living in these over-crowded camps.  The accommodation is very bad.  Sewerage facilities, lighting and facilities generally in the camps are very inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="135" /> The incidents on the West Bank started when a young girl was shot by settlers who were in the area illegally.  Resolution 242 of 1967 stated that the Israelis should withdraw and, unfortunately, there was a mistake made in the drafting of that Resolution when it said &ldquo;from territories occupied&rdquo; and did not say &ldquo;the territories occupied.&rdquo;  This is one of the problems we have to admit to.  The people on the West Bank will not continue to allow themselves to be butchered nor are they prepared to live in the deprived conditions in which they have to live.  They live in conditions worse than those that we would provide for our animals.  Those people are at the end of their tether.</P>
    <P>The Israeli Prime Minister has tried to justify what the army are doing in breaking up what could be considered to be small riots.  The army are breaking them up not, in the traditional way &mdash; by the use of excessive force with water cannon and so forth &mdash; but by using live ammunition and they are killing people. The UNRWA officials at the Khan Yunis camp &mdash; they do not often openly criticise what happens &mdash; have said that another cause of the conflict in the area was the fact that the Israeli soldiers were seen urinating into the water supply at the Khan Yunis refugee camp.  The refugee camp water supply is inadequate and nobody in their right minds could justify the actions of the Israeli soldiers in that area.  There will have to be a political settlement to the problems the Palestinians have on the West Bank, Gaza, and in those areas throughout the world where they are dispersed.  There will have to be a United Nations sponsored conference on the problems of the Middle East and of the Palestinians in particular. There is no point in suggesting that the Palestinian Liberation Organisation who represent the vast majority of Palestinians will go away.</P>
    <P>The suggestion of an international conference on the question of Palestine has had reasonable acceptance throughout the world but, as Senator Ferris has said, Israel will not talk to the Palestinian Liberation Organisation.  If there is going to <Col N="136" /> be a resolution of this problem they will have to talk to them.</P>
    <P>The people of the West Bank and Gaza &mdash; hundreds of thousands are living in desperate conditions &mdash; are at the end of their tether.  They look to nations like Ireland which has a good record in that area for help and support to try to resolve the problems that they are confronted with daily.  It is very hard for people in Ireland or in Europe to understand the problems that are associated with living in refugee camps for the past 40 years now.  The refugee camps are there for a long number of years.  The UNRWA people &mdash; and I am delighted there are so many fine Irish people involved in their operation &mdash; do the best they can to keep some semblance of order, education, relief and welfare in these camps, but they can only do a little.  They cannot really help the people who live in these camps.  They can ward off day-to-day problems but they cannot help these people to live as they should be allowed to live.</P>
    <P>I join with Senator Ferris and other Senators who have accepted this motion, and appeal to the Minister for Foreign Affairs to use his considerable influence not alone to attempt to resolve the immediate problems that are confronting the people on the West Bank and Gaza but to attempt, with all his might, to get the international conference on the question of Palestine brought to the fore in the United Nations and at European Community level in the near future.</P>

      <P>There is a minute remaining.  Does Senator Eogan wish to speak?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeEogan" hpid="Professor Eogan Professor Eogan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Eogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief.  I want to say initially that this is an area I know reasonably well for close on 30 years, which is only about ten years after the foundation of the state of Israel.  I went out initially, and I have been out many times since, not in any way to study or get involved with political problems, whether they were Jewish or Arab, but to deal with matters which were long pre-both Jews and Arabs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="137" /> Nevertheless, it soon became apparent that all was not well.  Very soon I was introduced to my first example of man's inhumanity to man, these awful and horrible refugee camps where these displaced people &mdash; displaced from their homeland &mdash; were living in horrible conditions. Coming up to Christmas in the older days I remember it was the practice of the Israeli authorities to allow a limited number of Arabs to visit their relations on the West Bank.  I remember the terrible scenes of emotion at the Mandlebaum Gate.</P>
    <P>However, I do not want to go on dealing just with emotional matters.  I would like to refer to current events which I would not in any way attribute simply to the work of hooligans, young hotblooded Arabs getting out of control.  If this trouble has started &mdash; and it has started &mdash; in a very vigorous way it is simply due to the fact that we are dealing with a frustrated people, a people who have been deprived and seriously wronged, who have been treated as aliens in their native land.</P>
    <P>The Palestinians, those who are still in Palestine, are forced to live under military occupation which is of a ruthless nature and I have witnessed some of this. I have witnessed the wiping out of villages &mdash; I was not personally present when they were wiped out but one year there was an attractive Arab village and it was gone the next year, literally wiped off the face of the earth.  In addition, we have the use of very primitive acts such as flogging and, worse still, shooting.  As bad as these physical events are, there are the psychological events, the fact that these Palestinians are living very much as second-class or third-class citizens in their own land.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to say that there are the other offensive acts such as that reported in today's paper, for example, the Israeli Defence Minister moving into an apartment in Old Jerusalem.  What is making all of this much worse is the heavy-handed attitude of the Israelis. Their military campaigns may have a short term effect but they are not going to have a long term effect.  Like Senator <Col N="138" /> Ferris and Senator Lanigan I, too, appeal to the Minister for Foreign Affairs to use his enormous skill and initiative in trying to encourage the setting up of a peace conference because it is only then that the problem will be resolved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an area in which I took a particular interest during the previous period when I was Minister for Foreign Affairs and was very closely associated with the Venice Declaration which laid down the parameters of the Community recognition of the role of the PLO and, in conjunction with the recognition of the integrity of Israel and all other states in the area, the establishment of the Palestinian homeland.</P>
      <P>Very little progress has been made since then.  I feel that one of the factors on which we must rely now is the pressure of moral and democratic opinion throughout not alone the Community countries but the western world generally. That is why I thank Senator Ferris for his initiative in raising this matter and the other Senators for their contributions. Basically these tragic events &mdash; and I will not go into the detail of them because they are just inexcusable &mdash; which are a matter of wide international concern are a reflection of the whole attitude on the part of the Israeli state towards the occupied territories.  This aspect is being considered by the United Nations Security Council at present.</P>
      <P>As far as the European countries are concerned in the Community and the forum of European Political Co-operation, our attitude is quite clear.  As recently as 5 December at the Copenhagen Summit we issued a statement and I participated in the drafting of it which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Twelve confirm their desire for a negotiated solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict which would bring to the region a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in accordance with the principles set out in the Venice Declaration, and <Col N="139" /> reiterate their support for an International Peace Conference under the auspices of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>That is the only way forward because as long as the present situation of drift is allowed to continue, unfortunately there is a very grave danger of further events of this kind.  As long as there is no negotiated settlement, then the Israeli forces feel free to move into the West Bank where there are very serious refugee situations involved that create their own problems.  The imposition of harsh measures of crowd control, of a range of individual and collective punishments, such as administrative detentions, the forced closure of academic institutions including the University of Bethlehem &mdash; with which UCD has established strong links as part of a project funded jointly by Ireland and the European Community Commission &mdash; and the demolition of the homes of those suspected of being involved in militant activities, inevitably create their own escalatory problems which will lead to further violence.</P>
    <P>Ireland's underlying approach &mdash; and we have put this point of view in the United Nations and European Political Co-operation to this issue &mdash; is the inadmissability of the acquisition of territory by force.  This is what the Israeli state has done on the West Bank.  A military occupation is temporary.  It cannot give any permanent solution to the problem and it conveys no permanent rights whatever under the rules of international law. In effect, it amounts to a policy of annexation. For this reason we have consistently opposed the Israeli policy of imposing its structure of civil administration on the occupied territories and its continuing practice of opening new settlements in the territories.  Unfortunately, the tragic events of recent days will be an ongoing factor unless this aspect is resolved and unless there is an international peace settlement in the area.</P>
    <P>Apart from the violence caused, the rules of international law are being flouted by the State of Israel.  Their <Col N="140" /> persistent refusal to recognise and accept the obligations of the State, and the continuing catalogue of harsh security measures imposed on the civilian population, create the conditions for further tension, unrest and terrorism in these territories.  The potential danger of such a situation is clearly illustrated by the recent events that have prompted the Senators to raise this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
    <P>This climate of violence and anger is felt by the vast majority of Palestinians by reason of their deep-rooted sense of frustration caused by a total negation of their rights in this area and not just rights but the sense of total poverty and deprivation that exists in these occupied territories. We have always placed great importance on this aspect because as long as that is allowed to continue and fester there will be a recurrence of violence, tension and killing.  The whole matter is so terrible that the only way to resolve it is to bring all the parties concerned to the conference table by way of an international conference.</P>
    <P>We believe the fundamental rights and well-being of the Palestinian population can only be protected in the context of such a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement of the whole Arab-Israeli conflict. This view is shared by all our partners in the Twelve.  Indeed, the recent tragic events in Gaza and on the West Bank further emphasise the point of view that I have just mentioned.  There is no other way in which this matter can be tackled unless there is a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the region resulting from an agreed settlement which would be guaranteed fully, if necessary, by other powers.  That is the only basis on which we can proceed.</P>
    <P>It is not a basis that is in any way aimed at the Israeli state because the existence and security of that state must be guaranteed as well as the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and all that implies.  The PLO have a legitimate role in the negotiation and implementation of such a settlement.  The events of recent days have accentuated and emphasised <Col N="141" /> in a very telling way &mdash; even though in a very harsh way &mdash; that the cycle of violence and repression must stop and that we must have an international peace conference in the area.  It is in the interests of the major powers to have such a conference. Everything we can do, as a country and, more particularly within the sphere of the twelve member states of the Community and in the context of European Political Co-operation, will be done to achieve that.  I hope in the New Year in Bonn to meet King Hussein who is coming to a meeting of European Political Co-operation under the German Presidency in January with a view to seeking to establish practical ways and mechanisms of getting this process going, this process of talks and negotiations in which all parties would be involved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="142" /> We will seek to promote peace in the framework I have mentioned.  Unless that is done there will be more &mdash; I do not want to sound too bleak &mdash; and possibly worse incidents of this kind because they flow inevitably from the irrational and volatile situation that has been created on the West Bank.  The only way to achieve progress is by way of international agreement which will acknowledge the boundaries of existing states, including Israel and, at the same time, ensure that there is a homeland for the Palestinians and a process within which the PLO have their role to play.</P>
