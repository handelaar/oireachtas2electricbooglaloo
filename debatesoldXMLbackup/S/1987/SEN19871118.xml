      <P>I have notice from Senator Maurice Manning that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to compensate the former employees of Irish Shipping Limited in view of his promise made in that regard in June 1985.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Paschal Mooney of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to clarify the position in relation to the British Nationality Act, 1981, in view of the widespread concern expressed by Irish citizens resident in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Manning and Mooney as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Manning's motion and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m., or earlier if the business ordered is concluded. Senator Mooney may give notice for another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>Before I call on the Leader of the other side, I would like to put on record my sincere thanks to the Leas-Chathaoirleach, Senator Charlie McDonald and, indeed, to any temporary Chairpeople who may have done some of my hours while I was out of this House.  As regards the Leaders, I will have to come back to them.  I think it is lovely when you can tell a story against yourself and I find no trouble in doing so. Somebody said to me the other afternoon after I came of hospital that they did not think I needed support for my neck.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I talk on the Order of Business may I also join with the Leader of the House in welcoming you back?  Even though you had a most competent and charming substitute, the place was not the same without you.  We are all very glad to see you back.  I do not think we are taking your collar as any indication that the full rigour and vigour of your Chairing will not apply as heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree to the Order of Business.  I am somewhat curious as to the way in which Item No. 11 will be taken and at what stage today.  Perhaps the Leader of the House could illuminate that aspect for us.  On the Order of Business also &mdash; I beg your indulgence for a moment on this and when you hear me out you will probably think it is appropriate &mdash; I hesitate very much to discuss the internal affairs of RTE or their scheduling, but a <Col N="1567" /> change is taking place and is about to take place which I think has important implications.  That is the attempt to move the programme &ldquo;Mo Cheol Thú&rdquo; on to VHF, Radio 3.  I do not want to comment on internal programming, but this programme is one of the jewels in the crown of RTE.</P>
    <P>The point I am raising is that it is received by a great number of Irish people in Britain.  I have had considerable representations from Irish people in Britain who greatly value this programme and who will not be able to receive it on the VHF transmission.  The view I am expressing that this programme should be left where it is is a view which, I think, will find agreement in all parts of the House.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Independent Senators, I would like to welcome you back and to wish you a very speedy recovery.  While you were away we missed your style and panache even though you were very ably represented and your job was very ably carried out by the Leas-Chathaoirleach.  We certainly have been wondering whether or not we should take advantage of the fact that you may be slightly indisposed at the moment, or whether we should actually be very careful with you here.  The general view is, indeed, that you will be well able to continue and well able to control us despite our best efforts on this side of the House.  We welcome you back and look forward to discussions, arguments with you and working with you for the next period of time.  We hope that is the end of your illness.</P>
      <P>I would also like to welcome the fact that the Leader of the House is ordering Item No. 11 on the Order Paper.  Thank you very much.</P>

      <P>I have no problem with the Order of Business.  I want to join with our colleagues in welcoming you back to <Col N="1568" /> the House after your short term away.  I do not suppose you will need to continue to wear your collar for too long.  I said on the day of your appointment that you did not need any insulation for your neck. You are tough and while the collar is temporary I hope it will be removed quickly.  I welcome you back.  You were deputised for in your absence, but I do not think you were replaced.</P>

As someone who is in regular contact with the Irish in Britain, I would also like to concur with Senator Manning's remarks about the radio programme. I know how important this programme and others on RTE are to them.</P>
      <P>I would also like to convey to the Leader of the House &mdash; I know I speak for the overwhelming majority of the people in this country &mdash; the marvellous feeling of elation we felt last week when Ireland qualified for the European finals in Germany.  A little blight was cast over it because of Liam Brady.  Perhaps the Minister might convey to the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I promise to be less obstreperous.  Could I just add my words to the comments made by everybody in welcoming you back?  It is good to see you again.  You look in fine fettle to me.  I also support my colleague, Senator Manning, in his comments on &ldquo;Mo Cheol Thú&rdquo; in relation to the obvious <Col N="1569" /> benefit and enjoyment this programme gives to Irish people in Britain.  It is part of all our Sundays.  That gentle, almost soporific voice early on Sunday morning means a great deal to all of us.  For that reason I would hate to think&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to echo the great pleasure we all have in seeing you reinstated in your properly appointed sphere and to say how very glad we are that you are looking so well.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business, Senator O'Toole and myself are very pleased that it has been decided to allow the introduction of Item No. 11 on the Order Paper &mdash;&ldquo;Bill entitled an Act to amend the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1986&rdquo;.  As a result of this, it will be our intention to withdraw Item No. 42:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann in the exercise of the powers conferred on it by Section 13 of the undermentioned Act declares that the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987 shall not come into operation on the 1st day of December, 1987.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole and myself feel that, in the circumstances, although the Bill that it is our intention to introduce will not meet all our reservations about this, it is important that we all act in a most mature, balanced and statesmanlike way and that we do nothing to interfere with the smooth movement of Government and the attempt to conduct a proper foreign policy, despite the fact that we still have some reservations.</P>

I understand some weeks ago he gave an indication of an approximate date.  I would like an indication of this, because I wish to take further briefings.  Senator Lanigan will note, I am sure, being the observant person he is, that Item No. 45 has been amended in the light of recent developments in Soviet policy.  I would like to have some indication of when it is coming.</P>

That will be considered by the Government.  I presume that if legislation is necessary it will be implemented.  Senator Norris and Senator O'Toole are using their limited time in the Seanad to their best advantage.

As far as &ldquo;Mo Cheol Thú&rdquo; is concerned, I am sure we all would consider that any withdrawal by RTE of anything produced by that excellent broadcaster &mdash; Ciarán Mac Mathúna &mdash; should be deplored.  We will express to RTE the views of the House on this matter.  I do not know if there was any other question.  Somebody attracted my attention when Senator Ferris was speaking, but I do not think Senator Ferris asked a question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to increase Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta's facility to borrow under ministerial guarantee from the existing level of £150,000,000 to £180,000,000.</P>
      <P>I will now outline the background which gave rise to the necessity for this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>NET was incorporated in 1961 with a nominal share capital of £100 and with ministerial power to guarantee up to £1 million in borrowings.  Through a number of subsequent legislative Acts the authorised share capital was increased to 77.5 <Col N="1573" /> million shares of £1 each.  All the authorised share capital has been issued and all the shares are beneficially held by the Minister for Finance, except for one each held by the directors.  Similarly, successive legislative Acts have increased the Minister's power to guarantee NET's borrowings up to a limit of £150 million. This facility is currently fully utilised.</P>
    <P>NET was formed for the purpose of manufacturing nitrogenous fertilisers and the company commenced production at its plant in Arklow in 1965.  The chief products were ammonium sulphate and the fertiliser, calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN), both of which were based on ammonia which in turn was produced from heavy fuel oil.  Then the discovery of the natural gas field off the Kinsale Head offered NET the opportunity of using an attractive feedstock for the manufacture of ammonia.  At the beginning of 1974, NET received an allocation of gas from the field and at the end of that year with Government approval they commissioned Kellogg to build a world-scale ammonia and UREA plant at Marino Point, Cork, with annual capacities of 435,000 tonnes of ammonia and 310,000 tonnes of UREA.  However, as Senators are only too well aware, major problems were incurred in the construction of the plant which resulted in its construction being delayed by 17 months. The final cost of the Marino Point plant was £137.3 million, an increase of 116 per cent on the first detailed estimate of £63.5 million.</P>
    <P>This cost overrun, coupled with net trading losses, placed the company in extreme financial difficulties resulting in the State having to inject £50 million in extra share capital in 1981.  This share capital is, of course, included in the issued share capital of £77.5 million to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>Despite this capital injection, NET did not immediately move into a profitable situation.  It lost £12.2 million in 1982 and £25.3 million in 1983.  However, it made a profit of £2.9 million in 1984 and £4.8 million in 1985.  These profits were significant results as they were achieved <Col N="1574" /> after the servicing of the company's heavy debt burden.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately this trend did not continue. The company lost £19.5 million in 1986 and lost about £14 million to end September 1987, by which time its total debt was £180 million.  In fact, 1986 was a most difficult and unrewarding year for the fertiliser manufacturing industry and all European producers suffered losses due to a slump in world prices which resulted from cheap imports into the European market.</P>
    <P>The ongoing losses, combined with difficult trading conditions in Europe compelled the senior management of NET, following a review of NET's strategic position, to conclude and recommend that an association with a major fertiliser producer was necessary to ensure the long-term viability of the company.  Their review identified Richardson's Fertilizers Ltd. (RFL), Belfast, a wholly owned subsidiary of Imperial Chemical Industries plc (ICI), as the most suitable partner.</P>
    <P>The strategic need for an association with a major fertiliser producer arose because NET's prospects in the medium term were uncertain.  The company's debt placed an enormous strain on its cost base and on its ability to develop or survive.  There seemed little prospect of NET making any significant reduction in its debt in the medium term.  It was quite obvious that, unless some significant remedial action was taken, NET's ongoing losses could not be sustained and that these would place in serious doubt the very future of the company with a possible total loss of employment.  This currently amounts to 615 people of whom 301 are in Arklow, 277 in Cork and 37 in Dublin and other locations.</P>
    <P>It was against this background and the belief that a strong native manufacturing fertiliser industry was of strategic importance to any agricultural country, that the Government decided that discussions should be opened with ICI aimed at creating a joint venture company involving NET and RFL.  In January of this year the Government approved the joint venture arrangements which had been agreed in <Col N="1575" /> principle following lengthy, detailed and complex negotiations.</P>
    <P>I should say that the financial analysis and examination which preceded the setting up of the joint venture involved looking in detail at a two-year plan up to the end of 1988 for both NET and IFI.  It also involved carrying out a five year analysis of the situation using a variety of assumptions. The House should note that IFI are operating in a fiercely competitive environment and it would be unwise of me to reveal any details of their projections and plans.</P>
    <P>Under the joint venture arrangement the business of NET has been merged with that of RFL to form a new company, Irish Fertiliser Industries Ltd. (IFI), to service the fertiliser markets in the 32 counties of Ireland.  NET at present manufactures straight nitrogenous fertilisers at Marino Point, Cork, and calcium ammonium nitrate at Arklow.  Both of these products are based on ammonia which is produced in Cork.  By contrast RFL &mdash; which employs approximately 340 people &mdash; manufactures a compound fertiliser at its factory in Belfast.  The new company will, therefore, be able to supply its customers with a broad range of fertilisers through its own production and also, of course, if desirable, by trading with other suppliers.  It will also supply at commercial prices the Richardsons' plant in Belfast with ammonia about equal in quantity to that imported by Richardson's from the United Kingdom at present.  This ammonia has been surplus to NET's requirements and by its transfer to Belfast the necessity to sell it on the open market at whatever price it could obtain will be removed.</P>
    <P>The company also intends to produce and sell intermediate products and byproducts of its fertiliser manufacture.  It will also sell on foreign markets products surplus to the requirements of the home territory.  It is the company's intention to establish and maintain a competitive cost base and a strong distribution sales system throughout the country and to utilise, wherever possible, indigenous raw materials, services and labour.  It <Col N="1576" /> shall also be open to the company to develop further investment opportunities, which in the opinion of the board can be separately and economically justified.</P>
    <P>The structure of the joint venture provides that Irish Fertiliser Industries will be a subsidiary owned 51 per cent by NET and 49 per cent by ICI.  NET will, of course, continue to be a 100 per cent State-owned company.  NET has retained its gas contract with Bord Gáis Éireann. It will sell the gas purchased under this contract to IFI at a price which has been subject to detailed commercial negotiations between the Government, NET and ICI to ensure that it is a market-related arms length price.</P>
    <P>Disclosure of the gas price arrangement between NET and IFI would be extremely detrimental to IFI which is operating in a fiercely competitive market as it would reveal confidential commercial information about IFI's cost structure to its competitors.  The gas will be sold to IFI under a complex formula and all projections show that it would be sold at a profit.  This profit, plus its share of the dividends of IFI, will be used by NET to service its debts.  As to when the debt will be repaid, I have to say that this depends on so many variables that no one can hazard a guess.  For instance, an upsurge in oil prices, which are part of the gas price formula, if unaccompanied by a compensating increase in interest charges, could reduce the debt very quickly.  It is, therefore, not realistically possible to even hazard a guess as to when the debt might be cleared.</P>
    <P>The company's liabilities now stand at approximately £168 million following the transfer down to IFI of about £20 million of NET'S debts in respect of working capital.  This £168 million includes bank borrowings of £160 million and other liabilities such as interest payments and provision for the cost of gas delivered before the joint venture took place.</P>
    <P>I must stress that the joint venture was never envisaged in terms of asset sales. It was negotiated as a pooling of resources to create a stronger indigenous fertiliser company.  The financial terms <Col N="1577" /> were structured to ensure that the returns to the two parties would be commensurate with their relative earnings contributions.  From NET's point of view this has been achieved through a commercial gas price coupled with 51 per cent of the dividends from IFI.  On this basis, approximately 75 per cent of the profits of IFI will come to the Irish State and 25 per cent to ICI.</P>
    <P>This latter company which is a world leader in technology of ammonia production will contribute to IFI through the input of Richardson's and its technical expertise in ammonia production.  It will also contribute through its purchasing and marketing facilities and through the sheer size of its presence in the international marketplace.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated NET had heavy losses over the past two years. These losses have been funded largely through short term borrowings which were due for repayment in the near future.  With the implementation of the joint venture the opportunity was taken of putting these borrowings on a longer term footing and also to provide some additional facilities.  In addition, NET had £150 million of guaranteed borrowings.</P>
    <P>When approving of the joint venture in January, 1987, the Government decided, that if possible the additional medium/long term funding should be obtained from the banks on an unguaranteed basis, but that if the funding were not available on terms acceptable to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance the Government would introduce legislation to guarantee the required borrowings.  Following this decision, discussions took place with a number of banks and, while offers to provide the funding on an unguaranteed basis were received, the terms attaching thereto were not acceptable.  These terms were a mortgage on the gas contract and higher interest rates which would mean an additional £120,000 to £200,000 a year in interest payments.  Consequently, the Government decided to introduce legislation to guarantee the additional borrowings required which is £30 million. <Col N="1578" /> The banks were notified of the decision and in anticipation of the introduction of this legislation, they provided the funding on terms acceptable to myself and to the Minister for Finance.  Medium and long term facilities of £30 million have been arranged on acceptable terms, replacing NET's existing short term borrowings and providing the company with a contingency margin during the initial, transitional period of the joint venture in what remain unpredictable market conditions. The provision of these facilities cleared the way for the establishment of the joint venture which was put in place on 9 October last.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that NET`S financial position was and is quite serious and that the joint venture will not of itself necessarily provide sufficient money to service the debts.  A company which lost £34 million over the past 21 months will not produce significant profits for its parent Irish company immediately after joining with a profitable company in Belfast.  It must be pointed out that NET will be very exposed to movements in oil prices and to exchange rates because of the gas price formula and it will also be exposed to changes in interest rates.  For example an increase of 1 per cent in interest rates would cost NET £1.6 million per annum.</P>
    <P>Also, if oil prices slump it could result in NET getting a reduced return from IFI.  Hence the need to provide a hedge for NET to allow it scope to service its debts over the first year or so of IFI's operations.  However, the joint venture will create a stronger, more viable operational company better able than an independent NET to meet the fierce competitive pressures existing in the fertiliser industry.  I am confident that through its gas price and dividend payments to NET the joint venture company will contribute much more significantly to servicing the debt than NET could if it had remained an independent company.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, it will take a tremendous effort on behalf of all concerned, plus a significant improvement in the international fertiliser industry and related markets if the debt is to be serviced out <Col N="1579" /> of the moneys to be received by NET and without recourse to Exchequer support. In this regard, it should be noted that it will be the responsibility of NET to monitor the performance of IFI on behalf of the State, and to keep the Government and the Oireachtas informed as to its progress and the contribution it is making towards the servicing of NET's debts. In addition, the accounts of IFI will be incorporated into the annual accounts of NET which company, as I have already stated, will remain 100 per cent State owned and will, therefore, be subject to Government and Oireachtas scrutiny as at present.</P>
    <P>Several amendments to this Bill were moved by the Opposition during the passage of the Bill through the Dáil, the effects of which were to provide for a maximum figure lower than the £180 million proposed or else to reduce the £180 million limit over time and that such lower limits would then become upper limits.  However, it is emphasised that there is no point in fixing a limit lower than the £180 million proposed as it is necessary not only to cover borrowings that are outstanding at present but also to provide the company with a contingency margin during the initial transitional period of the joint venture.</P>
    <P>In relation to a sliding scale of limits I wish to say that as the limit reduces, my approval and the approval of the Minister for Finance will be required to let it go back up again.  However, if lower limits were provided for in the legislation then any increase, no matter how small, would require new legislation.  I do not think that this is practicable.</P>
    <P>Another Opposition amendment proposed that in the year 1992 the guaranteed limit of £180 million would revert to £150 million which is the limit obtaining at present.  This is essentially a review mechanism which, if accepted, would mean that the agreements which NET have already made with the banks would have to be renegotiated which could affect the margins, rates and terms of the loans.</P>
    <P>I undertook to consider an Opposition <Col N="1580" /> amendment which proposed that within the overall limit of £180 million.  I could, if I so wished, give either a 100 per cent guarantee or lower guarantees, e.g. 90 per cent, 80 per cent etc.  My Department have consulted the Attorney General's Office on this and the advice received is that such an amendment is unnecessary since I already have such discretion.  Even if only a portion of a loan is unguaranteed that element of the loan would attract higher interest rates and unacceptable security in the case of a company like NET which has no manufacturing operations of its own but is dependent on another company for its income.  For these reasons the Seanad will note that we have not accepted the above amendments.</P>
    <P>During the Dáil debate several Deputies referred to the role of worker directors who will be on the board of NET.  I have to emphasise that their role will be the same as for the other NET directors which is to monitor the performance of IFI and to manage the gas contract and the company's debts.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta Bill will commend itself to the Seanad and I recommend the Bill for its approval.  Before I sit down I should say that I will have to go to take Questions in the Dáil.  I will come back later on to go through the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the merger of NET and RFL.  It is the proper way forward.  There are a couple of questions I would like to ask in the context of my speech.  I hope the IFI merger will secure the 615 jobs already there at present and that the company will become more competitive in selling fertilisers within the 32 Counties.  There are a number of points I would like to make. As I understand it, the previous Government decided in January that the additional borrowing necessary for NET would be undertaken on normal commercial terms without the benefit of a State guarantee.  Normal commercial terms are the appropriate way in which any commercial business should raise money because in that way the company <Col N="1581" /> must not only convince the Government and their own board of directors but also the banks whose money is at risk.</P>
      <P>By changing their minds about a State guarantee the Government have essentially absolved the banks of their responsibilities in vetoing the project in that they will be repaid whether the project works or not.  Why did the Government decide to finance this deal on a guaranteed basis.  The banks offered to fund the deal on a non-guaranteed basis. Why were the terms the banks offered unacceptable?  I accept that the savings from a guarantee are not very large but I cannot understand why the Government decided not to opt for a normal commercial loan to finance this deal which, in the event of failure, would leave the banks at risk rather than the Government and the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>At the end of September 1987 the debt of the old NET company was in the region of £180 million.  How much of that debt is being transferred to the new company and how much will remain with IFI? Quite a large part of that debt is related to the working capital.  If the working capital debt is remaining with IFI there is no question of guaranteeing that as we are only guaranteeing the debt of NET and the new holding company &mdash; and if the debts of the new holding company are to be £180 million minus the working capital, that will leave the Government giving a guarantee of NET of less than £180 million.  Depending on what the working capital was, the Government may not have to guarantee as much as £180 million.  The company lost £19.5 million in 1986 and about £14 million to September of this year.  What is the Minister's forecast of the likely profit or loss for the company in 1988?  I know it is a difficult question, but it is one that has to be asked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to have the best available estimates for the next year before we can make a judgment on giving the guarantee on behalf of the taxpayer which otherwise would have to be met by the banks.  Can the Minister say when he expects the debt inherited or retained by NET to be extinguished under the arrangements <Col N="1582" /> being made?  As I understand it, Irish Fertiliser Industries will pay a dividend on any profit they make which will go towards the reduction of the debt on NET which we are now guaranteeing to further extend.  The main contribution towards the extension of this will come from the profit NET will make on the gas they sell to Irish Fertiliser Industries.  NET have a contract in regard to gas which must rate as one of the best contracts around and are paying probably 4p or 5p per therm when the going price is somewhere in the region of 30p.  What commercial price have the Government decided with IFI?</P>
    <P>I would like to state that, coming from a Border area, in the past number of years I have seen a lot of fertiliser being imported from Northern Ireland and sold in the Republic.  It is necessary that this merger would leave the companies more competitive.  I have been informed that nitrogen has been brought from Northern Ireland, then imported back there and resold at a cheaper price.  This is anomaly that must stop.</P>
    <P>I wish the merger every success and I hope the company will be trading with a profit in a number of years time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has pointed out, the purpose of this Bill is to increase NET's facility to borrow under ministerial guarantee from the existing level of £150 million to £180 million.  I welcome the fact that the Minister is introducing this Bill.  Despite all the problems of NET, I see this in many ways as a recognition of NET's genuine efforts to restore order to its finances and to the general operation of the major rationalisation programme which is now almost complete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not the first time that NET has been mentioned in this House or in the other House.  I recall the severe criticism of the company over the years.  Its performance was not the best, and that is being kind to it.  The overriding aspect of the criticism was the fact that we had so much over-expenditure in the construction of the Marino Point complex. That criticism still remains and will remain forever to haunt that company. <Col N="1583" /> The Minister has given us the actual figures. The final cost of that exercise was £137.3 million or 116 per cent over the first estimate of £63.5 million.  Therefore, we know the company had problems from the very beginning.  One cannot but look back at the operations of the company, the contracts that were handed out at the time, perhaps the bad advice that was given to the board members, not forgetting the disastrous Marino Point project which will remain forever as a severe criticism levelled at the company.  One might argue that that is a monument to bad management.</P>
    <P>If the company had not been established our large agricultural industry could not have counted on an assured supply of nitrogen.  In fact, if it was not established we would be totally at the mercy of foreign manufacturers.  Today NET employees number about 600.  At one stage it was probably double that number or even more.  I hope it has shed all the non-profitable operations and is now an efficient and progressive organisation. We cannot ignore the fact that agriculture is vital to our economy.  It can be said that NET has been a great friend to our farmers.  It has supplied us with the vital element of nitrogen as a fertiliser. The company never let the farmers down.  I believe when there were labour problems the company imported the appropriate fertiliser and sent it around the country so that farmers would be able to continue with their farming operations.  Surely that is a very practical example of the genuine concern that the company has always had for the farming community.</P>
    <P>There are one or two points I would like to raise.  The Minister might outline in greater detail the basis on which the loans have been granted.  I have always believed that a loan, whether it be a personal loan or a loan to a company, should be given by banks, or whoever, on the merits of the case.  Unfortunately, banks do not operate in that way and they tend to have that extra support.  In the knowledge that this is a semi-State company, it would be a nice gesture if <Col N="1584" /> the banks granted the money without this extra ministerial guarantee.  However, that is the way banks operate and we will have to accept it.</P>
    <P>By introducing this Bill the Minister has recognised the merit of this company. He recognises the very important role it is playing in the industrial and agricultural sectors.  Like all of us in this House the Minister wants the company to move forward rather than backwards.  For a company with such important national consequences it is right that the Minister should involve himself in a practical manner in this industry.  I hope the company will continue with rationalisation and a forward thinking approach, and with the fusing of ICI and the Richardson concern in Belfast on the 51:49 basis so that the company can go on to great heights.</P>
    <P>I wish the new company, Irish Fertilisers Industry Limited, the best for the future.  Like the Minister I am confident that this joint venture will create a stronger and more viable company which will be better able to meet very real and very strong competition than an independent NET and that this company will continue to exist for a long time in the area of the fertiliser industry, that it will continue to show growth in the years ahead and that the aspirations, hopes and beliefs of the Minister will be proved right in time to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief on this Bill.  It is obvious that the House supports the measures put forward here today by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. It is very important that we have a strong company such as NET to provide nitrogen and all the other things it provides for the Irish farmer.  We know that the company needs money at present.  The Minister has outlined the reasons why it needs this money.  While there may be arguments put forward regarding the method of procuring that money and people might ask why did the company not go to the banks and get the money from them without the necessity for a State guarantee, I believe that for a company such as NET it is important that the <Col N="1585" /> Government should give the necessary guarantee.  That is what we are doing in this legislation.  We are increasing the existing level of £150 million to £180 million.</P>
      <P>NET has given tremendous service to the country since its foundation in 1965. Like many other Irish companies NET had bad years such as 1985 and 1986.  The worst thing that could have happened was what happened in Cork in 1974, when they started to build a world scale ammonia and urea plant at Marino Point in Cork.  There has been a lot of argument and a lot of criticism of the Government and the company as a result of the overall cost there, an overrun of 116 per cent. The original estimate given for this work was £63.5 million and the actual cost was £137.3 million.</P>
      <P>There were problems with that plant. Naturally those problems were handed on to NET and they are still with NET today.  It is easy to be wise after the event. There were problems with employment, problems with unions and many other problems.  I have no doubt that this company will go on from strength to strength. It is giving tremendous employment at present.  I understand there are over 600 people employed in the industry; at one stage there were over 1,500.  Like every other company in the State at the present time there had to be streamlining; there had to be pruning done in order to ensure that it was run in an efficient manner.</P>
      <P>The important thing about this company is that it assures a regular supply of nitrogen to Irish agriculture.  That is very important when we think of the part agriculture is playing in the development of the economy.  Agriculture is our main industry.  It is very important that farmers should have a regular supply of nitrogen. Particularly in recent years farmers are becoming more conscious of the need for nitrogen.  Over the past few years they have gone into silage making in a big way. They have developed their grasslands and made sure they have an early supply of grass for their cattle in the spring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>NET contributed enormously to this by having nitrogen available to farmers. It produces at the moment 51,000 tonnes <Col N="1586" /> of calcium ammonium nitrate, 490,000 of ammonia and nitrate and 365,000 tonnes of urea.  That is the contribution the company is making to Irish agriculture.  We then have to consider the tremendous spin-off industries from this company. CIE benefit enormously from transporting the products around the country. We have the private hauliers, dockers, shipping agents, engineering suppliers and the people who make the plastic bags for the urea and all the other products. Not alone is NET giving good employment in the factory but it is also providing spin-off jobs in other industries.  That is why it merits our support.  In time it will come back into profitability.  There is no doubt about that if the demand is there for the industry and if the demand is there for the product.  I believe farmers will see to it that that demand is there.  NET will be able to meet that demand.  That is why over a period of years I believe we will see this company going into profitability again.  I believe the arrangements that have been made in the company and the amalgamation that has been outlined by the Minister here today will ensure that we have a good sound company able to produce a product that is in demand by Irish agriculture at a reasonable price. That will ensure its viability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to increase NET's facility to borrow under ministerial guarantee from the existing level of £150 million to £180 million.  One must pose the question: why is this increased facility necessary?  Reading through the debate in the Dáil and looking at the historical facts I believe the roots of the problem rest with the decision to commission Kellogg to build a world scale ammonia and urea plant at Marino Point in Cork in 1974.  The purpose of the operation was to manufacture large quantities of these substances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to note that the initial detailed estimate for the project amounted to £63.5 million.  The project was beset by many disruptions and the construction was delayed for 17 months. The final cost of the project was £137.3 <Col N="1587" /> million, a staggering increase of 116 per cent.  One has got to ask: who should bear the responsibility for such a gross overrun?</P>
    <P>Everyone is to well aware of the industrial problems which plagued that project. However, an overrun of this magnitude cannot be attributed to industrial problems alone.  The major reason for the overrun was that a decision was made at that time to give the green light to a project, which was an unproven technology, whereby gas obtained as a byproduct of oil production could be used for the production of nitrogenous fertiliser.</P>
    <P>The plant at Marino Point was the first of its kind ever built by Kelloggs the main contractor.  This new technology was developed and perfected at great expense to the Irish taxpayer.  Unfortunately, this type of cost overrun is not confined to NET.  Historical records indicate that the initial cost plan for the majority of Government contracts has followed the same trend.  Again I ask: who is to blame?</P>
    <P>I believe the professional design team must come in for scrutiny, with no exceptions. The design team is made up of architects, structural engineers. mechanical and electrical engineers and quantity surveyors.  Is there proper coordination of the different services?  Are the specifications and design drawings comprehensive enough to close loopholes and to eliminate claims for all types of extras and variations?</P>
    <P>The trading record of the company is not good.  In 1982 losses amounted to £12.2 million and in 1983 there were losses of £25.3 million.  However, in 1984 and 1985 there was an upturn and there were profits earned amounting to £2.9 million and £4.8 million respectively. These profits were significant as they were achieved after the servicing of the company's heavy burdens.  Unfortunately, this trend did not continue and the company lost £19.5 million in 1986 and about £14 million up to the end of September 1987.  We must look on the positive side of NET.  If we take stock of the positive role and contribution that <Col N="1588" /> NET is making to the economy in terms of employment and services provided to our premier industry, agriculture, the consensus is that the company has served the industry very well.</P>
    <P>NET was set up in 1961 by the Government as a private limited company.  Its aims were to establish a nitrogenous fertiliser industry and provide the necessary requirements to our agricultural sector, thus removing our dependence on imported products.  NET is also responsible for many downstream industries. The company has a close working relationship with CIE and a wide distribution system has been developed.  As a result, the industry has a network of storage depots throughout the country giving a tremendous service to the farmer.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, I believe governments should not guarantee loans unless there is a reasonable possibility of the company returning to profitability within an agreed timescale and allowing the redemption of such a guarantee.  The new joint venture the management has recommended with Richardsons Fertilisers, Belfast, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of ICI, will result in a profitable company.  For this reason I believe we are justified in guaranteeing such a loan.  I am confident that the loan will be paid back in time.  Also, apart from the economic consideration of guaranteeing loans, there must be social and other reasons which are reflected in employment and services to the community which would favour the provision of such a guarantee.</P>
    <P>The question must be asked: why should NET be singled out for this treatment? In line with major efforts the management have made together with all State agencies to recruit employment and in the context of this joint venture with ICI, the company will have a bright future and will continue to serve the farming community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the committee on their work on small businesses in general and in particular on this their sixth report on the development and management of small business co-operatives. The committee identified five types of co-operative which currently operate and concentrated their deliberations on worker co-operatives and community co-operatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the co-operative movement is long established in this country, the concept of small business co-operatives is still relatively recent.  The past few years have seen an increase in the number of these co-operatives being established and the trend would appear to indicate that small business co-operatives are going to <Col N="1590" /> significantly increase their impact, both on the social and economic fronts.</P>
    <P>In 1981, there were some 30 trading co-operatives, mainly in the Gaeltacht areas.  There are now about 60 trading co-operatives employing almost 600 people, with the main growth occurring outside of the Gaeltacht areas.  Some 300 groups throughout the country are currently involved in some form of community enterprise, the majority of which are organised along co-operative lines.</P>
    <P>The emergence of these co-ops is due to a variety of factors such as: high levels of unemployment contributing to a desire on the part of the unemployed to find alternative means of creating sustainable employment in their localities; a growing sense of the need for self help among workers in businesses and communities which have experienced or are threatened with unemployment; a European and world wide growth in &ldquo;local employment initiatives&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Co-operatives have been the subject of two other reports as well as the one which we are now discussing &mdash; one from the Society for Co-operative Studies in Ireland on &ldquo;The Wider Application of the Co-operative System in Ireland&rdquo;, the other being the Irish Congress of Trade Unions' &ldquo;Report on Worker Co-operatives&rdquo;. The three reports have been subjected to intensive scrutiny by a number of State agencies, including IDA, AnCO and YEA.</P>
    <P>The State agencies have already undertaken significant initiatives in relation to small business co-operatives. As the report points out, under the community enterprise programme, a community enterprise programme approvals committee was established by agreement between the Department of Labour, community voluntary groups and the relevant State agencies.  The Youth Employment Agency co-ordinates the role of the other State agencies &mdash; IDA, SFADCo, Údarás na Gaeltachta, AnCO and the National Manpower Service.  The purpose of the committee is to provide the maximum assistance to business co-operatives while ensuring no overlap in <Col N="1591" /> functions.  The agencies see the co-operatives' need for assistance occurring in two primary areas &mdash; the planning and development stage and in start-up and after care.  They provide a full range of services for small business co-operatives at any stage of their development.</P>
    <P>The role of the Manpower agencies in relation to co-operatives has been copperfastened through specific provisions in the Labour Services Act, 1987, which will establish the umbrella body, FÁS, under the aegis of the Minister for Labour.  The establishment of FÁS will also reduce the number of State bodies involved in supporting worker co-operatives and help remove any confusion attributed to the multiplicity of State agencies in this area about which the committee expressed concern, and I believe rightly so.  The involvement of another body such as the IPC as recommended in the report would be counter to this process of rationalisation.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> the Government recognise the case for promoting the establishment of worker co-operatives in suitable circumstances. They are, therefore, to request FÁS to consider urgently proposals for the establishment of a co-operative development council.  The Minister for Labour is, at present, considering plans for a pilot operation which would help emerging co-operative business with specialised advice in advance of the establishment of FÁS.  This operation would be part funded out of current manpower agency funds with contributions coming from the IDA and non-State funds.  It is envisaged that the new body could draw on the collective experience of State agencies, trade unions, co-operative bodies and the Northern Ireland Co-operative Development Agency in developing its services.</P>
    <P>In addition, since publication of the committee's report the IDA have completed an internal review on how they, as a development agency, can best assist further growth in the co-operative movement and in particular, manufacturing co-operatives.  The IDA have decided to <Col N="1592" /> appoint an officer with overall responsibility for the development and promotion of co-operatives.  The officer will work in close contact with the proposed co-operative development council.  He will be responsible for the regular review of IDA co-operative policy, promotion of co-operatives at both national and regional level and liaison with Government, State agencies and groups involved in co-operatives.  In the interests of developing strong co-operatives, the IDA will also, as a condition of grant-aid, require that certain criteria be fulfilled. These will include such matters as positive evidence of external funding, professional and experienced management, incompany training and the appointment of experienced external local directors to co-operatives management committees.</P>
    <P>The report makes several other recommendations and I would like to address myself to some of these.  A major recommendation, and one which was also made in the other two reports to which I referred earlier, is for a new co-operative Act which would define a co-operative and set out the legal framework for the structure and operation of co-operatives.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware co-operatives are at present registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1893.  This Act has been criticised for not defining a co-operative and for allowing for the registration of businesses which are not co-operative in character.  It has also been criticised for imposing a number of restrictions on registered societies and for not reflecting modern standards of protection for members and all who deal with the societies.</P>
    <P>There is substance in all of these criticisms but it is necessary to make some other points in relation to the statutory position in order to get a balanced perspective on the role of legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>The committee in their report points out that the lack of a new co-operative Act in itself is not a fundamental reason for the failure of industrial and service co-operatives to take root in Ireland on any widespread basis.  It has also to be <Col N="1593" /> said that legislation no matter how positive in its intent can, at times, be restrictive in its effect.  This could be the case especially with any legislation which would seek to define a co-operative and limit or restrict the registration of new co-operatives which did not meet a new statutory definition.</P>
    <P>The question of a new Act specifically for co-operatives has been considered a number of times over the years but it has never been possible to produce a satisfactory statutory definition of co-operative which would cover every type of co-operative activity and at the same time be sufficiently water-tight to exclude from registration organisations which are not bona fide co-operatives.</P>
    <P>The general principles underlying co-operatives are well understood internationally. However, the principles do not have the precision which is necessary in a statutory definition.  A restrictive definition could be counter-productive in that it would limit the registration of some bodies which could be of long term value but do not meet the strict definition in law.  The net point which I make is that the flexibility which is offered by the current Industrial and Provident Society Acts may be preferable to a more restricted regime under a new co-operative Act. I have to say that this could be particularly the case in relation to the recommendation by the committee that new legislation should acknowledge the different forms of co-operative including producer, consumer, credit, industrial and service, and community.  Co-operatives will not in every case fall neatly into categories such as these and attempts to force them to do so are not likely to be beneficial.</P>
    <P>It is as well to consider the two sides of the coin also when one comes to look at legislative provisions in relation to the conduct of business by co-operatives and standards of protection for their members and others who deal with them. The legislative provisions governing companies have increased over the years and, indeed, there is a substantial Companies Bill before the Seanad at present.  A strong case can be made for the extension <Col N="1594" /> of similar provisions to industrial and provident societies but it must be realised that all such requirements impose administrative and compliance costs on the bodies to which they apply.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that my Department should continue to examine the legislative aspects of this issue, together with all the other aspects, with a view to ensureing that no unnecessary hurdle is put in the way of the establishment and development of co-operatives.</P>
    <P>The report also seeks to have the employment rights of worker members of co-operatives dealt with under the relevant employment legislation and not under co-operative legislation.  Employment legislation generally applies to employees who meet the various requirements in relation to hours worked and continuity of employment.  As worker members of co-operatives are not excluded for the purposes of the legislation, I feel that the existing legislation is adequate in this regard.</P>
    <P>The questions of education and training are vital to the success of a co-operative. It is essential that well trained managers be available to manage co-operatives as many of these entities fail because of the lack of expertise at this level.  Members of worker co-operatives can have difficulty at times in appreciating that they are both workers and shareholders, and that they are not in an &ldquo;us and them&rdquo; situation.  This can be particularly so in the case of &ldquo;phoenix&rdquo; situations where a workers' co-operative takes over from a failed business concern. This type of difficulty calls for continuing educational programmes for all involved.</P>
    <P>Considerable State resources are allocated to developing management expertise within co-operatives.  The committee have recommended that co-operative management grants be introduced.  In that regard, the YEA provide management grants to co-operatives of up to £14,000 for one year, with provision for a further £10,000 grant for a second year. Furthermore, the IDA's management grants are, of course, also available to manufacturing co-operatives.</P>
    <P>Another recommendation is that <Col N="1595" /> AnCO fund a scheme of management secondment to co-operatives in European countries, with a commitment from the personnel involved to work in an Irish co-operative for not less than two years thereafter.  While I agree that overseas experience would be of great benefit to managers, it is doubtful if AnCO could commit funds for this purpose.  It is also very doubtful if a commitment to work in a co-operative for two years on return could be enforced.  There could be some difficulty with that.</P>
    <P>There is also a recommendation to remove the condition that 75 per cent of the workers in a co-operative must be under 25 to qualify for the full range of incentives available under the community enterprise programme.  The Labour Services Act, 1987, to which I referred earlier, provides for the abolition of the upper age limit for assistance from employment levy funds.</P>
    <P>The committee, conscious of the importance of long term funding mechanisms for the successful development of any business, consider that trade unions, credit unions and existing large agricultural co-operatives would be in a position to establish co-operative venture funds which would invest in small business co-operatives.  As an incentive to individual investors, the committee recommend tax relief at the marginal rate in respect of involvement in the shares of such funds, subject to an upper investment limit of £10,000.  While tax relief for investments in venture funds is not a feasible proposition given our current budgetary situation, the business expansion scheme, through which more than £17 million has been invested in 170 companies to date, enables individual investors to obtain substantial tax relief on investments made directly in a qualifying co-operative.</P>
    <P>The committee have recommended the institution of a revolving fund to provide loan finance for co-operative start ups.  A number of initiatives to provide funds for start ups have already been taken on a local basis, but the feasibility of establishing a revolving fund on a national <Col N="1596" /> level, to be supported on a goodwill basis by major companies and institutions, might best be left for consideration by the proposed co-operative development council.</P>
    <P>In passing I should recommend the district expansion scheme to all concerned, including the co-operative movement.  As Senators know, it is a scheme whereby you can invest up to £25,000 of your own funds in a business and subsequently write that £25,000 off against your personal income tax.  There is no need to pay income tax.  By investing the money in a suitable business proposition that qualifies, you would be doing both yourself and the business you invest in a great favour.</P>
    <P>The committee recommend various changes in the enterprise allowance scheme.  Among these is a proposal that the weekly allowances be increased by 20 per cent and that the scheme be extended to a second year on a reduced basis. However, in the context of scarce Exchequer resources, it is most unlikely that significant changes of this nature in the scheme could be implemented at the present time.</P>
    <P>A weekly payment of £100 to participants in co-operatives is also recommended in the report.  I feel that discretionary rates of payment between categories of participant would be very difficult to justify simply on the grounds of the legal form which the business takes.</P>
    <P>The committee also recommend that people who have been made redundant and who can produce a P45 should not have to fulfil the 13 week unemployment criterion as required under the scheme. The reason this condition applies to the scheme is that it is felt that a proportion of persons becoming redundant can secure alternative employment quickly by virtue of their skills and experience and the demand for these skills in the marketplace. To react too soon to unemployment would be tantamount to diverting scarce Exchequer resources unnecessarily to an area not requiring them.  Employment schemes have a common objective of catering for the <Col N="1597" /> institutionally unemployed and this is currently perceived as commencing after 13 weeks of unemployment.</P>
    <P>I should point out that since the report was published, qualification for the scheme has been switched from marital status to social welfare dependency.  For instance, a man who previously qualified for the higher allowance under the scheme on the basis that he was married would now be assessed on whether he was receiving a social welfare payment in respect of an adult or child dependant.</P>
    <P>The report's recommendation on the establishment of a representative body for small business co-operatives will, no doubt, be addressed both by co-operatives themselves and by the proposed co-operative development council, as will the committee's proposals for a series of five year plans with targetted employment levels.</P>
    <P>In their report the joint committee states that while co-operatives are seen as a third force, in addition to State and private enterprises, not even their most enthusiastic advocates regard them as the ultimate solution to unemployment.  The relatively small number of co-operatives developed to date, their size and the sectors they are located in, indicates that it will take many years to successfully develop a viable and expanding worker co-operative sector.</P>
    <P>It is in all our interests that the co-operative movement should develop as a genuine third force in employment maintenance and creation.  The fulfilment of this objective demands the promotion and establishment of strong, viable co-operatives which will not need successive injections of State aid.  Such companies will have a strong product base and strong management and will widen their horizons beyond the purely local level.  The development of a strategic approach to import substitution and exports is the linchpin upon which co-operative members, and the community at large, will prosper.  I thank Senators for their attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>In his opening remarks the Minister congratulated the Joint Committee on Small Businesses on the work they have been doing for the past number of years.  As a former member of that committee I welcome the Minister's comments, but I am disappointed that the Government did not see fit to reestablish the committee.  In my opinion it was one of the hardest working committees, producing seven reports which dealt with the manufacturing industry, the retail and distribution industry, tourism, catering and leisure, the construction industry which has now been devastated by this Government.  A number of the recommendations which emanated from the committee were implemented by the previous Government but have now been scrapped by the present Government.  The committee also dealt at length with the chronic problem in the insurance area for small businesses, which is a growing problem for small industries.  I am aware of the Minister's work and the positive speeches he has made on this issue.</P>
      <P>The Joint Committee on Small Businesses were very active under the chairmanship of Deputy Ivan Yates and the vice-chairmanship of Senator Michael Lynch.  They both worked very hard for the success achieved by the committee.  In view of the very serious economic climate and the huge unemployment figures I ask the Minister to have this committee reestablished or a committee with more widespread powers set up.  This would have a definite input into solving some of our problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sixth report of the Joint Committee on Small Businesses deals with the development and management of small business co-operatives.  In most European countries, including Ireland, Government agencies, community groups and trade unions have been promoting various employment initiatives within the general framework of co-operative business entities.  In this context the committee decided to examine the potential for small business co-ops in Ireland and the obstacles to achieving that potential.  Although there has been <Col N="1599" /> a revival of interest in the co-op idea in Europe as a result of the growing levels of widespread and chronic unemployment, not even their most enthustiastic advocates regard co-ops as the ultimate solution to unemployment.  However, co-ops are increasingly seen as a third force, in addition to State and private enterprise. On the basis of evidence from some European countries, properly funded and well managed small co-ops can be an important extra dimension to both job and wealth creation.</P>
    <P>I will deal at a later stage in my speech with the success enjoyed by a number of co-ops set up in the town of Mondragon in Spain where it has been clearly shown that co-ops have had a major function to play in solving the unemployment problem and in the creation of wealth.  In Ireland, we will need to create between 15,000 and 20,000 new jobs each year into the next century simply to prevent unemployment rising further.  Like Spain, we should be able to set up co-op structures which would enable us to enjoy similar success.  However, up to now our record in the co-operative movement has been very poor except in the dairy area, where the co-op structure has been a major employer.  This was not dealt with in this report.</P>
    <P>As a former creamery manager I have seen at first hand the importance of dairy co-ops for employment and wealth creation in rural Ireland.  One need only look at what the formation of the Kerry Co-op and the North Kerry Milk Products did for County Kerry, creating thousands of jobs for both young and old.  Now because of their expansion into the US and other markets opportunities are given for highly trained staff with secure jobs to travel and gain valuable experience which can be utilised here.</P>
    <P>It is very important that personnel involved in the agricultural co-operatives should be willing to share some of their experience with small businesses co-operatives being established.  The international Labour Office defined a co-operative as:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1600" /> An association of persons who have voluntarily joined together to achieve a common end through the formation of a democratically controlled organisation; making equitable contributions to the capital required and accepting a full share of the risks and benefits of the organisation in which the members actively participate.</P>
    <P>The Congress of the International Co-operatives Alliance met in Vienna in 1966 and set down six generally accepted principles with regard to co-operatives:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  Membership should be voluntary and available to all persons who can make use of the services of a co-operative and are willing to accept the principles of membership.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Co-operative societies are democratic organisations.  Members should have equal voting rights and participation in decisions affecting their co-operatives.  Co-operatives should be administered by persons elected or appointed by the members.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Share capital should receive a strictly limited rate of interest.</P>
    <P>(iv)  The surplus or savings arising out of the operations of a society belong to the members and should be distributed in such a way as to ensure that no one member gains at the expense of others.</P>
    <P>(v)  All co-operative societies should make provision for the education of their members, officers and employees, and of the public in the economic and democratic aspects of co-operatives.</P>
    <P>(vi)  All co-operatives should actively co-operate with other co-operatives.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>The legal difference between a co-op business and a private firm is that in the case of the co-op ownership and control are vested in the members on the basis of equality rather than in proportion to financial interest, whereas in the case of <Col N="1601" /> a limited company control is determined by the size of individual shareholdings.</P>
    <P>There are five basic forms of co-operatives: (1) producer co-ops, the majority of which are the dairy co-ops in this country; (2) the consumer co-ops, in Ireland the main examples are housing co-ops; (3) community co-ops which deal with group water schemes, tourism, farmhouse holidays, local development etc.; (4) credit co-ops which basically are credit unions as we know them and which have made a major impact on employment in this country; (5) worker co-ops which may be in either the manufacturing or services sectors and are owned and controlled by the people working in them.</P>
    <P>Worker co-ops arise out of two situations: (1) where unemployed people come together to start their own business and provide their own jobs; (2) conversion of phoenix co-ops which arise out of closures in manufacturing industries when the workers purchase the assets and resume trading as a co-operative.  Worker co-ops operate almost exclusively in the industrial and services sector.  Although many European countries have worker co-operative movements going back to the last century, this movement is still in its infancy in Ireland.  However, worker co-ops have developed here in recent years and there is a growing interest in this form of enterprise.</P>
    <P>Worker co-ops are also increasing in Europe's production sector, especially in Italy and Spain.  From 1970 to 1980 the number of co-ops in Italy increased from 48,000 to nearly 80,000 with 500 new co-ops being created annually, providing 15,000 jobs.  In France the number of worker co-ops doubled since 1978.  There are now 1,300 co-ops providing 36,000 jobs.  With our level of unemployment and our expanding labour force, we would want to give much more impetus to the possibility of a co-op structure on the lines I mentioned in Spain, France and Italy.</P>
    <P>The ESRI and the NESC have shown that the labour force is expanding at the rate of about 20,000 a year into the early nineties.  There are, therefore, three <Col N="1602" /> possible scenarios: we will generate more jobs and-or we will have more emigration and-or we will have more people unemployed. The number of people employed has been falling since 1980.  In 1980 there were 1,163,000 people in jobs in Ireland. The latest official count was the labour force survey of 1985 which showed that there were 1,070,000 people with jobs. This represents a drop of 93,000 over those five years.  The ESRI have estimated that overall employment will have fallen to 1,030,000 by early 1988.  This would mean a further drop of 40,000 since 1985.</P>
    <P>The committee in their findings fully support the development of small business co-ops as a new force which can play a significant role in job creation.  It is to be expected that, given the lack of co-operative tradition in the industrial and services sector, initial progress will be slow.  It is recommended that a series of five year plans agreed between State and co-operative interests for the development of a movement of small business co-ops be initiated.  The first five year plan should be modest in its objectives and aim for a target of 250 small business co-ops employing approximately 2,500 by 1992.  The achievement of this target would provide a firm foundation for further major development of approximately 1,000 jobs annually in small co-ops. To achieve this there is now an absolute need for Government, State agencies, other public authorities and co-operative representatives to provide an effective framework of support for small co-ops.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the Mondragon development in Spain as a prime example of what can be achieved by the formation of a co-op movement. After the 1936-39 Spanish Civil War there was economic and social devastation and as a result a co-operative technical college was established in 1940. In 1956 the first manufacturing co-op was set up with 24 employees.  Some others followed and by 1960 there were 400 employed in eight different co-ops.  The growth in employment was rapid rising from 3,395 in 1965 to 18,058 by 1980. <Col N="1603" /> There are now 90 industrial co-ops producing a wide range of goods with a total turnover of $1,000,000,000 including exports of $250,000,000.  We should certainly be able to take a leaf out of their book.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to take a serious look at the recommendations issued by the committee on the proper framework for setting up of successful co-ops.  These include the following: (1) a new co-operative Act &mdash; this point was dealt with by the Minister in his opening speech and I welcome the fact that while there may be problems in relation to a new Act he has promised that he and his Department will have a further look at that area; (2) finance for co-ops &mdash; Ireland does not have a co-op bank like other European countries; (3) a new focus for management development; (4) a single representative body &mdash; and again the Minister referred to this in his speech when he mentioned that both the IDA and FÁS will be involved in the co-op movement; (5) improved State agency and local authority services.</P>
    <P>It is important that all of the above should be implemented if we are to take a revival of the industrial co-op movement in this country seriously.  I am aware that already a number of State aids are available to small business co-operatives. These include feasibility study grants, fixed assets grants, training grants, R and D grants, employment grants etc.  I believe new investment and a new approach to the co-op movement in this country would pay dividends and would help us along the path to economic recovery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this report and I congratulate the Minister on bringing it before us.  Unfortunately it is many years late.  I worked actively with Father McDyer many years ago when he was promoting the introduction of worker co-operatives. We worked hard to promote the development of vegetable growing. Unfortunately, we were entering an age when the emphasis was on amalgamation, rationalisation and what I <Col N="1604" /> would call conglomeration, because small units had to be got rid of.  There was no room for anything small.  &ldquo;Big&rdquo; was the in word.  Today as a result of that type of thinking, we are importing millions of pounds worth of vegetables, potatoes and other crops we could produce here.  I welcome Bord Glas who are now working in that direction.  For many years chips have been coming in from Holland and other countries.  We have reached the ridiculous situation where we were importing boiled potatoes from the Continent and putting them into a microwave to heat them.  As long as history has been recorded we have known how to boil potatoes, but we just got out of the habit of doing it.  Jobs were lost because we did not put the emphasis on being more self-sufficient and producing crops that we were capable of producing.</P>
      <P>When Father McDyer and many of us were working to promote co-operatives we were coming into the age of expansion. We had to get rid of the village pump, the parish boundaries.  We were in Europe and had to forget about local ideas.  We are coming back to that way of thinking, to a sense of community. Those were the days when we were holding meetings and marches.  It was Thomas Davis who said many years ago: &ldquo;Meetings and marches are not sufficient; we must work our land and correct our failings&rdquo;. Today we are reaching the stage where we will work our land.  I do not agree with the pessimists in our society who say there is no future for this country. The country is as good as the people who live in it.  It is as good as the effort we make.  A home is as good as the people who live in it make it.  The windows may be broken with the breeze blowing in, or it may be clean, tidy and repaired and be a comfortable home.  Ireland is our home, and it behoves all of us as a family to use our talents and abilities to create work and to make it a better place to live in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have experience of trying to get a small factory for my own little village of Grange, County Sligo, but nobody would listen.  I was so convinced there was a future for this thing that I built a shed at my own expense.  Today there are eight <Col N="1605" /> industries working in my village, all propagated from that old shed.  Last week one of those industries got a very lucrative contract to supply equipment to the American market which we will manufacture in the village of Grange.  What we can do in Grange can be done elsewhere. Unfortunately those of us who were plodding along that road were hitting our heads against a stone wall.  It was very hard to get support.</P>
    <P>A group not mentioned in this report for whom I have great admiration &mdash; they did a great deal for small industries, with all due respect to IDA and everybody else &mdash; are the county development teams.  Admittedly they could only give £200 or £300 but they came in at that vital point and gave help and assistance to small industries.  Their role should be broadened because they have a wealth of experience and information and they should be included in any talks on development.  No one has done more than the county development teams. They did fantastic work.  County development officers worked late at night and early in the morning trying to promote industry particularly in rural Ireland.  I would like to see a role for them in this report.  Perhaps at some future date we could think of including them in it.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the 13 week unemployment criterion.  I do not agree with that.  I ask him to rethink it.  I have seen a number of private businesses in Sligo which were going to the wall.  Those employed would have gladly tried to pick up the threads and keep the business going, but because they would get no assistance until a period of 13 weeks unemployment had elapsed the shutters went up.  It is very hard to reopen a business because the customers go when the place is closed.</P>
    <P>When a business folds up and the employees are prepared to try to keep it going, they should not be forced to go on the dole for 13 weeks, but should be given assistance.  I have at least four cases in mind where people who were trying to get a business started should have been allowed to continue.  We should not have allowed those places to close as they <Col N="1606" /> would have created more employment.  I ask the Minister to re-examine that point very carefully.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about amending the law.  The old law has worked very well.  There has been a great deal of chopping and changing of laws of one kind and another in an effort to modernise them.  Have we improved the law that much?  We should look very carefully at the old Act.  It has worked very well since 1893.  Many successful co-operatives have operated under it and I believe that it could continue to work with perhaps some amendments.  If we start amending the Act, we may end up worse than we were before we started.  I believe in what has been tried and tested.  It would be better to work with it rather than to throw it out.  However, if that is the case we will have an opportunity to give our views at a later date.</P>
    <P>The report discusses the advantages and disadvantages of co-operatives. Waiting for the committee to make a decision was the only disadvantage I found with co-operatives.  You can miss the bus when a decision has to be made fairly fast.  With that exception, I do not see any disadvantages.  Co-operatives are a great advantage particularly at present when we have labour problems, industrial unrest and people seeking to participate in decision making in their firms. Some two or three years ago I sent a resolution from Sligo County Council asking the Minister to encourage the promotion of worker co-operatives.  Perhaps that resolution prompted this motion.  It is good that Sligo County Council were thinking in that vein some time ago.</P>
    <P>I believe we have many good workers in this country.  If people were working for themselves and had a share in the business they could partake in profit sharing that would result in better workmanship. Better workers would play their part in reducing unemployment.  Are we doing enough fact finding among the unemployed?  I think many unemployed people have good ideas but their main problem is to get the money.  Finding money is a big problem when starting any venture.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1607" /> In Sligo a number of people came together and set up a fund through the Chamber of Commerce to help young entrepreneurs starting a business.  It has worked very well.  The fund lends them £2,000 or £3,000 at a very cheap rate of interest &mdash; 3 per cent or 4 per cent.  We should encourage more such action.  The commercial banks have done a good enough job.  When I approached them on behalf of young people starting out in business I found them helpful and co-operative. Unfortunately, the day of the friendly bank manager is very fast coming to a close.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have.  We have had some good managers.  I will not allow anything to be said against good bank managers. I had many dealings with them over the years and but for them I would have had nothing.  That day is gone because we are dealing now with computers.  We are dealing with the modern idea of projections, cash flow, finance management and this type of thing.</P>
      <P>Some time ago a bank manager knew the account holders and knew they had started small.  He saw how they were managing and how they intended to go a bit further.  When they went into talk to the bank manager, he had their track record and he would give the go ahead and lend them more money.  We have to do something to replace the friendly bank manager who is no longer there.  Banking is computerised.  I do not think computerisation is as good for the country as we were led to believe it would be because it has done away with individuality. Individualism has to be retained. The good thing about co-operative business is that it helps to keep the community together.  It also keeps individualism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good co-operative is a focal point and a talking point.  It is a centre where people congregate and where work is done.  I would like to see some more flexible way in which we could replace <Col N="1608" /> the bank man.  I am not so sure that funding at present is as easy as it was 15 or 20 years ago.  It certainly is not.  There is too much book work.  Very often a good worker, a man with good ideas, is not a good book-keeper.  If he was, he would not be a good craftsman.  He may decide to set up a business or to set up a co-operative with two or three of his colleagues.  The fact that they had to get accounts and figures discourages them. They are knocked out at the first hurdle.</P>
    <P>The county development teams would be very good men to help people starting because they would start them off small and they would know their capabilities. The county development officer could play a large and important role in trying to help worker co-operatives get their business off the ground.  The whole idea is to provide many services which we need in our society.  He could also play a very important role in stopping imports.  If we can stop imports we can create jobs at home.  If any society wishes to obtain private loans or raise more than £10,000 in share capital in any period of six months it must obtain the prior approval of the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  That is not the biggest problem. It was, but of late it is not.  Where do you go to get this £10,000 plus, other than a commercial bank?  I want to emphasise that we must do something to replace what we had when we could go and talk to a bank manager.  That is no longer possible or feasible.  Cashflow projections get too complicated for the ordinary person who is a good worker, a good craftsman, who is able to do a good job.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see that we are going to have an enterprise worker grant.  There will be a maximum grant of £17,500 available to community groups to employ a resource person for 12 months to advise and assist in the development of business ideas into job opportunities for young people.  That is certainly to be welcomed. It goes some way towards alleviating what I have been talking about.  How soon can you get this man?  You can only get him after you have started.  The problem is you need this man before starting <Col N="1609" /> because you can spent quite a bit of money in the early stages.  Auditors and accountants, while they are very good, cost money.  It has become very expensive to produce all this documentation.</P>
    <P>I have seen young fellows parting with their money and their documentation being sent away.  The documents come back but the bank does not think they are a good risk and the few bob they had is down the Swanee.  This is very important.  I have seen people losing the few pounds they had.  All they had left was a nice bound volume of documents. The pages in it are no good to pay the bills or to give to the bank manager.  We also get £10,000 towards the manager's salary and £2,000 towards marketing and development costs.  There is also a figure of £2,000 towards financial and administrative costs.  This is all available when the business is going.</P>
    <P>The vital point is that the friendly bank man who would help the lads in my village of Grange who have been very successful over the past ten years or so is no longer there.  There were definitely two of them in Sligo and they were real gentlemen. They would look at the enterprise and say: &ldquo;Right, we will fix you up&rdquo;.  Unfortunately, that day is gone.  Too much money is being spent on paper work before a start is made.  I would like to see some way in which finance could be made available.  It might be only £5,000 or £6,000 that was needed.  If there was some grant or assistance for the feasibility study before they start, whatever money the young men have would not be spent.</P>
    <P>Although co-operative banks are a feature of some European countries, co-operatives in Ireland are generally dependent on the commercial banks for their loan finances.  For many years we in the rural community have been advocating setting up farmers' banks, but that is a long story.  We never succeeded in getting special banks to facilitate farmers.  It is a great pity that we did not.  However, I do not see us getting co-operative banks as fast as that either.  We have to work with commercial banks.</P>
    <P>I keep coming back to the county development teams because I have wide <Col N="1610" /> experience of the great help and advice I got from them in setting up my little industrial estate in Grange.  Their budget is very limited indeed.  The young lad who has got his contract for the American market will get IDA assistance.  Everything will be laid on.  He is over the hill. When you get that far, our IDA services are super.  There is no question about it. I am talking about the position from the starting line until you get to where you have a bit of a track record.  The county development teams are the only body at present to assist you.  Their budget is far too small.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider giving a bigger budget to the county development teams and the county development officers.  They have created many jobs. They were the forerunners in the scheme and showed people how to get IDA grants.  The IDA claim the credit for all the factories they have set up.  We always hear of the ones that fall by the wayside. There are thousands of good factories which the IDA set up.  We must be fair about it.  In many cases it was our county development officer, with a shoestring budget, who set up people and enabled them to get a track record in order to qualify for IDA grants.</P>
    <P>In the interests of small business, I would like to see some latitude and some way, as I have said so many times, in which we could replace the friendly bank manager.  I am very pleased that there are grants available to employ management and to provide book-keeping expertise.  I would not like to be starting a business today.  I am not running much of mine now.  I have given it over to my son. When I was running a business you had only to worry about the bank man.  When you employed men you only stamped their cards.  I find today that to start to give employment involves a lot of administration. Something should be done.  I have said this on many occasions.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we could replace PAYE and PRSI with some simpler system of stamping the card, even if the card cost £20 or £25 per week.  At least when you took on a man years ago you knew about your rights.  Now, if you want to employ a <Col N="1611" /> man, even for a short term, you just cannot do it.  Many people will not do it. They leave a job undone or, unfortunately, go to the black economy because to employ a man is such a big job.  Just as an employer, I must get a registration number, PRSI and PAYE numbers.  Then you have to fill up all those forms.  The man who is getting the job says it is too much like work to get back on the system again.</P>
    <P>We should find some way of getting back to the old system.  It would be easier for people, for the first four or five years if there was some way in which they could pay a certain amount for every man.  It could be paid by stamp or some other system.  Indeed, such a system would be more reliable.  In the days when you stamped a card for a man, he could not get his unemployment assistance unless his card was stamped up to date.  The employer had to stamp the card and hand it to him, duly stamped, before he left his employment.  Today, an employee does not know whether his PAYE is paid or not paid.  He does not know whether his PRSI is paid or not paid.  Nothing may be paid.  If the stamped card system was still in existence, even if it cost as much as PAYE and PRSI does together it would be better.  The employee, when he finished, knew whether his card was up to date or not.  The Government would get more revenue out of this system.  It would be much simpler than the present one.</P>
    <P>We should have a good look at that end of the business for small industry and, indeed, big industries.  It would go a long way to help to create employment. Our present system is very restrictive.  It is very difficult for people to set up an enterprise, with all the necessary book-keeping and administration costs.  I welcome the whole thrust of this.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to say that they are going to amalgamate many of the agencies.  We have far too many bodies in this country which are duplicating one another.  I have often said so.  I am delighted the Minister is deciding to do something in that regard.  I was indeed <Col N="1612" /> critical the other day at a county council meeting of our social employment scheme, which is an excellent scheme. We all said so from the day it was first initiated.  It is bedevilled by the fact that we have Manpower &mdash; with all due respect to them &mdash; operating it.  It is ridiculous that if you want a couple of men to do a bit of environmental work for the county council or something like that which is second nature to them, they have to dress up and take the bus into the local town, sit in a queue and be interviewed for that job.  It does not make sense.</P>
    <P>In the old days when the county councils had a job they said to the local ganger: &ldquo;Get five or six men for this job.&rdquo;  Such social employment schemes should be operated directly by the local authorities. There would be more people involved in getting work.  The present system is not sensible at all where we have working men approaching Manpower in order to get a job cutting hedges, clipping grass, setting flowers or some of those ordinary run of the mill jobs.  The county council are wasting time writing to Manpower about them.  Manpower then write to the Labour Exchange.  The Labour Exchange write out and get a list of names and pass that back to Manpower.  Manpower then write out to those who have to come in for an interview.  The men come in for interview.  Manpower then write back to the county council and say: &ldquo;A, B, C and D are suitable.&rdquo; Look at the administration costs involved in order to get a few men to cut weeds, cut hedges along the road, clean up a graveyard or some ancient monument.</P>
    <P>The amount of administration work is beyond me.  I can never understand why that scheme cannot come directly to the local authorities and let the county engineers say to a local ganger: &ldquo;Right, we are going to do that little project at whatever little village it is; see if you can get five or six men, because we have six months' work for them&rdquo;.  I am sure the local ganger would have five or six men on that job the following Monday morning. There would not be as much money in it for An Post.  Are we in the business of keeping An Post in jobs, or are we trying <Col N="1613" /> to run the system in the best way, give as much employment as we can get the best returns we can?  I would like to see something along that line.</P>
    <P>I have already welcomed the manager's salary and the grant towards marketing development costs.  That is a very good thing, but £2,000 towards market development is a rather small amount. Marketing development is a fairly big job and £2,000 goes a very small way.  If £7,000 was given towards the manager's salary and £5,000 towards marketing development it might be a better division. I ask the Minister to have a look at that because marketing development is very important.  I welcome the grant towards administration costs.  As I have already said, administration costs are high.  What is the cost of the paperwork in this country compared to 20 years ago?  The amount of paperwork we all get, never read or could not possibly read is enormous. We are gone mad on literature and administration.  We will all have to take a hard look and see where can we cut down on administration costs.  While we have it, we have to put up with it, and deal with it.  I am delighted that there is a recommendation here to give £2,000 towards that.  It is definitely very welcome.</P>
    <P>I certainly welcome the report.  I look forward to its implementation.  I would like to see the county development officers involved in this.  I have great admiration and respect for them.  I know their work because I worked with them for ten or 15 years.  I know the amount of work they have done and the knowledge they have.  They should be involved in the creation of jobs and in the formation of small industries for workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackDaly" hpid="Mr. J. Daly Mr. J. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to appeal to the Minister regarding what Senator Kelleher said at the outset about reforming this committee.  We welcome the Senator's comments and congratulations on the work of this committee of which I happen to have the honour and privilege to be a member.  This Government, when forming the new committees, omitted the committee dealing with small businesses. <Col N="1614" /> I asked the Leader of the House, Senator Lanigan, what was going to happen about the small businesses committee.  Why was it left out?  He assured me that day that they were forming six committees, and others would follow.  Subsequently, I again asked Senator Lanigan, and I reminded him of the day he promised that this committee would be set up.  He said he gave no such promise.  He was only taking note of it.  I appeal now to the Minister to use his influence with the Government to try to get this committee going again because it was a very important one.</P>
      <P>Senator Farrell referred to the question of finance and spoke about friendly bank managers.  There must be something in the air in County Sligo &mdash; and the Minister is not too far away from there &mdash; that created a certain species that we do not have in my part of the country.  As regards the friendly bank manager he seemed to suggest that all you have to do is go in and talk nicely to him and you will come home with what you asked for. That is an Utopia, which in my lifetime in my small business, I never succeeded in finding.  What I got was by way of blood, sweat and tears.  Senator Farrell now admits that the Utopian bank manager has become a diminishing species. He said that such men are not there any more.  He appealed to the Minister to find some way of financing these industries.</P>
      <P>I should like to suggest to the Minister &mdash; in helping Senator Farrell's cause, which is a good one &mdash; that there is a simple solution to the problem.  The solution is to get the credit unions into the business of financing businesses.  At the outset the Minister spoke about investing capital in businesses which would be free of tax.  This is a good thing provided the business is going to succeed.  Can a company invest in another company?  I expect it is only a private person who could invest his money in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had industries which, when the late Seán Lemass set them up, were successful. You heard nothing about an industry that was successful but there was a hue and cry when one of them failed. Everyone knows that in this life you win <Col N="1615" /> some and you lose some.  The good ones would counter the ones that were unlucky and failed.</P>
    <P>New capital finance, as required to foster co-ops, as Senator Farrell mentioned, should be provided by the credit unions with the necessary tax incentives. Overall, this whole area is in the embryonic stages.  Senator Farrell referred to the fact that there are too many agencies and bodies.  I agree with this.  I would like to see a new Bill redefining the co-ops which are currently in limbo.  The Minister is aware that the present Act dates back to 1893.  It is time it was renewed.</P>
    <P>I should like to see small, single, grant-giving bodies with consultancy services within the Irish Productivity Centre, instead of the Youth Employment Agency.  I should also like to see grants given for the recruitment of managers, that is, professional managers.  Bad management has been a big weakness in the co-ops and, indeed, in other companies. Bad management has caused the collapse of a good many companies, as well as of co-ops.  In other countries such as Spain &mdash; and this was referred to by Senator Kelleher &mdash; there was a movement which was successful in creating jobs.  We should take a leaf out of their book.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell also spoke about the amount of paper work today and said that nothing like that was seen 20 years ago.  He said that a lot of people had not got time to read all this literature and that they were not interested in reading it.  The anti-litter Bill was brought in recently.  More notice should be taken of this in Departments.  A lot of literature goes into the wastepaper baskets.  I have seen this happen with my colleagues.  I am no different from them.  I do the same thing.  Letters come in.  You open the envelope; you know what it is; and you throw it into the wastepaper basket.  The cost of postage is enormous.  An Post are making fortune out of this.</P>
    <P>I live in Dublin 2 and my post is sent out.  I get an Order Paper for the Dáil and Dáil Questions down for Wednesday which arrive on Thursday.  I get an Order Paper for the Seanad the day after.  I do <Col N="1616" /> not know what the Post Office do or whether they are storing up post.  I agree with Senator Farrell that there is too much post and some of it is quite useless. We are trying to create savings in the economy.  I suggest that we start this at home.  Charity begins at home.  The number of documents issued should be monitored.  There is a simple way of going about this.  Instead of every Member of both Houses of the Oireachtas receiving a load of literature in the mornings &mdash; I know there are some Senators who would be interested in the Order Paper and in the Questions in the Dáil and that there are others who would have no interest in them &mdash; it could be left in the general inquiry office, or in the Dáil office.  Once each Member knew it was there &mdash; or any one was interested in particular literature &mdash; he or she could go in and get it.  This would save a lot of paper, postage and effort.</P>
    <P>This is what Senator Farrell was talking about.  The surprising thing about this is that in the age of the computer and the microchip there should be no need for half the paper work.  You can store information on microfilm.  You can store today in a small drawer that would have taken a whole room to store in years gone by. There is a good computer company in the Minister's home county.  It is called &ldquo;Digital&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That in view of the explicit statement from the Libyan Ambassador to France of his country's support for the IRA and the continuing interference by that country in the affairs of this island through the supply of deadly weapons to the IRA, Seanad Éireann calls upon the Government to convey to the Government of Libya the demand that it desist forthwith from its <Col N="1617" /> policy of interference in this country and failing such assurances to break diplomatic relations with that country forthwith.</P>
    <P>The first thing we must acknowledge and put on the record is that we are entirely against terrorism, no matter where it occurs or no matter what form it takes. This has been brought home forcibly to us in recent weeks by the seizure of a quantity of arms and ammunition off the coast of France.  Only the size and the estimated cost of the ammunition haul abroad the Panamanian registered trawler the <i>Eksund</i> has led anyone to doubt that this was yet another gun running effort by the Provisional IRA.</P>
    <P>The intelligence services have ample evidence at this stage of the IRA's tireless search for arms and explosives from Libya, America, the shady European dealers and, finally, back to our old friend Colonel Gadafi.  This arms haul of some 150 tonnes of weapons, explosives and ammunition is an enormous quantity for a terrorist organisation whose active service members is put at fewer than 300. There is one theory that the consignment was to be divided between a number of terrorist groups in Europe.  I submit that a more likely explanation is that it was to be stored in Ireland for use over a number of years.</P>
    <P>The Provisionals' need for more weapons has been intensified in recent times by the success of the US authorities in breaking Irish gun-running and by seizures by the Army and RUC.  Last year, 160 Soviet and German made assault rifles were discovered in the Irish Republic in boxes stamped &ldquo;Libyan armed forces&rdquo;.  Increasingly the IRA had to pass weapons around to carry out attacks.  The last rocket launcher captured by the security forces had been used for an operation in Belfast and a few weeks later in Derry.</P>
    <P>The IRA's greatest wish has been to acquire surface to air missiles, included in the <i>Eksund</i> catch, to attack police and army helicopters used for surveillance and ferrying supplies and troops.  If they did, the security forces would have to <Col N="1618" /> rethink their tactics.  In the find I am referring to, an estimated £20 million was the cost of the haul.  It also appeared to be beyond the financial capacity of an organisation which the security forces suspect need more than £2 million a year to run the type of military and political campaigns of the nature carried out by the IRA.  Recent evidence suggests that the Provisionals are short of cash.  The kidnapping events, particularly the kidnapping of Mr. John O'Grady, have brought it forcibly home to us that terrorist organisations will go to enormous lengths and use the most brutal tactics in order to achieve their ultimate aim of acquiring sufficient money to carry out whatever military and political campaigns they pursue, related to what they call a struggle in the North.</P>
    <P>It may be that the <i>Eksund</i> cargo was gift from Libya.  After all, its leader has twice in recent months expressed support for the Provisionals.  He had a strong motive for wishing revenge on Britain. However, the fact that the Provisionals' army council was willing to sanction such a hazardous venture, despite the recent history of failure, indicates both determination and desperation on behalf of the IRA to counteract the technically better equipped army and police.</P>
    <P>The Provisionals talk about a strategy for the next century designed to break Britain's will to remain in the North. They are aware of the dangers of war weariness infecting their supporters and disillusionment within the ranks.  We have had sporadic bombing offences and we even had the recent spectacle of two people being blown up in an attempt to carry out a bombing offence.  The real ambition seems to me to kill more British soldiers in the hope that this will hasten British withdrawal.  The weapons abroad the <i>Eksund</i> would have helped that ambition and certainly would have given tremendous heart to the terrorists.</P>
    <P>The operation carried out on behalf of the Provisional IRA by the <i>Eksund</i> should bring it forcibly home to us the international dimension of terrorist activity.  It should enforce the view that the Government have a tremendous <Col N="1619" /> responsibility in signing the European Convention on Suppression of Terrorism Act.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to an article that appeared in <i>The Irish Independent</i> on 6 November 1987 when the head of the French police anti-terrorist section, Mr. Alain Marsaud, said there was no doubt that four previous successful operations were carried out by the Provisional IRA. French police were certain that all five arms shipments between 1985 and this year had been gifts from Colonel Gadaffi and had been loaded at the military port of Tripoli.  The previous shipments are reputed to have involved a total of 150 tonnes of weapons and ammunition.</P>
    <P>The head of the police section also confirmed that the <i>Eksund</i> consignment had been loaded at Tripoli between October 13 and October 15.  We see that French intelligence, recently confirmed by Irish police intelligence, has confirmed that Libya was the source of this particular arms haul destined for this country by the very fact that a number of the people captured on that trawler were well known and high ranking officials of the IRA.  One of the people on board that trawler was reputed to be the IRA's logistics officer, Mr. Clery.  The Government have no option but to admit that this haul was destined for the IRA and that the supporting evidence which I have quoted is surely enough to substantiate the reason why the Libyans are in this particular event up to their eyeballs.  In fact, there was an admission by two crew members on the <i>Eksund</i> that the cargo was loaded in Tripoli.  This was despite denials by the Libyan Government.</P>
    <P>The reason for the immediate placing of a motion on the Seanad Order Paper by the Fine Gael Party was a statement issued by the Libyan Ambassador to France who stated:</P>
    <P>My country is quite open about its policies towards national liberation movements.</P>
    <P>We all know that Colonel Gadafi has declared his support for IRA activities in Northern Ireland on many occasions. <Col N="1620" /> Even in an interview with RTE some time ago, he declared openly his support for the terrorist activity and campaign of carnage being carried out against the British occupation of Northern Ireland. Therefore, Seanad Eireann cannot have any doubt about the efforts the Libyan regime will make to give military support to the IRA in their attempt to &ldquo;liberate Ireland from British occupation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is in this context that we must examine the seizure of the arms cargo on the Irish crewed <i>Eksund</i> off the coast of France recently.  The size of the arms find itself begs the question: how many events like the bombing massacre at Enniskillen could take place in Northern Ireland with the assistance of this sophisticated equipment? It should frighten all of us to contemplate the damage to property and human life this would have caused, carried out on behalf of all Irishmen.</P>
    <P>However, I have to question the sincerity of the Government and Fianna Fáil in their dealings with this event.  In a rushed attempt to distance the Government from Libyan involvement in the <i>Eksund</i> affair, the Minister for Industry and Commerce postponed, but did not cancel, a trade visit to Libya.  It demonstrates yet again, the ambivalence we can have and we are prepared to tolerate against international terrorism.  I submit that what is wrong now for the Government when they postpone this trade visit cannot be right at any time in the future.</P>
    <P>I regret to say that Fianna Fáil have often displayed their special relationship with Colonel Gadafi in the past.  The Taoiseach, made a number of visits to meet the Libyan leader in his tent to secure beef deals for Irish meat exporters.  I would like to take this opportunity to call on the Taoiseach to display his unique friendship with Colonel Gadafi yet again by asking Libya to desist forthwith from its policy of interference in this country and, if he fails to secure that assurance, immediately to break off diplomatic relations with that country.  It is very important for Ireland to show that it will not tolerate gun-running escapades which will lead eventually to the killing of innocent Irish people in our country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1621" /> The events in recent history show us that Libyan activity in international affairs goes further than their involvement in supporting the IRA.  The record of the Libyan Government on international terrorism, the number of incidents in relation to airline disruption, the bombing of a discotheque in West Berlin, and the number of Libyan students who have had to be expelled by various countries throughout Europe, bear testimony to the unease with which countries should view the Libyan Government under the regime of Colonel Gadafi.</P>
    <P>This all came to a head when the US drew the wrath of the Libyan Government by invading Libya two years ago. Whether or not we might agree with the sentiments behind that attack, I have no doubt that the debate which took place in this House at the time bore testimony to the fact that the US were taunted into making an attack on the Libyan Government. The Irish Government shared the concern of the United States about international terrorism at that time.  As a neutral country we had to be very careful about the crisis that developed in US and Libyan relations.  The tragic events of recent times indicate that Libyan activity could be increasing again in international spheres in order to heighten international tension once more.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs to take whatever intensive co-operative action he possibly can in the European Community in the struggle against terrorism and to ensure that the Libyan activity which brought about a huge find of arms will never again be allowed to recur.  We must put our country before party in dealing with international terrorism and we must demonstrate that we are forthright in resisting any attempt at the &ldquo;softly, softly&rdquo; approach we often have in this country to issues such as terrorism, particularly involving Libya.  If our beef barons have to suspend deals with Libya that is the price we must pay for the protection of our people.  We want to remove any ambivalence we may have in order to suppress any form of international terrorism that runs the risk of <Col N="1622" /> bringing arms into this country from a country that admits it supports the IRA and terrorism in an international sense.  I hope the Government will be happy to support the Fine Gael motion.</P>

      <P>Before I address the House on this matter may I just say that Fianna Fáil have no ambivalence in our attitude to terrorism.  We never have had and we never will have.  An attempt is being made here this evening to suggest that we are ambivalent in our attitude to terrorists.  We have always fought against terrorism.  Indeed, it was said at one stage that Fianna Fáil brought in more legislation to curb terrorism than any other Government did and we were criticised for that.</P>
      <P>The motion before us attempts to put the blame on Libya for many things that Libya has never done, and it has never been suggested by anyone outside of this country that Libya did.  We agree with the sense of outrage expressed by Senator Hogan here this evening that any country should seek to supply weapons of destruction to an organisation such as the IRA who are committed to a path of violence. We share that revulsion.  There is a sense of revulsion against anyone who attempts to bring arms in for use by the IRA or any other body, but it must be said &mdash; Senator Hogan mentioned the fact &mdash; that guns were found with the words &ldquo;Libyan armed forces&rdquo; on the boxes. Who is going to put &ldquo;Libyan armed forces&rdquo; in English on a box of arms going to a country in which English is not spoken except by very few.  If it were said that &ldquo;Libyan armed forces&rdquo; was written in Arabic, I might take the point made by Senator Hogan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could, in a sense, but we should not, equate the <i>Eksund</i> with what happened in Enniskillen.  On the news this evening the British Army officer in charge of security in the North, produced the actual type of bomb that was placed. A battery was produced and the name of <Col N="1623" /> the battery was plainly to be seen.  That battery was made in England.  Do we blame England for the bombing in Enniskillen? We do not.  The battery that was used in the bombing was made in England. It is a very well-known type of dry battery on sale here.  Do we stop the importation of these batteries into this country because that battery was used to detonate the bomb in Enniskillen?  It was proved that the bomb in Enniskillen was not accidentally set off.  It was deliberately set off.  The bomb could only have been set off deliberately by the perpetrators of that crime, and they used English material.  Do we condemn England for what happened in Enniskillen? If we do not, we should not condemn Libya&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The arms on board the <i>Eksund</i>, 120 tonnes, came from various countries with which we have diplomatic relations &mdash; eastern countries, western countries and also from some countries with which we do not have diplomatic relations.  Do we break off diplomatic relations with the suppliers of these arms? We all join with the Taoiseach in sending our gratitude and congratulations to the French authorities for their effective action in intercepting the <i>Eksund</i> and its deadly cargo.  It has to be said it was a deadly cargo.</P>
      <P>It is stated that possibly the amount of arms found on that boat would equal the amount of arms the Army have at their disposal.  The list of weapons read out by the Minister for Justice in the Dáil on 5 November was horrific and frightening and it takes no great imagination to envisage the extent of suffering such a number of weapons could cause had they successfully reached the hands of its intended recipients.  There is no proof as yet of where these arms came from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>The Sunday Times</i> of last Sunday week stated that the CIA, who do a monitoring service in Tripoli, showed that that boat <Col N="1624" /> may have been in Tripoli, but there is no proof yet.  We should wait for proof before we condemn anybody.</P>
    <P>I have seen the reports of the Libyan Ambassador's statement and I am aware of reports that indicate that even now the Libyan authorities insist on reiterating a position of moral support for the IRA while denying any connection with this shipment of arms.  Senators will be aware of similar statements by members of the Libyan leadership in the past, which in various ways implied a degree of encouragement and support for the aims and objectives of the IRA.  Indeed, they have come out in support of what they consider to be liberation movements throughout the world and it has to be seen in the context that they see the IRA as a liberation movement.  I do not agree with that position, but we have to suggest that that is their position.</P>
    <P>Senators will also be aware that successive Irish Governments have repeatedly sought to impress on the Libyan leadership that any expression of support for the IRA, from whatever source, was totally unacceptable to the people of Ireland.  Firm protests have been made on a number of occasions and it is clear beyond any doubt that the Libyan Government have been informed and are aware of the fundamental and principal position of successive Irish Governments in regard to the question of support for the IRA.</P>
    <P>There is a further dimension to this matter and one which Senators will also wish to take account of.  I refer to the coordinated approach amongst our partners in the Twelve in seeking to combat the menace of international terrorism.  This matter of international terrorism was addressed by Senator Hogan in his opening remarks.  Unfortunately, he fell into the trap of blaming Libya for many things that Libya were not involved in.  Of course, it is easy to find scapegoats when one looks for them.</P>
    <P>In 1986, the Twelve, in response to evidence of Libyan involvement in international terrorism, sought to bring home to Libya in a forceful and collective way the need on the part of states with which <Col N="1625" /> they conducted normal diplomatic relations to expressly and clearly renounce support for international terrorism. I subscribe to the wish of the Twelve in that.  The Twelve's position in this regard remains unchanged.  This is a further important element in our bilateral relationship with Libya and one which provides a wider context for the situation which now prevails with regard to the <i>Eksund.</i></P>
    <P>I share fully the widespread concern and public disquiet at the evidence that continued Libyan support for the IRA be reflected in our bilateral relationship with that country.  I have no doubt that this concern is also shared by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, and by members of the Government.  I also believe, however, that it is the clear duty of the Government in this instance to act in a measured and prudent way.  The Government are acting in a measured and prudent way in this instance, as they have been doing in every other instance over the past months.  It is often the people who shout most who do the least.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste will not be goaded into action where action might be precipitate and we might not, in the end, find out exactly where these arms came from or where they were going.  No doubt when the full facts are established the Government will give careful consideration to the best and most effective course of action open to them and one which will give full weight to the concern and widespread public indignation which this matter has given rise to.  In this situation the Fianna Fáil Government have never bowed to commercial pressure when it comes to our relationships with any country, whether it be Libya or anybody else.</P>
    <P>It is my view that our best interests will not be served by hasty ill-conceived action based on an incomplete version of the facts.  This is not &mdash; I hope no one would think otherwise &mdash; to be interpreted as in any way suggesting a lack of concern.  The unacceptability of providing support for the IRA has been made absolutely clear on several occasions.  Indeed, the Taoiseach, as <Col N="1626" /> Leader of the Opposition earlier this year, made it clear that he saw it as his duty to prevent support being given to the IRA from any source and in any form and that he would take any steps available to him to ensure this.  No one can be a friend of this State and at the same time be a friend of the IRA.  I stand over that statement.  Nobody can suggest that the Government would support the IRA.  We will not do it and we never have.  Ireland wishes to enjoy good relationships with the people of Libya.  It has to be said that the people of Libya are the people who have kept Colonel Gadafi in power.  He has been in power longer than any other leader, apart from Arafat, who has the full support of the PLO.  Arafat and Gadafi are the two longest serving leaders of their people in the Middle East.</P>

      <P>It proves the people of Libya support Gadafi.  I said we wish to enjoy good relations with the people of Libya but this is only possible on the basis of mutual respect and understanding.  In the light of the previous expressions of support for the IRA such respect and understanding has not been forthcoming from the Libyan leadership.  Without that reciprocity of respect there can be no productive relationship between our two countries.  I feel that the motion should not be before the Seanad.  That does not mean that we do not abhor any attempt to import arms to kill people in this country, but we have to be balanced and we have to wait until the full facts are known to us, not on the basis of rumour or innuendo but we must wait until we know the full facts.</P>
      <P>It has happened that a British ship with an Irish captain had arms which were going to the Middle East and that ship called at many European ports on the way.  Nobody knows where the arms were put on board but until such time as we find out where the arms were put on board we cannot fully support this motion.</P>

      <P>I listened with great interest to Senator Lanigan because obviously this side of the House were wondering what sort of amendment the Government would put down.  Of course, there was no amendment so it was very interesting to hear what he said.  It appears to me that what he offered by way of contribution was a whitewash of the Libyan involvement in the disastrous, tragic and appalling events which have sickened our people over the last number of weeks.</P>
      <P>I understand Senator Lanigan and I believe him when he states that he has an abhorrence and detestation and a total rejection of violence as it manifests itself in this country and around the world.  I respect that, but I venture to suggest that his attitude on this occasion is not unconnected with the fact that he is a prominent member of what I believe is called the Euro Arab League.  It is no secret that he has warm friendships, close connections with and indeed a warm regard for countries involved in the Euro Arab League.  That is all very well in its way, but I venture to suggest that his close involvement and his links in that area have somewhat clouded his judgment in relation to the motion before the House today.  If it is not going too far to suggest it, I suspect he may be somewhat prejudiced in regard to all of this.  He stated that the Government have never bowed to commercial pressure.  I want to know why my Government are not bowing to moral outrage because the Irish people have been morally outraged at what has happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend, during the course of my statement, to make the point that the links between what has happened and Libya are there, are patently obvious and should have been acted upon with strength, vigour and with commitment by a Government who were on the ball, to use a current phrase.  I and many people regret the pathetic reaction to the events. I am prompted to speak on this motion out of that same sense of moral outrage which I speak of and, indeed, a sense of utter and complete revulsion at the <Col N="1628" /> happenings which occurred in our country over the past few weeks.</P>
    <P>The whole population of the entire island were stunned into disbelief as the most horrific sequence of events unfolded.  In addition to expressing profound sympathy and condemnation, strong statements were made calling for an end to ambivalence, an end to double think, an end to the sneaking regarders, an end to the purveying of spurious republicanism and hatred, a multitude of words were spilled over into newsprint, spewed forth on radio and television along those lines.  What was required was action, and action of the kind we are talking about in this motion did not flow; there was a gap between thought, speech and action.  When those sort of breakdowns occur it is time to ask questions, and it is time to ask questions about ambivalence.</P>
    <P>It was a time of national crisis and it is still a time of national crisis.  It is a time, if ever there was a time, for the Government to give strong firm leadership and to repudiate utterly, and without ambivalence or equivocation, every aspect of the horrible crimes against humanity which it has been our deep misfortune to witness.  The events I speak of are the <i>Eksund</i> affair, or the capturing of the Libyan arms with all due respect to my colleague Senator Lanigan, the O'Grady kidnapping and the Enniskillen massacre. All these events have forced people in both parts of this island to confront a basic ambivalence towards violence which has been and still is prevalent in this country.  I regret to say that I found an ambivalence in the response of the Government and an ambivalence in the thesis put forward by Senator Lanigan on behalf of his party indicating why action was not taken on foot of the evidence. There was and there is a case to meet and, in my view, it has not been met.</P>
    <P>There has been a challenge to democracy and a very fundamental response from the Government is required.  So far it is my view that our Government have not measured up to the challenge posed by these awful, dreadful, appalling events.  Reaction to the <i>Eksund</i> affair, <Col N="1629" /> the interception by French police of arms from Libya destined for the IRA, has been extraordinarily muted in sharp contrast to the trumpeting of the special friendship between our Taoiseach while in Opposition and Colonel Gadafi.</P>
    <P>There was a time, of course, when it was politic to convey images of visits to the tent in the Libyan desert.  Whimsical vistas of the Arabian Knights were put before the Irish people and linkages which were profitable in terms of beef exports, live and on the hoof, were shown clearly to have been the consequence of this visit.  I am not obivious to the fact that in my city of Waterford beef on the hoof leaves our port and currently, as our port stands, is an important source of revenue.  Nevertheless, it is time now to talk about principle and to put principle before commerce.  I am not satisfied that the reactions of the Government have shown that principle in relation to Libya is what they are specifically and immediately concerned about.</P>
    <P>For quite some time now the Libyan leader Colonel Gadafi has been unequivocal in his support both moral and material for the IRA.  His political analysis of this country's affairs is wrong-headed and completely uninformed. Senator Lanigan referred to the fact that he would view the struggle going on in this country as being part of the great liberation struggle going on around the world.  Why were visits to the tents in Libya not used to inform the Colonel of the political facts and realities of life in this country?  I regard that as a failure, a gross failure on the part of Government knowing that this was the professed, explicit and expressed attitude of Colonel Gadafi.</P>
    <P>The wrong-headed analysis of the good Colonel of the political situation in this country has resulted in the shipment of more than 100 tonnes of weaponry into this country leaving a trail of havoc, death, injury and destruction in their wake.  One would have expected the Government on all the available evidence to have conveyed to the Government of Libya a demand that it desist forthwith, as this amendment says, from its policy <Col N="1630" /> of interference in this country and failing such assurances to break diplomatic relations with that country.</P>
    <P>Let us come to the evidence which Senator Lanigan in his speech on behalf of Fianna Fáil chose to feel was not sufficiently hard enough and therefore action could not follow as a consequence. I quote from an article in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i>, 15 November 1987, by Claudia Wright in Washington.  Ms. Wright states:</P>
    <P>Photographs taken by US intelligence services confirm that a vessel thought to be the gun-running boat <i>Eksund</i> was in the Libyan port of Tripoli shortly before it was intercepted by customs officials off the French coast.</P>
    <P>French security sources, who are questioning five Irishmen in connection with the arms haul, have also claimed that the guns came from Libya.</P>
    <P>Leaving batteries aside &mdash; I do not claim to be an expert on munitions &mdash; guns came from Libya.</P>
    <P>The US photographs formed part of routine surveillance of Libya.  The significance of the sighting of the <i>Eksund</i> in Tripoli was not realised until the French had intercepted the vessel. Only then an effort was made in Washington to trace the ship's course back to Libya.</P>
    <P>The US monitors the Mediterranean approaches to Libya and its airspace very carefully, using satellites and aerial patrols.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied enough with evidence that comes from that sophisticated surveillance which points to the fact that Libya had been connected with terrorism and the importation of arms and munitions into this country.  Given this evidence I would like to pose some questions as to what our Government did on foot of this evidence.  My colleague, Senator Hogan, has referred to it.  It leaves one breathless.  The Government merely postponed the trade delegation's visit.  It was not a cancellation, but a <Col N="1631" /> mere postponement.  I have since been informed that that delegation is going or has gone in a private capacity.  Certain questions must be asked.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State when he responds can confirm whether that delegation has gone there in a private capacity.  I hope he will tell us who is leading that delegation and inform us if any of the Irish taxpayers' money is involved in that exercise which, given all that has happened, is untimely and unsuitable, to say the least.  The postponement of that delegation's visit and the withdrawal of the Minister, Deputy Reynolds, was an inadequate response. It is patently just not good enough and does not reflect the views of the Irish people in the face of all that has happened. The decision to postpone the trade delegation was taken on Friday week last, 6 November, but extraordinarily, that decision was not announced when it was made.  It was kept secret; it was not bruited about for three days.</P>
    <P>I want to know why the secrecy, why the low key almost non-response in the face of the outrages, news of which at that stage was reverberating around the entire world?  At that time it had been clearly established by French sources and via the US Department of State that the arms discovered on board the <i>Eksund</i> were loaded in Tripoli.  We have the disturbing set-up of our Government which condemns violence and does not approve of Libyan arms shipments to the IRA, making their point by postponing the visit of a trade delegation.  This could rightly be called an ambivalent, equivocal response.  It is not strong, it is not swift, it is not principled, it is a non-response to events which have appalled the nation and the world.  We have seen naked barbarism, lawlessness, culminating in an act of genocide which has sickened and revolted our people.</P>
    <P>The Government's statement when it finally saw the light of day read as follows:</P>
    <P>In view of recent developments the Government has decided that the trade <Col N="1632" /> visit to Libya should not proceed at present.</P>
    <P>I do not know who was responsible for wording that statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what political thought went into that.  I do not know what human compassion or understanding or even basic intelligence went into the wording of such a communication. To call it low key is almost over-stating what it was.  Last year, after the US bombings of Tripoli, which I deplored at the time &mdash; nothing justifies naked aggression &mdash; Gadafi once again repeated his moral support for the Provisional IRA and despite two visits by the Irish Ambassador to Libya he refused to withdraw it.  The Coalition Government then reciprocated by issuing no further visas to Libyan students here.  It took a principled stand on foot of the attitude of Colonel Gadafi.  What does this Government do?  They postpone a trade delegation.</P>
      <P>I am aware that Libya is a valuable source of trade and that the balance in Ireland's favour was £29.5 million last year and £26.7 million this year.  I want the Minister of State, when replying, to assure me and the nation that no considerations of trade and commerce outweighed the moral outrage of these people and the consideration that a proper political response should have been made on foot of all that had occurred.</P>

      <P>The Fianna Fáil attitude to extradition now is completely different from what it was when in Opposition and when in power in the seventies.  What is the Fianna Fáil attitude to NORAID?  I have heard very little on it.  Perhaps if we get other Fianna Fáil speakers on this motion &mdash; which they seen to find extremely uncomfortable &mdash; they will <Col N="1635" /> explain to us what their attitude to NORAID is.  This is important and this is what the debate is about.  I put down this amendment not because I disapprove of the Fine Gael motion but because I do not think the Fine Gael motion is strong enough.  I thought the Fine Gael motion gave Fianna Fáil the sort of &ldquo;out&rdquo; they were looking for.  The Fine Gael motion calls upon the Government to convey to the Government of Libya the demand that it desist forthwith from its policy of interference in this country.</P>
      <P>Failing such assurances &mdash; I would not believe those assurances if I got them and I am not sure I would believe the Fianna Fáil Party if they told me they got them either &mdash; the honest thing for the Fianna Fáil Party to do on an issue like this, which they find acutely embarrassing, is immediately to cut and break off diplomatic relations with Libya.  I find no reason in Senator Lanigan's speech why this has not been done already.  I find nothing but excuses.  Senator Lanigan's speech did not answer one single question about the <i>Eksund.</i>  All it gave was a fair few excuses that it is not definite that it came from Libya.  That is the most extraordinary statement because it seems to be accepted throughout the international world that it came from Libya and for some reason it is not accepted here.  The reason it is not accepted here is that it is politically embarrassing for the Leader of Fianna Fáil to have to accept this because of his so-called &ldquo;friendship&rdquo; with Colonel Gadafi.  That is why I put down the amendment that the Taoiseach should repudiate all claims to friendship made by Colonel Gadafi.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is most important that the Leader of this country should not be seen to be having another love-in &mdash; which is what he had before &mdash; with the leader of a country who is sending arms to subvert not only Northern Ireland but probably this part of the country as well.  It is ridiculous that the Leader of this country, for some reason, seems frightened to condemn Colonel Gadafi because of some special relationship which he appears to <Col N="1636" /> have cultivated with him while he was in Opposition.</P>
    <P>It is important when these matters are being debated that this House should realise that the eyes of the world are looking at Ireland and its attitude to international terrorism.  It is amazing for any one outside Ireland &mdash; and I have talked to many of them in the past two or three months about these issues &mdash; to understand our attitude to terrorism.  It is impossible for them to understand the sort of legal niceties which are being provided as excuses for our attitude to the European Convention on terrorism and extradition at the moment.  Either we are not genuine about this &mdash; we are ambivalent about this and we are providing excuses &mdash; or we simply are not sensitive to world opinion which is not interested in this.  Gadafi is regarded as an international terrorist in this context at this stage.  Gadafi has proved, by his support for the killing of a policewoman in London, the disco bombing in Berlin and many other tragedies, that his support for international terrorism is unequivocal and unambiguous.  We may find this difficult and we may find this uncomfortable, but it is there and we should condemn it in the most concrete and obvious way.</P>
    <P>The reason we are not doing this is related to trade.  The reason, I presume, is meat and no other reason.  I presume that those who are making enormous sums of money out of the meat trade to Libya are not unconnected with the Fianna Fáil Party.  The pressures are purely financial and pecuniary ones.  We have got to ask ourselves what price are we prepared to pay for some sort of morality on this issue.  While we are prepared to export meat to Libya, the exchange for that is, apparently, that we are prepared to import terror.  That to me is completely unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I say this as one &mdash; and there are many others in the House &mdash; who was in the last Seanad.  In that last Seanad we passed an emergency motion condemning the American bombing of Libya.  We did this in a spirit of neutrality, in a spirit of what was morally right and morally wrong.  It <Col N="1637" /> was not in any way indicating support for what had provoked the bombing of Libya but that we are neutral in any military disputes between the US and Libya.  Our neutrality does not extend, as it appears here, to some sort of moral neutrality. We apparently are claiming &mdash; as neutrality was mentioned on the other side of the House &mdash; that in some way we are neutral as between right and wrong. What Colonel Gadafi is doing is quite obviously wrong.</P>
    <P>It is particularly important that the Taoiseach should condemn Colonel Gadafi because the Taoiseach, rightly or wrongly, is internationally portrayed as being soft on violent republicanism.  He has asked for this by his particular attitude and his particular friendship with Colonel Gadafi.  In this context it is important that he should make a personal condemnation of Colonel Gadafi and all his work, that he should cut his ties with him.  It is important that we are seen worldwide not to be ambiguous on terrorism and that we take other measures that are necessary in this area.  We should look again at Sinn Féin and decide whether we should proscribe Sinn Féin which is purely a mask for the IRA.  We should look again at those other organisations which money from Colonel Gadafi supports.  We should look again at Sinn Féin's shops and decide whether they should be banned.  We should look again at <i>An Poblacht</i> and whether it should be banned because all of these things contribute in a hideous way to the loss of life in Ireland.  We should look at section 31 with new eyes to see whether those who preach this sort of gospel should be allowed the freedom of the airwaves.</P>
    <P>I put this motion forward in a very disappointed fashion.  The Fianna Fáil Party have not shown any interest in it. Senator Lanigan said that he did not think it was something that should be debated in the Seanad.  This is the strongest possible condemnation of the failure of the Government to come clean on where these arms have come from because it is uncomfortable for them.</P>

Any examination of our pronouncements on legislation during the past few years will indicate that that is not true.  Furthermore, he used the words &ldquo;Fianna Fáil backwoodsmen&rdquo;.  I have never heard such bullshit talk in all my life.</P>

It is difficult for the Senators who were here to have that matter raised by somebody who was not here at that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I will remain within the confines of parliamentary language because I will have some harsh things to say.  Some of them will be about Colonel Gadafi and some of them will also have to be about the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>In being associated with this motion I am motivated by a strong feeling of revulsion against Colonel Gadafi.  I have been observing him since he took over from the medieval King of Libya, King Idris, about 15 years ago.  During the reign of this gadfly, Gadafi, in Libya, we have had 15 or more years of uninterrupted international terrorism. Colonel Gadafi is the doyen of international terrorism.  We have heard about his attacks on his neighbours.  He is not just an international terrorist; he also preys upon his neighbours, for example, Chad which is a peaceful ex-French colonial country beside Libya.  He has invaded northern Chad and his forces have gone close to N'djamena, the capital of Chad.  He has attempted to stir up internal insurgency in a number of his other neighbouring countries.</P>
      <P>In 1977 he launched a sadist crusade to march upon Egypt.  He went to the Egyptian border.  The then Egyptian leader, Anwar Sadat, who was the most moderate Arab in the Middle East at the time called Gadafi &mdash; and he was right in saying this &mdash; a madman.  Whether it is parliamentary or unparliamentary I have to say that I agree with the late Anwar Sadat's description of Colonel Gadafi.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know, and he even boasts about the fact, that he is the chief arms supplier to the Hezbullah who have carried out <Col N="1641" /> the most hideous crimes in Lebanon. They are the so-called party of God.  God help us.  He was the supplier of arms to the Black September who carried out that ferocious outrage at the Munich Olympic Games 15 years ago.  He was the supplier of arms, and he was glad to admit it, to the Baader-Meinhof gang who carried out many notorious outrages in Western Europe and, in particular, Germany, France and Holland.  His involvement in the outrages at Rome airport and Vienna airport immediately after the Christmas of 1985, is well known.</P>
    <P>Colonel Gadafi has said on many occasions that he supports the IRA.  He has said in at least one interview with an American magazine &mdash;<i>Newsweek</i> if I remember correctly &mdash; that he supplies them with arms.  Colonel Gadafi has said that publicly.  He said these things many years ago.  In the interim, the Taoiseach &mdash; and most of the time when Leader of the Opposition &mdash; has had this ongoing friendship with Colonel Gadafi.  He has made two visits to Libya where he met Colonel Gadafi.  Even after Gadafi had pronounced that he arms and supports the IRA the Leader of the Opposition, now Taoiseach, went to visit that man.</P>

      <P>The ambivalence of Deputy Haughey, the Taoiseach, towards this man, who has a reputation as an international terrorist, is &mdash; and I am sorry to have to say this because it is a shame to this country &mdash; utterly disgraceful. He should have come clean long ago and repudiated all his actions.  Two summers ago, we and the whole world saw &mdash; and Senator Ross referred to it &mdash; the shooting dead of a policewoman, Yvonne Fletcher, in broad daylight at <Col N="1642" /> Regent's Park in London, outside the so-called Libyans' &ldquo;People's&rdquo; Bureau.  She was shot from the window of the Libyan People's Bureau by a so-called diplomat of Colonel Gadafi.  That is the kind of thing that this &ldquo;friend&rdquo; of the Taoiseach engages in on the international stage.  It was also referred to by Senator Lanigan. Senator Lanigan's response to this debate here tonight was weak and pathetic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>His speech on behalf of the Government was full of lame excuses. He referred to a consignment of arms and tried &mdash; and this is what amazed me &mdash; to say that the consignment of arms found in this country last year did not come from Libya.  I would like to inform the House that those arms were discovered in County Roscommon about five miles from where I live.  There was every evidence that those arms came from Libya.  They were Russian arms of the type we well know are supplied by Russia to Libya.  In that consignment there was further evidence that they were issued to the Libyan Army.  Proof of that was evident from the Arabic writing on the consignment and nobody can contradict that.  All the evidence is overwhelmingly against this man Gadafi and his actions on the international stage.  Yet, we trade with him.  Yes President Reagan's famous attack on him last year was wrong.</P>
      <P>While there might be a certain feeling of support for it, it was wrong.  This House and the Fine Gael Party said it was wrong at the time and we still say it was wrong.  But two wrongs do not make a right &mdash; the greater wrong of Gadafi in the world and the terrible wrong of Gadafi in his actions in this country in supplying these arms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I condemn &mdash; and that is the word I must use &mdash; the Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins for what he said in the Dáil on this issue a week ago.  Pointedly, and it is in the Official Report, he never referred to the arms as coming from Libya.  He talked about them coming from a source in the Mediterranean.  Why did he not come straight out and tell us <Col N="1643" /> what we know and what the dogs in the street are barking, not only here but in every other country in the world: these arms originated in and came from Libya and they came here with the blessing of Colonel Gadafi.  That is a fact.</P>
    <P>He went on to say that possibly four other consignments came from that area in the past two years and that the Garda are investigating this but he was unwilling to go further than that.  Because he obviously knows more than he is telling us I call on him to come forward and let the Dáil and the country know what he knows about the four consignments that were supposed to have come here in the past four years and that were distributed apparently to the IRA, the INLA, or whoever.  He should come clean on these issues.  He should not hide behind this kind of diplomatic language about the Mediterranean area.  There is only one major international delinquent in that part of the world who happens to be the leader of a country and that is Gadafi. The Minister, Deputy Collins, should have the courage to stand up and say exactly who he is talking about.  Of course, he may have the tug on his sleeve of his Leader who does not want him to name his friend, Colonel Gadafi.</P>
    <P>With my party I call unequivocally for the severance of our diplomatic relations with Libya.  I understand that our Ambassador in Rome is accredited to Libya.  He should be told forthwith that his diplomatic mission and the carrying on of diplomatic relations with Libya are now terminated.  I am not sure exactly what diplomatic relations Libya has with this country or what kind of diplomatic representation it has.  Whether he is an ambassador, <i>chargé d'affaires</i>, or whatever, he should be told he is no longer welcome and if he lives in this country he should be told to go home.  If he lives in London or is accredited from London he should be told that we no longer wish to have diplomatic relations with his country.</P>
    <P>This is a moral question.  I have detailed what Gadafi's reputation is like on the international stage.  He has caused <Col N="1644" /> outrage after outrage all over the Middle East.  He has carried out hijackings, murderous attacks, suicide attacks in Lebannon and murderous attacks on innocent bystanders at Vienna and Rome Airports. This is the sort of enormously twisted, grotesque, international mischief this man engages in.  He does not engage in it in Ireland by arming terrorists here because he believes Ireland has some kind of a colonial problem but because of the twisted mischief of the man.  I am sorry if that sounds unparliamentary or undiplomatic, but sadly it is true.  He is not the first monster to be a leader on the world stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. S. Haughey Mr. S. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was appalled by Senator Ross's contribution to this debate.  I listened very carefully to his contribution on the monitor and I was appalled at what he said.  I felt personally insulted by his comments and I think he <Col N="1646" /> has insulted every democratically elected Member of this Oireachtas by what he said.  We all are concerned at the serious events which have taken place in this country over the past few weeks.  I understand his concern but I think he could have been more diplomatic.  I would like to put that on the record.</P>
      <P>I would like to take up Senator Lydon's point about the Fianna Fáil Party.  Fianna Fáil were founded in 1926 specifically to achieve a united Ireland by peaceful means.  The big break-up of the Sinn Féin party occurred at that time.  The people who went with Fianna Fáil were people who were committed to obtaining peace by peaceful means.  I suggest that Senator Ross should read again that period of Irish history so that he can see that that was the situation.  Eamon de Valera founded the Fianna Fáil Party because he wanted to achieve his aspirations by peaceful means.  I would say that Fianna Fáil are the only republican party who at present are committed to achieving their objectives by peaceful means.</P>
      <P>It is very important that we have a democratic, republican party who wish to achieve a united Ireland by peaceful means.  If Fianna Fáil were not in existence and did not take on that role, the only people who would be committed to achieving a united Ireland would be the IRA and that would be very serious.  I put it that Fianna Fáil are fulfilling a very important constitutional role by being a republican party who aim to achieve unity by peaceful means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully condemn, and I think every Member of this House would fully condemn, the outrage which occurred at Enniskillen.  I did not contribute to the debate on that matter last week but it goes without saying that every Member of the Oireachtas fully condemns that incident.  Every Member of the Oireachtas condemns violence of any sort and we must all be committed to achieving our objectives by peaceful means. Although I was not a Member of the last Seanad, I was pleased to hear from Senator Ross that the Seanad passed a <Col N="1647" /> motion condemning the bombing of Tripoli. This was a moral outrage.  I condemn the USA and Great Britain for their role in that incident.  It is absolutely appalling that such violent incidents should be used by governments.  I value human life and I am sure that everybody here values human life.  In that regard, I condemn also the horrific incident at Loughgall.  Anybody who values human life and peace must also condemn in the strongest possible terms the incident which occured at Loughgall earlier this year.</P>
    <P>I had not intended to speak in this debate so I had only a few points put together and those are the main ones.  I would also say, in a calm, rational way, that our trade with Libya is important and everybody acknowledges that.  The country has serious decisions to take in the light of recent events but we must have a sense of balance and our trade is important.  Of course, the gun salvage in France was absolutely horrific and the mind boggles at just how much arms were going to be imported into the country on that ship.</P>
    <P>We heard today that the number of arms on that ship, and on the other ships which are alleged to have come into the country, are more than what the Garda Síochána and Army have at their disposal. It is absolutely appalling and I congratulate the French authorities for their role in bringing to the notice of the country the arms found on that ship.</P>
    <P>We have to take calm, rational decisions.  The motion the Fine Gael Party put down this evening is not the best way to go about what we have to do.  We need to take decisions in a calm fashion.  We should not be rushed into decisions which will have major consequences for this country.  The way the Fine Gael Party are going about this is not the right way.  I hope the motion was not put down for sheer party political opportunistic reasons.</P>

      <P>I would like to say to Senator Haughey that it was with no vast political motivation that we brought this motion before the House.  It deals with a very serious matter and it is regretful that any party should have to bring a motion which deals with such an emotive and bloody issue before a House of the Oireachtas.  It is with regret that I have to speak on this motion but after the events of the last couple of weeks and the seizure of arms on the <i>Eksund</i> I think the time has come when we have to take a very tough stance with the people with whom we have diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>We listened emotionally to the speeches that we made in the House last week about the people who were killed in Enniskillen.  As an individual who lives very near Enniskillen I was very annoyed to learn that the bomb-making equipment that was found where the disaster took place was the same as that which was found by the French authorities on the ship <i>Eksund.</i>  That speaks volumes. We cannot go on accepting the fact that Libya, which is involved in international terrorism, is giving arms to the Provisional IRA.  We have to accept that the Provisional IRA are causing a lot of pain and strife, both physically and economically, in this country.</P>
      <P>I have lived in the Border area all my life and I know what it is like to see businesses falling away.  The people who are to blame for this are the ones who have kept this terrorism going.  The countries like Libya that try to ship armaments into this country are the ones that keep the terrorists armed.  This has to stop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The town of Ballinamore is infamous for the shoot-out that took place there in a kidnapping case.  As a person from that town I feel strongly about that.  We know the pain and strife that the families in the latest kidnap case have suffered.  As an individual who lived in a town that was taken over by Garda and Army, where the people lived in fear for one solid <Col N="1649" /> week, I feel that if everybody experienced the type of fear the people of Leitrim and Ballinamore experienced, they would do everything in their power to make sure that that would never happen again.</P>
    <P>Our trade with Libya is important but there is no way we can put trade above human life.  I ask the Government to consider this seriously.  We all suffer during times of harsh economic realities but I would gladly suffer on if terrorism is removed from this country.  The one hope I have is that terrorism will be removed.  I come from County Leitrim and terrorism is a terrible fact of life that the people there have to live with every day.  As a public representative I have received threatening phone calls and letters. It is annoying to me and to my family.  I do not think any individual should have to experience this.</P>
    <P>If Colonel Gadafi in Libya is sending arms shipments which are encouraging acts of terrorism, I have to appeal to the Government to break off diplomatic relations with that country.  The Libyan Ambassador to France has stated:</P>
    <P>My country is quite open about its policies towards national liberation movements.</P>
    <P>Colonel Gadafi has declared his support for IRA activities in Northern Ireland on many occasions &mdash; even in an interview on RTE some time ago.  Therefore Seanad Éireann cannot have any doubt about the efforts which the Libyan regime will make to give military support to the IRA in their effort to liberate Ireland from British occupation.  When you have a representative of the Libyan Government stating that sort of policy, I feel we have to grasp the nettle to offset it.  If we have to lose economically, we must be prepared to do so.</P>

There was a sense of occasion about what was happening as many of them wore their uniforms.  I did not tell the people from Irish Shipping Limited that I was hoping to raise the matter this evening.  These people have had far too many false promises over the past three difficult years.  I do not want to raise their hopes this evening only to have them dashed once again.</P>
      <P>My position and the position of many others in my party on the closure of Irish Shipping Limited and its consequences are well known and on the record.  In my own case, it is on the record of the other House.  I have spoken at parliamentary party meetings.  I spoke with the then Taoiseach and the then Minister on this subject, and I spoke with the people concerned. I accepted the commercial inevitability of the decision taken.  I regretted the decision.  I cursed the mismanagement and the squandering which brought it about and which led to the winding up of one of our great semi-State bodies and to the waste of the tremendous talent, dedication and service of these people.</P>
      <P>I also felt at the time &mdash; and I said so then &mdash; that a great injustice had been visited on these people.  I argued then for cothrom na féinne and for basic justice for the people affected.  I argued for a fair deal for these people.  I was not successful and one of the great regrets of my past number of years in politics is that I and those who felt like me on this issue were not successful in getting the type of justice which we felt these people were entitled to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1651" /> What I want to do here this evening in the short time available to me is to ask the Fianna Fáil Government to do what that party promised they would do in Opposition, what they promised specifically would be done and should be done to bring about justice.  This is not like many of the other promises which preceded the election which were, in a sense, global promises affecting hundreds of thousands of people.  These promises were made to specific, named people, people who had got to know their public representatives at a personal level, people who had a right to expect that Fianna Fáil in office would honour this promise.</P>
    <P>Let me quote from the debate on a Private Members' Motion in Dáil Éireann on 25 and 26 June 1985 as reported in the Official Report.</P>

      <P>I am sorry.  You may not quote directly from debates in the other House.  However, you can make points from them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I will quote points from speeches made in the other House.  Let me refer to what the then Deputy Brennan, now Minister of State, said.  The reference is Volume 359, column 2166. Deputy Brennan argued &mdash; and I presume it is in order to give an indirect account &mdash; that the Government should do the decent thing and respond to the appeal of Deputies Bertie Ahern and John Wilson to pay the compensation required to their own employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brennan said the Minister could not introduce a Bill in the other House, as he was proposing to do, to weed out rogue directors and to weed out directors who ran away from their responsibilities while the Minister and his Government ran away from their responsibilities in that regard.  Deputy Brennan made a strong, impassioned appeal to the Minister to listen to the Fianna Fáil point of view and to compensate the people involved who were employees of the State.  Deputy Brennan claimed that these people had served us all proudly for many years.  He ended his <Col N="1652" /> speech by appealing to the Minister to live up to his responsibilities and pay these Irish public servants the funds due to them.</P>
    <P>I know now that the Minister, Deputy Brennan, is busy but we have not heard him make his point of view known since the change of Government.  At the same time another prominent member of the Opposition, who is now a prominent and effective Minister in Government &mdash; Deputy Albert Reynolds &mdash; made a number of important points.  He assured the House &mdash; at column 2182 &mdash; that, if the Government wanted to solve this problem they should bring in the necessary legislation.  He guaranteed the full backing of the Fianna Fáil Party.  He said that, if the Government wished to reconstitute an Irish shipping company, they should &ldquo;forget about another committee which will go on talking until the Government are talked out of power&rdquo;.  He stated, and this quotation must come directly from the debate:</P>
    <P>... leave the matter for the Fianna Fáil Government who are already committed to reconstituting a shipping company.</P>
    <P>In winding up that debate, in which 65 Fianna Fáil Deputies voted, Deputy Reynolds, as the official spokesman for the party, argued that &ldquo;Fine Gael should try to stop betting each way&rdquo;.  He said that if the Government had any humanity they would see that the principles of justice were applied.  He told the Minister he would make a name for himself by standing on his own feet and he hoped that the principles in this case of firmness, equity and justice for the ordinary people would apply.</P>
    <P>I can say no more than that.  All I ask is that the Minister of State here tonight will ensure that the principles of firmness, equity and justice &mdash; promised by Deputy Reynolds on the evening of 26 June 1985 in the interests of the employees of Irish Shipping Limited &mdash; will be applied in a practical manner to ensure justice for these people.  In an aside, and it may be prophetic, in that same debate Deputy Reynolds accused the Government of <Col N="1653" /> wanting to start a fashion of getting rid of semi-State bodies.  This is something which the employees of the National Social Service Board, An Foras Forbartha, the Health Education Bureau and many others may find a rather hollow ring to at present.</P>
    <P>The principal speaker for the Fianna Fáil Party in that debate of 26 June 1985 was Deputy John Wilson who was then the shadow spokesman on this portfolio. He spoke eloquently, as he is able to do, and he argued on the motion in the name of the Fianna Fáil Party that Dáil Éireann, in view of the loyal service given by employees of Irish Shipping to the people of Ireland, calls on the Government to pay adequate compensation to the staff of Irish Shipping of six weeks salary per year of service and restore the pensions of all former Irish Shipping staff to their pre-liquidation level.</P>
    <P>That was the Fianna Fáil position in June 1985.  Deputy Wilson made it very clear that his purpose in putting down this motion was to try to change the Government's attitude to the treatment of the employees of Irish Shipping.  He made it very clear that the Fianna Fáil side of the House recognised the importance of Irish Shipping.  I will quote from the Official Report, at column 1864:</P>
    <P>... our commitment to the Irish Shipping workers &mdash; judging by the deaf ears upon which our words have fallen now, the Fianna Fáil Party seem to be the only channel through which the workers' grievances can be channelled and discussed openly with a view to changing Government policy.</P>
    <P>Is this still the case?</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson had decided that the claim being made by the workers in Irish Shipping was a fair and just claim.  If it was fair then, surely it is even fairer now, given the three years of deprivation and suffering these people have had to endure.  He attacked the Government for not acting.  He asked was it because of financial sensitivities and he said that these words take the biscuit.  He dismissed any question of financial sensitivities out of hand.  He then came to <Col N="1654" /> what I think was the nub of the difficulties in 1985.  I never agreed with the arguments that were put forward, nor did Deputy Wilson.  He said, at column 1865:</P>
    <P>There were also legal sensitivities. That gets under my skin totally.  This is the House that deals with legislation. Here is the place where a Bill could be brought in to nurture the sensitivities or wipe out the sensitivities or get rid of or whatever we have to do with these legal sensitivities.  This is the House that could do it.</P>
    <P>I submit that the Dáil, the other House and this House are the Houses where this can still be done.  If the promises made in 1985 were genuine, if the arguments behind them were valid then, surely they are equally valid tonight.</P>
    <P>I have deliberately played down this debate.  I have not, as was always the case in the past, invited in the spokespeople for Irish Shipping.  I did not tell them this debate was on.  I welcome the opportunity to put their case, made by the Fianna Fáil official spokesman of three years ago, to the Minister here this evening. Have they become more of the forgotten people?  Is there any sense of fairness or justice for these people, even at this late stage, when a promise was made to them in the solemnity of Leinster House, backed by the solemn commitment of the main Opposition party and put to the test of a vote after a six-hour debate over two days in that House, a vote in which virtually all Members of the other House took part?  That was the solemnity of the occasion.  That was the seriousness of the commitment of the then Opposition party.  However solemn or serious, the fact is that the misery and the suffering of these people still remain. All I ask this evening is that the Minister tell us what his Government propose to do for the former employees of Irish Shipping and to tell us, yea or nay, if the promises given so solemnly in Opposition have any hope of being honoured.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the fact that this debate on Irish Shipping is taking place in a very cool atmosphere.  I would like to begin by assuring the House that I share fully the concern which has been expressed for the employees of Irish Shipping Limited and the situation in which they find themselves as a result of the liquidation of the company.</P>
      <P>It is now just over three years since the liquidator was appointed to Irish Shipping Limited by order of the High Court. I do not propose to dwell upon the circumstances surrounding that regrettable occurrence, nor enter into academic dispute regarding the then Government's decision to allow the liquidation to proceed. Certainly there were serious errors of judgment by the management of the company, as referred to by Senator Manning, and an almost total lack of accountability to the Minister for Finance as shareholder during the period in which the commercially disastrous leasing commitments were undertaken.  It is truly unfortunate that these decisions, taken by the few, should have so severely affected the livelihoods of so many people who had given long and loyal service to the company.</P>
      <P>The liquidation of Irish Shipping considerably depleted our registered national shipping fleet.  It was in an effort to address this serious problem that the Government recently introduced the Shipping Investment Grants Bill which passed all Stages in this House last week. That measure must be seen as part of this Government's commitment to the enlargement of the national fleet and the improvement of the job prospects of all Irish seafarers, including those who lost their jobs in Irish Shipping Limited.  Let us link to the shipping investment grants scheme the two incentives provided for under the Finance Act of 1987: the acceptance of shipping, as a designated industry resulting in the reduction of corporation tax from 50 per cent to 10 per cent and the opening of the business expansion scheme for shipping payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot, however, turn back the <Col N="1656" /> clock.  Present realities must be faced however painful they may prove to be. Irish Shipping Limited at liquidation owed substantial amounts to their creditors and it is clear that their liabilities far exceed their assets.  In such a situation the question of providing extra-statutory or <i>ex gratia</i> compensation to the former employees of the company raises complex and sensitive issues of a legal nature, the implications of which cannot be ignored.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the recent debate in the Dáil when the former Minister for Communications, Deputy Jim Mitchell, in the debates on Irish Shipping and the Shipping Investment Grants Bill, said he had even gone outside the Government's legal advisers to see what could be done in overcoming the legal constraints in the Irish Shipping Limited case.  He consulted senior counsel but established that there was no way that this could now be altered.</P>
    <P>In repudiating responsibility for the debts owed to unsecured creditors, an important precedent was set which severely restricted and continues to restrict the scope for action in relation to extra-statutory or <i>ex gratia</i> compensation.</P>
    <P>On 25 September last, together with the Minister for Labour, the Minister, Deputy Daly met with representatives of Irish Shipping workers.  At that meeting it was explained that the Government had inherited a difficult and complex legal situation which inhibited their taking any action in the matter.  The reasons which prevented the payment of compensation were also explained.  As I indicated earlier, these related to the question of the State's responsibility in the matter of the company's unsecured creditors.  While I do not propose to put a definite figure on these liabilities they are of an order which would have the gravest implications for the Exchequer should they fall to be discharged either partially or wholly from that source.  Nevertheless, the Minister, Deputy Daly, undertook to have the legal difficulties reviewed again and that review is proceeding.</P>
    <P>Each and every option open to us is <Col N="1657" /> being carefully assessed in terms of the legal implications involved.  Senators will appreciate that while the matter remains unresolved it would be inappropriate, if not misleading both to the House and to the employees concerned, to speculate upon the outcome of the review.  I do not want to raise hopes which it may not be possible to fulfil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's bleak and very unhopeful reply flies directly in the face of every solemn promise that his party made in that debate.  Having said that, I urge the Minister to do his very best to see that what can be done will be done.  But I urge him also not to hide the truth from these people.  They have suffered enough for too long.  If there is no way in which the State will be able to do what justice says should be done, for God's sake, do not go on keeping these people in suspense.  Do not give them false hopes.  Admit that what was said in 1985 had no substance and at least take away from them any false hope that they will get justice.</P>

      <P>I would like to point out that the Minister, Deputy Daly, and the Minister for Labour, Deputy Bertie Ahern, met with these people on 25 September. I have indicated to the House and to Senator Manning, in particular, that every avenue will be explored.  I certainly appreciate that we cannot go on and that in the short term we must try to come up either with a solution or indicate the precise position to these people.  I would like to put on record that in <i>The Irish Times</i> it was quoted recently that &ldquo;unsecured creditors&rdquo; were due in the region of £205 million.  If the State had to accept liability for such a sum, the financial implications would be very serious.  We are talking about large sums of money.  I share the deep concern expressed by Senator Manning for the individuals concerned.  As I have said, every avenue will be explored and I hope that we will not delay a decision whether it be favourable or otherwise.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 19 November 1987.</P>
