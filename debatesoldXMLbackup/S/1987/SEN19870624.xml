      <P>I have notice from Senator Nuala Fennell that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matters:</P>
      <P>1.  The recent savage cuts by the Department of Health to Hume Street Hospital which will mean the termination of their vital day care treatment for thousands of psoriasis sufferers &mdash; and closing from the end of June of the women's screening clinic, and</P>
      <P>2.  The serious implications involved in the decision to end direct availability for GP's of free testing of specimens for sexually transmitted disease at St. James's Hospital, which has been available since 1971.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator John Connor of the following matters:</P>
      <P>1.  To ask the Minister for Education the present position regarding the construction of a new primary school at Frenchpark, County Roscommon, and</P>
      <P>2.  To ask the Minister for Health if he will reject the proposal of the Western Health Board to reduce the size and range of services at the County Hospital in Roscommon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1186" /> I also received notice from Senator Brian O'Shea of the following matter:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Transport to outline his proposals in relation to the provision of capital grants for the development of Waterford Airport.</P>
    <P>I regard all the matters as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Fennell's motion regarding Hume Street Hospital and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. Senators Fennell, O'Connor and O'Shea may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>
    <P>I want to thank Senator Fennell because her matter was ordered for the Adjournment last week and she very kindly gave way because somebody was unavailable.</P>

      <P>I wonder if I could raise a matter which I think it is appropriate to raise at this stage.  It concerns the ceiling of the Seanad Chamber next door.  A number of individuals and one particular group have expressed concern to me because it appears that the entire ceiling next door which, as Senators are aware, is a magnificent ceiling, is at risk of being destroyed in the construction work.  As the House is aware, this is a ceiling of James Wyatt done before 1780 and it is the finest example of his work in Dublin and, I think, in Ireland.  The problem is on one portion on the north wall side.  It is a very serious problem as the House knows.  The reason I am raising it in this way is that that part of the ceiling, less than one-third, has already had to come down because of the construction work.  Casts have been made with a view to reassembling it and keeping its original appearance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>My concern &mdash; and I believe it is sufficiently important to be a publicly voiced concern and I hope a concern all Members of the House would share &mdash; is that the Office of Public Works have a very good reputation for preserving original ceilings but they may feel under pressure, even from Senators.  We want the work to be completed as quickly as possible but it appears that a decision has now been taken to remove the entire original ceiling and there are a number of groups, for example, An Taisce and various conservation bodies, who believe that is not necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for this House.  I was going to ask you to ascertain the position because I am gravely concerned and I know that others are.  The Irish Architectural Archive have had experts examine it and they are very concerned about it and they believe it is not necessary that the ceiling should be destroyed.</P>

As I understand it, they have a very good reputation.  I am concerned that they might feel under pressure that has been expressed in the House about the problems of location for the Seanad in the short term.</P>

      <P>It is intended that today we will take Items Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 &mdash; if there is to be a debate on any of those items I suggest we should take the discussion in a broad sense and discuss the whole five together &mdash; Item No. 6, the Finance Bill, and the remaining part of the Fianna Fáil motion, No. 7.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Leader of the House through you, a Chathaoirligh, how much time is it proposed to allocate to the Finance Bill and <Col N="1189" /> when can we expect the Adoption Bill to be introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Leader of the House about the status of No. 39 on the Order Paper which has been put down in the past week.  It is a motion in the name of Senator Paschal Mooney and other Fianna Fáil Senators and the signature of the Leader of the House is noticeably lacking.  Is this a Fianna Fáil motion, or does it indicate that the Government are back-sliding on the issue of extradition, or is it a freelance effort on the part of Senator Mooney?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended to take the Finance Bill until 6.30 p.m. and to take the motion from 6.30 p.m. to 8 o'clock, with no break this afternoon.  Tomorrow we intend to take the Second Stage of the Finance Bill all day and to continue it, if possible, tomorrow evening.  I am not giving any guarantees as to what time we will finish tomorrow evening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can asure Senator Ryan that we will be here tomorrow.  There will be no curtailment of time, within reason, on the Finance Bill.  On the question raised by Senator Ross about Item No. 39, the motion in the names of a number of Government Senators, the fact that my name does not appear on that motion has no political or any other significance. I just did not happen to be around when the motion was put down.  If the Senator cares to go back to the record of when that Bill went through the Seanad, he will see that the sentiments expressed in that motion are the exact sentiments expressed by me during the debate on that Bill.</P>
      <P>There will be a need for a Committee of Selection to meet today to discuss the selection of people for the committees which will be set up as a result of today's debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Leader of the House proposed that we should discuss all five motions together.  I was not here when these items were first raised but I note that there is no reference so far to a Joint Committee on Development Co-operation. Does the Leader of the House know if it is intended that there should be a Joint Committee on Development Co-operation?  I find it rather peculiar that it is omitted from the list.  Is it a delay, a decision, or a postponement?  It is extraordinary that so many of the other committees are being set up and a <Col N="1193" /> committee on development co-operation is not so far referred to.  There seems to be a lot of uncertainty about it and perhaps the Leader of the House could clear it up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no uncertainty at all.  We discussed this matter last week. There are five committees before the House.  If Senator Ryan had been in the House when this matter was discussed he would know that various Members mentioned that committee and a committee on small businesses.  Various pleas were made for other committees to be formed.  We are here today to discuss the five motions before us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I participated in the debate last week, a Chathaoirligh, but I would like to make a plea which I hope the Leader of the House will accept in the spirit in which it is made.  It is that a Joint Committee on the EC Secondary Legislation will be established at the earliest opportunity.  I appreciate that there is to be a selection committee meeting but the Leader of the House as a former member of that committee and Senator Manning are aware that there is a very serious backlog at the moment.  We must be concerned.  Some of this was expressed during the referendum debate on the Single European Act.  There are very serious proposals with very far-reaching implications for this country that are getting no parliamentary scrutiny at all.  It is important that that committee should get together and do a sizeable amount of work before the inevitable summer adjournment during August.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I subscribe to the ideas put forward by Senator Robinson.  I can guarantee that these motions are before us here today so that we can get these committees going.  There will be no delay in the re-formation of the committee on secondary legislation and, indeed, I can guarantee that they will meet within the next week or so once the actual committees are formed, once we get through the formalities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am really repeating a question because the answer was not quite clear.  Do we have a definite list of what further committees are to be set up because it is relevant to the Committee of Selection who are meeting today whether we are to have a committee on legislation and a committee on development aid and who will be sitting from the various groups on various committees?  I am not expressing a preference but I am asking what further committees will be coming before this House within the next few months.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Finance Bill provides a statutory basis for the taxation provisions which were announced in the 1987 budget.  It also contains a number of other taxation proposals to improve the operation of the system and eliminate abuses.  Some of the proposals in this Bill have major significance for the development of sectors of the economy.  Before summarising individual aspects of the Bill, I would like to speak briefly on recent financial and economic developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we took over the reins of Government last March, we inherited huge economic and financial problems. There was no possibility of short-term solutions to these problems; equally, it was of critical importance that we should take immediate steps, however unpopular, to arrest the decline.  The lack of confidence in the economy had been demonstrated clearly by the huge outflows of capital and if this trend were <Col N="1210" /> sustained, the economy would wither downwards to a very low ebb.  We had, therefore, to follow a twin strategy of immediate improvement in the public finances while at the same time focusing special attention on development areas to generate more economic activity and to open up new employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>We had no reasonable alternative and the great majority of the public support our approach despite the unwelcome consequences of the necessity to cut back on services.  People recognise that we had to change direction.  The scale of borrowing could not be sustained because the accumulating debt would absorb most of our resources.  The deteriorating financial situation was destroying confidence in the economy.  Potential investors were doubting our ability to face up to our problems.  Their concern is reflected in a fall off in investment, heavy outflows of capital and diminishing opportunities for employment.  This is a depressing catalogue and people generally welcome our determination to break out of this bind even if this involves sacrifices in the short term.</P>
    <P>It is still very early but already there are positive responses to our decisions. The focus of attention has been largely on the downside effects such as the cutbacks in the public service.  These are regrettable but unavoidable.  On the positive side, we have already seen a substantial downward movement in interest rates and we can look forward to a continuation of this trend.  It is of critical importance for the development of the economy that interest rates come down as this will encourage further investment.</P>
    <P>Confidence in the economy will grow as we demonstrate our commitment to proper management of the public finances. We have set difficult targets in the budget but we are on course and we intend to stay on course despite the pressures for relaxation.  There is no merit in setting targets if they are not achieved and, unfortunately, in recent years there has been a succession of large overruns. This has had a very damaging effect <Col N="1211" /> because it has called into question repeatedly our willingness to face up to realities. We have paid a heavy price for this poor performance in terms of lost investment, rising debt obligations and the undermining of national morale.</P>
    <P>Financial discipline on its own is by no means enough to get us out of our difficulties.  We must at the same time give a major impetus to the economy. From the outset we have given special attention to development of areas of the economy which, we believe, have strong potential.  These include tourism, food processing and the development of financial services.  Special measures to promote these sectors are incorporated in the Finance Bill and I will deal with these later.  The focus of attention on these areas will pay worthwhile dividends and there is already evidence of this.</P>
    <P>The budget strategy is the basis for optimism in the recovery of the economy which has been in a depressed state for several years.  While some of the factors responsible for this have been outside our control, we have compounded our difficulties by misguided policies and by failing to take corrective action.  As long as there are doubts about the determination of the Government to manage the public finances with prudence, the economy remains in the doldrums because of the prevailing lack of confidence. This Government have already demonstrated firmly their commitment to good management of the public finances, despite the unpopular consequences, and this will bring its due reward in improved economic performance.</P>
    <P>While this Bill was being debated in Dáil Éireann, I listened to repeated calls for tax reform.  We all favour tax reform but there appear to be widely varying views about how it should be achieved. Too many critics ignore the budget realities and it is much easier to call for tax easements and incentives than to propose tax increases.</P>
    <P>I recognise the significance of taxation in the economy.  I acknowledge that there is need for improvement and that some of our tax rates are unduly high and have <Col N="1212" /> a significant disincentive effect.  Reform of the taxation system is a Government priority because this is an essential element in achieving the scale of economic progress that we need.  We are not in a position in the short term, because of the budget situation, to reduce the overall burden of taxation to any significant extent.  This, however, does not rule out or defer the issue of reform; on the contrary, there is scope, I believe, for significant adjustments which will result in a fairer system.  There is a general recognition that reform must involve widening the tax base.  I agree with this but I would emphasise that widening the tax base means imposing new taxes or withdrawing concessions.</P>
    <P>There is continuing pressure for tax incentives to encourage business and we now have a wide range of these incentives in our tax code.  They are expensive in terms of tax foregone, and they are a factor in our high tax structure.  We cannot have more and more incentives and lower tax rates at the same time. Incentives are necessary but they must be on a selective basis.  There is a clear limit to the extent to which incentives can be allowed; the deciding factors in each case must be the balance of advantage to the economy and the need to protect the tax base.</P>
    <P>I welcome discussion on tax reform; I see a need for change, and rational discussion can help this process.  Discussion serves no purpose, however, if it ignores the budget arithmetic and degenerates into a succession of calls for concessions of one kind or another. There are no comfortable solutions and nobody should be under any illusion about this.  In the present budget climate, if we are lowering taxes significantly in one area, we must expect increases elsewhere. We cannot ignore this reality.</P>
    <P>In our <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> we have given a commitment to rapidly reach the stage where two-thirds of taxpayers pay income tax only at the standard rate.  It was not possible to fulfil this commitment in this year's budget. Income tax reductions, however modest, are costly.  We had to make choices <Col N="1213" /> between lower borrowing and lower taxation and the priority had to be to reduce borrowing.  I think most people would agree that this was the prudent approach. As the public finances and the economy improve, we will be in a better position to reduce the burden of income tax and to fulfil our commitment.</P>
    <P>In the course of the Dáil discussion on this Bill there were several references to tax arrears.  Our problems of high taxation cannot be resolved simply by collection of outstanding taxes.  There has been considerable misunderstanding about the scale of arrears and some of the figures mentioned are wild exaggerations. Uncollected tax is a serious problem and any tax reform package must incorporate measures to improve collection.  Significant progress has been made in recent years.  There must be further improvement and this will be a priority with the Government.</P>
    <P>Any reference to the general economic and financial situation is incomplete without adverting to the problem of unemployment. It is the central priority and all our efforts must be concentrated on new opportunities for employment.  There are, unfortunately, no overnight solutions but the steps we have already taken and the further measures over a wide range, which are now under consideration, will have a very positive impact over the next few years.  The unemployment figures are most disturbing but there are some encouraging signs.  I am confident that, as the Government's economic and financial strategies begin to take full effect, they will have a definite and significant impact on the employment figures.</P>
    <P>I would now like to outline individual sections of the Bill and to draw the attention of the House, in particular, to the more significant items.  The earlier sections deal with income tax.  Section 1 provides for the renewal for a further year of the special PRSI tax allowance, which was first introduced in 1982.  The exemption from income tax available to lessors of agricultural land, who are aged <Col N="1214" /> 55 or over or who are permanently incapacitated, is being raised from £2,000 to £2,800 in section 2.</P>
    <P>New arrangements for the income tax credit for farm tax are specified in section 3.  While the farm tax has been discontinued, amounts due in respect of 1986 remain payable.  A number of farmers have yet to make their payments. To qualify for a credit against 1986-87 income tax liability, however, the farm tax due should have been paid by 5 April 1987 under the terms of last year's Finance Act.  The deadline for payment is now being extended to 30 June 1987; there will be no further extensions.  In their own interests, therefore, farmers still owing farm tax from last year should arrange for immediate payments, as they have been encouraged to do so by the IFA.  There are also outstanding arrears of health contributions and levies to be paid by farmers.  It is an understandable source of frustration to the general body of taxpayers that they are not being paid. It is now time that the farming organisations again showed responsibility in forthrightly encouraging their members to settle all outstanding arrears.</P>
    <P>Section 4 abolishes in relation to Irish people working abroad the &ldquo;place of abode&rdquo; test for residence in the State for tax purposes.  This change will enable people working abroad to visit home and transfer savings without being subject to Irish tax simply because they maintain a place of abode and make short visits home.  In section 5 the ceiling for relief on dividend income from an Irish manufacturing company is being increased from £7,000 to £9,000 where the company has an approved profit-sharing scheme for its employees.  This is intended as an incentive to companies to introduce profit-sharing schemes which are of benefit both to the companies and the employees and do much to improve industrial relations.  To counter a potential abuse, there is also a provision that this relief is to apply only in respect of bona fide ordinary shares.</P>
    <P>Section 6 implements the restriction on mortgage interest relief announced in the budget.  It provides that the relief will <Col N="1215" /> be restricted to 90 per cent of mortgage interest actually paid or 90 per cent of the relevant relief ceilings, whichever is the lesser.  Mortgage interest relief would cost about £160 million in the current tax year if no action were taken.  This restriction will claw back a small proportion &mdash; £10 million in 1987 - of this cost.  This clawback has been designed very carefully, so as to ensure that the biggest clawback comes from those who enjoy the biggest benefit from the relief. The new restriction must be seen in the context of the recently announced cut in the mortgage interest rate and the likelihood of further cuts.  A primary objective of the budget strategy is to force down interest rates and the success of this strategy in the home loans area will continue to be of substantial benefit to mortgage holders generally.</P>
    <P>The requirements for pay over of retention tax by financial institutions are being altered in section 7.  The arrangements for crediting interest adopted by some financial institutions meant that they paid over to the Revenue Commissioners tax on less than 12 months' interest for the tax year 1986-87.  This section provides that these institutions will have to make up any shortfall in their 1987 payment by an extra payment in October next and it also protects the yield for future years.</P>
    <P>While I am dealing with the retention tax, I want to take this opportunity to state publicly that any activities by financial institutions aimed at avoiding the tax will be dealt with by legislation.  I have in mind here, particularly, transactions which are, effectively, deposit taking and re-lending.  The regulation of the banking sector is a matter for the Central Bank and my Department will take up with the bank, for immediate action, any case where it considers that activities proper to approved deposit takers are being carried on by others.</P>
    <P>I will also be concerned to ensure that the return on all deposits taken by relevant deposit takers, in whatever form, attract the tax, and I will introduce, with retrospective effect, whatever measures <Col N="1216" /> are necessary to achieve this.  I draw the attention of banks and other financial institutions to section 32 (2) of the Finance Act, 1986.  This requires a relevant deposit taker to treat every deposit made with it &mdash; and the term &ldquo;deposit&rdquo; is very widely defined &mdash; as a relevant deposit unless it is satisfied it is not a relevant deposit.</P>
    <P>Chapter II of the Bill contains important amendments to the business expansion scheme.  This scheme provides for relief on certain conditions for an individual who subscribes for unquoted ordinary shares in an Irish resident company engaged in manufacture or in certain service sector activities.</P>
    <P>The scheme has been successful to date in generating additional investment for the activities to which it applies.  Since the relief was introduced in January 1985, over 140 companies, and investments of about £12.5 million, have been approved.</P>
    <P>Up to now, the business expansion scheme has been confined to the manufacturing and international services sectors. The Government propose to extend it on a selective basis to certain other areas which we have identified as offering significant potential for increasing output and employment.  The areas in question are shipping, trading houses and export tourism.</P>
    <P>I do not need to outline to the House the difficulties which have beset the shipping industry in recent years.  Positive action is required to enable the industry to recover from these difficulties.  In order to revitalise the industry, the Bill provides that shipping will now come within the ambit of the business expansion scheme and, furthermore, the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax will apply to shipping activities.</P>
    <P>Senators will note the provision that the acquisition of a ship will qualify under the scheme only where such acquisition would be eligible for a grant under a grants scheme administered by the Department of the Marine.  This will ensure that all proposals to raise money under the business expansion scheme to buy ships will be vetted in accordance with strict criteria by the Department of <Col N="1217" /> the Marine.  It will also guarantee that revenue foregone under the scheme will be subject to the same level of scrutiny as the direct expenditure of Exchequer funds in the form of grants.</P>
    <P>The business expansion scheme is also being extended to trading houses and to export tourism.  I will return to the trading houses at a later stage.  The Government have already highlighted the importance which they attach to tourism and they have demonstrated their commitment to the industry with a special package of measures to attract substantial additional numbers of tourists this year.  Already, these measures are showing results.</P>
    <P>The qualifying activities under the heading of tourism are set out in section 11.  The term &ldquo;tourist traffic undertaking&rdquo; has been defined in very broad terms to ensure that a wide range of tourist activities can be covered.  There is a requirement that in order to qualify for the benefits of the business expansion scheme a company must obtain approval from Bord Fáilte for a three year development and marketing plan which is primarily designed to increase tourist traffic and revenue from abroad.  The purpose of this is to ensure that qualifying companies are committed to the essential purpose for which the scheme is being extended to the tourist sector, namely, to bring in more tourists from abroad.  It will also mean that the expertise of Bord Fáilte in the tourism area will be availed of in deciding on applications for relief under the scheme.</P>
    <P>The export tourism activities provided for include the promotion of qualifying activities abroad.  I draw Senator's particular attention to this provision, which I consider a very important one.  It is vital not only that we have facilities for tourists who come to our country but also that these facilities are vigorously marketed abroad.  The application of the business expansion scheme to promotional activities should give an additional impetus to this most necessary function of selling Ireland as a holiday resort abroad.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the extension of the business expansion scheme to export tourism activities as defined in this Bill <Col N="1218" /> will give a major boost to tourism in Ireland, to the benefit not only of the tourist industry but also of the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>Chapter III of the Bill gives effect to the scheme of tax deduction at source on professional fees paid by certain public sector agencies.  These fees are paid normally to either individuals who are taxed as self-employed or to companies who are liable for corporation tax.  Under the system of tax assessment for the self employed, current tax payments use as a basis for calculation earnings generated in a period which can date back over two years in some instances.  Under corporation tax, payments are due six months after the end of the accounting period to which they relate.  This contrasts with the deduction at source on current earnings under PAYE.  The new system provides for deduction of tax on account, at source, on the publicly funded professional fee payments to which it applies.  Accordingly, from 6 June tax on account is being deducted at source at the rate of 35 per cent from all payments for professional services made by the bodies specified in section 14 of the Bill. The new system is estimated to yield £25 million in 1987 and it is an important element of the budget for this year.</P>
    <P>There has been a considerable amount of misunderstanding about the new system and some exaggerated comment as to its effects.  I would like to stress the following points in relation to the scheme.  No additional tax liability whatsoever arises; this is no more than an accelerated payment of tax.  There are adequate safeguards to ensure that there will be no hardship.  For the large majority of those liable the withholding tax is not a significant imposition that will in any sense disrupt their business.</P>
    <P>The tax is not inequitable; it is not disruptive and it will not affect employment. Its operation will be monitored closely and I will welcome submissions from people who may feel that the relieving clauses do not properly deal with this situation and that consequently they are in a situation of hardship.</P>
    <P>Senators will note that section 14 <Col N="1219" /> enables the list of accountable persons who will operate the tax to be extended by regulation subject to the approval of Dáil Éireann.  While the major public sector bodies paying significant amounts of professional fees are already included, I have arranged for a study of fees payable across the public sector with a view to possibly adding to this list at a future date.  There were proposals in the course of the debate in Dáil Éireann that payments made by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board for doctors' fees should be subject to the withholding tax.  In principle, I agree with this; in practice, however, these payments are now made to the insured persons so that there is not a direct link between VHI and the doctors.  I will look at the present arrangements to see what can be done.</P>
    <P>I would now like to move on to Chapters IV and V of the Bill and to draw specific attention to the principal items under these headings.  Section 25 provides that the restriction whereby capital allowances are determined on a &ldquo;net of grant&rdquo; basis will not apply to companies in the food processing sector which purchase their own plant and machinery. This reflects the special priority which the Government attach to investment in the food processing sector.  This is an area where, for export purposes especially, we have significant potential to achieve a higher added value content and large scale investment is necessary for this purpose. Already there has been an announcement of a major development in meat processing and we look forward to further progress in this very important sector.</P>
    <P>There is provision in section 27 empowering the Minister for Finance to extend by order the definiton of designated areas for urban renewal.  It is essential to provide attractive tax incentives to promote the proper redevelopment of inner urban areas.  The response to the provisions incorporated in last year's Finance Act is most encouraging.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the extension of the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax to <Col N="1220" /> shipping and this provision is incorporated in section 28.  This concession is being accompanied by measures designed to curtail certain tax avoidance activities in the sector.  These measures impose restrictions on relief for trading losses of shipping companies and capital allowances in respect of ships used in a 10 per cent shipping trade.</P>
    <P>The intention underlying the anti-avoidance measures is to confine the tax benefit of capital allowances on ships and any accumulated trading losses within the shipping trade.  It has been possible up to now to set these allowances and losses against income other than shipping income by means of group relief and, in the case of capital allowances only, leasing arrangements.  The result is that other companies or individuals can reduce their tax liability artificially and the profits of shipping companies for tax purposes have been artificially increased.</P>
    <P>The extension of the 10 per cent of corporation tax to the income of trading houses is proposed in section 29.  Trading houses are defined as companies carrying on a trade which consists exclusively of the sale by wholesale on the export market of Irish manufactured goods.  It is envisaged that these will be private sector companies with no State participation.</P>
    <P>The aim of the Government in promoting the establishment of trading houses is to develop a co-ordinated export marketing function for Irish manufacturing companies.  Many such companies, although their products have strong export potential, lack the resources and often the capability to exploit this potential.  This is largely a function of size, but the result is that smaller companies are put at a serious competitive disadvantage.  Trading houses will act as conduits for goods manufactured by such companies.</P>
    <P>Section 30 relates to the establishment of an International Financial Services Centre in the Customs House Docks site. This development has already received considerable publicity.  The special needs of the Custom House Docks site were recognised and provided for in the package of tax incentives contained in the <Col N="1221" /> Finance Act, 1986, for the physical redevelopment of the site.  In order to promote this redevelopment, however, it has been necessary to identify and target a specific economic activity which can be attracted into a portion at least of the accommodation being provided on the site.  It is obviously desirable that this activity should be new rather than that the site should attract operations already established elsewhere in Dublin or elsewhere in Ireland which might be willing to relocate.  The Government believe that the establishment of an International Financial Services Centre offers the best potential for development of the site.</P>
    <P>A low rate of corporation tax is recognised to be a necessary precondition for the successful operation of such a development.  Accordingly, provision is being made for the extension of the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax to income derived from certified international financial services to be carried on in the Custom House Docks site.  In defining the services to be permitted, certain services for Irish residents and certain dealings in Irish currency are not included. To qualify for the 10 per cent tax rate companies will require a certificate from the Minister for Finance and, in addition to the legal requirements, companies will have to satisfy certain criteria before a certificate will be given.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in so far as banking functions may be located in the Custom House Docks site, they will be subject to the licensing and regulatory authority of the Central Bank on the same basis as banks located elsewhere in the State.  The requirements of the relevant European Communities Banking Directives will be fully met.  The Government have notified the European Commission of the initiatives contained in sections 28, 29 and 30 and the normal procedures involved in such notification are being applied.</P>
    <P>Section 33 proposes a new rate of taxation of 45 per cent on the income of banks from home loan business granted after the publication of this Bill.  Income from existing home loan business will continue to be taxed at 35 per cent as heretofore and costs on all home loan <Col N="1222" /> business will continue to be available to be offset against income from other banking activities subject to the normal corporation tax rate of 50 per cent.  There is, therefore, no reason why those who already have home loans from banks should pay more, and a tax concession is still available in regard to new loans.</P>
    <P>The existing arrangements result from section 28 of the Finance Act, 1976, which was introduced to encourage the banks to provide home loans at competitive rates.  At the time the banks considered that it would not be prudent or profitable for them to engage in this lending. Over the years, however, the banks have expanded their share of this market and this year both AIB and Bank of Ireland have substantially increased their allocation for home loan schemes.  Continuation of a concession, devised when home loans were not looked on favourably by banks, is simply not justified in the present situation where the banks are setting out to be the major lenders in the home loan market and can use the favourable tax arrangement resulting from this concession to achieve this objective.</P>
    <P>I introduced an amendment in the course of the Dáil discussion on the Bill to provide a special incentive for investment in film making.  This is contained in section 35.  Film making is an expensive and high risk business and it is difficult to raise adequate financing.  The business expansion scheme has already proven itself a valuable vehicle for providing film finance and now we want to encourage investment from the business sector in film projects with commercial potential. This is the thinking behind the new incentive. We have the basic talents for development of a successful film industry but, without adequate financing, there can be no success.  In conjunction with the introduction of the tax incentive scheme the Government are reviewing the existing range of support and encouragement for film-making, including the work of Bord Scannan na hÉireann and An Chomhairle Ealaíon.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of customs and excise some relief is provided from excise <Col N="1223" /> duty on imported waste oil which is subject to processing to make it suitable for use as industrial fuel oil.  This change corrects an anomaly and it also encourages processing of oil which would otherwise be dumped.  The Bill also confirms excise duty increases on tobacco and certain fuels which were imposed by order last January.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with value-added tax.  As well as giving effect to the changes announced in the budget, the Bill contains a number of technical provisions. There is a reduction from 25 per cent to 10 per cent in the rate on photographic services, waste disposal services and driving instruction as announced in the budget.  In addition, I am extending the benefit of the reduction to admissions to cultural, historical, artistic and scientific exhibitions and tour guiding services. These reductions will have effect from 1 July and are intended as a further stimulus to the important services sector of the economy where I believe there is significant potential for job creation.  I am confident that this will improve the competitiveness of this sector and help combat black economy activity as well as contribute to employment growth in the economy.</P>
    <P>The Bill also confirms the reduction in the farmers' flat-rate VAT addition to prices from 2.4 per cent to 1.7 per cent which I announced in the budget.  This change, which has had effect from 1 May is intended to compensate the Exchequer for the revenue foregone on the abolition of the farm tax.  As I indicated in the Budget Statement, farmers retain the right to register for VAT and recover in full any VAT paid by them on their farm inputs.  I also mentioned in the Budget Statement that greater use will be made of the farm profile form in assessing smaller farmers for income tax.  The existing form has now been revised and the new arrangements will be put into operation shortly.</P>
    <P>The intention is that all farmers likely to have a taxable income should be assessed. The profile form will enable an inspector of taxes to determine in many <Col N="1224" /> cases that no tax liability will arise.  For most other smaller farmers, the inspector will be in a position to assess the amount of tax due without the need for accounts. This simplification of procedures should remove the need for smaller farmers generally to seek specialist accounting advice in relation to their tax affairs.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated my concern that farmers should pay arrears of health contributions and levies.  I served notice in Dáil Éireann that I will have to reduce the VAT refund still further if farmers do not meet their obligations.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of stamp duties, provision is made for the continuation of the bank levy to yield £25 million and for an increase in the levy on life assurance premiums from 1? per cent to 3 per cent. The contribution from the financial institutions to corporation tax yield is decidedly small and, while this situation prevails, there is no room for any diminution of levies.  It is reasonable to look to the financial sector for a bigger contribution to tax revenue.</P>
    <P>This Bill contains some major changes in taxation.  In bringing it before the House I have sought to present these changes in the context of the general Government policy on the public finances and taxation.  I also have to emphasise again, before concluding, the developmental aspect of a number of the provisions in this legislation.  The Government recognise that prudent management of the public finances is not sufficient on its own and that there must be a positive effort at the same time to promote development and employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Finance to the House and wish him well in the discharge of his duties.  We last met in July 1982 when he similarly presented his Finance Bill to the House. At that time we had a constructive engagement.  I dare say the tenor will be similar this time round although there are, of course, critical things which one must say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Normally, the debate on the Finance <Col N="1225" /> Bill is the high point in the political year of any Administration.  Members of this House will, naturally, be keen to comment on the finances of the country and on the measures which the Government have initiated and brought forward in the budget and the Finance Bill for dealing with the very complex and difficult problems which we are confronting.  These worrying problems are indebtedness, extraordinarily high unemployment &mdash; particularly given our unusual demographic structure &mdash; and the crushing burden of taxation.  I look forward to the debate and to hearing the contributions from other Members of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The Second Stage of the Finance Bill allows us all some latitude in the debate and the Cathaoirleach customarily recognises that fact, both in relation to the Finance Bill and, indeed, in relation to all other legislation receiving its Second Stage hearing in this House.  I am concerned, though, that the Committee Stage of this Bill should receive a very full exposé of every facet of the Bill. Unfortunately, in the other House such a comprehensive and detailed examination was not conducted.  We should supplement that deficiency on Committee Stage.  Although on the Finance Bill we are not permitted in this House to put down amendments, nevertheless, we have an effective and important role to play.  I hope Senators will avail of that opportunity to tease out every aspect of the Bill and to question the Minister in detail.</P>
    <P>The attitude of Fine Gael towards the Second Stage of the Finance Bill, 1987, is that we will not oppose it, although we are opposed to certain sections of the Bill, notably the withholding tax.  I noticed the Minister's soothing words but, nevertheless, when we come to a detailed discussion on that, my words will not be particularly soothing.  Of course, we can debate this at length on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>We now have in the Oireachtas and, indeed, I think it is true to say, in the country in general, a broad consensus on the economic problems of the State, what the problems are and the steps needed <Col N="1226" /> to be taken to bring about solutions.  I welcome this consensus.  I am glad to see it.  It took a long time to get to this point. I regret the length of time it has taken to bring it about.  In the interim period there has been a scandalous waste of energy on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party in particular, who spent the past four years blatantly obstructing or slowing down the emergence of this consensus.  I am sure thinking members of that party bitterly regret the posturing and macho-type Opposition which really went over the top.  They are being forced to climb down now, with a lot of discomfiture.</P>
    <P>Playing the game of Opposition has had a tragic result.  I hold the party now in Government responsible for the unnecessary delay in the process of adjusting our economy.  As a result of this, many people who had jobs now have no jobs.  Many people who desperately seek work are unable to find work.  By peddling a sham message of false hope and by proclaiming that there was another way &mdash; a better way or a magic way &mdash; the party now in Government deceived the people of this country shamefully.  They have now compounded that deception by executing a dizzying U-turn on the economy, one in a number of U-turns which have left the electorate disenchanted, enraged and frustrated. They are protesting, yet again, today.</P>
    <P>In the national interest I welcome this dramatic Pauline-style conversion on the part of Fianna Fáil.  I want to place on record the fact that I despise and reject totally the dishonesty which has further damaged the credibility of politicians and has debased politics.  It has dragged this country and its people down to an all-time low of despair and despondency. Given the outrageous Fianna Fáil election manifesto, with its far from promising raw material and the time constraints involved, it is hardly surprising that what has emerged as the Government's finance policy in the budget and, of course, in the Finance Bill, is by and large an adaptation or a modification of the policies upon which Fine Gael fought the last general election. The question must still be asked: <Col N="1227" /> what is the Government's underlying economic policy?  I fail to discern this on reading the Bill and on studying it in depth.</P>
    <P>The most disappointing feature of this Finance Bill is that it again increases taxation. I object to the reduction of the mortgage interest relief.  Mortgage holders will now be able to claim only 90 per cent of their interest.  The dismantling of tax reliefs, in itself, is disquieting.  I fear, as do many others, that this reduction is only the start of a wholesale decimation of reliefs in general.  If the Government did not have the financial scope to reduce tax this year, why at least did they not signal a willingness to introduce a meaningful tax reform, instead of tinkering with the system, which we all recognise to be outdated, inefficient and manifestly unfair?  The curtailment of mortgage interest relief, coupled with the scrapping of three out of four housing grant schemes, is seen as a form of treachery by the building trade, who had been confidently led to expect a VAT cut from 10 per cent to 5 per cent and a major capital injection via the public capital programme. They have been betrayed very badly by those who always proclaim themselves to be friends of the building industry.</P>
    <P>I find the abolition of farm tax objectionable as, despite a well-orchestrated campaign to decry it, it was a fair tax which helped farmers in intensive activity.  The last Minister for Finance, Deputy John Bruton, in November 1986 announced a relief for farmers who were hardpressed and liable for tax, particularly in the wake of two very bad summers. The present Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry, has omitted this measure and would appear to have dropped it.  Since the cost involved is minimal, I ask the Minister to restore it.  I hope the Minister will refer to that, in responding to the Second Stage debate, because it was a significant relief and welcomed by farmers who could avail of it.</P>
    <P>The farmers' VAT refund system has been reduced from 2.4 per cent to 1.7 per cent, that is, a saving of £9 million.  This <Col N="1228" /> has been done to fund the £9 million loss in revenue from the land tax.  This is unjust, because that money is now going to be taken directly out of the pockets of farmers, whether they are big or small or whether they are earning or losing money.  Levies and contributions under the TB eradication scheme are to be increased and charges are to be introduced for ACOT services.  By and large, while farmers bought the promise of the abolition of the land tax, they were duped with a whole new range of charges.  I would like to state my wish to see farmers taxed as fairly and equitably as everybody else in this country; however, I feel the land tax was fair, equitable and could have worked, but an election promise had to be held to in this instance.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to the 35 per cent withholding tax on professional fees, as are my party.  I find it inequitable and potentially damaging to employment prospects. It will impose a severe strain upon, for example, consulting engineers, particularly when working for Government or quasi-Government bodies under a fee scale which was introduced in 1964 and which was increased in 1978 by a mere 5 per cent, and that following upon a great deal of lobbying from those affected.</P>
    <P>The present lack of work in the construction industry and the prospects of an even gloomier situation ahead, when the building boom brought about by the grants for home improvements has finally dried up, means that sector of the economy is experiencing intense competition for the little amount of business now available and likely to be available.  To learn that 35 per cent retention tax is now to be applied to professional fees is really giving the <i>coup de grâce</i> to the entire profession and to the industry.  With delays in fee payments caused by the increased detail now required to be submitted on final accounts, there is already in existence a form of retention.  To compound this with a 35 per cent additional retention is most undesirable and probably dangerous.  In my view, it is a recipe for disaster from an employment point of view.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1229" /> Obviously, the measure was designed to catch some tax evaders and has been presented in this light as a sop to the hard-pressed PAYE worker, but this is just not so.  I have had numerous representations from firms who will be severely affected by this measure and indeed from individuals who will find this curtailment of their cash flow particularly difficult to cope with.  All make the point &mdash; I am referring to the firms &mdash; that all the staff of these firms pay tax.  PAYE, PRSI and VAT are paid out at regular and frequent intervals and, so, money which should be and is paid to the Government is never accumulated.  This tax is an acceleration measure and the Minister indicated this afternoon that that is what it is.  I contend that it is a form of double taxation.  It brings forward by one year tax payments that would not be due until October 1988.  It is a once-off tax and is estimated to raise £25 million. This will hit professionals very hard and, while there are provisions to help hardship cases, it is a most unfair tax and by far the most controversial element in the entire Bill.  It may be proved in time to have been unconstitutional.  I note that a group of people are contemplating bringing an action to the courts to contest the constitutionality of this provision.  I await the outcome with some interest.</P>
    <P>Returning to the proposal to increase the tax on bank profits and their home loan business from 35 per cent to 45 per cent, with consequent increases in mortgage interest rates, I must declare that I am opposed to this.  This measure has been introduced to help the building societies and, interestingly, was not a feature of the budget.  From that fact one infers that it was a result of pressure from the building societies and was not included in the Bill for revenue reasons as it was not part of the calculations of the budget.  The net effect of all of this is that the banks will pass on their disadvantage to the mortgage holder.  The Bank of Ireland have already increased their rates by three-quarters of 1 per cent. On the other hand, they may hold their rates on the basis of falling interest rates, which is as good as an increase to them. <Col N="1230" /> As usual, the ordinary man or woman in the street gets caught in this ongoing battle between the building societies and the banks for deposits and this time the Government have come down on the side of the building societies.</P>
    <P>There is in the budget, and therefore in the Finance Bill, a thinly disguised drive against tax evasion in a number of key areas.  In general one cannot cavil or argue with the notion of curbing tax evasion and putting in some restraints. There is to be a redeployment of 25 public servants in the collection of tax arrears on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners.  It is estimated that this &ldquo;hit squad&rdquo; can bring in an additional £10 million per annum in unpaid taxes.  Simple arthmetic indicates that each of these needs to net a haul of £1,600 per day every working day for a full year.  I may be accused of cynicism, but I await the outcome with interest.  The facts are that the entire system of tax collection has fallen into disarray and the fact that it is centralised is a recipe for delay and inefficiency.  Our tax collection system should be decentralised and collection should be at local level with a certain percentage retained at local level to assist the local authorities who were starved of cash following reductions in the rate support grant and now they, too, will be subject to the 35 per cent retention tax.</P>
    <P>At a news conference in Dublin yesterday an announcement was made that Government tax officials had put forward a 40-point plan designed to deal effectively with outstanding taxes.  The Minister, in his speech here this afternoon, indicated that wild figures were in circulation about the actual amount of arrears outstanding.  At this press conference yesterday the figure of £664 million was brought forward as the figure.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's comment, in his reply on Second Stage, as to whether he felt that figure was wildly exaggerated or was on target.  The Irish Tax Officials Association set up this press conference, I understand, and it is reasonable to assume that they would have some inside <Col N="1231" /> knowledge of what the actual situation is.</P>
    <P>I look forward to reading this plan.  My immediate reaction to it is: let us take it seriously, let us study it, let us debate it, and let us implement it, because so many plans, so many studies, the fruits of so much collective wisdom in this country all seem to end up gathering dust on shelves.  This is too crucial a point to be neglected or to be subjected to the kind of delay and prevarication which have been attached to so many other reports of merit and value.</P>
    <P>The officials want more power given to the Revenue Commissioners, which would result in total control over the collection of taxes.  Radical new powers are urged, including power to seize goods and property from tax dodgers.  Power to debit the bank accounts of offenders is suggested.  The Revenue Commissioners want similar rights as the banks when it comes to defaulters.  They want the right to appoint nominees to the boards of companies to protect the interests of the Revenue Commissioners.  The Irish Tax Officials Association's general secretary, Paddy Keating, has stated that the problems in Ireland do not arise in Britain and that the level of unpaid taxes here is six times higher than in New Zealand.  He has claimed that 70,000 farmers brought into the tax net in 1983 have not been asked to fill in a tax form.  I would like verification from the Minister, in his reply on Second Stage, on whether he is privy to this kind of information, if this is in fact so and, if it is, what is he going to do about it; and, if it is not so, could we have a clearly couched and strongly enunciated denial.  It is this kind of information that drives, and understandably drives, the PAYE taxpayer around the bend.  It is not acceptable.  While I agree that there are facile arguments that our debt problems and our difficult financial situation could be eradicated and changed overnight if we managed to bring in all our arrears, nevertheless there is enormous scope for action and quick incisive sharp action in this area.  I hope we will speedily see the kind of action that I talk about.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1232" /> Claims for expense allowances in respect of repairs and maintenance of cars and other vehicles will have to be accompanied by a VAT invoice showing that the work was performed by a registered trader.  This is to be welcomed and is part of the tax avoidance measures being dealt with in this Finance Bill.  The motor industry, heading towards the lowest car sales in 20 years, has got nothing else in this Bill.  Granted that the room for manoeuvre is severely restricted, but I would like to know how it was decided to favour one sector over another, which is a marked feature of this Bill.  The Minister in his speech indicated that food processing, the financial services sector and various elements which he felt were wealth producing were the criteria for inclusion, but I think that point is not being clearly explained. There is an understandable feeling of resentment and irritation on the part of industries such as the motor industry, and indeed the construction industry, that their problems are not being understood and that there are no particular accommodations, reliefs or assistances given to them.</P>
    <P>Those involved in the construction industry will be asking that same question as those involved in the motor industry, because the construction sector is experiencing six consecutive years of decline.  I note that shipping has been helped out and that food processing has also been given assistance, and this I welcome.  I know that my colleague, Senator Daly, when he speaks on the Finance Bill, will grill the Minister on the matter of the motor industry, as it is an area which he feels keenly about.  I will leave it to him to develop the points in connection with that area.</P>
    <P>The purchase of duty free goods by day trippers to Northern Ireland and Britain is to be curtailed.  Superficially, this appears to be effective; but my fear is that it will be virtually impossible to police.  On the credit side, I welcome the provisions for expatriate workers.  It is a recognition of the reality of emigration which is so badly affecting this country. It is a way in which we can ensure that <Col N="1233" /> we do not further alienate these people, who very often through no choice of their own must work outside this country.  As matters stood, Irish people working abroad were liable to Irish tax on money which was sent home, if they owned a house here and visited this country for even a few days during the tax year.  This discouraged investment and it caused unnecessary family problems as, understandably, expatriate workers were reluctant to visit relations in Ireland while on assignments abroad.  It is also a tangible and practical recognition of the fact that so many skilled Irish people are forced or choose to work outside this country. They should not be further alienated by our tax code and should be actively encouraged to invest at home.  I welcome this measure.  I am pleased, too, that the Minister is reviewing corporation tax. This is timely.</P>
    <P>There is good news for the Irish film industry in this Bill.  At last there is a recognition that some kind of financial climate which could encourage investment in film making here needs to be created if the advances of recent years and the signs of emerging talent are not to be smothered.  Under the new scheme put forward in this Finance Bill companies may invest up to £100,000 a year in Irish film production companies.  In return these corporate investors will be able to get a tax write-off against profits for annual investments in the film companies, which must be incorporated here and not tax resident elsewhere.  Equally sensibly, at least 75 per cent of the production work on the films must be done here.  Again, inherent in that, is a recognition that there will be a certain spin-off advantage to the locations where films are being made.  Places like Dingle, for example, will long be remembered for &ldquo;Ryan's Daughter&rdquo; and &ldquo;Barry Lyndon&rdquo; made by Stanley Kubrick in Waterford and the spin-off and the general activity engendered by the presence of film making in an area is significant and is obviously considered when it comes to putting this particular measure together.</P>
    <P>There are other strings attached &mdash; of course, there are always strings attached. <Col N="1234" /> For instance, the film company can raise only a maximum of 60 per cent of a film's budget under this scheme.  There are other advantages for investors, among them additional relief on capital gains tax after the investment has been left in for three years.  The scheme takes on board much of what the Irish Film Board have been championing for quite some time; and, even if it does not eliminate the risk element for investors, this is now significantly reduced.  It is not a panacea for the financial ills of the Irish film maker but, compared to the official neglect and misjudgment of decades past, it marks a considerable move in the right direction and at a time when we are suffering severe financial constraints.</P>
    <P>I recognise the fact that there is enormous visual and artistic talent present in this country and only ready to be translated into film of artistic merit.  I hope those people will see these benefits and will run with them to the advantage of the film industry in particular and the country as a whole because such films made on location in Ireland will have a spin-off effect in terms of enhancing the status and image of this country abroad, in being part and parcel of the tourism package and in attracting more and more visitors to the country.</P>
    <P>In general it is true to say that the Finance Bill, like the budget to which it gives legislative effect, will do nothing in the short term to achieve economic growth.  The whole thrust of the Bill is to bring about a climate for interest rates to fall, through lower Government borrowing, which in turn, it is hoped, will eventually stimulate the economy.  There is a risk in this strategy in that all the eggs are in one basket.  For the case to hold, two conditions must be met.  Interest rates must decline sharply.  They are declining at present, and a report from the stockbroking company, Goodbody, this morning indicated the prospect of further decline.  But it must be remembered that there is a pendulum effect in interest rates and that they have been low before and they can rise.</P>
    <P>The second condition which must be met is that industrial investment must <Col N="1235" /> increase on foot of the lower interest rates.  There is no magic formula here.  One hopes this will happen.  One puts in a series of measures which will encourage the growth and will stimulate it.  There is no absolute domino effect that this will happen.  Would that it were so, and I wish it well.  The markets and investors need to be convinced that the Government mean business and that they will stick to their targets.  We will have some idea of the lie of the land on June 30, when the half-yearly returns are published. We will then see if revenue and expenditure are on target.  If they are not, immediate corrective action will be required, despite inevitable political unpopularity.</P>
    <P>The track record of the previous Fianna Fáil Administration is not encouraging in this respect.  Fine Gael faced reality by choice.  Fianna Fáil in Government have been compelled to do so. Fianna Fáil are reluctant converts; but like all converts, they have set about the business of indicating their zeal with an unbridled enthusiasm; in many instances their touch has been more of the bludgeon and less of the scalpel, and they are unnecessarily incurring displeasure &mdash; not that I should be too unhappy about that, I suppose.  It is true to say that the Irish people over the last four years were brought to a realisation of the nature of the problems in this country and that, in order to achieve anything, you must bring people along with you.  Fianna Fáil have only woken up to the reality of the problem and are only now beginning to implement the policies which the country badly needs to have implemented.  In the national interest we will support realistic policies and we will not seek political advantage at all costs.  That is novel in Irish political history.</P>
    <P>Much is missing in this Finance Bill. No attempt is made to confront the situation of industrial spending.  At present 3,400 people are employed full time by 20 State agencies involved in job creation, or management training, or manpower training.  Over the past four years <Col N="1236" /> they have spent about £400 million annually on grants and on administration, yet the manufacturing workforce has fallen by 33,000.  That situation needs urgent attention and remedial action.  I hope that, if it is not part of this Finance Bill, we will quickly see signs that it is being addressed.</P>
    <P>The collapse of Hyster has highlighted another area crying out for attention.  The number of people employed in foreign-owned industry has fallen by 10,000 since the start of the eighties.  There is an obvious need for a review of the effectiveness of this spending.</P>
    <P>Tax breaks for industry are costing a fortune.  A recent study suggests that the concessions are costing £240 million per annum in foregone taxes which would otherwise be payable by Irish-owned firms and institutions alone.  Tentative estimates suggest that the cost of tax breaks for foreign firms could be another £400 million per annum.  These are items which are missing from the Bill but which urgently need attention.</P>
    <P>All in all, then, I would say we recognise that the Government have at last focused on the reality of the picture facing the country, having evaded confronting that reality for the past four years.  When we see realistic, helpful policies being implemented in the national interest, acting responsibily as a responsible Opposition, we will not oppose such policies.  In that tenor I welcome the Finance Bill and look forward to a detailed examination of its various component parts on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would like to welcome the Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry, to the House and to congratulate him on what I regard as a very practical, no-nonsense speech to us here this evening, setting out the problems that he and his Government have inherited and setting out the manner in which he and his Government intend to tackle many of those problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not intend to comment on other speakers but I cannot but comment in some way on some of the remarks of the previous speaker.  I would have to suggest <Col N="1237" /> to Senator Bulbulia that it was Fine Gael and Labour who were in Government for the past four and a half years, that they had a majority in the House for four and a half years and that, in fact they had the majority in the House for ten out of 14 years.  Therefore, it is unreal for Senator Bulbulia to blame the present Government, who have been in office now for little more than two months.  What happened during the past four and a half years was that the previous Government simply asked us to tighten our belts, which we all did in the national interest. The result was that we were far worse off after those four and a half years.  I know, as a result of the measures this Government are now implementing, that at the end of the four and a half years which the Government will last the economic scene will have been dramatically improved.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the Finance Bill, we know that it gives a legal effect to the budget, and we all know that this year's budget was severe.  It was severe because it had to be severe.  This Government had to start getting the public finances under control or else they would have gotten completely out of hand.  In a few short years we would simply not be able to borrow what would be needed to keep us ticking over.  This Government had to endeavour to reduce the gap between Government income and expenditure so that Government borrowing could be reduced.  This is recognised in the first part of the Minister's speech, where he makes the point that there is no possibility of short term solutions to these problems.  Equally, it was of critical importance that we should take immediate steps, however unpopular, to arrest this decline.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to &ldquo;focusing special attention on development areas to generate more economic activity and to open up new employment opportunities.&rdquo; That is something I will refer to later on, because that whole area is vital to the survival and economic life of this country.  The social welfare bill for this year is something like £2.6 billion.  In fact, it represents £100 million over last year, a staggering figure indeed.  Much of <Col N="1238" /> this bill must be related to the unemployment figures.  Obviously, if we can reduce unemployment we will reduce the size of this huge £2.6 billion social welfare bill.  Throughout the Finance Bill and throughout the budget the Government clearly had this in mind.</P>
    <P>As we all know, Government Departments have been carefully restructured to respond better to the development potential that is obviously there in our economy.  For example, there is the creation of the new Department of the Marine which will now deal with all matters relating to the seas around us.  This is important for us as an island people.  I firmly believe that we have not yet fully realised a fraction of the potential of the seas around us &mdash; fishing, fish farming, mariculture, shipbuilding and so on. There is great potential there which, I believe, will give much employment in the future.</P>
    <P>Tourism also can be improved.  Everyone knows that tourism is vitally important in the area of new employment.  We have fallen behind in terms of growth in this area.  World tourism is a fast expanding area.  It is suggested that in 20 or 25 years time tourism could well be the world's largest industry.  The Government are correct in endeavouring to increase our revenue from tourism which will, in effect, mean extra jobs. Of course the taxation incentives in the Finance Bill from the business expansion scheme will obviously be a big help here.</P>
    <P>The horticulture industry, where again I believe there is great potential, has been neglected over the years, so much so that at the moment we import £37 million worth of vegetables and fruit every year which we could produce ourselves. Having set up an office of horticulture with the Minister of State in charge, his main objective obviously will be to establish, promote and develop the horticulture industry and the employment potential it has.  I know Deputy Seamus Kirk will be very active in this promotion. I can recall some years ago in the Seanad in a debate on agriculture querying as an urban person why we do not have some <Col N="1239" /> form of compulsory tillage.  I know that it is not as easy as one might expect.  The new horticultural board will be examining this.</P>
    <P>We have developed forestries.  There is great potential for the development of the forestry industry.  We have a Minister of State in charge, Deputy Michael Smith, to promote and develop this sector.  The vast natural potential we have for sales in Europe, which is short of timber, will be realised with a further significant contribution of growth and employment in this area too.</P>
    <P>The development of the food industry is important.  Its potential is obvious. Employment is wide open in this area and new jobs can be created.  I have referred to the restructuring of Departments. Unemployment in the context of the budget and in the context of the Finance Bill, which gives legal effect to the budget, is paramount.  It is as important in any section of the Bill as anything dealing with customs and excise, or VAT, or any of the other matters that normally form part and parcel of Finance Bills.</P>
    <P>Another area where we are looking for development is in the section which enables the Government to develop the Custom House Docks site and to provide a financial services centre.  We all know that this international financial services industry is one of the fastest growing areas of the world economy.  Financial transactions far exceed in value the total of world trade in goods.  They are, indeed, a major source of employment. The Government are to be congratulated on having set up this central committee with a mandate to establish as quickly as possible a new centre in the Dublin Custom House Docks site for international services.  I am convinced there is great potential for the development of international financial services in this country based on the availability of people with the necessary skills.  I know we have this type of person in abundance. In fact, many of them are leaving our shores to enter into the same type of business in other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>The fact that we have the necessary <Col N="1240" /> professional structures, the fact that our geographic location is right, and the fact that our highly advanced telecommunications system will be of huge benefit, are all factors in our favour plus, and including very positively, an attractive taxation incentive for the proper running of this type of enterprise.  The objective of the Government is to ensure that we share in this expanding service industry and share in the first-class type of employment it provides.  I have a great deal of confidence that this project will be a success.</P>
    <P>Again, there is the question of attractive tax incentives.  It comes into play in other areas where we can have further growth in the economy, where we can have further employment.  I am aware, as we all are, of the move of the Government towards decentralisation, that is, the building of Government offices and Departments in different locations throughout the country, and that private funds will be sought rather than Government funds to finance these projects.  This is something I welcome.  For the Government it would have to be, and would be seen to be, a no-loss and a free gain situation.  I do not know how the Government intend to pursue this line.  I would like an extension of it so that not just for Government buildings but for libraries, Garda stations, other Government requirements, a proper statutory consortium would be set up to look at this whole area.  If the proper tax incentives are there this type of funding will be available.  If it is done in this way with no hassle, or as little hassle as possible for potential investors in that type of scheme, it could have a great future.</P>
    <P>The question of the change in the tax on bank income from interest on home loans will no doubt be mentioned as it has already been mentioned by the first speaker, Senator Bulbulia.  We all know that for the past couple of years the two main banks, Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks, have moved into the home loan market with a vengeance.  For the first quarter of 1987 these two banks alone lent twice as much money as the <Col N="1241" /> building societies.  I think this development is recognised.  At the moment my understanding is that between them they have lent a figure in excess of £330 million in home mortgages.  The Finance Bill, 1987, essentially reduces the tax subsidy that was extended to the banks in 1976 to encourage them to provide mortgage finance at a time when there was a scarcity of housing finance.  The present move has, predictably, caused some anger in banking circles and, in the main, their reaction is unjustified.  The fact is that the conditions which applied when the subsidy was first introduced in 1976 are no longer there.  There is simply no way any Government could justify continuing to boost bank profits with taxpayers' money.  So, perhaps Senator Bulbulia has got it wrong.  Certainly, that is my stand. If she thinks the taxpayer should continue to boost the economy and the profits of banks, that is her business but I think the Government are right in looking at that matter.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Finance Bill refers to the mortgage interest relief.  It is probably true to say that Department of Finance officials have long been suggesting an abolition in some way of mortgage interest relief.  The Minister has given the figures for this year and even after the 10 per cent that it will cost, millions will be saved to the Exchequer.  The relief scheme was originally introduced to encourage people to house themselves rather than to depend on the local authorities. As we all know, we now have a home ownership rate of 74 per cent.  It could be and is being argued that the scheme has very nearly achieved its objectives and that it should be scrapped.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Taxation also suggested in their report that the mortgage interest relief be axed but the Commission's formula was perhaps different from what many people fear is now being considered.  They suggested that the relief should be ended as part of a package of tax reforms which would include the elimination of all allowances and the replacement of the various marginal rates with a single rate for all.  If that was being contemplated then, there is little cause <Col N="1242" /> for the concern that is being shown but the fear is that the mortgage interest relief may be abolished not as part of a general taxation reform package but in isolation and that, in itself, would pose many problems for many householders. Many of them paying marginal rates of tax at 45 per cent and over have taken out large mortgages in the belief that the relief scheme would continue to operate and if it were suddenly to be totally ended it would become impossible for many to sustain their mortgage repayments.  This would trigger off a price slump in housing.</P>
    <P>The question of taxation is paramount in this debate and has been referred to by the Minister.  The aim of the Minister and the Government is that all should eventually pay equally.  The whole question of tax reform must be tackled.  The Minister made this point but he said it could not be done in the short term for the very obvious reasons that he spelled out.  We all accept and agree that the pay-as-you-earn taxpayer is paying a substantially higher figure of tax than any other sector of the community.</P>
    <P>Measures to improve the collection of tax must also be uppermost in the mind of the Government.  Outstanding tax is not a new phenomenon in this country and it was referred to by the previous speaker as something of great importance. She referred to recent meetings of tax officials but her own Minister for Finance &mdash; I think it was Deputy Alan Dukes, the present Leader &mdash; said at one stage that there was no crock of gold in this area of tax evasion.  So, it is not something new.  Tax evasion and its associated problems have been hardy annuals in Finance Bills for years.  If it is clearly established that it is a huge problem, it ought to be tackled but there are conflicting figures.  We were informed that the figure concerned is £350 million and then we were told it was another figure of £664 million.  It is a regrettable fact of life that this is the present state of tax collection.  Nonetheless, while it is there and has been there for years, I know it is something the Government will continue to counteract and they will <Col N="1243" /> endeavour to get in as much of the money as they can.</P>
    <P>May I refer briefly to a point I made on the Companies (No. 2) Bill in regard to tax collection?  It is a point which I feel is of concern to a number of companies who found themselves in trouble over the past few years and eventually going into liquidation.  I refer to the fact that the Collector General enjoys preferential treatment in this kind of situation.  That is something that might be considered and perhaps reviewed.  Perhaps this is to some extent contributing to the general tardiness &mdash; if you like &mdash; in the collection of taxes.  In other words, the Revenue Commissioners and the Collector General's staff are aware that they have preferential treatment in respect of any sums owing by any company within 12 months of its going into liquidation.  I am sure the Minister for Finance will not agree with me but I have to suggest that it might be reviewed.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the trading houses.  The decision to set up trading houses to encourage more small companies to get into exports is one of the very significant new proposals in the Bill and is certainly one that I welcome.</P>
    <P>The question of DIRT tax or retention tax has been referred to.  It is a problem which the Minister inherited together with the anomalies and problems it brought with it.  DIRT tax, as we know, was introduced by the previous Government. I well remember the controversy at the time and now, one and a half years further on, there is still an element of controversy about it.  At the time bank managers smiled at the figure the then Minister suggested would be brought into the coffers of the Government knowing, as they did, that the figures would be dramatically increased and knowing that the figures the then Minister for Finance was suggesting were dramatically understated. The flight of the £1.5 billion from the economy was partially due to the DIRT tax.  There is no doubt about that. There were other factors as well, the general air of unease with regard to <Col N="1244" /> accounts of residents and of non-residents, doubts about confidentiality and lack of confidentiality.  It all tended to make people with money invested uneasy and, in my opinion, they withdrew it for that reason.  We all know that the Isle of Man bank deposits increased in 12 months.  From 29 January 1986 until Christmas Isle of Man deposits increased from £1.5 billion to £2.3 billion.  I suggest that 90 per cent of that was Irish money, if not more, money from Irish banks, building societies and so on.  This leakage was a new phenomenon in our economy. We must get that money back because the return of these funds would bring significant benefit and would have a major impact on our interest rates.</P>
    <P>The anomalies and problems which exist in relation to the DIRT tax are something the Minister might examine.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, will take note of that.  I would like to refer to two points.  The first is the case of a person, Mr. X, over 65 years of age.  He has a contributory pension and he has a small &mdash; perhaps employer's &mdash; pension, giving him a nil tax liability.  The second is the case of Mr. Y, with a similar contributory pension and with an amount equal to Mr. X's employer's pension by way of an investment income.  He is treated totally differently from Mr. X.  In other words, income from investment is treated differently from all other forms of income.  To encourage people to save I think this must be examined and I ask the Minister to do so.</P>
    <P>Persons over 65 years and incapacitated persons who are exempt from paying income tax can claim a refund of the DIRT tax.  They go to their bank, or their post office, or building society, and they get a certificate of interest on request.  Then they are asked to contact their nearest tax office.  This is fine if you live in a town which has a tax office but if you live in a remote area it can be a problem.  Unfortunately &mdash; I would ask for clarification on this point &mdash; the Revenue Commissioners may reserve the right to take account of the depositor's tax liability for previous years.  This will almost certainly cause problems and <Col N="1245" /> delay the refund.  I know it is causing problems.  I know many pensioners who are not even bothering to look for their refund because they find the procedure cumbersome and awkward.</P>
    <P>I have an example here of a famous or infamous local authority member for over 40 years, former Councillor Waters from Athlone, who knows better than anyone how to beat the system legally.  It took him almost three months to get his refund of £61 from the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; and he lives in a town where there is a tax office.  I ask the Minister to have his officials prepare an easy, simple formula for old age pensioners and people who have a nil tax liability to enable them to get their 35 per cent retention tax back in the easiest possible manner.  They are our senior citizens. They have paid thousands of pounds to the State over the years in taxes of all kinds.  They were rightly advised to put their money into a building society, or a post office, or a bank rather than keep it at home because of the danger of robbery. Now, while they are not penalised &mdash; the system is there for them but it is cumbersome &mdash; they find the filling in of forms and so on an awkward business.  I ask the Minister to prepare a simple, no hassle arrangement which would be of benefit to this type of person.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the increase in stamp duty on life assurance premiums. Wearing my insurance hat, I have to indicate an interest.  The rationale behind considering a lower rate of stamp duty on single premiums paid to life assurance offices in respect of pension is basically as follows.  In practice, many self-employed people make a series of occasional lump sum payments of varying amounts to retirement annuities, to suit their own particular cash flow.  A charge of 3 per cent on each contribution is far higher than was ever intended or felt to be reasonable.  Single premium payments are generally made to accelerate the state of funding of an arrangement so as to enhance its security and reduce potential increases in cost at a later stage.  This 3 per cent charge is a deterrent to such form of prudence which is being encouraged <Col N="1246" /> by various current initiatives from the National Pensions Board and from accountancy and actuarial bodies.</P>
    <P>We all have a duty to get the finances of this country in order.  We need only to look at countries not so far from us to see what they have done.  Government expenditure and the amount of Government borrowing must be reduced as a condition of stimulating growth, investment and employment.  Firm action in controlling Government expenditure and borrowing is vitally necessary &mdash; not very popular but necessary &mdash; if we are to create a general climate of initiative, enterprise and to inspire confidence in our ability to overcome our economic difficulties.  Of course there will always be people who will object, criticise and have a differing view from the Government of the day but the vast majority of the Irish public at this point in time have accepted this kind of budget.  They are genuinely concerned about the future and they want the finances of the country put on a proper, secure basis.  Whatever their own preference might be, they recognise that the approach this Government have taken is the only possible way to deal with this situation in which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>We are a small country with over 19 per cent of our population unemployed, and with a national output per head of population only 70 per cent that of the EC average.  The main focus of all our efforts should be to ensure the creation of a climate which will attract more people to establish enterprises.  That is what the budget and the Finance Bill, which gives legal effect to the budget, are about.  I hope, for all of our sakes, we will be successful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I was in another House for four and a half years.  During that time, while the then Government tried to act in a responsible fashion, it was said repeatedly by the Opposition that we were supporting Thatcherite policies, monetary policies, that we were an uncaring Government, interested only in book-keeping exercises.  How many times have we heard that?  We were a book-keeping Government, we were told by the Taoiseach. During the election Fianna Fáil totally rejected the budget proposals of the outgoing Government and told the people there was a better way.  Now the Minister tells us people realise that we have to change direction.  If the Government were responsible in Opposition things would be different.</P>
      <P>I did not think Senator Fallen would touch on the retention tax but he devoted a substantial part of his speech to it.  It was the policy of the present Administration in Opposition to abolish retention tax.  Then we were told just after the election: &ldquo;We have changed our minds on that&rdquo;.  If Senator Fallon wants to solve the problems he mentioned in his speech he should get the Government to support the policies they had in Opposition.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a number of points on the Finance Bill. I welcome the provisions contained in section 4, which enable Irish people working abroad to repatriate savings without being liable to Irish tax.  Some Irish emigrants are in the happy position, through their skills and hard work, of being able to earn substantial sums abroad which, hopefully, they will use to start a business and create employment and wealth in their own country at some future date.  In the meantime this section will make it attractive for these people to maintain their savings in Irish pounds and help the beleaguered Irish balance of payments under the time honoured and not to be sneered heading of emigrant remittances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also glad that the Minister in <Col N="1248" /> extending the relief in respect of dividends received out of 10 per cent of corporation tax profits from £7,000 to £9,000 relief has accepted that this was one of the far-sighted provisions included in the 1986 Act by the former Administration. Another measure introduced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy John Bruton, in the 1986 Finance Act was income tax relief for investment in corporate trades also known as the business expansion scheme.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the amendment in section 8 (b) which provides for the right of election for tax relief in the year in which a person makes an investment in a designated fund rather than in the year the qualifying shares are purchased by the fund.  I am informed that this removes a significant administrative obstacle to the efficient management of such funds.  I am a strong believer in the use by the public of a designated fund as a vehicle for investing in the business expansion scheme.  It not only spreads the risk for the investor in what is invariably a high risk investment but also provides a convenient and efficient administrative vehicle for both the investor and the qualifying company.  Most important, reputable designated funds can provide vital management of financial skills to young companies which increases their chances of success.</P>
    <P>As envisaged by Deputy John Bruton, when he introduced this provision, only the fusion of capital and managerial and entrepreneurial skills carried on in a sufficient volume in all the productive sectors of the economy and accompanied by a stable economic environment can bring the economy back to the path of economic growth from which it was so wantonly derailed by the reckless policies of the Fianna Fáil Government in the years 1977-81.  Such a painstaking process cannot be replaced by hype or by the announcement of large flashy and costly ventures which if past experience is any guide, often fail at great cost to the Exchequer and the national morale.  I emphasise this because I am not satisfied that the Government have learned anything in this regard from past experience. <Col N="1249" /> Judging by the recent press reports in relation to a project recently announced in the meat industry this is a very expensive project which may do little except replace employment in one factory as against another, massively financed by State and EC subsidies.</P>
    <P>I deeply resent also the way the recipients of such State largesse ridiculed the work of a distinguished politician of my party.  It is a case in my view of sneering all the way to the bank.  I also strenuously object to the introduction, particularly in such an obvious, selective and <i>ad hoc</i> fashion, of section 25 of this Bill, which is obviously designed to facilitate the same project.  Such short term and expensive measures, combined with political pressure on industrial development authorities, for someone who played a political role for Fianna Fáil prior to the last election, are symptoms of Fianna Fáil's political policy.  This country has a sad future under Fianna Fáil Government and the prevailing cynicism with regard to politicians will be more deeply entrenched forever in people's minds.</P>
    <P>I believe that section 12 of the Bill, the withholding tax on professional services, is a grave mistake.  If the Government and Revenue Commissioners felt that the collection of income tax from certain professional groups was a cause of concern they should have addressed the problem directly by taking strong measures in relation to the collection of that tax.  I would support such measures.</P>
    <P>I will not restate the point often made in relation to the need to distinguish between a firm's revenue and taxable revenue. I believe, however, that for many professionals and their firms this provision will result in grievous loss of cashflow causing unemployment and hardship.  Many professional firms are already badly affected by their inability to collect fees for work done due to the general recession and the lack of money in the economy.  For many professional firms, particularly those in the building industry, the gravy train stopped a long time ago but the Minister seems to be unaware of it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of a tax <Col N="1250" /> provision in sections 11 and 27 in relation to export trading houses.  I caution however, that the development of deeds and titles will be a relatively slow process and I urge the Government to accept this and encourage their development with sound, long term measures rather than fly-by-night ventures, failure of which would only discredit what would be a worthwhile concept.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Doyle's remarks are a model of expedition, so much so that they have caught me on the hop.  It is always interesting to speak on a Finance Bill if for no other reason that that I find myself consistently over the year having to reiterate certain misconceptions which most of my colleagues in this House and the other House have about the nature of Irish taxation, the scale of Irish taxation, the equity of Irish taxation and, indeed, the relative burden of taxation that we carry in this country.</P>
      <P>It needs to be said because people &mdash; particularly new right economists of the Paul Tansey variety &mdash; are beginning to challenge many of the assumptions which most members of political parties in this country still hold that taxation is, of itself, both a necessary and a good thing in a society because of the objectives it achieves, the first objective being that it finances the necessary services of the State whether they be in the area of security, infrastructure, investment or in the area of services and that public expenditure via taxation does a lot of good in our society.  The same individual I just mentioned &mdash; it is invidious to mention individuals but journalists perhaps have to live with this and when they feel free to do it about us I feel free to do it about journalists &mdash; questioned the inherent value of public expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me give one specific example to this House about the inherent value of public expenditure.  I will quote from the <i>OECD Observer</i> of April-May 1987. They produce a fascinating set of statistics. One of the favourite targets of the new right economists of the ilk of the same individual has been to suggest that we have spent more and more on our <Col N="1251" /> health services and we are no healthier than we were before.  That statement made by a considerable number of economists is either a deliberate untruth or reflects a level of professional incompetence on their part which, if politicians showed it the electorate would deal with very effectively at the next election.  I repeat, they are either totally incompetent or they are telling lies.</P>
    <P>Let me give a very specific example of how our quite substantial, and painful to pay for very often expenditure on the health services has worked to our advantage. We have an infant mortality rate &mdash; I keep on reiterating this because it needs to be said in this country &mdash; of 8.9 deaths per 1,000 live births.  That infant mortality rate rates with the best in the world. When you consider that we quite rightly do not allow abortion and therefore pregnancies that are liable to be difficult, that are liable to produce unhealthy or seriously-malformed infants are not terminated and, therefore, all confirmed pregnancies are allowed to go the full term and when you consider that we are comparing statistics with countries which do approve of termination of pregnancy, that figure is even more impressive. When you add on to that the fact that that figure is a clear 1.6 per thousand lower than that of the United States, it proves that our health expenditure was worthwhile.  The infant mortality rate in the United States of America is 10.6 per thousand.  The infant mortality rate in this country that has about one quarter of the GNP of the United States is 8.9 per thousand.  I defy any economist to tell me money spent to do that is money wasted by the Irish State and the Irish people.</P>
    <P>The problem with infant mortality is that it does not rate as a measure of lost production, it does not rate as a measure of lost value and, therefore, as far as an economist is concerned, the infant mortality rate is not measured in economic statistics.  It is a very important human statistic and one that justifies high <Col N="1252" /> levels of expenditure in the health services. I do not believe any country with a large privatised health service, the United States being a classic example, can produce those sort of figures.  They are four times as rich and they still have a higher infant mortality rate than we have.</P>
    <P>I say that, a Chathaoirligh, not because I want to go off onto a long tangent about the health cutbacks &mdash; and whatever my own inclination is I am aware at this stage that you would not let me anyway &mdash; but because I want to reiterate the principle that public expenditure is a good thing. It seems to be in question now that the idea of using the resources of the State to provide necessary services for people is a good thing, that the idea of using taxation to raise revenue to pay for things that people would otherwise not be able to afford is a good thing.  It seems astonishing that in Seanad Éireann one has to say these things.  There is such an assault on the very principle of redistributive public expenditure that they need to be said again.</P>
    <P>I want to look very briefly at the problem of the public finances.  It has characterised a lot of the rhetoric as distinct from the talk, or the argument, or the logic of the Irish left, that they try to pretend that they can talk their way out of the country's indebtedness crisis.  One of the very valuable things contributed by the NESC report last year on the national debt was that it forced various interest groups to look at facts that might have been unpalatable to them.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement were forced to acknowledge the fact that the level of national debt was in danger of spiralling out of control and would, therefore, have to be brought under control. The industrialists and the employers on the same body had to acknowledge that if you are going to deal with public expenditure you cannot pick on what employers would regard as easy or soft targets; it must be based on fundamental principles of equity in our society.  What precisely the farming community acknowledge I am not quite certain yet, because they <Col N="1253" /> never acknowledge that they owe anybody a living, a debt, or anything.  I must say I cannot say on that issue.  I have heard trade unionists frequently accept the need to accept restraints in public finances, to accept economies, changes, cutbacks.  I have yet to hear similar acceptances by the farming community. The farming community's view seems to be: &ldquo;Everybody else should cut back but we are different.  We need more.  Everybody else must have less.&rdquo;  The trade union movement have been remarkably responsible in this, though I think the limits of their responsibility and their tolerance are rapidly being reached.</P>
    <P>I accept that the public finances have to be restored to order.  Anybody who read the NESC report last year will recognise that we are very close to a dangerous spiral of interest and indebtedness which could fundamentally undermine our public finances.  I want to say that the fact that it could happen, and possibly might happen if matters continue uncontrolled, is a long way from the Brazil, Mexico, Poland scenario those same right wing commentators have quite unjustifiably used to describe this country.  We are not in the position Poland is in; we are not in the position Brazil is in; we are not in the position Mexico is in.  We are not in that league and it is downright unpatriotic for Irish Government Ministers, including one former Minister for Finance, from Fine Gael, Deputy Bruton, to say we were as badly off and as publicly indebted as Brazil, Mexico, or Poland.  That is unpatriotic.  It was also damned bad politics by a senior politician.</P>

      <P>University graduates are far too clever for that, Senator Fallon. Witness the quality sitting on the benches here.  The fundamental fact I want to reiterate is that we have a crisis.  It has to be tackled and it needs to be tackled and, in the process of tackling it, all of us would have our various vested interests or various precious little projects threatened. There is no doubt about that, but such an attack has to be based on a perception of justice in society.  It has to be based on a perception that people have that everybody is carrying a fair share of the burden.</P>
      <P>That is not something people have seen.  Part of the reason for that is that the final political willingness to deal with this crisis only really emerged some time around last November when the financial institutions passed a vote of no confidence in the state of the public finances and funds began to flow out of the country in enormous sums.  There are two questions that need to be asked about that. The first is: did these huge outflows flow out legally or illegally?  I thought we had exchange control regulations in this country. Yet we had a flight of funds in two or three weeks on a scale that suggests it could not have gone via any exchange control regulations and that a large part of it was done without that.</P>
      <P>The extraordinary thing is that bankers and people like that are much given to giving lectures about public spirit, public service, patriotism etc.  So are many of their political allies, but the same people have absolutely no compunction about breaking the law in the defence of their own little financial interests.  So the money flew out; interest rates flew up; the £ was under pressure and certain commitments were made by the previous Government which are now being fulfilled by this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the unfortunate political consequences of the diktats of the financial markets is that the cutbacks must be made in the areas approved of and, dealing with the national debt, must be in the manner approved of by the financial <Col N="1255" /> markets.  That means, of course, that those areas that have been targeted for cutbacks are the ones which must be cut. We have had dictated to us a mythology, the same right wing mythology, that the real crisis in the public finances is a crisis based on providing services for ourselves that we could not afford.  We have been told that we are living beyond our means, that we have given ourselves services in the areas of social services, health and education that are beyond what we could legitimately afford.  That might have been true some years ago.  There is an argument that the Fianna Fáil Government from 1977 to 1981 were ringing up health boards and hospitals saying: &ldquo;Please take on more people.  We have promises to keep and a long way to go before we sleep&rdquo;, and so on.  There is considerable evidence to that effect.  That was ten years ago.</P>
    <P>The position is that, at the present level of public expenditure, if debt service costs were removed from the total burden of current public expenditure, public finances would be in surplus.  The last figure the previous Minister for Finance mentioned was £700 million or £800 million. In other words, if we did not have to pay off those debts, we would have a surplus to the tune of £700 million or £800 million in the public finances, equivalent roughly to 40 per cent of income tax. We could pay for everything we have at present and reduce income tax by 40 per cent, or we could improve the services and also have a substantial reduction in income tax.  If debt service is removed it is quite clear that what we are spending on health, education, welfare, security and so on is not such an enormous proportion of our total resources.</P>
    <P>The problem is debt servicing.  That may well necessitate cutbacks in some of those areas.  We are not providing excessively high quality services for the State in terms of what the country can afford.  At the core of that fact is the shock that politicians in various parties have suffered when they discovered what cutbacks in health really mean.  The truth is <Col N="1256" /> that we have minimal standards of welfare, health care, education, etc.  When you start to cut them, believing, as many people do because the right wing economists have had a field day for the past four years, that there is a whole lot of wasteful expenditure, they bite so deeply because there are no spare services, no fat which can be cut back.  The basic facts of public expenditure demonstrate that. We do not spend excessively large amounts of money on health, education, or welfare.</P>
    <P>The fundamental flaw in the strategy of this Government and the previous Government is to assume that there is a large area of public expenditure which is excessive to our needs and that we can provide basic health and welfare services and cut at the same time.  The truth is that, if we take debt service out of what the Government are spending, we spend quite a small proportion of our GNP on public services.  People do not like those figures.</P>
    <P>Let me give another example of the sort of distortions that are foisted upon us.  We are told, for instance, that we are burdened down with a huge Civil Service. The same economists would have us believe that the Garda, the Army, teachers, doctors and nurses in public service are all civil servants.  This is another untruth.  I heard a prominent economist use public service pay as a measure of the cost of administering the health services, whereas public service pay involves the salaries of teachers, doctors, nurses, gardaí, the Army and so on.  The truth is that the real Civil Service, the white collar Civil Service, as a percentage of the total population in Ireland is 2.2 per cent, in Germany is 4 per cent, in the Netherlands is 2.4 per cent.  I am quoting from the document produced by the Irish Tax Officials Union and the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants. Unfortunately the pages are not numbered so I cannot give a page number.  Our Civil Service is proportionately quite small.  If you begin to cut lumps out of our Civil Service by embargoes on recruitment, inevitably you end up with large gaping holes in the <Col N="1257" /> service, the most obvious being in the area of revenue collection.</P>
    <P>It is quite astonishing that Margaret Thatcher's Government, in spite of everything else they did, increased recruitment, employment and numbers in the area of revenue collection in order to improve the quality of revenue collection in Britain.  Irish Governments successfully have reduced the workforce in the area of revenue collection.  How we can have an equitable, fair and efficient tax system if we keep on reducing the numbers of people working there and at the same time increase the complexity of the revenue collection service is beyond me to figure out.  It is getting close to the position where one has to believe that large sections of both the Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil Parties are by a process of nods and winks giving covert approval to tax evasion on a grand scale.  If they did not, they would have guaranteed the recruitment of large numbers of people into the Revenue Commissioners to ensure that certain things were meant.</P>
    <P>Let me give an example of the sort of things that need to be dealt with.  I am quoting from the document produced by the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants and the Irish Tax Officials Union.  It stated:</P>
    <P>Three times as many traders in the United Kingdom pay their tax on time as in Ireland.  Ninety-five per cent of UK employers pay their PAYE liabilities on time, whereas only 33.5 per cent of Irish employers do.  Sixty per cent of UK traders pay their VAT liabilities on time whereas only 24 per cent of Irish traders do.</P>
    <P>This is not the trader's money.  This is the money that his customer paid when the service or goods were being provided by the trader.  It is not a question of money coming out of his pocket.</P>
    <P>Those are the sort of figures that demonstrate how inept the quality of our tax collection is.  That springs directly from the unwillingness to put the staff into it.  I defy somebody in Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael to explain to me how they can justify reducing employment in the area <Col N="1258" /> of revenue collection at a stage when the country desperately needs every single penny of revenue that can be generated.</P>
    <P>The second area in terms of revenue collection that needs to be dealt with and that comes back similarly to the paucity of revenue collectors, of staff in the Revenue Commissioners, is the area of the black economy.  I do not know how big the black economy is or how small it is, but I have here a range of estimates from a variety of sources, the Irish Banking Review, an economist for the ESRI, an article in <i>Business and Finance</i>, and so on.  They all vary between £500 million and £1,500 million.  That is lost revenue of between £200 million and £600 million. Six hundred million pounds is about half the current budget deficit.  By simply ensuring that those who are gainfully employed in this country and not paying tax were required to pay their taxes, we could halve the budget deficit.  What do we do?  We reduce employment in the area of the State which could do something about that.  It suggests a deliberate decision by those in Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael who have dominated this area in our society for the past 60 years to look after their friends in business, trade and agriculture by simply not putting the resources in to make sure that those friends paid up on time and in full.</P>
    <P>That brings me onto another area of potential revenue gathering, that is, agriculture. I have frequently stood up here and talked about earnings from agriculture and been contradicted by various people who, while they would not accept the term, seemed to be nothing more than a lobby to guarantee that their farming friends would never pay income tax. I have decided that something I found well over a year ago should be put on the record.  This is an article from <i>Irish Farmers Monthly</i> of January 1986.  It is to do with farm incomes, and so on. These are not the sort of figures that are normally published.  We normally get the old average farm income of £3,000.  That is an average income distributed over 215,000 people who classify themselves as farmers.</P>
    <P>You get the total agricultural income <Col N="1259" /> and you divide it by 215,000 and you get an average income of £3,000 a year.  You get the impression that the IFA are vigorously and with great purpose defending the rights of these poor people earning on average £3,000 per annum.  The truth is, of course, that there are not much more than about 70,000 or 80,000 full time farmers.  Of the 215,000, between 100,000 and 140,000 have other employment. They are only part time farmers. Therefore, to look on their income from farming as their entire income is a total distortion.  These figures are directly taken from the figures of the Agricultural Institute, though the author of the article, Willie Ryan, said that the Agricultural Institute does not highlight these matters when it publishes farm income statistics. The top 30,000 Irish farmers in 1984 had annual incomes averaging £18,500.  The remaining 185,000 farmers had incomes averaging just over £3,000.  The top 30,000 &mdash; about 14 per cent of farmers &mdash; account for just half the total income coming from farming.  These are large figures.  This is big money.  Crudely, 30,000 multiplied by £20,000 gives a little less than £600 million being earned by the top 14 per cent of farmers.</P>
    <P>Because I was curious I did a little exercise on this last year which is relevant today.  I made a few comparisons. The top 15,500 farmers earn on average £24,000 per annum according to the Agricultural Institute.  If they were paying PAYE, presuming that all of those farmers had three children, with only one spouse earning and therefore were entitled to all allowances accruing to the earner, those 15,500 farmers should pay £131 million in income tax.  I am using the figures supplied by the Department of Finance for last year's budget concerning the percentage of total income of a PAYE earner on £24,000 per annum that goes on income tax.  The next 13,500 farmers, who on average earn £12,500 per annum, should have paid £34½ million in income tax.  I worked through the various categories simply taking the income figures produced by the Agricultural <Col N="1260" /> Institute, using Department of Finance figures on percentages deducted for income tax.</P>
    <P>If farmers earning £6,200 and above were to pay the same proportion of their income as PAYE earners the total revenue from farming in income tax should be about £190 million &mdash; crudely £200 million.  That is precisely six times the amount which farmers pay in income tax. I defy any member of Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael to explain those figures away.  I know &mdash; and everybody knows &mdash; that there is a considerable amount of affluence in certain sections of farming.  Part of that affluence is because they know, and have known for a long time, that they will never have to pay the same proportion of their income in income tax as other sections of society.  They are the figures: £200 million accounted for, six times as much as the amount collected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will continue because I have said most of what I want to say.</P>
      <P>This is what has to be done to create a sense of equity.  There is ample evidence of a lack of equity.  In Britain, for instance, in Margaret Thatcher's enterprise economy, the corporate sector contributes about 9 per cent of State revenue.  In this country &mdash; allegedly over-taxed, penalised, disincentives, a non-enterprise economy &mdash; the corporate sector pays 3 per cent of total revenue to the State.  A three times greater proportion of the State's revenue in Britain comes from the corporate sector than comes from the corporate sector in this country.</P>
      <P>It is also interesting that the proportion of the State's revenue that came from capital taxation in the &ldquo;hungry Thirties&rdquo;, when allegedly there was nothing in this country, was about two and a half or three times as much as it is today.  That would mean about £200 million in capital taxation instead of £50 million or £60 million which is currently derived from capital taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1261" /> When you add up the amounts due from the black economy, the uncollected taxes, the delayed taxes, farming tax, and from capital taxation, you reduce a deficit of about £1,400 million or £1,500 million to around £200 million or £300 million. When you have convinced people that you will make everybody pay for the services they enjoy, then you can talk about cutbacks to balance the books.  That comes after you have created a perception of justice in society.  A perception of injustice exists, not because people are fooled, but because people are right.  The statistical evidence is there.  The trouble is that those who should be informing the people, in particular financial journalists, have their own view about how society should be organised.  That view is committed to a low tax, low public expenditure and a highly individualistic society. I believe in a high tax society with a sense of collective responsibility and a sense of moral responsibility.  That is where the two views of society differ.  My view of society is that everyone who earns an income should pay the same proportion of that income in tax, irrespective of where the income comes from.  That is a very simple view.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that many people want to tax short term social welfare benefits. If those proposals about equitable taxation were to be introduced, I would support enthusiastically the idea that income from welfare should be subject to taxation but I am damned if I will tolerate targeting social welfare recipients for further penalties while those who have surplus income, whether in farming or in business, are allowed apparently to sail whatever way they wish with virtually no prospect of being caught.  According to the Commission on Taxation, the chances of being caught for fiddling your taxes are about one in 100.  You have 99 chances out of 100 of getting away with fiddling your taxes.  Even if I did not understand free market economics that would be regarded as an acceptable risk. That is at the core of our country's problems.</P>
    <P>Finally, as there is so much talk about the state of the economy, I want again to <Col N="1262" /> put an average figure on the record.  It needs to be said yet again that this country has a quite remarkable record in a number of areas.  We have been told consistently &mdash; and it is true &mdash; that the only way we will turn our economy into a successful modern economy is by successfully selling goods and services on the international markets.  We must remember that a small businessman who sets up a small garage or a service industry which operates entirely within the economy may be helping local people but he is contributing nothing extra to the economy. He is simply moving other people's money around.  The only ways in which we can increase the total sum of wealth are by selling goods outside the country, or by creating goods that can be sold within this country or outside it, or by selling services on the international market.  We have been told frequently &mdash; and quite rightly &mdash; that we must export to do this.</P>
    <P>We have also been told frequently that one of the problems about exporting from this country is that we must retain our competitiveness.  I would not disagree with our competitiveness being retained. That is a very sensible idea.  I would disagree with the definition of competitiveness and the argument that it was lost.  We were told frequently by the previous Government &mdash; and with increasing frequency by this Government &mdash; that we must hold wages down in order to hold prices down, in order not to lose our competitiveness.  In the early years of the previous Government, we were told frequently that wage increases were eating away at our competitiveness and we were rapidly losing markets.  That is why I want to quote a couple of statistics here.</P>
    <P>First, we must remember that within the entirety of the OECD, with the exception of the Belgium-Luxembourg economic union which I do not want to get tangled in we have one of the highest exports as a percentage of our gross domestic product.  Irish export represents about 57 per cent of our gross domestic product, which is a huge percentage.  We <Col N="1263" /> are a trading nation.  We depend on international trade for our success.  The astonishing thing is that between 1980 and 1985, exports from Ireland increased by an average of 8.8 per cent by volume, not by price.  The volume of our exports increased by almost 9 per cent per annum on average between 1980 and 1985.  That is a good record.</P>
    <P>The astonishing thing is that it was happening at a time when we were being told by successive Government Ministers that we were undermining our competitiveness. The truth is we were not.  I want to know why is it that our exports increased faster between 1980 and 1985 than those of the United States, where exports actually reduced by 3.2 per cent per annum on average between 1980 and 1985.  At the height of the Reagan regime American exports were going down.  In the same period in Japan, for instance, exports increased by 7.3 per cent on average. Between 1980 and 1985 Irish exports increased faster than those of Japan.  Let me take another model country.  In the United Kingdom they increased by 3.6 per cent.</P>
    <P>If you go through the entirety of the countries of the OECD &mdash; approximately 22 countries &mdash; the country with the higherst average annual growth in exports between 1980 and 1985 was Ireland.  That part of our economy which contributes 57 per cent of our total gross domestic product increased by 9 per cent.  Since our total gross domestic product increased by only about 1 per cent, the extraordinary contraction that was taking place in our domestic market at the same time is underlined by that.  Fifty-seven per cent of our gross domestic product, averaging an increase of 9 per cent suggests an annual contraction of domestic growth of the order of 7 per cent or 8 per cent.  That contraction of gross domestic product in the home market was contributed to by wage deflation, by high taxes, by a reluctance to recruit people into the public service as well as by a number of other factors.  I invite either a spokesman for Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil &mdash; because they agree about everything as we discovered <Col N="1264" /> this afternoon &mdash; they do not have any fundamental differences anymore, other than who started what and who finished it and they are more like schoolboy or schoolgirl games than they are real politics&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been present in this country for the past 15 years and that confirms my opinion of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  It was not in this House that I heard the information which confirmed to me that there is no difference between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  It was outside this House.  There is no difference.  One of them might explain to me what percentage of annual average growth in exports they expect or hope for in order to develop this country.  Are we actually going to go further ahead of the Japanese, or is there a problem about the kind of exports we are generating?  Is there a problem about the fact that many of these exports are paper exports and, if they are, should we not rewrite the figures and tell ourselves the truth?</P>
      <P>A large part of that figure is fiction.  It is fiction which is justified because of the extraordinary tax concessions we offer to multinationals.  If it is not fiction, then we should be seeing the benefits of it.  If it is fiction we should not be producing spurious statistics.  The truth is that it appears that what we are doing is creating an industrial base via multinationals which create a very limited number of jobs and a considerable amount of wealth.  The price we pay for that considerable amount of wealth is to allow it to leave the country untrammelled by taxation restrictions.  It is time those who have thrown their eggs into the basket of attracting in large multinationals should tell the Irish people what price they are expected to pay to continue this.  There are alternative strategies which I will give in another context another day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to reiterate that the crisis we face is real and should be dealt with. There is no movement towards equity in <Col N="1265" /> taxation either in the areas of agriculture, or in the areas of how those in the non-PAYE sector are dealt with, or in the area of capital taxation.  We do not have excessive levels of expenditure in the areas of health and social services.  We cannot afford to cut back seriously. Therefore, we need to look at the strategy which creates equity, first of all.  Once equity has been established in terms of contribution to the national revenue, we can talk about dealing with the small budget deficit that would remain when equity has been introduced.</P>

      <P>The overall strategy of this year's Finance Bill is developmental in many of its aspects.  It comes at a period in this country's history when our people are reeling from the effects of a recession of monumental proportions.  As has been referred to earlier in the debate, Fianna Fáil were not in Government for much of the period since our entry into the Common Market in 1973.  Since then many of the economic problems which have faced this country have arisen.  I am not suggesting that they arose as a direct result of our entry into the Common Market but, since we got more involved at international level industrially, I remember hearing Government spokesmen bemoaning the fact that, but for the international recession, Ireland would have a better economic record.  In the last few months I have been reading that the international boom is about to be lowered after several years of growth.  To paraphrase the television commercial; &ldquo;Where is the boom gone&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People living in this country must have been amazed and very angry to learn, particularly in the past five years of belt tightening, that they have very little to show for it.  Therefore, I welcome the thrust of this Bill and must also applaud the Fine Gael Party &mdash; I am sure Senator Brendan Ryan will be delighted to hear me saying this &mdash; for recognising that there is a need for a genuine consensus on the economy and the direction we should take if we are to get ourselves out of our present difficulties.  Listening to Senator Ryan, one would think that he <Col N="1266" /> has a monopoly on expressing care and concern about the less well off.  Personally, I resent the implication in Senator Ryan's remarks and suggest to him that there are many people on this side of the House who are as concerned as he is about the less well off and about aspects of our economy, in particular in the tax collection area.  On this side of the House we have what I would call responsible compassion for the vulnerable sections of our society.  People have been crying out for strong Government, together with an acknowledgement that the mistakes of the past decade cannot be rectified all at once.</P>
    <P>I believe that the people of this country have, in this Administration, people who are showing a strong and resolute determination to root out the underlying causes of our economic difficulties.  The Finance Bill is a good start to this process. We have been living beyond our means for a long period of time.  It was inevitable that there had to be a day of reckoning. The time had to come when a Government had to say in relation to a high degree of public expenditure: &ldquo;Thus far and no further&rdquo;.  That day has dawned, and in this year of Our Lord 1987 the cutbacks, particularly in public expenditure, will cause a certain amount of reaction from people who perhaps thought that they were getting services free.  The reality was that there never were any free services as such because ultimately the taxpayer was paying for them.  With public expenditure going out of control over a period of years it was inevitable that the day of reckoning would come.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Government on recognising their responsibility in this area to start to put things right.  Apart from the inevitable cutbacks in public expenditure they have also adopted a developmental approach to the thrust of their economic policy.  They have proved a certain impetus to the economy in key areas, specifically tourism.  For many years we have been hearing that tourism was the second most important industry in Ireland.  Yet there did not seem to be the same emphasis or importance <Col N="1267" /> attached to developing our vast tourism potential as there had been, for example, in the area of agriculture or of industrial development.</P>
    <P>A proper, balanced and imaginative proposal or series of proposals in the area of tourism is to be welcomed.  The tourism proposals were announced in the Bill, or subsequent to the Bill's publication, in order to attract more people here from Britain.  In reading some of the Irish newspapers that circulate in Britain I noticed that a number of Irish people, I am sad to say, referred to some of these proposals as being nothing other than cosmetic.  That is rather sad.  There is a genuine attempt being made by this Government &mdash; and it has been recognised by all sides of the House and, indeed, outside this House &mdash; for the first time in many decades, or certainly since tourism became such a growth area, to try to generate more income through tourism and at the same time claw back a great deal of tourist traffic which was lost to this country over the past ten to 15 years because of a perceived and a real recognition and acknowledgement that this country was pricing itself out of the tourist market.</P>
    <P>I regret that the proposals in relation to petrol vouchers, where £10 is being given to the first 20,000 potential travellers from the London area to visit Ireland, is being criticised in some of the Irish newspapers in Britain and that the overall thrust of the Government's policy towards tourism is also being criticised. The benefits on the ground of the introduction of such items as the petrol vouchers scheme, and the change in the attitudes of various international airlines flying in and out of this country have produced very beneficial effects.  I have no doubt that the tourism figures this year will show a substantial increase.  They are already, over the first number of months of this year, beginning to show a substantial increase, particularly from the British market.  Britain is our nearest neighbour.  There has been a long, happy and traditional relationship between the British tourist and ourselves, not just <Col N="1268" /> from the ethnic market but also from the traditional British holidaymaker.  Sadly, due to historical circumstances as they affect Northern Ireland and this part of the island, we have lost a great deal of that market.  I hope it will return.  In fact, that is already happening.  That aspect of the Finance Bill is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Tax reform is the great catch cry. Everybody would like to see tax reform. They would like to see tax reform which would satisfy all aspects and all sides of society.  They would like to see tax reform that would please those who are earning great sums of money and do not wish to have to pay and tax reform that would help the less well off and the lower paid. I hate to use a term such as &ldquo;the growing middle classes&rdquo; in a consensus society such as Ireland is.  I do not think we are a class society.  I would hate to think that we will ever become a class society.  There is a vast body of people who are referred to generally as being the middle class. They are young married people or those who have small families on fixed incomes who, because of spiralling costs over the last number of years, have found themselves caught in this trap and are looking to the Government to help them out of their difficulties.  In that context the proposal to which the Government is committed &mdash; and, indeed, it was mentioned in the Fianna Fáil manifesto before the election and subsequently reiterated in Government &mdash; that ultimately two-thirds of the income taxpayers will be paying the standard rate of tax is an aspiration that one hopes will very quickly become a reality, whenever budgetary provisions allow.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of publicity surrounding the amounts of outstanding tax.  Indeed, the Minister earlier referred to what he called exaggerated claims in some instances where it was suggested that there were such huge amounts of tax outstanding.  It was suggested that if all of it were to be collected and if everybody was to go about his business in the Revenue Commissioners Office to the best of his ability &mdash; all of this money could be brought in and, at the end of the day, we would have so much money that we <Col N="1269" /> would have solved all our problems.  The Minister said that this is an exaggeration. We must look at the way tax is collected, particularly among the self-employed, the non-PAYE sector where the Revenue Commissioners operate on an assessment basis and decide how much they think one owes.  The procedure is that unless one responds within a given time and tells them that that amount is not owed then that figure stays on the statistics book.  I am not in any way underestimating the problems of tax evasion and tax collection.  The Minister said there has been considerable misunderstanding about the scale of arrears, and that some of the figures mentioned are wild exaggerations.  He admits that uncollected tax is a serious problem and any tax reform package must incorporate measures to improve collection.  He also notes that significant progress has been made in recent years and that there must be further improvement.  This is a priority with the Government.</P>
    <P>I suggest that statements being made about the amounts of tax outstanding make good headlines.  It is a headline for the hard-pressed PAYE sector.  They look at a national newspaper or watch television, or listen to the radio, and see that £600 million is outstanding in tax, but the real figure is considerably less than that.  That figure is based on an assessment.  That assessment is the initial process where somebody in the non-PAYE sector is involved leading to an agreement where they pay their taxes. That sort of publicity is not in the public interest.  All it does is stir up envy.  It creates a situation where the PAYE taxpayer genuinely believes, as is the case now, that those in the self-employed area are getting away with murder.</P>
    <P>I accept that there are abuses of tax in this country as there are in every country where a tax collection system exists.  I am not so sure that it is in the public interest that there should be further divisiveness in what is essentially a small country.  We are a tightly-knit society.  We need to be pulling together and not against each other.  I might add that when it comes to the question of tax reform one wonders <Col N="1270" /> who should benefit.  We have seen, over the last few years in Britain, where those who are the rich and famous have benefited by reductions in the higher rate of income tax.  We have also seen where the vast majority of those who are on low salaries seem to be paying more.  It goes without saying that this party &mdash; and I would like to think that most responsible politicians&mdash;would be committed, in any area of tax reform, to initially helping those who are the most vulnerable &mdash; the lower paid and the less well off.</P>
    <P>It is rather interesting that the British Treasury commissioned a survey which has not yet been published.  This survey was commissioned from Professor C.V. Browne.  He concluded that the extra incentive to work harder as a result of a tax cut was offset by the fact that a tax cut offered more cash for the same amount of work.  He made the point that after all we are all human.  It is just a small point in relation to those who talk in terms of tax cuts.  The whole area of tax reform is a complex one and is one that, obviously, will not be dealt with in any great detail today or, indeed, in the context of this Finance Bill.  Perhaps the time will come &mdash;and I hope it is not too far off &mdash; when there will be a very serious look at how to bring about equitable tax reform.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the Finance Bill is the question of the transfer of moneys from people living abroad into this country. I welcome the proposal whereby this money from overseas residents will not be subject to tax.  It is amazing that over the past number of years, perhaps since the introduction of the DIRT tax last year, perhaps as a result of a distorted interpretation, or perhaps because of the fact that, sadly, in Britain not a great deal of news about Ireland or Irish affairs percolates through the British media, there has grown up a misunderstanding about this new tax regime and about the whole question of deposits of money in this country by non-residents.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that, when the Finance Bill eventually becomes law, this aspect of it might be looked at in the context of better information.  All of us would agree that the more money that <Col N="1271" /> comes into this country the better this economy and this country will be as a result.  We have, sadly in one respect, a substantial number of Irish people living in Britain &mdash; I refer to Britain primarily &mdash; who have done well for themselves.  I say &ldquo;sadly&rdquo; because they are doing well for themselves over there and not doing well for themselves over here.  Equally, it should be a cause for great joy in another respect, particularly where it comes to surplus funds.  Having been a former emigrant, I know there is an underlying affection for this country, despite the circumstances in which some people might have had to leave it.  Those who have done well and who have surplus funds are willing, and indeed are anxious, that this money should be deposited in Ireland and used for the benefit of the economy, as well, of course, as getting them a prime interest rate.  I would not want to give the impression that these people are only concerned about a good prime interest rate: they do have the interest of this country at heart.</P>
    <P>Over the past six months I have been making some inquiries and, as a result of representations that have been made to me on my frequent trips to England, it is clear that there is a doubt about the status of these funds.  I suggest to the Minister that perhaps there should be a better publicity campaign, through, for example, a newspaper such as the <i>Irish Post</i> in Britain, which has a very high readership, which is the newspaper of the Irish in Britain and is read by all sections of the Irish in Britain right across England, Scotland and Wales.  Perhaps there should be an information campaign specifically directed at people who have surplus funds and who would like to invest them in this country but who have an idea that in doing so they are open to all sorts of tax restrictions: (a) that they are going to be taxed on their money; and (b), that if they leave their money in here they will not get it out again.  That sort of doubt and rumour should be dispelled in the interests of the country generally. In welcoming that section, I feel it is not enough for it just to be in the <Col N="1272" /> legislation.  As I said earlier, since a great deal of news about this country does not percolate down to the average Irish person living in Britain, I suggest that there is a responsibility on the Department of Finance to publicise that aspect of their proposals in more detail.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the Finance Bill which claw back 10 per cent of mortgage tax relief have not met with universal acceptance. Opponents of it have been particularly vociferous, naturally enough, among those who have only taken on mortgages over the last couple of years. Their attitude has been that the Government have accommodated them as potential home owners by saying that, if they took out a mortgage, the Government would give them tax relief on it.  They have gone through that process.  They have committed themselves to mortgages of 15, 20, 25 years at very substantial rates of interest, and they are now being told that 10 per cent of that tax relief will be taken back.  It is not so much that they are annoyed or worried about the 10 per cent.  The concern that has been expressed to me is that it is the thin edge of the wedge, that this Government have succumbed to the Civil Service mandarins, whoever these faceless people we hear about may be; that it is a proposal that has been on the table in the Department of Finance and has been looked at by successive Finance Ministers over the past ten years and they shied away from it, but that this Government have now decided to go ahead with it.</P>
    <P>I can understand the reasons, because we need money and we need to get money from sources such as tax relief being given.  The argument goes that 10 per cent is not very much.  After all, there is a move afoot and a proposal from various sectors of the society that this mortgage tax relief should be done away with altogether, that it is unfair.  Indeed, I have heard this expressed by members of the Labour Party.  I hope the 10 per cent will be all that we will hear about in terms of a clawback in that area until such time as the engine of the economy gets fully oiled and working again, when more money and more wealth are being created.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1273" /> As things stand at the moment, the vast majority of people who are on mortgages are the people I referred to earlier on fixed incomes; and any changes in their monthly financial commitments &mdash; and 10 per cent may seem like a small amount &mdash; are significant.  One had only to hear the sigh of relief that went around over the past few weeks when the building societies and the banks announced that they were reducing mortgage rates by 1 per cent.  To some people who are not on mortgages 1 per cent may not seem a lot. But it is quite a considerable amount to a family who are budgeting on a pounds shillings and pence basis.  I would not want to give the impression that I would be against the idea in principle, but I would find it difficult to sit down without expressing the concern of many people who feel that this is the thin edge of the wedge.</P>
    <P>The business expansion scheme is to be welcomed.  It gives an opportunity to people &mdash; entrepreneurs, banks, insurance companies, those with money &mdash; to invest in schemes which will ultimately be of benefit to the country, the incentive being that the investment is tax free.</P>
    <P>I must welcome the imaginative initiative taken by the Minister for Finance in the past few days in extending the business expansion scheme to the film industry. The film industry has been in a sense a Cinderella industry in this country for the past number of years.  It has amazed me that successive Governments &mdash; and here I am talking about both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael-Labour Administrations &mdash; have not looked at this area in more detail until now.  Basically the Government are attempting to create an investment climate for an indigenous film industry.  We have all applauded down through the years the wonderful beneficial publicity this country has received from, for example, films such as &ldquo;Ryan's Daughter&rdquo;, which I heard Senator Bulbulia refer to earlier.  While that in itself was a marvellous achievement, consider the one movie which has had the most beneficial effect in terms of bringing people into this country &mdash; perhaps for <Col N="1274" /> the wrong reasons in that at the time, and subsequently it created a distortion of the real Ireland.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Quiet Man&rdquo;, was filmed in the West of Ireland in some of the most beautiful countryside around Maam Cross in Connemara and in parts of Mayo.  While at the time it was filmed in the early fifties perhaps it distorted the reality of a growing, developing Ireland, yet it still had a truth about it in regard to parts of the country.  But, certainly, to look at &ldquo;The Quiet Man&rdquo; today and compare the Ireland of 30 years ago with the Ireland of today, it certainly is a distortion.  However, the reality is that that one single film, that one piece of celluloid, attracted more American people to this country than any one single promotional act by Bord Fáilte since they were first set up.</P>
    <P>I only use that as an illustration of the vital importance of the film industry to this country.  It is not only what the film itself can generate in terms of income by being distributed around the world, but the spin-off advantages to this country can be immense.  For example, the Australian film industry, which was practically non-existent ten years ago, is now looked on as one of the premier industries in Australia.  Those of you who remember going to the cinema when you were growing up and sitting in the sixpenny forms will, if you cast your minds back, remember the opening credits on many shorts and cartoons which had &ldquo;National Film Board of Canada&rdquo;.  Often, as a young fellow, I sat in the darkness of the Roxy Cinema in Drumshanbo and said to myself, &ldquo;Why is there no National Film Board of Ireland?&rdquo; Why not, indeed? Now there is.</P>
    <P>This Government have given tangible evidence of their commitment to the development of the film industry by proposing what they have in the Finance Bill. To quote the Minister &mdash; and it does need to be repeated because it is an imaginative and innovative scheme &mdash; he says, &ldquo;Film making is an expensive and high risk business and it is difficult to raise adequate financing.&rdquo;  Indeed, criticisms were levelled at this country &mdash; and not <Col N="1275" /> just at the Government but at financial institutions &mdash; in the last five to six years because, as the film industry worldwide was burgeoning, there seemed to be a perception &mdash; at least from what one read in the newspapers &mdash; that financial houses in this country were releuctant to finance Irish film makers.  The only reason appeared to be that they were afraid of the risk.  Bankers by nature are very conservative people and they will not put in a buck or a pound unless they think they can get two back.  It is a sad reality of the market place but that is the way it has been in relation to the film industry.  The Minister continued:</P>
    <P>The business expansion scheme has already proven itself a valuable vehicle for providing film finance and now we want to encourage investment from the business sector in film projects with commercial potential.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the emphasis is on films of commercial potential.  However, I would hope that, in the mad, headlong rush to finance all of these wonderful films we are now hopefully going to see coming out of Ireland, there would also be, perhaps from the business sector, a contribution to films of a cultural and aesthetic nature.  We have the most beautiful scenery in the world in this country.  We do not broadcast that often enough.  I would like to think, looking at the history of some of the films down through the years which have show-cased Ireland and shown us in our best light &mdash; not in a patronising, Paddy Whackery sort of way but in a very positive way &mdash; that as a result of this new scheme there will also be room for films of an aesthetic nature so that people can enjoy Ireland as we enjoy it.</P>
    <P>The Minister says further, in relation to this particular provision, that the thinking behind the new incentive was to encourage films with commercial potential.  He then goes on:</P>
    <P>We have the basic talents for development of a successful film industry, but without adequate financing <Col N="1276" /> there can be no success.  In conjunction with the introduction of the tax incentive scheme the Government are reviewing the existing range of support and encouragement for film-making, including the work of Bord Scannán na hÉireann and An Chomhairle Ealaíon.</P>
    <P>In that context I would hope that this is the start of a new dawn for the Irish film industry.  The people who are on the Irish Film Board and the people who over the last number of years have been making submissions to Government to help the film industry are people of the highest calibre.  We are very fortunate in a way, when you think about some of the individuals who have been involved in film making in this country against the most difficult of odds and who have still maintained their commitment to this country and to the idea of a film industry.  I am thinking, for example, of John Boorman. Indeed, I was pleased to read in the last few days that Mr. Boorman, who has returned to this country, where he lives, following yet another one of his successes, says that he is immediately starting work on a script for a new film which he hopes to make in Ireland directly as a result of this particular incentive.  In this context also I would refer to the development of the Ardmore Studios by one of our more astute and business-minded film entrepreneurs, Mr. Morgan O'Sullivan, and his good offices in attracting one of the largest television film and video production companies in the world to Ireland &mdash; MTM Productions.  For those who may not be too familiar with the American production companies, if I were to mention such a successful television series as &ldquo;Lou Grant&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hill Street Blues&rdquo; perhaps it might give some idea of the importance that one should attach to this. I know many people do attach great importance to the introduction of MTM to Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the same way, there is the development of an animation studio in Conyngham Road, a new and exciting development, so much so that the most successful cartoon animation film in 30 years was partly produced in this country. <Col N="1277" /> The film, &ldquo;An American Tale&rdquo;, which opens shortly in Dublin, was partly produced in this country by animators who formerly worked with Walt Disney Studios and who have stated that their reason for coming to Ireland was because of the availability of a high technical workforce and the hoped for tax concessions.  The mighty dollar rears its head again.  But, if it means in the end that this country is going to benefit across a wide spectrum in the financial area as well as in the aesthetic and cultural areas, then the development of the film industry is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>There is a reference in the Bill to incentives to shipping &mdash; I see where the Bill is encouraging the purchase of new ships by giving tax incentives &mdash; but I would not like to let the occasion pass without making some reference to the demise of Irish Shipping.  I would hope that the situation would never arise again in which the employees of this company, who long served this country and, indeed heroically saved it during World War II, with loss of life and with personal injury and inconvenience to themselves, would ever again have to experience, not only the demise, but the manner of the demise of a company like Irish Shipping.  I have a brother who lives in Marseilles where the <i>Irish Spruce</i> was held by the port authorities for some 18 months.  I received regular reports from my brother, who visited the personnel on board ship.  As he said himself, it was a very sad situation to have to witness the port authorities coming on board and sticking notices on the masthead next to the Tricolour telling the master of the ship that he could not take it out of port because of default.  I only make the comment in passing.  It was a sad episode in the affairs of this country. I would hope that we will never ever see a repeat of it.</P>
    <P>The withholding tax has received a great deal of comment.  It is interesting that whenever a Government, irrespective of the colour of the Government, decide that they are going to introduce tax in a particular area, it is the strength of the lobby which ultimately decides <Col N="1278" /> whether the Government of the day concede in that area, or whether the tax proposals go ahead in a watered down version, or whether they eventually go ahead as originally proposed.  Those are the three options which face all Governments in attempting to levy tax.  I have to say that it is an indication of this Government's determination to try to get the nation's finances right that the Minister for Finance has held out against what has been an extraordinary lobby, the professional lobby against the introduction of the withholding tax.</P>
    <P>Without going into the merits or otherwise of it &mdash; it is a budgetary provision designed to bring in something of the order of £25 million &mdash; all I would say is this.  Perhaps I have better preface my argument by saying I can understand the difficulties that would face some companies in the short term with regard to cash flow.  I want to make that point and I sympathise with people who will have a cash flow problem.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the question: do all of those companies work exclusively in the public area?  Are we to be led to believe, in regard to the companies and the various professions who are criticising this tax, that their entire income for the year is based on public service fees?  I think not.  While, as I say, it will obviously cause some problems in the short term, the Minister has outlined the manner in which he will lend a sympathetic ear to people who find themselves or their company with that sort of problem.  He says there will be no additional tax liability whatsoever, that it is no more than an accelerated payment of tax.  It is tax which would ultimately be owed which is now being paid in the short term and it will bring in an estimated £25 million in 1987.  He says there are adequate safeguards to ensure that there will be no hardship and that, for the large majority of those liable, the withholding tax is not a significant imposition that will in any sense disrupt their business.  He says that the tax is not inequitable, that it is not disruptive, that it will not affect employment and that he will monitor its operation closely.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1279" /> Listening to the Minister earlier, when he said the new system is estimated to yield £25 million in 1987, I could not help but think that £25 million is Monopoly money to most of us.  However, compare it with the figure which the IDA propose to inject into the Larry Goodman deal, which is the largest investment in this country since the foundation of the State, something of the order of £25 million, which is going to result in about 1,500 to 2,000 jobs over a period of four to five years.  Consider that £25 million, which is the IDA's contribution but which ultimately is the money which you and I, as taxpayers, are contributing to the national coffers.  Say, for example &mdash; of course the Government Exchequer does not work this way &mdash; that the £25 million which is coming from the professional bodies was to be transferred the following day to the IDA, who, in turn, are injecting it into this massive undertaking, this massive development, and it resulted in not only continuing and increasing amounts of money for the State over a period of time, but also meant employment for a considerable number of people, would the professional bodies not be able to say to themselves it is, indeed, a small price to pay for contributing to the well-being of this country and its economy?</P>
    <P>Urban renewal is tackled in the Bill. The only question I would like to raise in the area of the urban renewal proposal is this.  I have read from time to time that Dublin Corporation hold a great deal of property in the inner city.  The impression is given &mdash; I speak open to correction, and no doubt the highly active and vocal PRO for Dublin Corporation will be very quick to correct any wrong impressions about his corporation, and rightly so &mdash; that Dublin Corporation are in ownership of large sections of dilapidated property in the area being designated for urban renewal.  I know that costs are a factor and that there is difficulty about the development of such buildings, but they are an eyesore.  I remember up to about two or three years ago coming in from Dublin Airport, having travelled abroad <Col N="1280" /> to various European cities, getting the immediate feeling of an anti-climax coming in the north side of Dublin and seeing what was on show.  I was Irish and I was a little embarrassed by it.  I often used to think: what do our visitors and tourists think about that side of Dublin as they come into the inner city, the area which is now being designated for urban renewal?  In that context, the work being carried out by Dublin County Council and the corporation in developing the two-lane highway to Dublin Airport and back has been a marvellous improvement of the image of that whole area of north County Dublin.  It is a pleasure to drive from Dublin Airport into the centre of the city now on what is an extremely modern highway.  It is yet another example of the new modern Ireland which we want to project to our visitors. But, on the question of urban renewal, I would hope that the proposals inherent in the Finance Bill will be taken up by those people who, up to now, have been reluctant to invest in inner city properties.</P>
    <P>The idea of trading houses dealt with in the Bill is a new concept for Ireland. It is a concept which has been extremely successful in Japan and, indeed, has led to that country's remarkable economic growth since the period of the ending of the Second World War.  The concept of trading houses, in effect, is to harness the marketing expertise of individuals or companies by giving them tax breaks to buy from Irish manufacturers and then sell abroad.  The concept is an excellent one and it is surprising that it has not been thought about or tried in this country before.  I was listening to the Minister explaining this concept of trading houses in another forum some days ago.</P>
    <P>While he is obviously concerned that there should be no abuses of the concept, I would hope that at the same time he would not discourage individuals who have entrepreneurial flair, who have the marketing expertise and a good track record, but who are perhaps short of funds.  I hope he will not discourage those people because in the long term they are the sort of individuals we need to <Col N="1281" /> encourage in this country.  I accept that the concept of the trading houses is being directed more towards existing companies whom we would wish to get more involved in the marketing of products abroad.  Individuals who have the same sort of marketing expertise and a good track record, but may not have the finance, should be encouraged rather than discouraged by the financial institutions. The Government should perhaps act as a go-between if such a difficulty were to arise with someone who has the sort of expertise those trading houses are being catered for.</P>
    <P>In the further context of the trading houses, there is no doubt that there is a wealth of goods, particularly in this country, that are not being sold and marketed properly abroad.  The comment has been made that we have here many people who, for example, are good at arts and crafts.  One has only to go to the-various craft fairs around the country, or indeed to the various craft villages that are set up, to see the remarkable range of Irish arts and crafts.  But the point is being made time and again that, while the people who are producing these arts and crafts are excellent and very creative, when it comes to actually selling their goods they have difficulty.  They are good manufacturers, but bad sellers.  I hope this trading house concept will get us away from the parochial image that many of our local manufacturers have.  They manufacture for the local, regional or indeed the national market, but do not touch the international market on the basis that: &ldquo;Well, we are doing all right and, anyway, I do not know anything about the international market.  I might get my fingers burned, so I will not get involved in it&rdquo;.  Hopefully, the idea of the trading houses will eliminate a great deal of that, and it should realise considerable revenue for the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The financial services sector which it is proposed to establish in the Custom House Docks site is yet another innovative and imaginative proposal in this year's Finance Bill.  The international finances services have been defined.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1282" /> In defining the services to be permitted, certain services for Irish residents and certain dealings in Irish currency are not included.  To qualify for the 10 per cent tax rate companies will require a certificate from the Minister for Finance, and, in addition to the legal requirements, companies will have to satisfy certain criteria before a certificate will be given.</P>
    <P>When this proposal was being formulated some months ago, I read somewhere that it would not involve deposit taking, that there would not be a provision or an accommodation for deposit taking.  I only raise the question, because in any of the other offshore financial services sectors, such as those in the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands, on which, I presume, this financial services sector is based to a large degree, there are provisions for deposit taking by non-residents in those financial services sectors.</P>
    <P>Obviously, they must be doing it in the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands because it is generating a great deal of revenue and I am wondering why the Minister is not including deposit taking as a service in the financial services sector.  It has not been adequately explained to me and it would be interesting to know why the Government at this stage feel that they cannot or should not introduce it, because, as I say, if the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man and other financial services sectors are doing it, they must be doing it in order to raise money.  I presume the idea behind an international financial services area in Dublin is to raise money.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to Part III of the Bill which deals with value added tax.  He said:</P>
    <P>As well as giving effect to the changes announced in the budget the Bill contains a number of technical provisions. There is a reduction from 25 per cent to 10 per cent in the rate on photographic services, waste disposal services and driving instruction as announced in the budget...</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1283" /> In addition the Minister said he is extending the benefit of the reduction to admissions to cultural, historical, artistic and scientific exhibitions and tour guiding services and that these reductions will have effect from 1 July and are intended as a further stimulus to the important services sector of the economy where, he believes, there is significant potential for job creation.  Might I bend the ear of the Minister in relation to some aspects of that provision, which I welcome and I think is long overdue?  I do not think there should be too high a price put on access to cultural, historical, artistic and scientific exhibitions and tour guiding services. We need to encourage more and more of our people &mdash; particularly our young people &mdash; to go into these institutions. Any proposal to reduce the cost of access is to be welcomed.  Any reduction in tax in the service area, including photographic services, waste disposal services and driving instruction, is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about the film industry. Is the Minister aware of the position if a company wish to involve themselves in stage productions?  It is a very popular pastime with theatre companies, amateur drama, the Tops of the Town and various other things: a number of outlets are providing costumes and stage lighting to these companies.  It has come to my notice that, increasingly, Irish-based theatre and stage production companies, whether permanent or freelancing for a short time, are importing stage costumes and stage lighting from Britain, simply because the VAT is too high here and the price is not competitive.  A number of the companies &mdash; one which springs to mind is Burkes' Costumiers in Dublin who are a long standing family concern, an institution as Senator Cassidy quite correctly says &mdash; are in severe danger and are already losing a considerable amount of business because of unfair competition coming from outside.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider the area of imports and perhaps but a tax on it. We have an import tax on records; we have an import tax on cars; why not on <Col N="1284" /> stage costumes and stage lighting, if it will protect jobs?  I know there are companies other than the Burkes involved.  There are lighting and stage people also.  Perhaps the Minister could look at that as something which could be incorporated, if not in this year's Finance Bill, certainly in next year's.</P>
    <P>Farm tax has been talked about.  I do not intend to try to answer the amazing statistics Senator Ryan went into over a period of time.  Suffice to say that, coming as I do from County Leitrim, we do not have too many rich farmers.  In fact, we do not have too many farmers at all because of the nature of the land and the geography.  I suggest that a similar situation prevails throughout the West.  I am sure Senator Daly would agree with me that there are very few ranch farmers who would be liable for tax in County Kerry.  At the same time I can understand Senator Ryan's frustration.  He wants to have a go at somebody and the farmers are as good as anybody to have a go at. He comes from a part of the country where there might be more of the type of farmers he is talking about &mdash; those liable for income tax.  Whenever I read about more tax on farmers I feel that I am reflecting the views of the vast majority of the people from my part of the country in saying: &ldquo;Not that red herring again!&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Farmers need support and encouragement. I am talking about the vast majority of people who are in farming in this country, the small farmer, the family-based farmer, the farmer who wants to stay on the land, who wants to raise his family on the land, who has a commitment to this country and who is paying his or her way &mdash; there are women farmers as well, God bless them.  I hope Senator Ryan's contribution in relation to farmers will fall, to some extent, on deaf ears.  While there are ranch farmers and those in the farming community who are abusing the tax system by not paying their fair share, the vast majority of people involved in agriculture are those with the small to medium sized farms who need encouragement and do not need to be belted around the head with more tax.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity <Col N="1285" /> to refer to another aspect of Part III of the Bill, that is, the area of the reductions in admissions to cultural, historical, artistic and scientific exhibitions.  The Minister said that he is confident that this will improve the competitiveness of the sector and help to combat black economy activity as well as contribute to employment growth in the economy.  I suggest that these institutions now getting this tax concession might look at the marketing of their products which are identified with a particular institution.  For example, I know the National Museum and the National Gallery have postcards of various paintings and artefacts.  Why not go a stage further, as is happening particularly in many of the museums and public buildings in America where there are exhibitions of one sort or another?  The management of those institutions looked at the products and artefacts they have on display which are attracting people into the institutions in the first place. They went to various manufacturers and had copies made of those artefacts.</P>
    <P>For example, if the famous statue of the death of Cuchulainn, which is in the GPO, were to be marketed in the form of a copy and sold through the various institutions it might increase the wealth of those institutions and it might generate more income for them.  This point should be directed more at the institutions themselves, at the National Museum, the National Gallery and the various heritage centres around the country.  I presume the Minister had in mind any area or institution where there was a cultural, historical, artistic or scientific aspect to it when he introduced this reduction.  Perhaps, at some stage in the future the Minister's Department might consider amplifying this section of the Bill dealing with value added tax.  Perhaps he could suggest to the various institutions such as the National Museum and the National Gallery that they should look at the artefacts within their establishments, go to people involved in merchandising such as Carrigaline Pottery or Textprint and say to them: &ldquo;We have some things many people are coming in to see &mdash; particularly overseas visitors &mdash; and if we had <Col N="1286" /> copies of them we know people would buy them.&rdquo;  In that way they could generate more wealth.</P>
    <P>In relation to the levy on insurance premiums a number of people in the financial sector have asked me during the last six months &mdash; perhaps they are Fianna Fáil supporters &mdash; why the Government do not consider privatising part of Irish Life.  The Government are sitting on a gold mine; it is a Government-owned institution.  If they are looking at ways of raising more revenue, part privatisation of Irish Life, which is probably the most successful company in the insurance sector in this country and abroad, might be a way of involving more people in public share ownership, as is happening to a degree in Britain &mdash; although there are question marks about that development.  It might be a way of generating income for the economy and, at the same time, keeping the company within the public sector.  I do not mean that it should be privatised completely but some aspect of it should be.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would just like to say that the various points which I have raised have been raised by many other people but are raised in the context of the overall thrust of the Finance Bill which is developmental in its aspects.  In that sense it must be one of the most revolutionary of Finance Bills ever, apart from the tax provisions which are part and parcel of every Finance Bill, but there is an underlying thrust to this Bill which is a reflection of the Government's determination and commitment to get the situation right.  I am not exaggerating when I say that if we do not start to get our economy right this year, start getting our costs down, start developing more export-led industry, this country will not get out of the morass that it has been in over the last number of years.  I have no doubt, having gone through the Finance Bill and listened to the contributions from all sides of the House and, indeed, in the other House, but mostly because of the stature and because of the type of stuff that the Minister for Finance is made of&mdash;coming as he does from good Leitrim stock &mdash;<Col N="1287" /> that when he sets his mind to doing something and says he is going to do something, he is not only going to do it but he believes in it and I know that the Government believe that the proposals contained in this Finance Bill are in the best interests of the country and I wholeheartedly welcome and endorse it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief and I want to thank Senator Daly for letting me in to make my few short comments. I welcome this Finance Bill and I look forward to its implementation with confidence. As the Minister pointed out here today, tough decisions had to be taken to correct the finances of the State and if these decisions were not taken now it would be very bad for us down the road in a few years' time.  I want to congratulate the Government on their determination to tackle the problem and not alone tackle it but to stand up to their commitment and to yield not an inch to any particular pressure group that may have thought they were the Government and not those elected by the people to represent them in Parliament.  I know that in showing great determination and example they are also leading us back on the road to recovery, something very badly needed.  I say that with confidence, having looked at the performance of this Government over their first three months in office and at the encouraging signs of interest rates in particular starting to come down and the effort to stop this black hole economy which we had become so accustomed to, having unfortunately been sucked into it over the previous couple of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is heartening, to say the least of it, when you see people re-investing in our economy and when you see money flowing back into the country as it has been in the last two to three weeks.  That is the only way we are going to come to grips with our problems &mdash; by getting our interest rates down.  If we do that we all know the business person will be tempted to invest.  There are so many encouraging incentives coming the way of businessmen &mdash; in industry particularly &mdash;<Col N="1288" /> that they realise that interest rates are down to suit their level of borrowing, and the impetus will just snowball in the opposite direction.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day it is the job factor that matters most of all.  We do not really realise, until we go abroad how many Irish people have left this country.  They are going out of it in far greater numbers than most people realise and far in excess of the official figures that are available for emigration as a whole.  After the doom and gloom that we were used to over the past years we can look forward now with confidence and say to our young people and those of the older generation who are losing jobs that there is a future and there is something that we can offer them in the long term.  It is going to take a little longer than anticipated but at least this Finance Bill is the start of the recovery. I suggest that as a by-line to sell this Finance Bill.  &ldquo;This is the start of the recovery&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There are a few sections in the Bill that I want to welcome but bearing in mind that Senator Daly very kindly let me in to speak before he was due to make his contribution I will be very brief.  I think it was a great idea to extend for farmers who are in extreme difficulties the date of payment to 30 June.  By then they may be able to in some way to pay part of the money that they owe.  They may not be able to pay it all but at least it will give them the opportunity and encouragement to make an effort.  That is all anyone can do in the middle of this massive recession.  I know that if anyone is making an effort at all and showing a sense of responsibility &mdash; because it boils down to responsibility at the end of the day &mdash; no one expects more than that.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the section of the Bill referring to special measures to promote tourism, food processing and the development of the financial services. These should be welcomed.  I believe that focusing attention on these items will pay us dividends in the very near future, particularly in the case of the tourist industry.  That is the greatest possibility of all for us here in Ireland.  The Minister <Col N="1289" /> did say that tourism was one of our three major goals.</P>
    <P>I know this Government had to accept many Estimates already prepared before they became the Government but I would like them to have a look in the next Estimates at the family-run hotels which are the backbone of the tourist industry in any country.  There is an enormously high percentage of family-run hotels in Ireland which have not got the very basic necessities of toilet and bathroom or shower facilities in their bedrooms.  In fact I believe that more than half of the family-run hotels here have not got that very basic requirement and speaking with wide experience of that particular industry, it is very important that if we are offering a service to tourists &mdash; and this is one of the three big planks of the Government's recovery plan &mdash; we should meet the basic requirements of tourists when they arrive here.  This applies particularly to the Americans from whom money can really be made in accommodation, because while we are all aware of the various comforts that tourists look for, the Americans look for the very best in accommodation.  Indeed, most other Western tourists make the same demands nowadays.  If you have not got the basic requirements it will speak badly for the country and speak badly for the efforts of Bord Fáilte and everyone involved.  We must not go out and market something for which we have not provided the basic essentials.</P>
    <P>The greatest thing we have going for us here is our hospitality and the hospitality is found mostly in the family-run hotels.  It is that personal service and that welcome that can be given in a family-run hotel that counts.  Attention to detail is so very important to make everybody feel at home and comfortable.  The easiest business of all to get is the repeat business.  We have the best chance of getting that in our family-run hotels compared to the multinational hotels.  I say that from experience of visiting these places myself.  One area the Minister for Tourism in conjunction with the Minister for Finance could look at &mdash; maybe also <Col N="1290" /> with the EC &mdash; is providing basic requirements in our family run hotels.  The multinational hotels have everything that they require.  That is one point.  This would create employment in the building industry. Everyone knows the building industry could do with a boost.  That is one area where we could give the building industry a boost.</P>
    <P>I also welcome section 4 which abolishes in relation to Irish people working abroad the place of abode test for residents of the State for tax purposes.  This change will enable people working abroad to visit their homes and transfer savings without being subject to Irish tax simply because they maintain a place of abode abroad and make a short visit home.  That is to be welcomed in this Finance Bill.  There is enormous potential for money to come into Ireland from people abroad who have a house in Ireland or a very small holding of ten or 20 acres or whatever it is.  Their hearts are in Ireland and as the poem says &ldquo;Where is the man who does not love the land where he was born?&rdquo; I never met an emigrant who did not say at some stage in his life he would like to come back home and finish his life in Ireland.  This is a great link, apart from being a great opportunity to bring finances back to Ireland.  I welcome it in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the business expansion scheme which is being extended to trading houses and to export tourism.  I want to welcome in particular the trading house idea because two-thirds of Irish manufacturing at present is done by the multinationals.  Only 40 per cent of Irish-made goods come from Irish companies and 60 per cent of Irish companies do not export.  That speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>This trading house idea has to be recommended and I can see that it could be an enormous success.  I do not know how many trading licences are proposed: I presume somewhere in the region of 20 to 50.  If you are an expert at your craft it is impossible to be an expert in marketing because the two are completely different. You may have the talent but you will find quite often that they are two different fields and they are time-consuming <Col N="1291" /> things.  Businesses that have very good ideas sometimes fail because they have not got the marketing expertise.  We have only three million people in Ireland and 60 per cent of our Irish companies manufacturing only for that three million market.  When you look at Europe with 320 million people and America with 240 million people you can see the vast potential there is in Ireland for the manufacturing industry.  The idea that Ireland is the world is one we must get rid of; we just cannot expand; we cannot create more jobs, we cannot do anything.  The world is outside of Ireland.  Ireland is only the base.  There are 500 million people outside.  That is where the whole secret lies.  The vision of this Government in implementing this concept in the Finance Bill shows they recognise that the export potential is there in an enormous way.</P>
    <P>Those trading houses have enormous potential also because they have a 10 per cent rate of corporation tax.  That is another great incentive for people who have the expertise in marketing to get up off their behinds, knowing that at the end of the day their corporation tax will be only 10 per cent.  I welcome that in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the incentives for the film industry.  The film industry here does not exist, as we all know.  It is a high-risk business and perhaps two, three or four films are tried out here every year.  Take Australia five years ago.  Australia has 15 million people and we have three million people.  The film business did not then exist in Australia.  The Government gave it all the incentives and all the encouragement possible and this year the film of the year was &ldquo;Crocodile Dundee.&rdquo; It was made in Australia, financed in Australia and it has been the greatest success story of the Australian film industry.</P>
    <P>We have our world leaders in actors and actresses.  They must go abroad to display their talents.  I know that in their hearts, while they go away and become international celebrities and international stars and box office attractions, which is the most important thing in the <Col N="1292" /> film industry, they would love to come back and make at least one film a year here.  As any actor or any actress will make five or six films in the year so, to come here and play a part and to become a box office attraction would also be an incentive for any film company to come here and make this their base.  We have beautiful scenery here.  John Houston finished his life here, one of the greatest world celebrities in the film industry.  We have the natural beauty, the hospitality and everything else.  There is enormous potential and an enormous number of jobs to be gained out of this industry. Enormous amounts are spent on films. Any type of a decent film costs £2 million to £3 million.  In some cases the greater part of these films is made in places outside of the capital cities because that is where they have this beautiful scenery which they require.  A lot of money could be spent in the west, in the south or anywhere else in Ireland that would give a lot of employment in those areas.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to thank the Minister for reducing VAT from 25 per cent to 10 per cent on exhibitions, museums, cultural, historical, artistic and scientific institutions.  That is very essential to their survival.  I say &ldquo;survival&rdquo; because they are all going through a difficult time. There may be a hope that in the near future, the Minister for the Environment or the Minister for Finance may have a look at the rates situation concerning those attractions, because with our weather and our hard-pressed tourism, we shall have to encourage investment in indoor exhibitions, indoor activities and indoor sport.  If people have incentives the Minister will get the investment required.  I congratulate the Minister and the Government on their courage and wish them luck in the coming 12 months with a very courageous Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>It was Claude Bowers who said:</P>
      <P>America has been fortunate in drawing to her shores men and women of the most enterprising and liberty loving races of the world and in none has she been more fortunate than in the Irish.</P>
      <P>The history of the 40 million Irish in America, whether they be of Irish birth, parentage or ancestry, is indeed a captivating and inspiring tale of the great and magnificent contribution of the Irish to the development of America in every occupation and in every field of human endeavour.</P>

    <P>Congressman Donnelly, speaking in the House of Representatives on Wednesday, 20 May 1987 said:</P>
    <P>My intention in filing this legislation today is threefold.  First, our nation must reintroduce into the main immigration stream those countries that have been adversely affected by the Immigration Reform Act, 1965 and which face the same barriers with the passage of the 1986 Reform Act. Second, it holds out the possibility of legal immigration to people who see their only hope in illegal entry.  Third, it would allow the natives of those 36 countries adversely affected by the Immigration Reform Act, 1965 to compete in a more fair and equitable manner under the new seventh preference category.</P>
    <P>I welcome the amnesty provisions of the 1986 Act in regard to illegal aliens who were in the United States before 1 January 1986.  I welcome section 314 of the 1986 Act in so far as it provides for an additional 10,000 non-preference visas, 5,000 a year for the fiscal years 1986 and 1987 for:</P>
    <P>Qualified immigrants who are natives of foreign states, the immigration of whose natives was adversely affected by the 1965 changes to the Immigration and Nationality Act, 1952.</P>
    <P>This means that 10,000 non-preference immigrant visas will be provided in the next two years over and above the 270,000 annual limitation established by <Col N="1295" /> the 1952 Act.  I am pleased to note that Ireland has now secured approximately 3,000 of these 10,000 non-preference visas.  However, section 314 of the 1986 Act has put a tiny provision in a massive document.  In the words of Congressman Donnelly:</P>
    <P>Section 314 of the 1986 Act is but a mere drop in the bucket of the need to address the decline in immigration from the nations in Europe that enjoyed long, historic and family ties with the United States.</P>
    <P>Countries which, like Ireland, have contributed so much to the American melting pot in past generations for, in the words of William Shannon, a former United States ambassador to this country:</P>
    <P>The Irish are now the oldest and best integrated group in American society.</P>
    <P>No people ever believed more deeply in the cause of Irish freedom than the people of the United States.  No country ever contributed more to the building of the United States than the sons and daughters of Ireland.  Irish volunteers played so prominent a role in the American army that Lord Mountjoy informed the British Parliament:</P>
    <P>We have lost America through the exertions of the Irish.</P>
    <P>This can be seen from the fact that eight of those who signed the Declaration of Independence, the Secretary of the Congress who signed it, the officer who first read it to a public gathering and even the printer who turned out the first copies, were all Irish born or descendants of Irish immigrants.  Even the White House was not exempt from Ireland's spell for one-third of all American Presidents have traced all or part of their lineage to Irish forebears.</P>
    <P>When John FitzGerald Kennedy was elected President in 1960, the President of the United States, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the majority Leader in the United States Senate and the Chairman of the National Committee <Col N="1296" /> were all of Irish extraction.  It was of course with a mixture of hope and agony that they left behind their homeland, a nation yearning to be free and led James Joyce to describe the Atlantic Ocean as &ldquo;a bowl of bitter tears&rdquo;.  An earlier poet wrote:</P>
    <P>They are going, going, going and we cannot bid them stay.</P>
    <P>I am, of course, glad that from America, where Ireland has so long invested her people and her children, Americans are now investing their capital here and taking their vacations here.  There are now some 300 American companies in Ireland, providing employment for approximately 38,000 people with a total investment of $4.2 billion.  The flow of investment is not all one way.  There is evidence of an increasing interest by Irish companies in establishing an American base usually through the take-over of existing companies.  Some major Irish companies have expanded in this way, companies such as the Smurfit Group. Aer Lingus, Rohan, McInerney, Fitzwilton, James Crean and many others.  In 1983 Allied Irish Banks acquired 40 per cent interest in the First Maryland Corporation, one of the largest banks in the United States.</P>
    <P>This internationalism of Irish firms has been described by Professor Dermot McAleese as a very welcome development. It is wholly consistent with the objective of building up a base of strong, indigenous Irish companies.  The American nation has always been a beacon of hope and opportunity for people from foreign lands.  I believe, therefore, that every effort must be made at Government and diplomatic levels to safeguard and secure the protection and status of newly arrived Irish immigrants in America. I urge the Government, in view of the magnitude of the task facing them, to seriously consider appointing a Minister with special responsibility for Irish affairs overseas, particularly in the United States and in Britain.</P>
    <P>I also urge Irish cities, towns and counties to establish appropriate links with cities and other such units in the United <Col N="1297" /> States, thereby forging bonds of friendship and social, cultural, educational and economical links between the people of Ireland and the people of the United States.</P>
    <P>In 1986 as Mayor of Limerick, I initiated a very worthwhile sister city relationship between the city of Limerick and the city of Worcester, the second largest city in the State of Massachusetts, a city which was the recipient of the all-America city award for an unprecedented four times.  These arrangements are designed to foster personal and family contacts and the promotion of industrial, educational, cultural and other developments between the people of Limerick and the people of Worcester, thereby helping to harness the vast amount of friendship and goodwill that exists between the people of Ireland and the people of the United States.</P>
    <P>Massachusetts and the general Worcester area are noted for electronic and high technology industries and a number of electronic and computer companies from these areas have recently been located in Limerick and the mid-west region.  Education has been the hallmark of the Worcester area for some years and already important educational developments are taking place between the National Institute for Higher Education in Limerick and the Worcester Polytechnic Institute in matters of research and in the area of student exchange.</P>
    <P>Burton W. Potter said at the dedication of the new Worcester City Hall on 28 April 1898:</P>
    <P>May we realise that the true greatness of Worcester is not evidenced now and never will be evidenced by the number and length of its streets, its magnificent buildings, its intensive factories or its great populations but if it is found now and ever will be found, if found at all, in the minds and hearts of the people I believe that the time is now right to forge new bonds and new contacts between the minds and hearts of the people of Ireland and the people of the United States.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1298" /> The Irish in America have integrated and assimilated into the national mainstream of American society while maintaining, as we all know, an enduring commitment to and attachment for the land of their ancestors.  George Potter in his book <i>To the Golden Door</i>, the story of the Irish in Ireland and America wrote:</P>
    <P>The Irish in America not only work hard, but dangerously.  The bones of many Irish men lie encased in the foundations of the materials in America they helped to build.</P>
    <P>At the same time, they moved up the leadership ladder.  They lifted themselves up by the boot straps.</P>
    <P>The story of the Irish in America can be truly represented as an Irish-American Hall of Fame which sets forth the tremendous achievements of Irish-American men and women.  It is my hope, therefore, that our two countries will move even closer together and that we will be able to forge at all levels new bonds and ties of friendship.  Therefore, I support this motion and I call upon the Government to launch a major political and diplomatic initiative to bring about greater flexibility in American immigration policy to facilitate countries such as Ireland which have always enjoyed historic ties and links with the United States and contributed so much to the building of America.</P>

      <P>It is no solution to the problem of young people in Ireland today to be asking the authorities in another country to look after them when they go there.  It is an abrogation of responsibility and the ultimate &ldquo;cop-out&rdquo; and in no way is it a manner for this Chamber or for either of the Houses of the Oireachtas to respond to the needs of young people.  I worry a lot about the comments that are made by people in authority about young people and the facile treatment of their problems is very difficult to accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I worry when people say that we should look after them in America when people do not care what happens to them here. The most common cry about young people in Ireland today is that we should <Col N="1299" /> look after them because they are the hope of the future, or we should invest in them because we will reap the investment in the future.  That means for young people, &ldquo;We will look after you when you grow old&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is time that it was recognised that 50 per cent of our population are young people.  That is an accepted fact and the figures support it.  It is extraordinary that instead of working out how these people might participate in the Ireland of today we should continue to look upon them as the hope of the future.  The only hope for our young people is to grow old quickly or go to America and we will ask the people in authority there to look after them.  If we in authority here abrogate our responsibility towards our young people we can hardly ask other people to take up where we leave off.</P>
    <P>I want to put in context the latest census figures.  The latest census figures from the Central Statistics Office are fairly disturbing because they show a poor pattern of emigration.  We should be talking here about emigration rather than the immigration referred to in the motion.  We should be more worried about people leaving this country than people going into another country.  The perspective of the proposers of the motion worries me.  Our worry should be for the people leaving this country before we should worry about them going into another country.</P>

      <P>With the greatest respect to the Senator, I do not want a contribution on what should be, I want the Senator to contribute to item No. 7 on the Clár.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In relating item No. 7 precisely to what is on the Clár the reason we are worried about the needs of immigrants is that we have failed to worry about emigration and emigrants.  It has a very clear and definite connection.  The latest figures show that 30,000 young people are emigrating annually.  That is a growth figure.  I am not sure how many of these actually go to the United States <Col N="1300" /> of America because we do not have figures for that.  The reason we do not is that these people, having failed to find employment or career opportunities here, are going into the United States illegally and working illegally there. Consequently we do not have clear figures on this.  In a State where the age cohort is about 60,000 &mdash; there are approximately 60,000 people of any age group in Ireland &mdash; if 30,000 people leave this country annually that would mean that over the years one in every two young people is leaving this country.  That figure is growing.  There is a disgracefully uncontrolled rise in emigration to the United States and other countries and the vast majority of our young people are leaving us.  Not only that, but from information we get from America and elsewhere it is clear that very often those people who are leaving are the most resourceful and the people we need most.</P>
      <P>It seems to me, if our young people are our greatest national resource and they are emigrating to the United States and other countries that we are callously unconcerned because, if I draw an analogy with one of our other great national resources, Kinsale oil or gas, and if half of the Kinsale oil or gas field started to flow unused and unharnessed, there would be a national outcry.  I could not imagine people standing idly by trying to have this oil safely brought to America or any other country when it was needed at home to develop our country.  What is happening here is that half a generation of young people are being dumped on a scrap heap and we are standing by.  I am not saying that the responsibility has arisen in the last couple of months.  We all accept this level of responsibility back over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to do something now.  We must start off from the philosophical point of view that Irish youth have the right to work in Ireland.  That should be our first and primary concern.  It is secondary to talk about looking after them in the United States.  Of course, we have a duty to our nationals in every country of the world and, of course, in that sense it should be unnecessary to ask <Col N="1301" /> a particular administration in a particular country to look after them.  It is a duty we have to our nationals in all parts of the world.</P>
    <P>With regard to job creation, at present the private sector are losing more jobs than they are creating.  This is where ministerial responsibility comes into it.  It is disastrous the way private industry are moving at present.  In our new drive to create employment, the motivation must be the public good rather than private gain.  We must see to it that our young people do not have to seek the support of foreign Governments, do not need to leave our country when we need them here to solve the problems we have at home.  In a State with a half-developed fishing industry, an under-developed forestry industry and a tourist industry which has not yet begun to recognise the value of selling this country abroad, the real impetus should be to accommodate our young people here.  We should be saying to the people in America: &ldquo;Come home; we are creating employment for you&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We should be looking at ways to create that employment.  In discussing the Finance Bill tomorrow I will be developing my ideas and the ideas of the trade union movement on how employment might well be developed.  In the meantime, I say to the Minister and the House that we now have a greater responsibility to our young people at home than we have to them in the United States.  This motion is peripheral to the real needs of young people, who have a duty and a need to participate in Ireland now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion because it is designed to help many of our young people who not necessarily have to go because of hardship or because they need jobs but go because they want to travel and gain experience in other countries.  For that reason we should see to it that they are looked after and that they get a fair crack of the whip.  It is a pity that so many people speak in the negative about our youth.  We have a very good youth.  Over the last 20 years we have put a huge investment into our youth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1302" /> When I was going to school there was the technical school and the college. Today there are regional colleges and various other centres.  We never did more for our youth.  There must be something wrong with our educational system when, after 20 years of free education and 20 years of working for our youth, we did not engender in them the motivation of enterprise, the motivation to help themselves. Instead we seem to have educated them to live in the belief that the country owes them a job, that the country owes them a home, and that they owe the country nothing.</P>

      <P>It also guarantees that the likes of the Senator should teach them how to work and how to help themselves as the good old technical schools did for those of us who had the blessing to go there.  We learned how to help ourselves; we got an education for life.  We must tell our youth to be enterprising.  We are giving our youth the best education and training.  The vast majority of people trained in Ireland are depending on the State for a job.  They are not providing employment for themselves.</P>
      <P>I am tired of people attacking the private sector.  I have great respect for trade unions because I worked in days when there were very few trade unions and we did not get a very fair deal from employers.  There is a grave need for trade unionism.  Trade unionism has seemingly gone mad of late and the shoe is on the other foot.  It is time we realised it is patriotic to work for our country, to do something to help our country and provide jobs.  We all have a duty to provide jobs.  Some of us provide jobs and set up the correct environment in which people can obtain employment and help themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my village of Grange there are eight factories owned by private enterprise, all products of the local vocational school, employing up to 100 people in a small rural village.  This is the type of thing every village should be encouraging.  This <Col N="1303" /> is what our educational system must gear itself to and stop blaming others.  We all need one another but our main goal should be to build an Ireland we can all be proud of.  Instead of that, we are consistently knocking our little country. We are accusing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the present system continues they will not be allowed to expand their knowledge and gain greater expertise in a foreign country. I support the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I read this motion and then I read it again and again.  It is a good old Fianna Fáil motion because one really does not know which side they are on. They express concern at the implications of the US Immigration Bill for young Irish immigrants now working in the <Col N="1304" /> United States.  Are we concerned that they will be kept there or that they will not be kept there?  Are we concerned that they may be sent home or sent to prison?  I missed Senator Mooney's initial remarks and perhaps it is clearer now.  It is sad that representatives of a party who governed this State for most of the past 60 years are reduced to begging the most right wing regime the United States has ever had the misfortune to be subjected to, to be concerned about young Irish immigrants who are working illegally in the United States.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons I am sceptical about this motion is that the ingenuity of the proposers could have been better devoted to reflecting on why a large number of young Irish people have left this country and also reflecting on the sort of work many of them are doing. There is a regrettable legal emigration of Irish people to the United States.  We cannot be concerned in this motion about those people who are working legally in the United States because obviously the Immigration Bill will not affect them. One must presume, therefore, that we are talking about illegal immigrants in the United States.</P>
      <P>The evidence we have is that those people are not exactly working in hightech, highly skilled industries which will enable them to bring back grand new notions of enterprise to this country. They are working in precisely the same menial jobs they had here except that in the United States, in the short term at least, in certain areas of high labour demand they are a lot better paid.  One presumes that since they are outside the legal economy they are not paying much in the line of taxes.  One presumes, furthermore, that they are not paying much in the line of social security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, if you are an illegal immigrant you are not into paying tax to the Revenue Commissioners who might chase you down and want to know where you came from in the first place.  What we are worrying about are people in dead-end jobs, with no futures, with no skill acquisition and with a reasonable <Col N="1305" /> level of income acquisition.  We might be better advised to be concerned about the medium to longer term future of these people.  The medium to longer term future of these people is of no security, no right to marry, no right to have a family, no right to any of the services of the State.  They are there illegally and will remain there illegally.  We have romanticised to a certain extent the alleged enterprise of these people.  There are few things more difficult to take in this benighted country than romanticising enterprise, but the idea somehow prevails that they show enterprise and creativity.</P>
    <P>Amongst the illegal immigrants are many who have skills that they acquired here.  We did not train them for free. Because we did not charge them money for the right to be educated does not mean that it was free.  It means that we chose to pay for it because we thought it was a worthwhile investment in their future.  I do not regard investment as giving away money.  I regard investment as the way to use the resources of this country to advance this country.  That is a different thing.  Those people were forced to leave this country, having had the investment of resources in them, because we failed to provide employment for them.  It is true that there are nurses leaving this country.  It is true that there are teachers leaving this country.  To the extent that they are going to work as teachers or nurses in the United States they are there legally.</P>
    <P>I heard Senator Kennedy earlier today romanticise the whole idea of emigration and of the people who pull themselves up by their boot straps.  I have never been a particular devotee of the boot straps school of economics.  An awful lot of people's boot straps failed in the process. They ended up not pulling themselves up, but landing at the bottom, starving at the bottom and suffering from disease, malnutrition and overcrowding.  What we identify always are those who rise above the mass of the emigrants.  We must remember that there is a mass of emigrants who never rose at all and who became the backbone of the sweat-shops <Col N="1306" /> and the industries, not just in the United States but all over Europe.</P>
    <P>Nobody has yet got around to romanticising the Turkish so-called &ldquo;guest workers&rdquo; in Europe, or the Greeks or the Portuguese in Europe.  Not many of them did much with their boot straps because they were not let.  What happened was that once things got tough they were all unceremoniously dumped back home.</P>
    <P>Emigrants are welcomed into a country not because of some romantic idealism or romantic dream, but because people need a workforce.  For reasons to do with demography and the age structure of the US population, young Irish workers had a role to fulfil.  I would suspect also that young English-speaking workers who were available to do certain domestic and menial chores would have a considerable attraction.  There are young black and young Hispanic people in the United States who are unemployed, but they have the unfortunate qualification they they do not have white skins.  They do not speak good English.  Therefore, in a large part of the west coast and the east coast of the United States young English-speaking white people have a great attraction.  It would be worthwhile for this House to devote its time to scotch the myth that emigration is a necessity and that those who go to the United States are somehow benefiting themselves by learning and acquiring all sorts of skills.  They are not learning anything. They are doing lousy, menial jobs, often under very dubious legal conditions with very little support or protection.  God help them if they happen to get sick. God help them if they happen to have an accident because there is nothing for them and there will be nothing for them. We ought to be concerned not about persuading the American Government to allow the illegal immigrant to remain there &mdash; because they will not &mdash; but instead about persuading our young people, before they go to the United States, to be aware of the frightening risks they are taking with their lives, the frightening risks of illness, of insecurity and of a variety of things.  If they want to emigrate they can emigrate to Western <Col N="1307" /> Europe where they will have greater possibilities of secure employment.  They can probably find jobs in Europe related to their own particular skills.  They can probably find jobs in Europe which are more rewarding in money terms, more secure in terms of their legal status and, perhaps, ultimately more likely to make a contribution to the future development of this country.</P>
    <P>We should stop romanticising this whole idea of the US being a land of opportunities.  For most illegal Irish immigrants it may be a land of short-term financial gain.  It is a long-term land of hostility, insecurity and of no legal status. Whether we change the Immigration Bill or not, it will not get away from the fact that most of our illegal immigrants in the United States are going to remain illegal and are going to remain insecure.  All we are talking about is not fundamentally changing their status but about the degree and the extent of the legal penalties to which they will be subjected.  To be arguing in this House about minimising or changing the dreadful penalties that Irish immigrants in the United States will suffer is in many ways a waste of the time of this House.  We should address the fundamental fact that perhaps 100,000 young Irish people are in severe social danger, and I do not mean that in the moral sense because one of the positive outcomes of immigration to the United States is a reasonably liberated attitude to some of these issues, but in the sense of the lack of security.  We are building up problems for ourselves and for many of our young people.  To suggest that we would like the American Government to cast a blind eye on illegal immigrants or to be less severe than they might otherwise be to illegal Irish immigrants is not really tackling the issue.</P>
    <P>The fundamental problem is that God knows how many Irish people, in very short-term jobs with no social or legal security are stuck in large cities in the United States.  That is a problem for us and a problem which we should address. I would be happy if at some stage this House could address that problem.  How <Col N="1308" /> are we going to secure the future of those people, either at home or in the United States?  How are we going to protect their rights?  How are we going ultimately to get away from this awful necessity that they have to emigrate?  May I say, in conclusion, that I do not think the trade union movement has much to do with the problems of this country.  Last November when £2 billion left this country in a week it was not the trade unions who shipped it out but the captains of private enterprise to whom Senator Farrell is so attached.  They did not like the way the Government were operating.  I wish the trade unions had that type of clout because then we could change the country, but unfortunately they have not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to Senator Ryan I am not too sure how I should begin because he seems to be totally divorced from the practicalities and realities of immigration.  He is totally divorced from what the motion involves.  It is intended that we should express our concern to the United States authorities about the implications of the United States Immigration Bill.  The implications are not basically addressed to immigrants in the United States.  They are addressed to employers.  It is suggested that employers in the future will be fined large amounts of money if they are found to be employing illegal immigrants, whether they be from Ireland, Mexico, or wherever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality in the United States at present is that there are a large number of jobs which are available and which young Americans are not inclined to take up as a first alternative.  Immigrants in the United States are prepared to take up these jobs.  They see them as stepping stones.  No matter where you go in the United States at present you will find that there are people from outside the United States taking up what were considered to be menial jobs, but highly paid menial jobs.  What is a menial job?  A menial job, apparently, is a job that gets somebody involved in working hard, whether with his hands, or as a building labourer, as a <Col N="1309" /> bar person or in the electricity supply board equivalent in the United States.</P>
    <P>Is it menial to work with your hands? What is wrong with working with your hands?  Just because you have a university education, what is wrong with going out and earning good money by hard work? Why should somebody who is university educated consider that he should not work in a pit in Pennsylvania or on a high rise building in New York?  Is such a person better or worse than the person who has not got a university education? Is university education something that is sacrosanct?  Should people who go to university apply themselves only to the discipline in which they got involved in university?  They are privileged to have had the opportunity to go through university. It broadens their minds.  Does that mean that they should automatically go into the discipline in which they have been trained?  A menial job was mentioned many times by Senator Ryan.  It is quite obvious that he considers that because he works in academia that people who work with their hands rather than their heads are working in menial jobs.</P>

      <P>We are expressing concern in this motion about young Irish emigrants going to the United States.  Look at the implications of the new immigration laws.  There are a number of very concerned politicians in the United States, including Congressman Brian Donnelly, who has looked at the situation of immigrants over a long number of years.  He has suggested that the United States would be better if they allowed more Irish educated people into the United States than are allowed in at present.</P>

    <P>What is a dead end job?  If one can get into a job and progress through that job, getting an increase in salary and an <Col N="1310" /> increase in personal involvement, and is enjoying the job, maybe by academic standards it might be a dead end job, but if it is a job that is satisfying to the individual it should not be called dead end.  Why should people who go to university decide that everybody who is in a job that has not promotional prospects is in a dead end job?  It is rubbish.</P>

      <P>Ninety per cent of the people who go to the United States rise above the mass of emigrants.  In other words, 90 per cent of the Irish who go to the United States rise above the mass of immigrants from other countries because they are going into a country which is English-speaking.  They are going into a country in which their capacity to develop is recognised.  They are not like Senator Brendan Ryan who does not see the horizons available to them in the United States.</P>
      <P>The Irish people have invested a lot of money in young people.  When they go to the United States they do not, as many would suggest, in the main get themselves into a situation where they cannot rise above the mass of emigrants.  They are better than 90 per cent of the people who come from other places.  They are better educated.  They are well able to address themselves to the problems of the country. They do not find themselves with the major problems with which people from non-English-speaking countries find themselves.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1311" />&ldquo;Romanticising&rdquo; is a word that was used on a number of occasions by Senator Ryan.  I do not know whether he has gone to Boston, Chicago or to any place in the United States.  The Irish in the United States do not romanticise their situation. They go there to earn a living, not to romanticise.  They meet together at various times.  It may seem to Senator Ryan that it is romanticising that at weekends a group of young people sing Irish songs in an Irish ambience.  Why should they not sing Irish songs in an Irish ambience after spending the rest of the week working hard?  Many of them would sing American songs in an American ambience if the occasion were given to them on the Sunday night.</P>
    <P>The problems in the United States at present are problems of growth in an economy.  They do not have young people who want to take on jobs at the lower end of the job market.  We have a group of people who are capable of taking jobs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It has brought them up to the highest echelons in politics, business and in the social sphere of the United States.  Twenty-five per cent Black unemployment is mentioned by Senator Ryan.  Twenty-five per cent of Black unemployment might be related to the educational facilities available to Blacks in the United States.  It has nothing to do with this motion.  If the Senator wants to bring in a motion here asking the United States Government to provide better educational facilities for Blacks, I would suggest that we can bring that motion in here and discuss it.  We are not discussing the lack of educational facilities for Blacks in the United States.</P>

      <P>Having travelled to the United States, I have a concern that there is not within the United States Government a realisation that Irish immigrants can play a major part in the development of the United States economy and social structure.  I ask them, as the motion asks, that they would place as much emphasis as is possible on the positive aspects of Irish immigrants in the United States.  We do not want all young Irish people to go to the United States.  If they go there we should ask that the American Government should realise the value to the American economy of young, Irish, educated people going there.  We would like to provide in Ireland enough work for young Irish people but there will always be people who want to emigrate.  There will always be people who want to travel. I ask the United States Government to realise the value-added Irish immigrants have given to the United States.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed Ambassador Heckler is not in the Chamber to listen to this debate.  I would have thought that, because this is the first time a debate on emigration to the United States has taken place, Ambassador Heckler should have been here.  I cannot understand why she is not here.  She should be here if she has any interest in the job she is supposed to be doing here in Dublin. Emigration is a cancer in Irish society at present.  Emigration by young people, well educated who are capable of looking after themselves and who are capable of living within the particular society, should not be underestimated.</P>
      <P>Congressman Brian Donnelly in his Immigration Bill originally suggested that the young Irish immigrant has a lot to offer to the United States.  I think that is so.  I would not go along with the &ldquo;menial job&rdquo; attitude of Senator Ryan, the &ldquo;dead end&rdquo; attitude of Senator Ryan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the motion, in particular because I feel it is proper that this House should express concern on behalf of the many thousands of young people who have gone to the United States and particularly those who have entered the United States illegally. It seems to me that the proposals of the American Government cause concern properly to this House, because of one of the principal provisions of that legislation. I am thinking, in particular, of the provision whereby employers are about to be turned into agents of the State, unfairly policing jobs which young Irish people have.  It is very proper that we should express this concern.  It is a dangerous thing that employers should be turned against employees in this manner in the United States.  It could lead to a serious problem, including the shedding of an existing workforce.  I am quite sure that the Government are aware of the substantial difficulties that would face this country if the very large numbers of those who are resident illegally in the United States were returned compulsorily by the machinery of having their jobs arbitrarily withdrawn from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very good thing that many of our young people are properly educated.  I am sorry to see this hare being raised again &mdash; this curious antagonism between the so-called educated and so-called uneducated in this country.  It is very largely irrelevant to this debate.  As somebody who sat in this House and was chastised on the basis of the university of life, may I say that I am very glad to have been educated in a university, partially, of course, as was everybody else, at the expense of the State but I am also more than happy to take off my jacket and roll up my sleeves.  I know that many of the young people of this country are, too. However, this is a privilege that I have. This is an option that I have.  I can choose to do that, if I wish.  I am glad to have that opportunity.  I accept, of course, that <Col N="1314" /> as the Chinese discovered during the cultural revolution, it is a very good thing occasionally to empty the universities and toss them out into life.  Not everybody wishes to choose.  It is important that all our young people have an option.</P>
    <P>Recently, at the invitation of a distinguished Member of this House, I spoke at a meeting of the General Council of County Councils in Ballybunion. Leaving the hall I met a young man from Kerry who told me a story that I think is relevant to this evening's motion.  He was a man who had taken a science degree from University College, Cork, who could not obtain employment in this country.  He had a very good degree from what I could understand.  He went to America illegally, could not obtain employment commensurate with his intellectual abilities, and I do not intend any slur on menial work.  I do not have to remind Members of this House in a Christian and democratic State that Jesus Christ was a carpenter.  If menial work was good enough for Him it surely should be good enough for us.</P>
    <P>This young man wished to choose.  He wished to employ his skills.  He wished to give value to whatever community he was in for the education he had received.  Yet he was on a building site in New York, one of 12 young people, ten of whom were Irish, all of whom had third level degrees and none of whom wished to spend their life on a building site.  I asked him if he had health insurance.  Of course, he said he did not.</P>
    <P>Perhaps this is another area the Government could properly inquire into. I do not have sufficient knowledge, but it seems to me that the most vulnerable area of an individual's life is provision for protection when rendered incapacitated by illness.  Is there a possibility, for example, that even a minimum level of reciprocal health protection could be extended, even on humanitarian grounds, to young people who find themselves in this situation in the United States, regardless of whether they are legal or illegal?  This minimum level of protection should be found for our young people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1315" /> I should also like to say, in what may be taken as an aside, that it is not just the Immigration Bill which causes me concern.  It is the whole immigration policy of the United States Government. I cannot agree with my distinguished colleague, Senator Lanigan, in his blanket criticisms of Margaret Heckler, I think she is concerned.  I think, unfortunately, however, she represents a regime that is not always realistic.  I was greatly offended by the suggestions of President Reagan, in flagrant defiance of his medical advice, that immigrants, including Irish immigrants, should be tested for AIDS.  It seems that, in view of the history of this disease, they would be far better off testing them on the way out, rather than on the way in.  I resent this implication by the American Government. My interest would be to protect young people in America, to give them the basic minimum protection in terms of health provision which I think is the absolute lowest line.</P>
    <P>I also would have to remind the House that there is the question not only of the illegal immigrants but also the possibly long term more worrying situation that so many of our young people applied for visas.  Just around the corner from here every day as I go down Molesworth Street I see queues at the Passport Office of people wishing to leave the country.  I thought we had more or less ended this situation in the fifties and sixties.  Young people very often choose to get out. Listening to the interviews around about the time the American Government were issuing extra visas, it struck me how many of those who actually managed to get visas had jobs already.  They were exercising that luxury of choice in going to America.</P>
    <P>I am one of the very few privileged people because I live in the north inner city of Dublin in an area where there is up to 85 per cent unemployment.  Last night, as I came home past Hardwicke Street flats, I looked at the young people sitting on the steps.  I wondered what their future was.  Many of those people would be glad to have the opportunity to <Col N="1316" /> leave.  They do not even have that very harsh and unfortunate choice.  In order to cure this situation it is essential that this Government do absolutely everything they can to maximise employment, even if that employment means substantial investment in certain educational facilities.</P>
    <P>In particular, I would suggest respectfully that the Government should look very thoroughly at matters that are under discussion currently such as the funding of the Dublin Dental Hospital because I am sure that the Government will be made aware, if they are not already aware, that the knock-on effect of this is, in fact, to open up the possibility of very considerable numbers of jobs, not in dentistry but in the pharmacology section and through the School of Pharmacy in Shrewsbury Road, which currently has a pool of jobs which cannot be filled because of lack of space.  These are people who may well go to America as either legal or illegal immigrants.  So, I feel it is important that this House supports the motion and I am certainly happy to so support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivianOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to support the motion and to say that a lot of what I intended to say has been very competently said by Senator Norris.  As someone coming from a community that has been devastated by emigration, primarily of an illegal nature, in the past couple of years, I think it is important that we should seek to identify with the people who are currently deemed to be illegal in the United States of America. It is most opportune for us that we should comment on the tenor of the legislation which has been enacted in the United States and will become law quite soon. As it has quite rightly been said, we could easily be confronted with a situation in the next year or so in which many of our emigrants and young people living in the United States may have to return.  That is something we should look at with a fair amount of trepidation at the moment because, with the present job situation here, this is one of the very few escape routes we have for people who want to <Col N="1317" /> do any form of work.  It is probably unfortunate that in this debate here this evening too much emphasis has been put on menial work versus any other type of work these people might seek to do in the United States.</P>
      <P>The fact is that these people are going through absolute necessity, and there is an onus on us here in this Chamber to express our solidarity with them, because they are concerned about their position. Comments from Irish American newspapers were quoted here this afternoon, and the last day as well, about the concern being expressed by the Irish American communities in the United States that there is a degree of indifference in this country to the plight of so many of our young people who are currently deemed to be illegally in the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I support the motion, I think we should be careful how we address some aspects of the question.  There are many people getting caught up in this &mdash; I would almost call it razzmatazz &mdash; going off to the United States at present and we are, to a certain extent, overtly glamourising some of the positions being taken up by our emigrants in the United States.  We hear of the fortunes that are being made and so on, but of course the reality is quite different.  We do hear occasionally of the success stories, and they have been synonymous with the presence of Irish people in America for many centuries now.  But the facts are, of course, that at the other side of the spectrum there are many failure stories.  Unfortunately, these would to a large extent apply to the majority of the Irish immigrants in that they have not achieved what they set out to achieve when they went to America the first day.  We have to be careful that, while we are looking here for some relief, as it were, from the American Administration in relation to the present crop of emigrants in the United States, we guard against the ultimate consequences of what we propose to do.  I do not think it would be the ambition of anybody in this Chamber, or indeed in this country, to encourage people to leave, despite the fact that Members of the Dáil have <Col N="1318" /> exhorted young people to emigrate regularly in recent years.  I certainly would not subscribe to that, even though it may be an unfortunate eventuality in some cases.</P>
    <P>Only 25 years ago we had a similar situation where people had to emigrate. Only by creating a climate of future possibilities in this country did we ultimately create a work ethic so that people were prepared to consider the possibility of staying at home and working for this country rather than taking to the emigrant ship, whether it was to the UK or the United States.  We would want to be conscious of that.  As Members of this House we should not lose sight of our absolute and total obligations.</P>
    <P>Our primary reason for being here is to create an economic climate whereby we would be in a position, as we were in the late sixties and early seventies, to create a sufficiency of employment in our own country so that these people would be able to stay at home.  Indeed, many of the people currently in the United States, legally and illegally, would come home, because most of them expressed the desire to do so many times to me when I was there over the years.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to consider how we actually approach our call to the US Government.  Do we feel that we, as a country, as a race of people, are entitled to a special place in the considerations of the American immigration authorities? Certainly, judging from the tenor of the discussions here over the past few days in this debate, I think that we do; and, if we do, I think we can reasonably say that we have not been getting a proper recognition of the type of relationship our American brethren would like to think we should have with them.  They are not slow on occasions to exhort us here as to how we should conduct our business and, indeed, many people comment when we fail to comment on problems in Nicaragua, El Salvador and so on &mdash; and I feel we should comment a good deal more often than we do.</P>
    <P>Quite often the comment is couched in these terms: &ldquo;Well, you know, we are expecting the occasional concession from <Col N="1319" /> the American Administration&rdquo;, as indeed was forthcoming in the debates on the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  Financial support, yes, was forthcoming.  A degree of moral support, yes, was forthcoming. But, in a situation like this, where we deem ourselves to be in a special category <i>vis-a-vis</i> our relationship with the American Government, we do not appear to get the kind of response we feel we are entitled to.  This is something we should look at very seriously when we are putting this before the American Administration. We have made this claim before.  It was probably not as critical as it is in the present climate, but I do think that we should conceivably expect to get more consideration for this point of view than we seem to be getting at the present time.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would like to support the tenor of the motion, but to couch it in terms other than regarding this as being a permanent situation requiring special concessions for our immigrants.  We hope we will not need those concessions until some time in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, may I thank all the Senators who have contributed to this debate &mdash; Senators Mooney, Kiely, Bradford, McKenna, O'Connor, Murphy, Reynolds, Kennedy, O'Toole, Farrell, Ryan, Lanigan, Norris and O'Callaghan &mdash; for their contributions. They were diverse, very frank and firm.  The important thing is that in many cases they came from people who had to emigrate, who have come back home and who have obviously been able to put their talents and their expertise to great use here at home.  The debate, as I said, was frank and diverse and to me of tremendous interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Might I just take up a point raised by Senator Norris?  I also have seen the queues outside the Passport Office.  I think, however, we would be wise here to state that many of those are not going to emigrate but are going on holidays &mdash; and good luck to them that they have the capability and the money to go on <Col N="1320" /> holidays.  I certainly will take into account some of the other points he raised.</P>
    <P>I would like also to take the opportunity to thank those Senators who welcomed me here to the House.  I look forward to being here for many years, working in co-operation with them.</P>
    <P>I would like, in the first place, to thank very sincerely the movers of the motion. While there are many interpretations of it, it is proper that we should read the motion.  I will try to stick to that in my reply.  The action is most timely, both in the context of the life of the Seanad and in the context of the present state of the problem which the motion addresses.</P>
    <P>As far as the Seanad is concerned, it is most appropriate that the issue of emigration is addressed so early after the House has been convened.  It indicates the priority which Senators give this problem, a priority with which the Government fully and completely agree.  As I said, it is an indication of the experience quite a number of Senators have had.  In the context of the present state of the problem the motion is also timely as it enables us to assess recent US legislation on immigration &mdash; the most important on the subject for many years &mdash; and its impact on our citizens.</P>
    <P>There has been, of course, a great deal of speculation about the number of Irish people in the US whose status is unclear or uncertain.  Given the absence of clear statistical information, this is perhaps understandable; but I would like to emphasise that the figures which have been mentioned from time to time are, in my view, exaggerated.  Irish and US national systems are not designed to monitor illegal immigration flows and because of the nature of illegal immigration itself we have a problem in identifying how many of these emigrate specifically to the United States. However, recent research, which we have carried out in conjunction with US sources, suggests that the total number of Irish illegal immigrants in the US is considerably less than some reports suggest. I take the point made by Senator Mooney and others &mdash; I can vouch for it from my own experience in my county &mdash;<Col N="1321" /> that a tremendous number of people have left, that the GAA in America in recent years, both in hurling and football, has had a revival.  When one takes into account the decline in small rural clubs in Ireland, one can quite safely add two and two and come up with the proper answer.</P>
    <P>This Government are conscious and understanding of the personal difficulties each of our emigrants is facing because of the uncertain nature of his or her status.  The Government are also aware of the anxiety and fear of their families here at home.</P>
    <P>Turning to recent legislative developments in the US, as Senators are well aware, entry into the United States, particularly from Central American countries, has been a major cause of concern to the United States for a considerable period of years.  Last year saw the passing of not one but three pieces of legislation in this area, all designed to curb illegal immigration and to make it difficult for illegal immigrants to remain in the United States.  The particular legislation to which the motion before us refers, and which is of the greatest significance for Irish citizens, is the Immigration Reform and Control Act, 1986. From the Irish point of view this legislation contains three provisions of direct interest to us.  First, it provides for an amnesty; second, it provides for a new non-preference category of immigration &mdash; the lottery visas; and, third, it contains new employer restrictions.</P>
    <P>In the first place it provided for an amnesty for all illegal immigrants who had arrived in the United States before 1 January 1982.  To qualify for such amnesty aliens, as well as having had to enter the United States before January 1982, must satisfy the immigration authorities that their legal status expired before that date and that they were continuously resident in the United States from before that date and that they were continuously present in the United States since 6 November, 1986, that is, at the passing of the Act.  We do not know how many Irish could benefit from this; but, as it is calculated that several thousand <Col N="1322" /> Irish people were illegally present in the United States on that date, we believe that this measure will be of real value to them.</P>
    <P>The second feature of the 1986 Act which is of immediate benefit to Irish people is the NP5 or lottery visas.  This provision, which was mentioned by Senators Mooney, McKenna, Kennedy and others, has as its genesis a proposal from Congressman Brian Donnelly that there should be a specific annual quota of 5,000 visas for Irish people who wish to emigrate to the United States.  In the negotiations between the two Houses of Congress this proposal was replaced by one which provided that a total of 10,000 visas, to be divided over a two year period, be allocated to nationals of the countries which were most disadvantaged by the passing of the 1965 Immigration Act, again a point mentioned by many Senators in their contributions.  These countries totalled not less than 36.</P>
    <P>In between the passing of the Act and its implementation, and following representations from, among other sources, our Embassy in Washington, the State Department decided that the most equitable way of distributing these 10,000 visas would be on the principle of first come, first served.  The result of this is now well known.  Nearly 1.5 million applications were received in Washington from all sources.  Of the 10,000 visas actually awarded, over 3,000 went to Irish people, some of whom were living illegally in the United States.  Successful applicants in this lottery have been notified and their applications are now, I understand, being processed by the US authorities here.</P>
    <P>It is of particular interest to note that the number of such visas issued so far this year &mdash; in the region of 300 to 400 &mdash; is equal to the number of normal preference emigrant visas issued in the same period. In other words, this provision has meant that the number of Irish people wishing to emigrate legally on a long-term basis to the United States has already doubled as a result of the passing of this particular provision.</P>
    <P>The 1986 Act had, of course, another side to it, and it is one which has rightly <Col N="1323" /> occupied the minds of Senators.  This relates to what is called the employer provisions.  Until the passing of the 1986 Act the attention of the US Immigration and Naturalisation Services were concentrated on the alien.  Under the new Act the direct target has now become the employer of the alien.  It is unlawful for an employer to knowingly hire, recruit or reserve for a fee aliens who are not authorised to work in the United States. Employers who violate the Act are subject to substantial civil penalties.  These sanctions affect all US employers regardless of the size of their companies.  There is, however, a &ldquo;grandfather&rdquo; provision which permits an employer to continue to employ an illegal alien who was hired before 7 November 1986, although, of course, the onus is still on the alien to have his or her situation regularised.</P>
    <P>Because of the unique nature of these provisions, which are a dramatic departure from previous US Federal law, there is a phase-in period for the sanction provisions. This period was originally to run out on 31 May but it has now been extended to 1 October.  The principal impact of these provisions on illegal aliens will be that, firstly, it will be much more difficult for those who arrived in the United States after 6 November 1986 to find work.  Secondly, for those who arrived before 6 November 1986 it will be more difficult to move to another job. Clearly, employers who face the possibility of heavy penalties will be reluctant to hire illegal aliens.</P>
    <P>These new sanctions will also affect aliens who are in the United States legally. They would have to provide employers with proof of their identity and their authorisation to work.</P>
    <P>The response of Fianna Fáil and the Government to the developments I have just outlined has been at two levels.  In the first place we are making a determined effort to generate sustained economic growth here at home so as to develop the capacity of our economy to employ people in productive industry and services in Ireland.  This is an essential aim of our Programme for National Recovery <Col N="1324" /> and the prime object of Government activity since we were elected &mdash; and this is a point mentioned by, among others, Senator O'Toole and Senator O'Callaghan. Could I just take Senator O'Toole's point, when he says that Irish youth have the right to work in Ireland. I and Fianna Fáil wholeheartedly support that idea.  It is one of the principal aims of our development programme that we should be able to employ our people here at home and it takes into account also the point raised by Senator Ryan.  I feel that one emigrant is one too many.</P>
    <P>Secondly, we are mounting a substantial political and diplomatic effort to improve the position of those who have entered the US illegally.  I would like to remind Senators of what the Fianna Fáil Party programme says on this matter, and this was prior to the election:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are greatly concerned over the plight of many thousands of young Irish people who have been forced to emigrate over the past four years.  Special problems have arisen in the United States where the status and general uncertainty of their position prevents them from making definite plans for the future&mdash;</P>
    <P>Again, it is something that was raised by a number of Senators, including Senator Norris&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;and where they are often exposed to exploitation in their employment. This is a cause of great anxiety not only to those directly involved but also to their families here at home.  Fianna Fáil would therefore undertake a major political and diplomatic initiative to secure legal status for these young people.</P>
    <P>In other words, Fianna Fáil had identified this problem as a very real one, from the experiences of our TDs, Senators and councillors all round the country, and had, before the election, decided on what action should be taken.  As Senators are aware, within one week of taking up office the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste visited the United States and met members of the influential Friends of <Col N="1325" /> Ireland, Congressional leaders and representatives of the US Administration and discussed this matter in depth with them.  We are satisfied that as a result of that presentation members of the Congress and the Administration now have a much greater appreciation of the difficulties faced by our immigrants, of the need for measures to help regularise their position and of the urgent degree of priority which this Government attach to this problem.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the visit of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste has already had an important outcome with the tabling of a draft Bill by Congressman Donnelly last month which, if enacted, would increase the number of immigrants' visas available to Irish citizens.  The purpose of this Bill would, in effect, be to set up a new or seventh preference category of 27,000 visas.  The new quota would be aimed again at citizens from countries, including Ireland, disadvantaged under the 1965 Act.  It would come into effect in 1989.</P>
    <P>The Government have welcomed very warmly Congressman Donnelly's proposal, and I would like to use this opportunity to express our strong appreciation for the dedicated efforts he has made on behalf of our citizens, both on the occasion of the passing of the 1986 Act and with the introduction of this new measure.  I hope the ideas it contains will be taken up by the US Congress in a manner which will provide permanent benefit for those of our citizens who wish to live and work legally in the United States.  We have signalled our reaction to our friends in both Houses of Congress, and here I would like to take some little issue with some of the criticisms that have been levelled at them.</P>
    <P>Throughout the passage of the 1986 Act the Friends of Ireland, which include both Senator Kennedy and Speaker O'Neill, stayed in very close touch with the Irish Embassy in Washington and helped smooth the legislative process, in particular of the visa lottery part of the Bill.  There seems to be a view prevalent in certain quarters that our interests were ignored in this respect by our Friends. Nothing, in fact, could be further from <Col N="1326" /> the truth and I would like, Sir, to put this on record and to have the record straight on that point.  How long it will take to have Congressman Donnelly's present measure adopted and what final form it will take is, of course, something that nobody in this House can say, given the intricacies and complexities of the American system.  I take Senator Ryan's point. Again, it was one that was raised and also touched upon by Senator Norris and by Senator O'Callaghan: that there is a grave need to alert prospective illegal emigrants to the US of the pitfalls that can await them there.</P>
    <P>Turning, however, to the point of the motion &mdash; the possibility of the very adverse repercussions of the implementation of the employer clauses in the 1986 Act, which was mentioned by many of the speakers &mdash; I would like to assure Senators that the Government are watching the situation most closely and will take cognisance of the remarks and advice given by many of the Senators. Through the Embassy in Washington and our Consulates in the United States we are maintaining close and continuous contact with Irish American groups and with Church representatives.</P>
    <P>In this regard I welcome the remarks of Senator Murphy on his own experience in Boston when he spoke of the admirable manner in which the consular staff in Boston had looked after the emigrants there.  Should any Irish citizen who is working illegally in the States contact any of our offices they will be either directly advised of their rights and how to regularise their position or referred to agencies who have a more specialised knowledge of the law.  I urge them certainly to do so, and I urge any Senator who is in contact with any of our emigrants also to urge them to contact the Embassy.  Should the law appear to be unfavourably implemented as regards our citizens we will not hesitate to draw the attention of the US authorities to this and to seek prompt modification of their position.</P>
    <P>This Government share the deep concern of Senators about the numbers of young Irish who have left our shores to <Col N="1327" /> live and work in the United States and about the implications for them of legislative changes there.  We have already acted quickly to deliver on the commitment in our Programme for National Recovery and I can assure the House that our objectives in this regard will be pursued vigorously in the coming months.  I can also assure Senators on behalf of the Government that we will do everything we can to ensure that the adverse effects of this Act will be minimised as much as possible.  I have great pleasure in accepting the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I, as a member of the Fianna Fáil group &mdash; indeed it was in the name and spirit of the Fianna Fáil group that this motion was put down &mdash; thank the Minister for his contribution and, indeed, for his presence throughout the debate both last week and again this evening?  In particular I would like to thank him for the very strong commitment he has given and the strong commitment of the Government to the young Irish who are now finding themselves in a legal vacuum in the United States.  In that context I hope the word will go out from this House, that the Government will use every means at their disposal to get across the message of this debate, and their own message as typified in the speech of the Minister, and that he will get that message across to the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an important message to get across.  It is one that, up to now, seemingly is not getting across.  I would like to quote from Niall O'Dowd's column in &ldquo;The Irish in America&rdquo; yesterday in which he talks about a function that took place in the Tower View Ballroom last Saturday night and says that over 900 young Irish turned up for the first function held by the new Irish emigration reform movement.  He said that probably it was at least 30 years ago, during the great emigrant arrivals of the fifties, that there was such a crowd of people.  But one of the people speaking at that, a Mr. Seán Minihan, who was one of the <Col N="1328" /> organisers of the &ldquo;New Irish&rdquo;, as they call themselves, said: &ldquo;We have had our fill of lip service from politicians in the Irish Government on how they would help the situation.  The New Irish would help themselves&rdquo;.  I hope the message will go out to Mr. Minahan and, indeed, to all of his friends who have set up the emigration reform movement, that this Government, this House and the representatives of the people of this country are four-square behind them and have made a public commitment to the cause that they have espoused and that, as has been pointed out by the Minister, every conceivable effort which has been taken will continue to be taken to monitor the attitudes, the behaviour on a legislative level of the US Government as it affects our citizens abroad.  As I say again, the message, hopefully, going out loud and clear from this Chamber is, &ldquo;We do care&rdquo;.  Thank you.</P>

I would like to pass a few comments on what was said by Senator Robinson this morning regarding the Seanad Chamber. She suggested that the Office of Public Works were not dealing with the matter of the Seanad Chamber as they should be.  The ceiling of the Chamber is a wide ceiling and of very great importance architecturally and just because the Office of Public Works took the full ceiling into account &mdash; I am not exactly sure what the architectural phraseology is &mdash; and took an impression of the full ceiling, it does not mean that they are going to take down the full ceiling.  It would have been impossible to repair part of the ceiling without taking a full impression and the <Col N="1329" /> Office of Public Works have taken a full impression of the ceiling so that if anything happens during the renovation works they will know exactly what was there before the renovation began.  I would like to assure Senator Robinson that the Office of Public Works are just taking precautions and are not going to go in and just take the ceiling apart as she was suggesting this morning.</P>

      <P>The Chair has received notice from Senator Fennell that on the Motion for the Adjournment she wishes to raise the matter of: The recent savage cuts by the Department of Health to Hume Street Hospital which will mean the termination of their vital day care treatment for thousands of psoriasis sufferers &mdash; and closing from the end of June of the women's screening clinic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank you and say how pleased I am to have been allowed to raise this matter on the Adjournment this evening.  I am pleased to see the Minister of State is here to listen to the points put forward.  I wish to raise the matter of the severe cutbacks in the allocation for the years 1987-88 to Hume Street Hospital.  The allocation has been reduced by one-third from last year and now stands at £796,000.  Before I address myself to the main part of what I have to say, I would like to put on record a letter received from the Secretary-Manager, Miss Leahy.</P>
      <P>Resulting from reorganisation in August 1985 with the advice and approval of the Department of Health, the first five day week hospital in Ireland was established in Hume Street Hospital (incorporating a Day Care unit).  Bed numbers were reduced from 90 to 40 together with agreed reductions in staff complement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reorganisation of the hospital is in line with the policy document of the Department of Health &ldquo;Health &mdash; The <Col N="1330" /> Wider Dimensions&rdquo;.  The distribution of workload away from in-patient care to other delivery modes within the hospital, such as out-patient and day care through the operation of special units, like day-wards, five-day wards and programmed investigation units is a major objective of hospital policy. These concepts are increasingly being embodied in the approach to hospital planning&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The reorganisation of Hume Street Hospital cost £265,000.  The hospital contributed £175,000 from voluntary funding and the Department of Health provided a capital grant of £90,000.</P>
    <P>In 1984 the hospital deficit came to £1.2 million; if similar expenditure had continued in 1986 the deficit would have been in the region of £1.5 million.</P>
    <P>However, Hume Street Hospital is operating in an environment which requires efficient and effective use of the limited resources available as can be seen from the following:</P>

    </table>
    <P>We have now been asked to cut back to £796 million.  To operate within our estimated budget of £930,000 necessitated terminating the employment of 10 full time staff members.</P>
    <P>To comply with the Department of Health allocation would mean terminating the employment of a further 12 staff members.</P>
    <P>Clearly, if this hospital's unique and vital economical service is to be viable such a measure is not practical.</P>
    <P>Our new hospital is being used as a model for dermatology units in the UK and abroad.  Medical/Nursing and Administrative Staff from abroad regularly visit the hospital in order to learn how best to establish similar units.</P>
    <P>Hume Street Hospital accepted in 1985, the challenge of a radical change in its operation.  They made the savings <Col N="1331" /> already.  Other services also need to reorganise in line with the economical constraints.  How can they be persuaded to follow in the footsteps of Hume Street if the consequences for taking up that challenge is certain death?</P>
    <P>That is a letter received from the secretary-manager of the hospital.</P>
    <P>I would like to give some background to the hospital itself and to the service provided by Hume Street.  As was mentioned, in 1985 this hospital changed quite radically from what was generally known as Hume Street Skin and Cancer Hospital.  The emphasis since that time of rationalisation has been on dermatology and it still includes the treatment of skin cancers.  However, the very important function performed by this hospital now and which concerns me tonight is unique in this country; it is their day care centre for psoriasis victims.  Another imaginative initiative which they took was the operation of the five-day week hospital. When it became apparent that rationalisation was needed many innovative ideas were put forward and discussed and developed in the hospital, one of those being the very popular women's screening clinic which is now under threat also. Prior to that time the personnel at Hume Street Hospital went to a great deal of trouble to see how day care units for treating the condition of psoriasis were organised in other countries.  The unit which exists now in Hume Street is modelled on treatment centres in Sweden and the United States.  It was designed and set up with assisted funding, as has already been said, from the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the members of the board of Hume Street, to the staff in Hume Street, particularly its matron, Miss Maeve O'Dwyer, and to its secretary-manager both of whom are committed to the concept of a day treatment centre.  It has to be said and anyone who has been a patient in Hume Street knows that this hospital has an ambience and a cheerful <Col N="1332" /> and willing staff that is in my opinion rather unusual even in the caring world of medicine.  It is thanks both to the Department of Health and the work of Hume Street Hospital that the hospital was able successfully to transform and change its services and develop a highly successful treatment centre.</P>
    <P>I have asked for this debate because I want to put it very forcibly to the Minister that what is happening in Hume Street is, in my opinion and in many other people's opinions, what is needed throughout the country: that people who do not need to be hospitalised, who do not need to occupy acute beds, who are sufficiently healthy to come to well-equipped day treatment centres should be encouraged to do that.  This makes good sense and is good political housekeeping.</P>
    <P>Hume Street's approach to its work is to discourage people from feeling that they are ill and to let them see that in many instances they can continue with their normal lives and their jobs while being treated for a particular complaint. I regret to say that this type of petty pruning which the Minister has exercised in this case is very shortsighted.  Hume Street Hospital is not of an enormous scale in its budget.  It does not involve anything like the kinds of amounts that are discussed in both Houses when cuts are being debated.  Perhaps it is because of this fact, that it is only such a small amount by comparison, that it has been overlooked and suffers a 30 per cent reduction which is felt very severely by them.  It does not get the prominence and the attention that the larger reductions in other hospitals have had.  This is something the Minister should look at very carefully.</P>
    <P>I suggest that initiatives such as those which have been taken in Hume Street need to be cherished, encouraged and copied.  I am not proposing the retention of acute hospitals or acute beds because I am fully aware that we are spending too much money on the number of acute beds we have at the moment.  Hume Street Hospital is showing that there is a better way.  That was the slogan that was very much used before the general election by <Col N="1333" /> the Fianna Fáil Party.  There is a new philosophy of shared care there, where patients who occupy hospital beds for five days of the week: those patients go home to their families at the weekend and return on Monday.  The hospital has shown that the State need not in all instances take over total care for people who are ill.  It is a case of sharing responsibility and support.  I believe our idea has to be to encourage people to do this.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister personally to look into the work of this hospital and he will see that it is a very encouraging development that people have related to and are using with great results.  Those people are sufferers from psoriasis which is a very debilitating and incurable skin condition.  This unit serves patients from all over the country.  They can come in as early as 8 o'clock in the morning, can have an hour or two of treatment and can then quite comfortably go to their jobs. Employers who have workers who suffer from psoriasis are now aware of the treatment available.  Due to the fact that it has cut down on absenteeism they are very ready and willing to give time off, if this is necessary, in the mornings so that workers do not have to become in-patients in hospital for treatment.</P>
    <P>The in-patient treatment was the only service that existed prior to August 1985 when the condition of psoriasis became so severe that treatment was necessary. A patient would have to spend two or three weeks in hospital being sick, or pretending to be sick, when in fact he or she was not really sick enough to be in bed, in order to get specialised care.  I put it to the Minister that if he compares the cost factor of putting in hospital a person who does not really need in-care treatment, and all this involves, compared with facilitating that same person with two hours treatment daily, extending only the specialised treatment and care he or she needs, he will have to see the sense and reason in the argument for funding Hume Street Hospital to enable it to continue its valuable work.</P>
    <P>On its present grant Hume Street Hospital is at risk of closing down.  If that <Col N="1334" /> unit closes what will happen?  That is the very big question.  All the people who can be and are being treated there will be thrown back on to the acute hospital list. To give an idea of the figures involved, prior to its reorganisation this hospital treated 20 patients a week as in-patients; now they can treat 100 a day, 70 in day care and 30 as in-patients.  The hospital has affected a 30 per cent reduction in its running costs while dealing with four times as many patients.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the commitment from the Minister and the Department to institute a review of health services.  I suggest that it would have made much greater sense to have had the review before the cuts.  We have a classic example here of how cuts can lead to the demise of an innovative idea.  What is the point of having the review afterwards when this innovative idea and practice have gone?  A subsequent review will not really be very relevant when a unit such as the one I am speaking about, which exists in Hume Street, has died from lack of funds.  That is why I would like to impress upon the Minister the importance of giving this hospital the small extra allocation they need in order to allow them to continue their work.</P>
    <P>There are splendid people involved in this unit who firmly and sincerely believe in the work it is doing and I would like to pay tribute to them all.  They have worked as a team to establish the psoriasis unit and to ensure that it works to maximum efficiency.  They show great care and kindness to those attending it and they are battling to keep this treatment centre open at all costs.  They cannot do it without departmental support and without official understanding of this work.  I appeal to the Minister to review the reduction for Hume Street in the coming year and I have every confidence that with the first-hand experience that the Minister for Health, who is himself a doctor, has of this complaint he will find the small funding necessary to ensure the continued operation of this very important unit.</P>

      <P>First, I would like to acknowledge the Senator's concern in regard to this issue and I welcome the opportunity on behalf of the Department to explain the present position.  I am also delighted to see the matron and the secretary-manager of the hospital here this evening as well.</P>
      <P>Hume Street Hospital specialises in the treatment of dermatological conditions, most notably psoriasis.  It operates on an out-patient basis with a back-up number of five-day beds.  In 1985, the hospital established a women's screening clinic on the basis of funds provided from voluntary sources for a two year trial period. Hume Street Hospital has received an allocation of £0.796 million in the current year.  The hospital is at present implementing measures to enable it to provide the service to patients within the available funds.  These measures include the termination of the women's screening clinic at the end of June.  I would like to mention at this point that this clinic was established at the hospital on the basis of private funding.  I regret that these private funds are no longer available to the hospital to enable the clinic to continue but I fully understand the position in this regard.  With regard to the daycare facilities including the services for psoriasis patients, I am aware that the hospital is considering further measures in order to live with its approved allocation. However, the hospital has not yet made any firm decisions on the extent of these measures or on their timing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1336" /> In conclusion, Senators will be aware that on 19 May last the Minister spoke in the Dáil about the drawing up of a national plan which would have regard to the streamlining of the acute hospital systems throughout the country.  He pointed out in that Chamber that officers from the Department would, with assistance from Comhairle na nOspidéal, commence discussions with management of health boards and voluntary hospitals to devise a plan for each health board area. This consultative process is now well advanced and will be completed in a matter of weeks.  Bearing this in mind, I do not think it appropriate that I should comment on any individual hospital until such time as the review group have completed their task and reported to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the work being carried out at Hume Street, which is very useful indeed and I regret the very difficult times that Hume Street may be experiencing. Hopefully, when the review is completed a further discussion can take place.</P>
