      <P>Could we have some indication as to whether it is proposed to finish the Second Stage of Item No. 1 today because I would like to make a very strong point on that.  I have to repeat what I said earlier this week, that we see no reason to take this Bill here today. We feel that, if ever legislation needed time for reflection, this is it.  The passage of the weekend would have allowed Members of this House to reflect on many points that were made in the other House and, indeed, to talk to outside groups who have a very definite interest in this legislation.  The debate in the other House showed just how important an open mind is on these very important matters.  I was very impressed with the open-minded approach of the Government.</P>

      <P>I am endeavouring to be constructive and if I may make this point I will not be any way obstructive in voting against the Order of Business.  It is an important point and it has to be made.  I feel that this is not emergency legislation.  There is no time deadline to be met.  The other deadline on extradition was met earlier this week.  We on this side of the House will be urging the President very strongly to refer this Bill to the courts when it goes through both Houses, because we want to ensure that there are no constitutional doubts overhanding this Bill.  Since the President will almost certainly do that &mdash; not at our urging but I am sure it is the proper thing for him to do &mdash; there is no question of this Bill coming&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My idea of a speech, when I was on the floor of the House, was the length of time you have now taken.  I am just trying to make a comparison for you.  Could we get back on to the Order of Business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I learned well from reading your interventions on the Order of Business at a different time.  Our concern is that no doubts overhang this Bill and that it gets the fullest possible debate. I would suggest, first of all, that Second Stage should not be completed today, that a time limit should be fixed for the end of today's sitting, that we break at 5.30 p.m. and continue Second Stage next week, or whenever it is proposed that the debate be continued.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I want to put on record the opposition of my group to the way in which this Bill is being rushed through the House.  I suspect that my reservations are shared by many in all parties in this House.</P>

      <P>I would like to support strongly what Senator Manning has said. I believe it is unfortunate that this Bill is being rushed through.  I would also like to have a ruling from the Chair on a matter related to this from the Order of Business that was taken last week.  I would remind the House that Senator <Col N="1971" /> Joe O'Toole and myself had put down a motion on this subject which was withdrawn as a result of advice from the Leader of the House that he would give time at the earliest possible moment to take Item No. 12 on the Order Paper which was a Bill in the name of Senator O'Toole and myself amending the Extradition Bill.  However, on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>What you are raising now does not require my ruling at all. It is a matter for the House itself.  That answers that one for you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask for a ruling on the following point?  It is a point of order and a point of the Constitution.  Senator Lanigan said that it was impossible to take this Bill because of business being conducted in the other House.  When I asked whether the business of the House was to be dictated by the operations of the lower House Senator Lanigan said: &ldquo;Under the Constitution.&rdquo;  I asked then what section of the Constitution and was refused an answer.  I think it is important for the proper conduct of business in this House that we know whether we are operating under the 1937 Constitution or the improvised Lanigan Constitution of 1987.</P>
      <P>I have one further question on the Order of Business.  I would like to know from the Leader of the House if there will be provision for a debate on foreign affairs.  I understood this was to take place.  I think it is important in the lamentable absence of an Oireachtas joint committee on foreign policy, particularly in the light of the visit of Mr. Gorbachov. I believe he may stop at Shannon Airport. It is very important to say that this would be a useful opportunity to protest at the repetition of untrue statements by Mr. Gorbachov about the fate of Raoul Wallenberg.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to the Order of Business.  I agree with Item No. 1 being taken today.  There was general agreement the last day we sat and the Leader of the House assured us that the Bill would not be rushed through the House.  It is appropriate that we should at least begin discussion on the Extradition (Amendment) Bill following its passage through the other House.  I agree with the way the Leader has ordered it. However, I take the point Senator Manning has mentioned.  Is it the intention to compete all of Second Stage today, or is it intended that the House shall rise at the appropriate time and continue next week?  If so, on what day next week does the Leader of the House suggest we should continue Second Stage?  That is really all I want to ask.  It is appropriate, if we are doing that, that we should not have a lunch break or a tea break and get as much of the Second Stage debate completed today as possible.  I certainly do think we should not rush it through to completion and the Leader of the House has agreed not to rush the Bill.  I welcome his assurance on that.</P>

      <P>This is a very impractical arrangement.  It gives the lie to the <Col N="1973" /> assurance the Leader of the House gave us earlier this week that this Bill would not be rushed through.  Surely it is more appropriate to fix a time to convenience the Members of this House and to facilitate greater debate and to have this debate concluded at 5.30 p.m. to 6 p.m. this evening and to continue it next week?</P>

I understand there are many speakers on all sides of the House and we are unlikely to finish so let us be reasonable.  We will discuss through the Whips in the afternoon the proposed finishing time.  It does not necessarily mean the completion of Second Stage.  We will do what we can. Let us not argue about it.  The Whips should meet.</P>

    <Title>Extradition (Amendment) Bill, 1987: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Col N="1974" />
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Extradition (Amendment) Bill, 1987, comes before the Seanad following a prolonged debate and detailed scrutiny on Committee and Report Stages in the Dáil.  The Bill has been strengthened in that process.  That is how it should be. The Bill is an important measure, because it addresses very real public concerns about our existing extradition arrangements.</P>
      <P>In practical terms when we talk about extradition from this State, we are talking almost entirely about extradition to Northern Ireland and Britain.  That is why the safeguards in the Bill deal with those arrangements.</P>
      <P>The event of recent weeks demonstrate the importance of our arrangements with those jurisdictions.  Those events have brought home in very stark terms the threat which terrorist inspired violence on this island poses to us all.  I have in mind the vicious kidnapping of Dr. John O'Grady and events which followed from that.  I speak also of the <i>Eksund</i> affair &mdash; the attempted importation of highly sophisticated weaponry on an unprecedented scale and the reports of previous successful attempts in the past few years.  I am sure I speak for all Senators when I record once more the Government's appreciation of the prompt and timely intervention by the French authorities in the matter.</P>
      <P>Finally, in referring to recent events, I must mention the atrocity at Enniskillen. Words are inadequate to express the sense of horror and anger we all felt at that outrage.  That event revealed the two sides of the scourge of terrorism on this island.  On the one hand we had a mindless act of terror directed against a community peacefully honouring their dead. On the other hand we had the courage and forbearance of the survivors and relatives of those killed.  It is with their living Christianity that I know the Members of this House would wish to identify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These events should bring home to us <Col N="1975" /> how crucial arrangements such as those provided for in Part III of the 1965 Act are.  Extradition is an important weapon in the fight against international terrorism. That is why the Government have sought to maintain effective extradition arrangements with Northern Ireland and Britain.  Those arrangements will be enhanced both by the implementation of the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, which came into operation on Tuesday last and by the enactment of this Bill. There should be no mistake about it &mdash; this Bill is important in strengthening our extradition arrangements.  That is because mutual confidence in those arrangements is essential to their proper functioning.  By addressing the very real public concerns which exist about extradition, this Bill will contribute in a significant way to strengthening that mutual confidence and thereby pave the way for the more effective operation of the existing arrangements.</P>
    <P>Public concern about our extradition arrangements has centred on the need to ensure that before a person is extradited there should be sufficient evidence to found a prosecution against him for the offence for which he is being sought.  The new safeguard which section 2 of the Bill provides will address that public concern in a real and meaningful way.  Yet it will do so in a manner which will avoid creating unwarranted obstacles to extradition which the prosecuting authorities in requesting jurisdictions would be unable to meet.</P>
    <P>That new safeguard will operate on an administrative basis.  The essential provisions for this purpose are the new sections 44A and 44B which subsection (1) of section 2 will insert into Part III of the 1965 Act.  Under the existing section 43 of that Act the Garda Commissioner must, subject to the provisions of Part III, endorse a warrant for the arrest of a person accused or convicted of an offence which issued in Britain or Northern Ireland.  Under the new section 44A which section 2 of this Bill inserts into <Col N="1976" /> Part III a warrant for the arrest of a person accused of an offence shall not be endorsed if the Attorney General so directs.</P>
    <P>Section 44B provides that the Attorney General shall give a direction to the commissioner not to endorse a warrant unless, having considered such information as he deems appropriate, he is of opinion, first, that there is a clear intention to prosecute the person sought or to continue a prosecution of that person for the offence specified in the warrant and, second, that that intention is founded on the existence of sufficient evidence.</P>
    <P>Much of the debate on the Bill in the Dáil centred on the issue of whether it should be the Attorney General who performs this function or whether those functions should properly be conferred on some other person.  The Government remain firmly of the view that the Attorney General is the appropriate officer to perform this function.</P>
    <P>The Government hold that view for a number of reasons.  The new function which is being conferred on the Attorney General is consistent with, and will complement, his existing duties in the extradition field.  The Attorney General is responsible for representation of the State in extradition cases.  He also has an important role in administrative arrangements which already exist for the purpose of vetting warrants and related documentation submitted by the British authorities before warrants are endorsed by the commissioner.  The purpose of these arrangements is to eliminate, as far as possible, the opportunity for requests being refused on technical grounds.  It is also the practice for the Attorney General to advise me as Minister for Justice on those same matters in relation to requests which are made to me under Part II of the 1965 Act.</P>
    <P>The second consideration which convinces the Government that the Attorney General is the appropriate person is that the functions he will be performing under this Bill are analogous to those which a number of statutes have reserved to him <Col N="1977" /> as regards deciding whether proceedings should or should not be instituted in relation to prosecutions which involve an international dimension.  Those statutes include the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976, the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1978, and the powers reserved in relation to the Geneva Conventions Act, 1962, the Official Secrets Act, 1963, and the Genocide Act, 1973, by section 3 (5) of the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974.</P>
    <P>There is another issue which is related to the question of the appropriateness of the Attorney General's involvement in the new procedures provided for by the Bill.  That issue is whether the functions he will be performing are judicial in nature or not.  That was a question which was debated at length in the Dáil.  The Government are of the view that these new functions are essentially executive or administrative in nature.  The Government clearly could not seek to confer judicial functions on a non-judicial officer of the State.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that the Bill does confer judicial functions on the Attorney General seems to be based on a fundamental misunderstanding as to the purpose and effect of section 2.  That section will require the Attorney General to form an opinion as to whether there is a clear intention to prosecute or to continue a prosecution of the person sought and as to whether that intention is founded on sufficient evidence.  The formation of that opinion will simply be a necessary and preliminary step to the initiation of the extradition process.  The Attorney General is not being empowered to determine any issue in relation to the court proceedings which will have to follow.  The issue of deciding whether the offence for which the person is sought is extraditable or whether the person can be properly extradited will remain one for the courts in this jurisdiction.  Going beyond that, the issue of committal for trial and his innocence or guilt will remain a matter for the courts in the requesting jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>In dealing with section 2, I should mention one minor yet significant amendment which was made to the Bill yesterday in <Col N="1978" /> the Dáil.  That was the amendment of section 44A to enable the Attorney General to revoke a direction previously made under that section.  That change is significant because it will enable the Attorney General to respond to changes in circumstances regarding the information which may become available to him.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for another important safeguard related to the rule of specialty and restrictions on the reextradition of extradited persons.  Those safeguards are already provided in Part II of the Act and the Bill will give a statutory basis for their introduction for the purposes of Part III.</P>
    <P>Section 3 will do this by empowering me as Minister for Justice to provide by order for the application of section 20, 21 and 39 of the 1965 Act under Part III. Section 20 gives effect in the State to the rule of specialty for the purposes of extradition from the State while section 39 provides for the same rule where a person has been surrendered to the State. Section 21 of the Act imposes similar restrictions on the right of a country to which a person has been extradited to reextradite that person to a third country.</P>
    <P>Briefly the effect of the rule of specialty is that extradition may not be granted unless provision is made by the law of the requesting country that the person claimed will not be proceeded against for an offence committed prior to his surrender other than that for which his extradition has been granted except (a) with the consent of the requested State or (b) where the person has not left the territory of the requesting State within a specified period of his final discharge in respect of the offence for which he was extradited or has returned to that State's territory after leaving it.  The requested State is, however, required to consent to the bringing of additional charges if the offence for which consent is requested is itself one for which there is an obligation to grant extradition.</P>
    <P>The Bill allows, as I have said, these provisions to be applied by order.  The reason for proceeding this way rather <Col N="1979" /> than by re-enacting the relevant provisions by way of this Bill is that adaptations and modifications will be necessary to take account of the differences in the nature of the procedures provided by Parts II and III of the 1965 Act.  There is also the consideration that the effect of the sections which are being applied is to require provision to be made in the law of the requesting country, which, for the purposes of Part III, means, of course, in British law.  That is not to say that there will be no safeguards in this area in the period before an order is made under section 3.</P>
    <P>Section 44, subsection (2) and section 50, subsection (2) (b) and (4) of the 1965 Act already provide certain safeguards in the matter of bringing additional charges. I have already said that the purpose of section 3 is to give the safeguards the rule of specialty affords to an extradited person a statutory basis.  That is because there are already certain administrative arrangements in place which are intended to ensure that the specialty principle is observed in our extradition arrangements with Northern Ireland and Britain.</P>
    <P>The third safeguard contained in the Bill is intended to address the concern that the coming into force of the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, might result in persons becoming liable for extradition in circumstances which would not serve the interests of justice.  Section 2, subsection (1) (b) of the Bill addresses that concern by amending the 1965 Act to enable a person whose extradition is sought to apply to the High Court to have his extradition refused on the ground that, by reason of the lapse of time since he is alleged to have committed the offence or been convicted of it and other exceptional circumstances, it would be unjust, oppressive or invidious to extradite him.</P>
    <P>This new provision closely reflects the approach taken by the courts in those few extradition cases where the question of unfairness by reason of lapse of time has come up.  The case of McMahon v Leahy [1985] ILRM, 422 is indicative of the sort <Col N="1980" /> of circumstances in which lapse of time would make it unjust, oppressive or invidious to extradite a person.  Mere lapse of time will not on its own be a ground for refusing an extradition request.  An amendment was accepted in the Dáil which makes this crystal clear beyond any possible doubt.</P>
    <P>A number of other more substantial amendments were made in the Dáil. These related to two issues &mdash; first, renewal of the Bill's provisions after a year and, second, prohibition of improper communications being made to the Attorney General for the purpose of influencing the making of a decision by him to give a direction under section 44A.</P>
    <P>On the first of these points the Bill as it now stands provides in section 7, subsection (4) that it shall expire 12 months after the date of its passing unless before then a resolution is passed by each House of the Oireachtas declaring that it should continue in operation after that time.  The origins of this provision are to be found in an assurance given to the Dáil by the Taoiseach in his opening statement on Second Stage that the new arrangements contained in the Bill would be carefully monitored by the authorities here. He said that public opinion would wish to be assured that extradition works fairly and properly and that the new arrangements would be scrupulously adhered to.</P>
    <P>We would wish to see the arrangements upheld both in letter and spirit, he said.  If they were not upheld the Dáil and the people would expect him to come back and set the arrangements aside and he gave an assurance of his intention to do that.  He also made it clear that should it emerge after a period of 12 months that these arrangements were not working satisfactorily and persons whose extradition was fully justified could evade the law, the Government would bring forward revised proposals to deal with such a situation.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage in the Dáil the main Opposition party put down an amendment which was designed to write this assurance about monitoring and review into the Bill itself.  This amendment was in keeping with what the <Col N="1981" /> Government had intended to do in any event, so we accepted the principle behind it and, on Report Stage, amended the Bill accordingly with some slight modifications.</P>
    <P>To facilitate the process of monitoring and review of the Bill's operation, section 6 of the Bill as it now stands contains provision for an annual report being made to both Houses of the Oireachtas on the operation in the preceding year of Part III of the 1965 Act &mdash; the new safeguards being provided in the Bill are being incorporated into Part III.  This provision also originates from an amendment proposed by the main Opposition party on Committee Stage in the Dáil and accepted by us on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>The other important amendment made to the Bill in the Dáil is reflected in section 4 of the Bill as it now stands.  It prohibits communications with the Attorney General for the purpose of influencing the making of a decision to give a direction under section 44A, other than proper communications of information that is relevant to the giving of such a direction.  &ldquo;Relevant&rdquo; here means, the section says, relevant for the purposes of forming an opinion that there is a clear intention to prosecute and that such intention is founded on the existence of sufficient evidence.</P>
    <P>This provision stemmed from a concern that was expressed by a number of speakers in the Dáil that the Attorney General might be subjected to representations and improper attempts to influence his decision as to whether or not to give a direction under section 44A. The Government did not think it necessary to include a provision of this kind in the Bill in the first place because they considered that the situation in question would not arise anyway.  However, once an amendment was put down on the subject we did not wish to oppose it and we brought forward an alternative amendment ourselves on Report Stage which is now enshrined in section 4.</P>
    <P>Those, then, are the provisions of the Bill itself.  Before concluding I want to refer again to the Extradition (European <Col N="1982" /> Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, which came into operation on Tuesday last, to which the Bill now before the House is related.  The coming into operation of that Act has paved the way for ratification by Ireland of the Terrorism Convention.  The purpose of the Convention is to assist in the suppression of terrorism by complementing and, where necessary, modifying existing extradition arrangements between member states of the Council of Europe.  It seeks to overcome the difficulties which may arise in the case of extradition involving persons accused or convicted of terrorist offences by eliminating or restricting the possibility of a spurious political content or motivation for such offences being invoked in order to oppose an extradition request.</P>
    <P>The Convention provides that certain particularly odious offences are never to be regarded as political &mdash; hijacking of aircraft, kidnapping or hostage taking, use of explosives or automatic firearms which endanger persons, etc.  The Convention was drawn up against the background of growing international terrorism affecting nearly all European countries.  This led to a consensus among the member countries of the Council of Europe, who have democratic values and traditions in common, that people committing acts of terrorism in any one of these countries should not be able to find a haven in a neighbouring country and claim exemption from extradition by virtue of the political offence exception.</P>
    <P>We are a member of the community of European nations and we play our part in this common fight against terrorism. Extradition is a particularly effective measure for combating terrorism.  By ratifying the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism and at the same time ensuring that there are sufficient safeguards for the rights of Irish citizens who are wanted for extradition, we will be giving the message to our European partners that we are using all available means of legal co-operation to deal with international terrorism.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say that I have kept my opening statement in this debate <Col N="1983" /> as concise as possible, consistent with the need to do justice to the provisions of the Bill.  I am anxious to encroach as little as possible upon the time available to other speakers and I await with interest what they will have to say on the Bill.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>The destruction of human life in such a callous way and in such a cowardly manner at Enniskillen has brought the outrage of terrorism home to us more forcibly in this part of the island.  The Minister referred to those recent events in relation to the kidnapping of John O'Grady, the destruction at Enniskillen and the finding of the arms cargo destined for this island off the coast of France.  Those three events brought this debate more to the fore and gave impetus to the need for this country to ratify the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.  The outrage in Enniskillen and in particular the words of Gordon Wilson, and Senator Robb in this House, should have left an indelible mark on any warering sympathiser.  We heard of Mr. Wilson's farewell to his daughter and saw Senator Robb extend the poppy to the Leas-Chathaoirleach in this House.</P>
      <P>Gordon Wilson's immediate forgiveness of the perpetrators of the murder of his daughter should be an example to all of us as to the meaning of Christianity.  The kidnapping of John O'Grady, the bombing massacre in Enniskillen and the arms that were seized in France should provide this House with clear evidence that there is an international dimension to terrorism and a clear need for Ireland and Britain to redouble their efforts to defeat terrorism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret the fact that the debates on the Extradition Act, 1986, the Extradition Act, 1965, and the need for this country to ratify and sign the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism should have generated as much heat as they did over the past few weeks.  It was <Col N="1984" /> regrettable that various Fianna Fáil Ministers, Ministers of State, TDs and councillors sought to create conditions before those three tragic events whereby the Government could postpone the implementation of the Extradition Act from 1 December 1987.  I think those same people were not aware that extradition has been part of the arrangement between Ireland and the UK and Northern Ireland since the Taoiseach, who was then Minister for Justice, introduced the 1965 Extradition Act.  It was the present Minister for Foreign Affairs and Tánaiste who in later years put this legislation into operation.  The debates that took place during the passage of the Extradition Act of 1986 last December, using such unfortunate language as &ldquo;treachery&rdquo; and &ldquo;sell out&rdquo; in order to introduce a simple amendment to the 1965 Extradition Act which defined what was not a political offence, were regrettable.  Those words came to mean something different in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court broadly defined the necessity for the amendment to the 1965 Act in the McGlinchey case.  Recent events have shown that we have to forget about our double think, our pseudo Republican cant and whatever ambivalence exists in order to get down to the task of healing the religious and political wounds in this island.  Accordingly, I welcome the implementation of the Extradition Act and the means by which the Government can sign the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.</P>
    <P>It is also important that this legislation should be allowed to pass in order to demonstrate our international dimension and our international commitment to people in the European Community and other neighbouring countries and to the world in general and to show that we are serious about the suppression of terrorism in an international sense, that we are serious in our aim to bring communities together and to work closely with the British authorities in bringing people to justice in a safeguarded way on either side of the Border.</P>
    <P>It is important that the European Convention is signed in order to demonstrate <Col N="1985" /> clearly our support for the Anglo-Irish Agreement in the eyes of our European partners and in the eyes of the members of the United Nations.  This Agreement is so important to bringing about some reconciliation in this island that a simple procedure and simple political speech-making about our anti-British attitude are not good enough in relation to postponing the signing of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.</P>
    <P>We are here today to discuss the Extradition (Amendment) Bill, 1987.  I appeal to the House to look closely at this Bill in the context of recent events.  The decision to bring forward these safeguards may have a doubtful origin but I welcome the fact that safeguards are being proposed in relation to the Extradition Act of 1965.  None of us would like to see a situation arise where Irish citizens could be sent to another jurisdiction, in Northern Ireland or Britain, without getting the proper hearing that benefits the dignity of any Irish citizen going into another jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Government to allow the Extradition Act onto the Statute Books was probably forced upon them because of recent events.  Prior to these events I think the intention was different.  Deputy Blaney in another House stated that the Taoiseach had given him an assurance that he proposed to allow the Extradition Act to wither away.  The type of publicity and attention that brought to a piece of important legislation was regrettable.  If this was ever said, I am one who would never know, nor do I wish to know.</P>

      <P>The Fianna Fáil opposition to the 1987 Act dates back to the debate on this legislation in December 1986 when they endeavoured to mislead the public into thinking this was the first time extradition was introduced in this country. We now know after a period of education over the past few weeks that this is not the case.  The Extradition Act, 1987, enables Ireland to provide the basis for a common approach between the member states of the Council of Europe to the question of what does not constitute a political offence for the purposes of <Col N="1987" /> extradition and mutual assistance.  The offences in question include hijacking of aircraft, kidnapping and hostage taking and offences involving the use of bombs or automatic firearms, if that use endangers persons.  The Extradition Act, 1987, therefore, clearly outlines what does not constitute a political offence.</P>
      <P>There was a great deal of discussion before the European Act was circulated on whether a <i>prima facie</i> requirement should be included.  This arose as a result of some cases involving extradition to Britain or Northern Ireland which were perceived, rightly or wrongly, to have gone wrong in one way or another.  It was pointed out at that time that, even if we wanted to, we could not impose a <i>prima facie</i> requirement unless we were prepared to withdraw from the 1957 European Convention on extradition and to abandon the arrangements for extradition between us and countries of continental Europe.  It is true to say, however, that the position is different in relation to Northern Ireland and Britain, as the British Government have not yet ratified the Convention of 1957 and we could, therefore, change our law so as to require a <i>prima facie</i> case in relation to those jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>Indeed, it has come to my attention in recent times that the British are preparing legislation to take the <i>prima facie</i> requirement out of the law in order to allow them to ratify the 1957 Convention. Clearly, it would have been a waste of time for us to go ahead with insisting on a <i>prima facie</i> requirement because, as soon as Britain ratifies the Convention, we will no longer have the option of maintaining such a requirement.  I welcome the decision by the Government not to proceed along those lines and not to render the arrangements about extradition a lot more difficult than they need be.</P>
      <P>In the course of our preparations for the 1986 Extradition Bill, which is now the 1987 Extradition Act, the question of safeguards was examined and the Minister for Justice then, Deputy Dukes, stated in the Dáil:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1988" /> A full review has taken place and it has been decided bilaterally that a warrant for the return of the fugitive will not be sought unless the Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland, or the Crown Prosecution service in Britain, has considered the evidence and is satisfied that it is sufficient to ground a clear expectation of a prosecution... In effect, this means that a warrant will not be sent from Northern Ireland or Britain for execution in the State &mdash; or <i>vice versa</i>&mdash; unless the case has been examined at a high level to see if there is sufficient evidence on which to bring a charge.  This accords with the principle that extradition is for the purpose of charging a person and not merely for questioning him.</P>
    <P>Those remarks are taken from the Official Report of the Dáil Debate on 4 December 1986, column 1386.  At a later stage in that debate the Minister went on to state:</P>
    <P>The British authorities have now agreed an addition to this arrangement. In all cases where a warrant is sent to this jurisdiction for backing the British Attorney General will send to our Attorney General through diplomatic channels a confirmatory note to the effect that he, that is the British Attorney General, has satisfied himself that the relevant prosecuting authorities have complied with the arrangements I have just described. That note will serve as an additional reassurance that those arrangements have been complied with in each case.</P>
    <P>Those remarks are taken from the Official Report of the Dáil Debates on 16 December 1986, column 3508.</P>
    <P>The passages I have referred to from the Dáil Debates last December show very clearly that there was genuine concern about implementation of safeguards at that time.  The concern then, as it is now, was that the procedures should work properly, and in a manner intended in both jurisdictions, by providing proper <Col N="1989" /> legal safeguards for the persons concerned. The present Bill sets out to provide or to reinforce those safeguards.  In fact, it is consistent in principle with the stand taken a year ago.  If the Government now consider it is necessary in order to bring in safeguards and to achieve proper administration in relation to this Bill, we will certainly welcome that.</P>
    <P>The constitutionality of this Bill, particularly in relation to the section dealing with the powers given to the Attorney General, has been raised in the other House and various people have offered views on whether or not this section is constitutional.  Deputy Kelly and the Government have indicated that they are happy that the powers given to the Attorney General are adequate and will stand up in line with our Constitution. Others have said otherwise.  The only way in which we can be satisfied and ensure that there will be no conflict with the Constitution is to have the President refer this Bill to the Supreme Court at an early date in order to ensure its constitutionality and ensure that we have no difficulties in relation to extradition in the future.</P>
    <P>The difficulty is, of course, that the person who is advising the Government on the constitutionality of this legislation is the same person who is getting the powers, the Attorney General.  I would prefer to see these powers being given to a more independent person, away from the political arena.  The Director of Public Prosecutions, as was mentioned, would provide a clear and unambiguous functional independence from the process of Government.  Since the formation of our State, most Attorneys General have been TDs.  In recent years Deputy Kelly also held that office while he was a TD &mdash; was he the only one?  I stand to be corrected on that, but I understand there were a number of TDs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In view of his close association with the political process of Government and the fact that the Attorney General is a political appointment of the Taoiseach a direction by the Government might interfere with the independence of an Attorney General.  I am concerned about that, but I am open to clarification.  I am pleased to see that the Dáil has decided to insert a review and monitoring system in relation to these powers.  The Houses of the Oireachtas will have to ensure, through a motion, that the administrative and legal powers being conferred on the Attorney General are voted through the Houses again in order to continue them.</P>
      <P>During the course of the Taoiseach's speech in the Dáil last week he said:</P>
      <P>I also wish to make it clear that should it emerge after a period of 12 months that these arrangements are not working satisfactorily and persons whose extradition is fully justified can evade the law, the Government will bring forward revised proposals to deal with such a situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome that statement by the Taoiseach as it reassures us on this side of the House that a genuine attempt is being made to ensure that the independence of the Attorney General is protected and that the unjustified pressure being put on the office of the Attorney General by this procedure will not end up in some future <Col N="1991" /> situation arising where extradition may not actually take place.</P>
    <P>If I were Attorney General I would not like to see this type of power conferred on me in such a sensitive political situation in this country.  It is putting an extremely grave responsibility on the office of the Attorney General and it is putting extreme pressure on the Cabinet in so far as the Attorney General is the legal adviser to the Cabinet and, at the end of the day, the Cabinet will have to make a decision on the matter.  It is bringing the process of extradition too close to the political arena and away from the independence of the judicial system at the moment, away from the courts system and away from a more independent person such as the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It is desirable in this case that an amendment should be introduced and provision made in the Bill to ensure that each year a report from the Attorney General shall be brought before the Dáil. Accordingly, I welcome the amendment passed by the Dáil in this regard.</P>
    <P>As I said before, I think the influence that could be attributed to the Attorney General in this sphere is open to question. I must inform the House that I will be putting down an amendment in order to have these functions assigned to the Director of Public Prosecutions who would be a more independent legal officer in the case of these particular matters.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said in the course of the Dáil debate that the mere passage of time itself will not constitute grounds for refusal of extradition.  In my opinion this provision is not sufficient.  It needs amendment to make it clear that this is his intention and the intention of the Bill. It needs the addition of a phrase to clarify this and we will consider that at a later stage.</P>
    <P>In his speech last Friday the Taoiseach referred to a number of other issues.  He referred to the fact that under the 1957 Convention on extradition he agreed that it was not possible to have a <i>prima facie</i> requirement.  I referred to that earlier and I regret again that the various debates <Col N="1992" /> that have taken place over the past few weeks sought to create this <i>prima facie</i> requirement for some Members of the Dáil in order to disagree with the introduction of the Extradition Act, 1987, and the ratification of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister if the arrangements and the safeguards that were mentioned during the debate on the Extradition Act, 1987, have been working satisfactorily and if there is need for amendment in order to bring them together in a more safeguarded position in the context of this Bill.  Section 2 of this Bill amends Part III of the 1965 Act by the insertion of new sections after section 44.  The new section 44A provides that a warrant for the arrest of a person accused of an offence under the law of one of neighbouring jurisdictions shall not be endorsed for execution if the Attorney General so directs.  This presumably implies that each and every warrant will be referred to the Attorney General and he, and he alone, shall decide whether or not the warrant is to be endorsed for execution.  This is something I will be opposing and I will endeavour to have it changed.</P>
    <P>There are a number of things I would like clarified on section 44B.  How does the Attorney General form an opinion and what sort of information is he likely to need in order to make his decision? What evidence will he regard as sufficient in order to make his decision in relation to extradition?  It is a tremendous obligation to impose on the Attorney General in Ireland and I hope it will not result in long delays before a decision is taken as to whether a warrant will be endorsed.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer also to the provisional warrants usually sent by the RUC to this jurisdiction for the purpose of extradition. They seem to have a very haphazard approach and seem to have difficulty in bringing forward to this jurisdiction the official warrants at an early stage in order to bring about an early <Col N="1993" /> extradition.  An example of this happened recently when a provisional warrant arrived in this jurisdiction and an official warrant was too late to extradite somebody. The Minister should use his good offices to see to it in the context of the Anglo-Irish Agreement that the RUC get their act together, as it were, in relation to these matters.</P>
    <P>As I read the new section 44C &mdash; this could cause problems &mdash; I could envisage situations arising in the future when the Attorney General would be summoned to a court to explain in a particular case why he has decided to endorse a warrant and to explain the grounds on which he made his decision.  This certainly would be an unsatisfactory situation.</P>
    <P>Included in section 44D is a provision enabling a court to discharge an order for a person's extradition where, by reason of the lapse of time since the commission of an offence specified in the warrant having regard to all the circumstances, it would be unjust, oppressive or invidious to make an order to deliver him up under section 47.  I understand that during the course of the Dáil debate an amendment was proposed by the Fine Gael Party in relation to this matter and that the Minister accepted it and introduced an amendment himself which included the words: ...at line 19, page 3, after the word &ldquo;offence&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and other exceptional circumstances&rdquo;.  This would accommodate the fears people have that a lapse of time in itself would be grounds for the refusal of an extradition.  Therefore, this amendment was necessary and important.  It is important when you consider the case of McMahon <i>v.</i> Leahy which the Minister mentioned in his speech and is an indication of how this provision may operate in relation to the lapse of time since the committing of an offence.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with the reforms of certain functions of the Attorney General. Subsection (1) enables the Attorney General to direct a Director of Public Prosecutions or an officer &mdash; either being a barrister or a solicitor &mdash; of the Attorney General designated by him to perform his functions if he is ill, absent <Col N="1994" /> or out of the country, for example.  For the benefit of this House I would like the Minister to expand on various situations that may arise and the way in which extradition will be handled in these circumstances when the Attorney General is not in a position to carry out that process. Subsection (2) enables the Attorney General to revoke a direction under the section.  Does this mean to revoke a direction to act on his behalf or what?</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill sets out the arrangements for the Attorney General to report to the Government on a yearly basis.  I welcome the decision of the Government to review the operation of this provision after 12 months and that it will have to come before both Houses of the Oireachtas in order to allow the powers granted to the Attorney General to continue for another year.  Despite the serious reservations I have regarding the office of the Attorney General and the scrutiny that he will have by his colleagues in Cabinet, I think it is important that the Houses of the Oireachtas should scrutinise the powers to see if they are working properly.  I welcome the Taoiseach's statement to the effect that, if he considers that these powers are not working properly during the course of the 12 months, he will have no hesitation in bringing in regulations and changes in the legislation to ensure that the judicial process is not hampered.</P>
    <P>Finally, I suggest we should be given sufficient time to tease out the various difficulties and technical details that have to be teased out in relation to a very complicated process, that of extradition. Over the past couple of years we have seen that the process of extradition is not straightforward.  The judicial process has to be extremely well handled.  In our determined effort to fight terrorism, to defeat the terrorist on any side of the Border &mdash; or in the UK, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland &mdash; we cannot neglect to put safeguards into our legislation to ensure that our citizens get fair play in another jurisdiction.  We should not make the process of extradition any more difficult and make it harder to convince our European partners who have <Col N="1995" /> signed the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism that we are as determined as anyone to defeat terrorism and that we are putting the necessary legislation into place in order to bring that about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>The most appropriate word in the Extradition (Amendment) Bill, 1987, is &ldquo;amendment&rdquo; because everybody in the country seems to be talking about extradition and nobody seems to mention the word &ldquo;amendment&rdquo;.  It is most important to stress that this is amending legislation. The Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, came into force on 1 December. This means we are now in a position to ratify that Convention.  The parties to the Convention have pledged themselves to counter the problem of international terrorism by facilitating the extradition of fugitives from justice who claim a spurious political justification for serious crimes of violence.</P>
      <P>In office and out of it Fianna Fáil have always acknowledged the need for international co-operation in the battle against terrorism.  This is why we supported in principle the legislation enabling us to ratify the terrorism Convention when it came before both Houses of the Oireachtas last year.  Our only difficulty with the legislation was that it did not address the safeguards issue to the extent that was necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Extradition (Amendment) Bill, 1987, is to provide for certain safeguards in relation to the procedure under which persons charged with, or convicted of, certain offences in England and Northern Ireland &mdash; and it also takes in Scotland, Wales and the Isle of Man &mdash; may be extradited to those jurisdictions.  Under the Extradition Act, 1965, a warrant can be issued in England, Wales, Scotland or the Isle of Man for the arrest of a person accused or convicted of certain offences who may be found in Ireland.  It has to be endorsed by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána for execution in our State.  He or she would <Col N="1996" /> have been arrested and brought before the District Court which might order that person to be extradited.  It does not apply if the offence in question is a political offence or an offence connected with a political offence.</P>
    <P>The political offence exemption, which also applies under Part II of the 1965 Act, is restricted by the Extradition European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism Act 1987, which provides that certain terrorist offences, which are specified in the Convention and the Act, are not to be treated as political for the purposes of the 1965 Act.</P>
    <P>The Extradition (European Convention on the Supression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, which came into force on 1 December did not introduce extradition for the first time.  Extradition existed since the foundation of the State on the basis of preceeding British law.  The 1965 Act introduced our extradition legislation which laid down special arrangements for extradition between this country, Northern Ireland and Britain.  Since 1965, 733 people have been extradited to Britain and 154 people have been extradited to Northern Ireland.  Until we had discussions on this Extradition (Amendment) Bill most people did not realise that so many people had been extradited.</P>
    <P>It also enables us to ratify the 1957 European Convention on extradition which does not allow a <i>prima facie</i> requirement.  We have been a party to that convention for over 20 years. Britain is only now about to join.  The growth in international terrorism in the seventies, such as hijacking, kidnapping, assassinations and bombings, led European countries to resist the political offence in the 1977 European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism to exclude such crimes from its scope in European countries that are political partners.</P>
    <P>Since 1982 the Supreme Court in its judgment has also restricted the scope of the political offence on much the same lines, thereby removing any constitutional difficulties about the ratification of the 1977 Convention.  In the context of the Anglo-Irish Agreement <Col N="1997" /> and against a background of progress in relation to improved confidence in the Northern Ireland administration and justice, and in the security forces, the previous Government agreed to ratify the 1977 convention and introduced the necessary legislation in December 1986 with a 12 months delay clause.  Fianna Fáil in Opposition supported in the principle of the Bill but sought to introduce safeguards.  We are now introducing those safeguards.</P>
    <P>A succession of events in Ireland like the O'Grady kidnapping, the seizure of the <i>Eksund</i>, the seizure of a cargo of very dangerous weapons by the French and the massacre of some of our people in Enniskillen made it essential for Ireland to ratify the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism and have appropriate safeguards to ensure public confidence in the procedures.  Even without the original 1987 Act coming into force, extradition would continue on the basis of the recent Supreme Court judgments.  As I said, we are introducing this amending Bill and the Government are providing safeguards.</P>
    <P>The first safeguard we are introducing is sufficient evidence.  The Attorney General must be of the opinion that there is a clear intention to prosecute and that this intention is founded on the existence of sufficient evidence.  This guards against extradition for questioning.  The second safeguard is extradition on a specific charge.  As a general principle a person can only be tried for the offence for which he or she is extradited and additional charges may proceed only with the agreement of the Attorney General.  This is known as the rule of specialty.</P>
    <P>The third safeguard is the lapse of time provision.  A person whose extradition is sought will be able to apply to the High Court to have his extradition refused on the grounds that, by reason of the passage of time since he is alleged to have committed the offence, having regard to all circumstances, it would be unjust, oppressive or invidious to extradite him.</P>
    <P>The fourth safeguard we have introduced is that the Attorney General will have a statutory obligation to prepare <Col N="1998" /> and submit to the Government an annual report on the operation of extradition arrangements and the specific cases in the previous 12 months.  The Taoiseach said that, if the arrangements are not upheld both in letter and in spirit, they will be set aside.  If they are not working satisfactorily the Government will bring forward revised proposals.</P>
    <P>We also heard during the debate that the function which the Bill confers on the Attorney General ought more properly be conferred on the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It would, in fact, be quite inappropriate to do this.  The functions of the Director of Public Prosecutions relate to the prosecution of offences within the jurisdiction of Ireland.  He has no function in relation to extradition applications, whereas the Attorney General has.  Responsibility for representation of the State in extradition cases in court rests with the Attorney General.  He has an important role as matters stand in relation to the vetting of warrants and accompanying documents before warrants are endorsed by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the kind of technical difficulties about warrants that have arisen in certain extradition cases.  The Attorney General is directly concerned in a number of administrative measures that are being taken to reduce to the minimum the risk of extradition warrants and associated documents being found by our courts to fail to meet the requirements of Irish law.  I would like to point out the non-statutory arrangements on the sufficiency of evidence which the previous Government were proposing to participate in.  Those arrangements would involve the British Attorney General in providing through diplomatic channels a certificate to our Attorney General.  The arrangement was to be on an Attorney General to Attorney General basis.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General in Britain is the law officer with ultimate responsibility on their side for arrangements in the prosecution service to ensure that every extradition case is scrutinised for sufficiency of evidence.  The appropriate law officer <Col N="1999" /> here to be in communication with the British Attorney General on this method, and to be given a statutory function with regard to it, clearly is the Attorney General and not the Director of Public Prosecutions. The previous Government accepted that this was not so when proposing purely administrative arrangements. Why should the position be different now that the safeguard on sufficiency of evidence is being strengthened by giving our Attorney General a strengthening role and putting it on a statutory basis?</P>
    <P>The British Government and especially the British Premier, Mrs. Thatcher, say we should extradite our citizens without any safeguards.  She has some cheek to interfere in internal matters in this country and dictate to us how we should legislate for our people.  It is interesting to note that England is the only country in Europe that requires a <i>prima facie</i> case to be made out in court before granting extradition from Britain.  It is also interesting to note that Britain is not yet part of the extradition Convention of 1957 and, of course, has never imposed this requirement in relation to extradition in Ireland.  Britain has no hesitation in extraditing anyone from Britain to Ireland without a <i>prima facie</i> requirement.</P>
    <P>The British have found that the imposition of a <i>prima facie</i> requirement on other European countries is a substantial, technical barrier to extradition and some of those countries have found it virtually impossible to get anyone extradited from England.  England are now trying to do away with the <i>prima facie</i> requirement.</P>
    <P>It would not be acceptable if we were to impose a requirement in our extradition law which had the effect of causing considerable expense and delay in extradition proceedings and would result in the failure of legitimate requests.  The suggestion being made by those who advocate a <i>prima facie</i> requirement seems to be that an extradition hearing in the District Court should be the equivalent of a preliminary examination in the case of an offence under our law and <Col N="2000" /> the wanted person should not be sent back unless it is shown that there is enough evidence to warrant his return for trial if the offence has been committed here.</P>
    <P>This would mean that the prosecuting authorities in a foreign jurisdiction would have to prepare at short notice a book of evidence which would comply with our laws of evidence.  It would also mean, if the same level of protection were to be afforded as in internal cases, that witnesses from the foreign jurisdiction would have to be available to be examined on their sworn depositions, should they be called upon to do so.  Can anybody seriously doubt that they would be called on to do so in extradition cases?  I am not satisfied that it would be possible generally for the authorities concerned to meet those requirements.  We would face an unacceptable situation in this event and fugitives from justice would be able to treat this jurisdiction as a safe haven.</P>
    <P>We have had extradition in this country for many years.  In this Bill we have built in safeguards which we hope will satisfy most people and will also protect our people from unfair extradition.  I welcome this amending Bill and, as I stated, &ldquo;amendment&rdquo; is a very appropriate word because it is amending legislation.  I congratulate the Minister on the drafting of this Bill.  It was a very difficult one for him to cope with.  I congratulate him on the tremendous effort he has made to bring it before both Houses of the Oireachtas to the satisfaction of most people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House with this Bill.  He was, as he said, mercifully brief and precise.  After a difficult week in the other House, of course, like everybody else in the country he is probably punch drunk from the word &ldquo;extradition&rdquo; and how it should operate in our jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is appropriate to put in context why this subject was raised in this country at this time.  It arose from the responsibility of the Government to put into operation the Extradition Act, 1987, called the Extradition (European Convention on <Col N="2001" /> the Suppression of Terrorism) Act which had a time limit put on it by the previous Government because we were dissatisfied with the level of safeguards that applied, particularly between the British Government and our Government, in regard to Irish citizens.  The previous Government put a stay of 12 months on the Act for that very good and cogent reason.</P>
    <P>There has been a debate between the Government and the British Government in the intervening period about whether anything has happened in this area which would satisfy us that improvements have taken place in the British justice system or in the procedures being followed in cases currently before the British Courts.  In the wake of all the happenings in the past few months a problem was created for members of the Government party in allowing the Extradition Act, 1987, to come into force.  I accept, as a politician, that these things happen.  The Government have been subjected at their parliamentary party meetings to tremendous pressure from backbenchers who are reflecting views from their constituencies, Comhairle Ceantair, Dáil Ceantair and every other structure within the Fianna Fáil Party that somehow Fianna Fáil should have nothing to do with the whole concept of extradition.</P>
    <P>I am glad Senator McEllistrim has put it on the record that we have had extradition in this country since 1965 because, listening to members of his party on the media over recent weeks, you would believe there was no such thing as extradition until the previous Government signed the Convention putting the Act into place.  We brought in that Bill in the context of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  It was appropriate that we should reassure our people in Britain that we wanted to have no hand, act or part in condoning terrorism or in offering a safe harbour for terrorists.  That was the reason we built it into the Anglo-Irish Agreement that we would play our part in signing the European Convention dealing with terrorism at European level.  Every day of <Col N="2002" /> the week we are conscious of the amount of European terrorism that goes on.</P>
    <P>The 1965 Act introduced by a previous Fianna Fáil Government is what we are amending today.  I suppose it is fair to say that in 1965, when the Bill was first introduced in its original form, the need for the new provisions in this Bill probably were not obvious to the then Government, to the present Taoiseach or, indeed, to Deputy Blaney who was a member of the Cabinet at the time and who this week is one of the strongest advocates of having nothing to do with extradition.</P>
    <P>The Minister will find that the Labour Party in this House, as we did in the other House, will deal with the Bill before us as constructively as possible.  We do not want to be difficult about it, but we feel the Bill is, to say the least of it, not a very good Bill.  It is difficult, it is highly complex, it is difficult to amend effectively. We made every effort in the other House and we will make similar efforts here to amend it as we feel it should be amended.</P>
    <P>Now that the Taoiseach has gone to the Heads of State meeting in Copenhagen, I am glad the Bill has been passed in the other House and he can assure the British Prime Minister that the first House of the Oireachtas has passed it.  It is important for our Taoiseach to be able to do that.  That does not remove from us our constitutional right to try to improve the Bill because our only concern, as Labour Party members in either House, is to ensure that whatever safeguards are built into the Bill will be operative and will not stand in the way of legitimate requests for the extradition of terrorists and that Irish citizens will be protected and assured of the best possible hearing of their case in the State that requests their extradition.  It was unfortunate that all the affairs like the O'Grady kidnap, the <i>Eksund</i> affair and the question of the Diplock courts over the past number of months have somehow lent an air of urgency to this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Birmingham Six was one of the reasons given as to why we should be <Col N="2003" /> slow about extraditing anybody.  The real truth is that the Birmingham Six issue had nothing to do with extradition, because they committed the offence in the jurisdiction in which they were arrested.  However, it does bring into focus some of the difficulties Irish people have in Britain when they are arrested in emotive circumstances.  Their case is at present being discussed in a review court in Britain and it would be inappropriate to pontificate on their innocence or guilt at this stage before the court has found one way or the other.  We, who are, listening and looking in from outside have no doubt that because of the circumstances surrounding the tragedy in Birmingham, Irish citizens were arrested on evidence which is regarded now as flimsy to say the least, and because they were Irish somehow their chances of being found innocent were much more difficult than if they were British, Welsh or Scottish nationalists or from any other part of the British empire.</P>
    <P>For that reason people like Senator Mooney and others put resolutions down in this House earlier in the year requesting the Government not to implement the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.  Thankfully they withdrew them.  Otherwise it would have left the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Justice and, in particular, the Taoiseach in an untenable position of having the majority of Members of one House of the Oireachtas calling on him not to do a particular thing when he was still in the process of trying to bring in the safeguards and improvements in the British judicial system we had asked for 12 months ago.  That was the reason we put a time limit on the original Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) (Amendment) Act.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party expressed an opinion in the Dáil and I want to express it here again.  We feel the Attorney General's Office is not the appropriate office for the examination of evidence or giving of opinion as to whether a person should go forward for extradition.  We expressed <Col N="2004" /> that view, not because we had any doubts on this or past holders of the high Office of Attorney General but we felt it was an inappropriate function for that office holder.</P>
    <P>The Minister has listened to a long week of debate on this issue.  I do not want to bore him, but we feel that an examination of evidence or of grounds for extradition should at the very least be carried out in some type of court, some type of judicial process.  With the involvement of the Attorney General, the Government are just now making it an administrative process.  As the Minister for Education says, &ldquo;so be it&rdquo;.  It is a point of view.</P>
    <P>I see no advantage whatsoever in changing it from the Attorney General to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I know my colleagues in the main Opposition party on this side of the House have shown a preference for that particular office.  I can understand that on the basis of excluding the DPP's Office from interference, representation, intervention or expression of any opinion by anybody in the State.  When a previous Government were involved in setting up that office they were at pains to ensure that it would be autonomous and over and above all of us, and appropriately so.</P>
    <P>That is possibly the reason Fine Gael wanted that office holder to be involved in the area of extradition.  We had reservations. First of all, the Attorney General, whether we like it or not, is appointed on a political basis.  I am not suggesting for a moment that once his appointment takes place he does not make decisions outside the political sphere.  I have no doubt he does and so advises the Government, which is his constitutional role.</P>
    <P>The amendment accepted in the Dáil has removed some of the doubts I might have had.  It is appropriate that the legislation should now reflect the fact that for this particular purpose the Attorney General is excluded from even receiving communications or representations from anybody.  I welcome that.  I am pleased the new section removes any suspicion or question mark that might have arisen. We must not forget that judges are also <Col N="2005" /> political appointees from time to time, but it is accepted that once their appointment takes place they are then removed from the political arena and their decisions are based on law.  To say that somebody is politically appointed does not mean there is anything wrong with him.  God knows, we are all politically appointed somehow or another&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have seen dictatorships in Africa and other places, where they decide on who everybody is and then put so many medals on their own chest it is impossible to see the chest eventually, but that is the operation of that system. Our system is as good as you will find in a democratic society.  We are subject in everything we do to the wisdom of the people's votes in the final analysis.  I am a great believer in that process.  I have no problem about judges, justices, the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, the Attorney General or any such person holding that high office being appointed by the Government of the day.  I think that is appropriate.  The amendment accepted in the other House will remove such doubts in the minds of people, I think politicians have a job to convince people that somehow or another people involved at that level must make a decision based on the best evidence available to them.  I am concerned about <Col N="2006" /> another amendment accepted by the Dáil in which a lot of play was made by the Government and the main Opposition party.  I refer to the new section which will allow this Bill, as amended and if it passes by this House and is signed by the President, to die in 12 months unless &mdash; and this is very important &mdash; both Houses of the Oireachtas bring in a motion asking that it be continued.  I am totally in favour of a review of the Bill, and that is an important section in it.  A review on an annual basis and indeed a report from the Attorney General is important, but to have the Bill &ldquo;wither away&rdquo; in the words of Deputy Blaney unless something else happens is quite a dangerous situation.  If we are to analyse it on a purely political basis this is the biggest and best three card trick we have ever seen.  It was difficult to implement the 1986 Bill on 1 December because neither this nor the previous Government were entirely satisfied with the changes that had taken place in the British judicial system.  In addition we had problems with our partners in Europe and this Government had to convince everybody they were not soft on terrorists, and because of that deadline some scheme had to be thought up which would satisfy all the cumainn in the country who had a problem with extradition. One of the ways of doing that was to amend the 1965 Act, an Act the Government had brought in themselves, and now they are putting in the final clause that the Act will not continue after 12 months unless the Houses of the Oireachtas so decide.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is another safeguard but it is a very fundamental one.  We are either in favour of extraditing terrorists or we are not.  The 1987 Act will do that in the European context.  If we are to have an extradition arrangement with the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the Isle of Wight, I am of the opinion that because of our experience, it is imperative that some safeguards apply.  I would have preferred to <Col N="2007" /> see the Bill amended with the safeguards which we all supported.  Every Member of this and the other House would welcome all the safeguards.  We might argue about the technicalities involved in carrying out of the functions, but we welcome safeguards.  However, we want to be absolutely honest also with people; we do not want the Bill to die in 12 months unless we accept that it is inoperable. That is the Labour Party arguement, that this Bill is inoperable and that it will put an undue and unfair demand on the office of the Attorney General, who will be forced, if he is so summoned, to go into court to prove why he gave an opinion. The Attorney General is busy enough as it is but he could finish up being requested to attend court quite frequently if the need arises.  I would have preferred to see the Bill continuing in force &mdash; if it is as good as everybody says it is &mdash; and giving safeguards to our people being extradited, particularly to the British jurisdiction and only being stopped by a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The opposite will take place &mdash; the Bill will die unless both Houses agree.  I hope the Minister is listening.</P>

      <P>The amendment was reported differently in the other House. The Minister then put the wrong amendment. In order that the Minister's wish be expressed on the record of the House, <Col N="2008" /> he should have put a different amendment in the other House.  The Minister knows from the pressure that has been on himself and the Taoiseach by his own party members over the past two months that pressure will inevitably be reactivated and intensified coming up to the next 12 months point.  Who knows what kind of Government we will have in 12 months time?  It might be this Government again sustained and maintained to the best of the ability of others, but it will be a Government without a majority. In 12 months the Government will be subjected to the intense pressure that occurs in the parliamentary party process. I am aware of it; I use it all the time. There is nothing wrong with it but it is a dilemma for a Government that have to govern all the country, and not just the Fianna Fáil Party.  The Government must run the country and the judicial system and must do so to satisfy all the people, not just their own supporters.  That is the dilemma, because if the Government have not a majority they must listen to the views of other people.  That might be a good thing.  May be the other House has proved that point.  The Government found themselves willing to accept suggestions because otherwise it would have created difficulties in voting procedures. The Taoiseach after all had confirmed that if the Bill had not gone through, we would have had a general election.  I do not think any of us would like an election before Christmas.  The reality is that it is extremely difficult to legislate when the Government is in a minority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator had an opportunity to make his speech and he made a good case, a good Fianna Fáil case, but a case that they would not have made two months ago.  Times and circumstances have changed and I have to deal with the circumstances as they have changed and presented me with an <Col N="2009" /> amended Bill which is totally different from the Bill debated by Fianna Fáil a month ago.  They are two different Bills. This Bill deals with our relationship with Britain.  We are anxious if we have an extradition arrangement with Britain, that every possible safeguard is built into it in the interests of our citizens.  Nobody condones violence, but we have to presume that everybody is innocent until proven guilty.  We want to ensure, having regard to our past experiences with the other jurisdiction, that the Irish who are extradited get a fair crack of the whip judicially and there will not be an emotive atmosphere surrounding the hearing of their cases.  In fairness, if somebody did not plant the bombs in Birmingham, which led to the arrest of these people who are now being tried &mdash; nobody would have been arrested.  Let us be honest with one another.  There should not have been a Birmingham bombing, an Enniskillen atrocity or Bloody Sunday: because these atrocities on both sides have taken 2,500 lives in the past 15 to 20 years, and we have not moved one iota nearer to the unification of the country.  Whether we are Fianna Fáil Republicans, Labour Party Republicans or any kind of Republicans, we have not moved one step forward as a result of the violence that has led to 2,500 lives being lost.  The only movement we have ever made is through the Anglo-Irish Agreement, which at least gives some hope that if a majority of the people of Northern Ireland are in agreement there will be unification of the country.  At least that is an aspiration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the first time the British Government have given an assurance that if there is a majority in favour of unification then Britain will agree to it.  At least that is a concession.  We accept the country is divided at present.  By bringing in an Extradition Bill in 1965 we accepted that there was another jurisdiction in the North of Ireland.  It is extraordinary when I hear Republicans talking about the reunification of the country and saying that there is no such thing as the <i>de jure</i> or <i>de facto</i> situation of the North of Ireland. That fact that we passed an Extradition Bill at all is conclusive evidence that we <Col N="2010" /> have accepted that there is another jurisdiction in Northern Ireland whether we like it or not.  The vast majority do not like it and we want to see an end to it peacefully and democratically.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement is a solemn agreement between two governments that if at some stage there is a majority in Northern Ireland favour unification, Britain would allow the North to be reunited with the South.  That is something we had never managed to achieve in the previous 60 years.  I am proud that our party took some part in that and that our party Leader, Deputy Dick Spring, participated fully in that process. I am also pleased that the present Government have continued their efforts to make the Anglo-Irish Agreement work.  It has been and even more difficult this year, not because the Minister is in power, but because circumstances have been very difficult.  The Minister has worked as hard as he could on it.  While he has often been accused of not trying, we know that is not the case, and he has continued and we want him to continue with the agreement.  When the three-year period has expired and the review that is promised in the Agreement takes place, we hope the Government will continue to show the same enthusiasm they have shown recently for it, and will renew the Anglo-Irish Agreement and not to be browbeaten by Unionists and others who feel their position is undermined.</P>
    <P>The Unionists should be assured that none of us in the South want to over-run, oust them or get rid of them.  We can understand the Unionists' reservations when people purporting to be Irish, or to represent us commit atrocities and take life ruthlessly in what they call the cause of Irish re-unification.  Nothing could be further from the truth, because these people, although they might be Irish, do not represent anything that good Irish people stand for.  We all want the re-unification of the country but we would like to see it come about in a peaceful and correct way.  However, that aspiration should not prevent us, in the area of extradition, from ensuring that our citizens are protected in every way possible. <Col N="2011" /> Neither must it prevent us from suggesting in various officers of the courts of the judicial system as being the appropriate officers to deal with extradition. That is our only reservation on this legislation. Because this Bill does not address that problem &mdash; we will see the difficulties that will arise within the next 12 months following these changes &mdash; there will be difficulties because the men of violence seem to have available to them the best legal brains, people who think of every possible reason for postponing the day of reckoning for their clients.  They are subsidised by the State in the interests of common justice.  We pay barristers and lawyers to look after these people because it is appropriate that they would have justice meted out to them, that they would be considered innocent unless proven guilty.  Let us not cod ourselves into thinking that in the period between now and the review date, every possible legal angle will not be used by lawyers representing people who, in the words of the Taoiseach might be or should be extradited and somehow may not be extradited.  Then we will all be guilty of having done something wrong in this House by agreeing to a Bill that does not meet the concerns and demands being made by us as legitimate parliamentarians trying to improve legislation that comes before us.  Perhaps the 12 months stay of execution on the Bill may be too short because this will be one of the most difficult periods.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that the Minister referred to the various background problems. He mentioned too, the O'Grady kidnapping.  It is appropriate to commend the Garda Síochána for their dedication in that most difficult situation.  The only relevance it has to the question of extradition is that if the well known and, in other places, sung hero, Mr. O'Hare, otherwise known as the 'Border Fox' &mdash; I should not name him because he is not here to defend himself &mdash; was arrested in the North of Ireland we would be looking for his extradition.  It would be embarrassing if we did not have some arrangement where by we could have him <Col N="2012" /> returned here to face trial for some of the atrocities he has professed to have carried out.  After he has recovered in St. Vincent's hospital we will know whether he carried them out.  I am not sure whether he has a medical card or whether he is subject to the £10 a day hospital charge. In any case we should not show any sympathy for the man but we should ensure that he gets a fair trial.  I am glad he was arrested here where he committed the offences because it might have been difficult to extradite him.  Britain might be very frank and open with us but they have been talking about <i>prima facie.</i>  I am not sure whether they want <i>prima facie</i> to apply between ourselves and other people.  The reason the <i>prima facie</i> clause was not put into the other Bill was that we would be in contravention of the European Act by so doing.  There was nothing wrong with having a <i>prima facie</i> clause or a similar system of judicial inspection in this legislation because it only affects ourselves and Great Britain which comprises England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the islands off the coast of Britain.  I am not sure if the Isle of Man is included because there is no explanatory memorandum with the Bill but I presume that all the islands off the coast of Britain with the exception of the Republic of Ireland are included in her jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage, I hope the Minister will listen to the arguments we will be making.  The only reason we will be opposing the Bill is because we feel it is not a good Bill.  The Bill has been cobbled together to meet all sorts of problems in various areas.  Let us hope that it does not wither away as has been predicted.  If the Bill is operable I hope the Houses of the Oireachtas will have the courage to continue it.  The reporting procedure will indicate how it is working.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, you will probably recollect that shortly after I was honoured by my appointment to Seanad Éireann the subject of extradition was debated here, that was in 1982.  I do not think it would be stretching a statement too far to say that the climate in which it <Col N="2013" /> was debated was somewhat different from that prevailing now when we are debating the safeguards in respect of extradition.</P>
      <P>It ill-behoves any English person or anyone from Northern Ireland to debate this issue without showing some indication of the difficulties extradition has posed for the people of Ireland, put in the context of the very bitter legacy of Anglo-Irish history and sectarian bitterness in the country.  At that time in 1982 &mdash; I have modified this somewhat since &mdash; the gist of what I said was that when struggling with this emotive issue the people of Ireland will be aware of a conflict between conscience dictating obligation towards their offended fellow Irishmen and consciousness as Irish men and Irish women before the legacy of our history.</P>
      <P>Extradition is much more than a simple legal problem.  It has emotional and moral dimensions.  In the final analysis it is a political problem and I still hold to that.  Some of the reservations that have been expressed by people who may consider themselves close to the group in Ireland who feel marginalised as time has advanced &mdash; we could call them I suppose, for want of a euphemism, purist Republicans &mdash; feel that there is an emotional problem attached to extraditing people into a British jurisdiction. We cannot ignore that.  We have to face up to it.  It has been faced up to quite courageously in recent weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Just as extradition for violent acts claiming political motivation has been perceived in the South as legitimising British control of the North &mdash; at least that was the case until the new Anglo-Irish understanding was promoted and that has been considerably qualified in recent years &mdash; failure to extradite is perceived in the North by the Loyalist community who feel so vulnerable in the face of evidence of covert connivance by people South of the Border to the murder, killing and mayhem that has gone on.  We all know and the Chief Constable is on record as saying that the numbers involved who are extraditable are not as significant as one is sometimes led to <Col N="2014" /> believe in the more emotive outbursts of certain politicians.</P>
    <P>The fact that no war has been declared between Britain and Ireland has always made it difficult for me to understand how the South could seek to woo the people of the North in some instances and in others not be prepared to take every possible step to prevent its neighbours being killed or murdered.  The answer is that we are dealing with the residue of the undeclared war which was not really addressed until, first, the New Ireland Forum came to grips with it and, secondly the development from that the new Anglo-Irish understanding as I call it, the undeclared war which is contained in the last element of this age old Anglo-Irish conflict.</P>
    <P>It has been convenient up to recently for the Establishments, both in London and Dublin, to ignore the failure of 1920 and 1921 to cope with that conflict by localising it into the six northern countries of the island.  The real challenge before us is outside the scope of this debate and I can only briefly allude to it.  It is not extradition, but settlement.  As Senator Ferris said so cogently, while we work at a settlement in terms of a few years to deal with something that has gone on for centuries, we must also be aware of the particular problems of people in their day-to-day lives and also take into account the complete revulsion which over 90 per cent &mdash; probably it is nearer to 99 per cent &mdash; of the people of Ireland feel at any endeavour to promote political movement by violent activities.  In pointing this out it is important to emphasise that my argument for extradition is mounted from the stance of a person from the Northern Protestant community who is committed unreservedly, with the other members of our New Ireland group, to the building of a new Ireland in which issues such as extradition within Ireland would be relegated to the history books.</P>
    <P>At the conclusion of the argument I tried to put forward in 1982, I stated that Southern public opinion would need to be satisfied that in the post-Bennett era &mdash; remember that Bennett exposed the <Col N="2015" /> excesses of the Castlereagh holding centre &mdash; legislation should be adequately scrutinised and law and order enforcement adequately monitored to satisfy the people of the Republic that justice is being pursued, in as far as it ever can be in a society with a double loyalty, double minority problem and no consensus.  At that stage while we were hoping &mdash; it no longer seems to have the same relevance &mdash; for an all-Ireland court, as I said at that time it is an all-Ireland settlement that is needed.  In the meantime, in order to show significantly that the people as a whole are against death and for life, extradition would be a symbolic gesture and could well be instrumental in reducing the lethal affects of the present violent campaign.</P>
    <P>I do not think I would depart very much from those words.  At that time there is no doubt that there was considerable generosity shown to me by way of response, although I detected the great difficulties that there were.  Because of my interest in Irish history, which has gone on for nearly two decades now, I was well able to understand why there should be difficulties and why there should be tensions and why the word &ldquo;extradition&rdquo; is so emotive.</P>
    <P>Concern about extradition is related to how one perceives the imperialism of Britain in its historic context on the one hand and on the other hand, how one perceives justice in the other part of this island with all the difficulties &mdash; and never let us forget &mdash; of justice in a divided society, a society which I have referred to elsewhere as the un-united part of the so-called United Kingdom.  Therefore, to show that I place it in that context I must now make some observation about the system of Diplock Courts and the system of repressive legislation in the context of extradition and of the problem of justice in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with only one piece of the jigsaw puzzle but there are many pieces to it.  Diplock Courts, paramilitary murder and intimidation, amnesty, ceasefire, oppressive emergency legislation, unsolved killings performed by <Col N="2016" /> those in uniform, fair employment and more employment, constitutional change in the Irish Republic, the Anglo-Irish process, the right to self-determination based on consensus, the need &mdash; and I would stress this &mdash; for repentance and forgiveness, the difficulties and dangers and the reasons for extradition are all just pieces of the complex political jigsaw puzzle that is part of our bitter legacy.  It is because the political solution as yet remains elusive that it is vital that the new Anglo-Irish understanding &mdash; let us not get too hooked up on the word &ldquo;agreement&rdquo;; let us see that there has been a process leading to an understanding &mdash; should not be allowed to falter.  Otherwise, the peace, justice and reconciliation referred to in the agreement will remain a figment of the imagination. We are on a long, slow process but at long last the pendulum is swung from the negative towards the positive.</P>
    <P>In relation to the painful challenges which continue to confront us, there is now a moral obligation on those with power &mdash; as I said a month ago &mdash; to move first and give most.  In this respect the British Government should have been magnanimous because it is the British Government who have the power to indicate that they are prepared to entertain the sort of changes that are required to move in the area of liberalising justice in Northern Ireland.  The onus is on me to show that that is not dangerous but that it is possible.  In fact, it is the other pan in the scale of new legislation here to try and deal with the problem of violence, killing and mutilation on the one hand, and also the question of fair play and the perception of it which is so important, particularly in a society where there is so little consensus.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough &mdash; as I pointed out in a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i>&mdash; for the British Government to justify their stubborness by leaning on the words of an ex-Lord Chancellor who in stating that politicians are barging into matters which they do not understand seems to be making the dangerous proposition that politicians should stay clear of the whole court issue in the North.  Scholar that he <Col N="2017" /> is, Lord Hailsham will doubtless recall that the Greeks had an interesting concept: the opposite of the word &ldquo;<i>politikos</i>&rdquo; was the word &ldquo;<i>ideos</i>&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, suggest that all law comes from political thought and that in essence there is no law which has not had some political basis.  He is undoubtedly aware of the difficulties, as we should be which confront a society such as Northern Ireland, containing a significant minority and so little consensus.  In such circumstances the call for law and order too often begs the question, &ldquo;whose laws and whose orders&rdquo;?  The answer may well be &ldquo;theirs, not ours&rdquo;.  It is in this context that the single judge non-jury Diplock Courts are unacceptable to a significant section of our community.  By no means are all of these members of the minority community in the North.  I cross checked that before I made that statement.</P>
    <P>As we grope our way towards the building of consensus, underpinned by new Anglo-Irish understanding, a single judge justice grafted onto emergency legislation without juries is increasingly difficult to tolerate.  There must be change in that aspect of our affairs and that change must inevitably come from Britain.  Far from weakening the Anglo-Irish understanding, which people have alluded to during the course of the past two weeks, I suggest that the painful process which republican consciousness has been engaging in over the past two or three weeks and which it has struggled with &mdash; as I see it &mdash; to a successful conclusion &mdash; now that that conclusion seems to be forthcoming &mdash; will have strengthened that understanding.  The petulant response of the English Prime Minister is indicative of how far she has to go to understand what is taking place here in relation to the historical legacy of violence, mistrust and errors on all sides.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement acknowledged two things.  The first is that England and the Republic have had a conflict of claim with regard to Northern Ireland. For the first time since the foundation of this State, England and the Republic faced up jointly to the fact that they also have a suppressed conflict, that is, how <Col N="2018" /> they relate to Northern Ireland.  Secondly the agreement tried to come to grips with the fact that there is a conflict of loyalty in Northern Ireland.  I emphasised before in this House &mdash; and I know from the tolerance I have received that you will not misunderstand me &mdash; that you cannot remove from a person what that person feels he or she is.  I feel I am an Irishman. I often say I am an Ulsterman in Ireland and an Irishman as far as the rest of the world is concerned.  Please do not ask me to defend whether I am a six county, a nine county, a four county or a two county Ulsterman, but I am an Ulsterman in Ireland and I am an Irishman.  I have no problem with that.  But for people who feel they are British, there is no legislation in the world that can remove from a man what he feels he is. At long last we have faced up to the fact that there are many different types of Irishmen in Ireland.  Through the process of the New Ireland Forum, Irish people were asked to look as themselves. Through the Anglo-Irish process, London and Dublin have been asked to see our problem in a different context.</P>
    <P>There are two sides in a conflict.  The catharsis which we all seek, which can lead to a new start, involves give as well as take on both sides.  In relation to how the Republic is perceived by the people of Northern Ireland, this is the first major painful step forward, or painful demand that has been made of republican consciousness in the Republic since the signing of that agreement.  For the past 20 years people on both sides in Northern Ireland have had to make the most painful adjustments, always under the microscope of world opinion and, more locally, of Irish Nationalist opinion.  Every move is watched, every court case is documented, every action is scrutinised and there has been movement.  In spite of the ghettoisation there is understanding of the other person's point of view even if we have not yet managed to move across and have an exchange which is fruitful.</P>
    <P>Up to this point it seemed to many of us that the people of the Irish Republic were not actually being asked to do very <Col N="2019" /> much apart from concede what is in Article 1 of the agreement and I know that caused difficulty.  In the day to day events of the ordinary citizen there was not much being asked of them.  Suddenly the deep, rigid feelings of inherited concepts are being challenged.  I congratulate the people on being able to face up to all the issues in the way in which they have done so to make this considerable step forward. I, for one, want it on the record that I acknowledge it is a significant step forward.  Many of the Loyalist community, out of which I have come, would not see it that way.  They would see it as something which should have come years ago.  The fact is that you cannot have a deep understanding of Anglo-Irish history and the secretarian history of Ireland without appreciating what has taken place over these past few weeks.</P>
    <P>Therefore, as an Irishman, and as an Ulsterman in Ireland, I must outline for Mrs. Thatcher's benefit how English perception in relation formerly to the grand design of imperial expansion in the world and latterly to the exercise of their position of <i>primus inter pares</i> at home, has affected, and at times soured, what should otherwise have been a constructive relationship between the people living in this island and those living across the water.  The mainland, let me emphasise, is where we stand.  This is not to suggest that we do not have our difficulties in relation to Anglo-Irish dealings or that these have not been discernible.  However, it also behoves me as an Irishman to ask the people here whether, having made this start, they are now prepared to put their State under the same sort of scrutiny as they have demanded of the people of Northern Ireland using the telescope into the past and the microscope in the present.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I was pleased to hear the Taoiseach suggest &mdash; I cannot quote the exact words &mdash; that he would consider setting up some commission or some committee.  He said that in each jurisdiction without reflection on either system, we might do well to initiate a formal study of the special arrangements <Col N="2020" /> for handling terrorist cases in both jurisdictions to serve as a basis for further discussion between both Governments. That is a start, but it is only a start and I will come back to that subsequently.  It needs to be expanded much more widely and it needs to go much deeper here.</P>
    <P>You have had your repressive legislation too.  The Offences Against the State Act has never been debated in depth since 1939 as far as I am aware.  I suggest that what it contains &mdash; I am sure Senator Robinson will correct me if I am wrong when she makes her contribution &mdash; is as bad in tone as the notorious Special Powers Act which is no longer on the Statute Book in Northern Ireland. Has there been any judicial review at any time, in depth and publicised, of the emergency powers as a whole since the foundation of the State?  In other words, have you had your Gardiner Report, Diplock Report, Baker Report and Bennett Report?</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting for a moment that the situation is similar because in one basic manner it is quite different.  There is consensus down here.  There is, therefore, a mandate and a legitimacy for the laws and the orders.  I detect as I read, from day to day, that things are a little less certain in that respect than they once were, that there is an increasing marginalisation of sections of the community and that there is an increasing feel of less than complete satisfaction with the state of affairs.  I beg of you, before the thing bursts, be well ahead of it; start well ahead of time to look at these things &mdash; the whole area of civil liberties and justice &mdash; because today people are aware; television has made them aware; education has made them aware.  People know their rights under the terms of the European Convention and United Nations Charter. I do not think it is sufficient to have a Statute such as the Offences Against the State Act which has been amended &mdash; or at least reviewed once in the seventies &mdash; on the Statute Book since 1939 without having had a really thorough ongoing debate on it.</P>
    <P>Have the special criminal courts ever been discussed in depth in the Dáil?  As <Col N="2021" /> a signatory to the MacBride Principles which you can imagine is not the easiest of situations in which to find oneself in &mdash; in the position I happen to hold &mdash; I hope I will not be seen as soft on unfair, discriminatory practices.  I, therefore, feel entitled to ask where is the machinery in the South to look at the possibility of discrimination?  I discussed this matter yesterday with a Senator, for whom I have very warm affection, and he assured me that such a thing did not exist.  I remember Unionists saying that.  Now that this new opportunity is beginning to arise, we need to look at ourselves and then at the island as a whole to share that experience.  The Taoiseach made that point.  If we want to share the experience, one part with another, we must begin to learn from each other and go forward.</P>
    <P>There is no death penalty in the North but there is one here.  After all, if you consider what has been going on there for so long, is it not to the credit of Britain that the death penalty &mdash; which I would be utterly opposed to because I find it quite abhorrent &mdash; is no longer on the Statute Book although I know that there have been from time to time atavistic noises made in that direction.  I hope it will eventually be removed from the Statute Book here.  Basically what I am saying is this; I am glad that because of what is being done here this week nobody can say any longer that there is smugness about the situation.  I think it is very important that we remember what is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander.</P>
    <P>There is a point of distinction I would like to make before I go on further which I do not think has been alluded to in the debates at all.  Through the Anglo-Irish Agreement, through the process that has led to that agreement, through what is coming out of that agreement and the understanding we hope will evolve as a result of it, you have the possibility now of influencing what takes place in Northern Ireland, more or less directly.  You have no direct input into what takes place in Britain.  I, therefore, feel that there is a distinction to be made in terms of where you are extraditing people, whether it is <Col N="2022" /> the North of Ireland or Britain.  Let us accept that Northern Ireland with all of its problems has not got a legal process which can cope or reflect any consensus: there is no mandate.  At least we should acknowledge that it is Irishmen you are dealing with and that through the Anglo-Irish Agreement you have what Unionists see as a monstrous intrusion into their affairs which others see as a perfectly legitimate right.</P>
    <P>The agreement is there on the Statute Book.  Therefore, one has to see the processing of laws in this island as a need to build up trust between people, to develop trust and out of trust the hope that there will be some new constructive activity.  I, therefore, would be much more concerned, particularly after what I read when the barrister and solicitor came from the trial of the Birmingham Six to talk in Dublin this week about what might happen to Irish citizens in Britain.  Every English schoolboy has a Paddy joke up his sleeve which I find racist to say the least.  The attitude to the Irish people is, unfortunately, a residuum of a time in which in the <i>Punch</i> cartoons of the last century they were portrayed as grotesque caricatures of themselves.  That is still there.  The whole prospective of what an Irishman stands for and his expectations is something which I find quite unacceptable in the general terms in which it is used in England.  I, therefore, believe that Irish people, North and South, are vulnerable at times of high emotion in England.  Regardless of what the court may find, and regardless of guilt or otherwise, some of the actions to which those men were subjected were quite indefensible.</P>
    <P>The point I am making then is this: please remember you have the possibility of monitoring the situation in Northern Ireland in a way in which you cannot do in England.  We have an obligation to build up trust.  We have all as a result of recent events seen that we have an obligation to ensure that we try and take out of society elements who, for whatever reason, are trying to violate and make matters worse rather than better.  We cannot get away from the fact that there <Col N="2023" /> must be safeguards.  The number of safeguards has been referred to; the <i>prima facie</i> case to be made in the courts, the warrant to be produced to the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Attorney General, the Garda Commissioner.</P>
    <P>I thought it was very useful when the suggestion was made by the Progressive Democrats in their amendment in the Dáil which &mdash; I think I am right in saying &mdash; was a means of producing <i>prima facie</i> evidence without having to go through machinery which might make the extradition of a guilty party very difficult.  I think it was the presentation of affidavits that was involved.  What interested me in talking to a member of the Progressive Democrats last night is that apparently there is already an arrangement of that nature between Ireland and the United States and between England and the United States.  The United States insist on that.  Yet reciprocation does not apply. If the United States insist on what is contained in the amendment of the Progresive Democrats, why have we not applied the same criteria in the opposite direction?  If we could do that, why can we not apply it between us?</P>
    <P>While there are dangers in what has been chosen undoubtedly one perception is that the Attorney General will make extradition easier because the political climate is such that it is easy to extradite; another perception is that it will make extradition more difficult for the same political reasons.  The time has come to put trust on the line.  I do think that as this Bill is passed and as this trust that we are trying to achieve if we play our role in it develops, we should put the onus on England because there is a terrible hypocrisy in the whole business of imperial integrity. The ruling class in Britain have always wanted to appear honest before the world.  I suppose most people wish to do so, but whatever they have done they have always tried to make out that it was done for honest and good and sound reasons.  What I feel then is that we should be saying: &ldquo;Look, in spite of this huge legacy of history we have gone <Col N="2024" /> through this process, in spite of the reservations that many of the purest republicans in Ireland have about it, in spite of the difficulties the ordinary TDs and Senators have at constituency level, we have brought this through and we do it in trust that you, in your turn, will look much more seriously at the irregular legislation and law in Northern Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am thinking in particular now of the application of the Emergency Provisions (Prevention of Terrorism) Act and the courts situation.  Before we do that let us please remind Mrs. Thatcher, and I feel that I am the person to do it, that we are facing our dilemma as squarely as possible and that she is not helping that dilemma by implying that the Irish people are soft on terrorists because they put safeguards into their Extradition Bill.  I therefore have to remind her, right at the word &ldquo;go&rdquo;, because the Attorney General's name has been used in the English debate, that in this century, a man, 15 months before he was brought into the British Cabinet and made Attorney General, was responsible for the illegal importation of 25,000 rifles and 3 million rounds of ammunition.  If that is not enough, let us give her history lesson No. 2.  One of her illustrious predecessors, a man called Lloyd George, put the gun to the head of the representatives of the Provisional Government of Ireland and told them that if they did not accept what was on offer, it would be war and all out war within three days.  You do not require what everyone refers to as the very long memory.  There are people living and walking around today who remember both of those events.</P>
    <P>Let us go further and give her a brief refresher.  Why are we in this ghastly dilemma?  In the 17th century Catholic Ireland was defeated three times with an enormous loss to the owners of land and in the 18th century suffered the penal code.  This did affect the Presbyterian community to a great degree but not to quite the same sinister degree as it affected the Irish Catholic community. Then came the end of the eighteenth century and of the Irish Parliament, although, if you wanted to be a bit <Col N="2025" /> facetious you could call it a Protestant parliament for a thousand Protestant Irish people.  However, the old Irish Parliament, which was an attempt to give Ireland a say in its affairs, was disbanded. There was brutal suppression of the United Irishmen.  Then there was the Act of Union brought in, to quote an Irish Protestant historian, by bribery and intimidation as well as argument.</P>
    <P>We come to the nineteenth century and certainly it was not all a one sided story.  We could go back and talk in regard to the eighteenth century about why 10,000 Northern Presbyterians were emigrating for years to the United States. One might also ask why they were in the forefront of drafting, printing and announcing the Declaration of Independence in North America?  You could also say that members of the Northern Protestant community suffered greatly in 1641.  We could go on and ask whether it is surprising, when it took 29 years to obtain Catholic emancipation after the Act of Union, that the Catholic population might have felt frustrated by what was on offer while the Protestant population began to get increasingly alarmed that the all Ireland that some of their fathers or grandfathers would have gone for was a Catholic Irish nationalism that they were being invited to participate in.</P>
    <P>All of these things which have caused division in Ireland and have caused a perception of England which has done no good to either of us have got to be worked through with a new trust, have got to be seen as something that has been responsible for the way in which we think about each other and the way we think we think about others.  What, one wonders, does Mrs. Thatcher think of the effects in the middle of the last century of rack renting, clearances, famine, the battering ram, the eviction, the deportation in the coffin ship?  Can she not understand the resentment that was felt by the people who landed, if they were lucky to get there, in North America?  We still suffer from all of that because that resentment bred bitterness and that bitterness bred a desire for some sort of revenge?  Do we need to go into the imprisonment of Irishmen <Col N="2026" /> in England?  I think it would hardly be helpful to go down that line for too long.  So while a constitutional nationalism developed in the last century and played its role for the British Empire in the First World War &mdash; I alluded to this here on 11 November &mdash; along with the Ulster Volunteer Force, we have also got to remember that there is another tradition in Ireland &mdash; the tradition of 1790,1840,1860,1905,1916,1918,1919 and 1937.  While it may not be easy for some of the Irish community to accept that, it is a fact of life and if Mrs. Thatcher were to go to the history books she would perhaps understand why the perception of England is unfortunately as negative as it has been in the past and why, therefore, it is so offensive when not only verbally but also by way of body language, she made her &ldquo;out, out, out&rdquo; statement some years ago and more recently has questioned the right of the people of the Republic to put safeguards into the Extradition Act &mdash; all this before a legacy of the bitterness that is our inheritence of centuries.</P>
    <P>There is much more I could say on those lines but I do not think it would be constructive to go further.  I might just add that the effect of Lloyd George and the effect of what happened between 1914 and 1922 left scars from which we are just beginning to recover &mdash; the civil war in the South and the partition of the island.  That is a factor of which Mrs. Thatcher, as British Prime Minister, should be made aware because that also has produced great difficulties in relation to the problem of looking constructively at what is going on in Northern Ireland. She should also realise that the legal system, North and South, has evolved along different lines and that the perception of what is right in law has got to be taken into account when you are dealing with two different jurisdictions. The tradition in England was very much based on common law but the tradition here, particularly in the last number of years, where, to use a term I heard recently, life had been breathed into the Constitution, is very largely related to constitutional law.  Fair enough.  Commercial <Col N="2027" /> consumer company law tended to go along parallel lines but since direct rule in 1972 there has been and I quote: &ldquo;an increasingly pronounced differentiation between North and South probably fostered by the constitutionalisation of law in the Republic&rdquo;. This is from the New Ireland Forum report on the two legal systems.  The current courts in the Republic were established in 1961 while pre-1920 courts lasted in substance in Northern Ireland until the major reorganisation in 1978. Virtually all formal links between the legal systems have died out, notable exceptions being through the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Acts.  Analysis of the use of judicial decisions in the courts North and South confirms that the precedent of neither jurisdiction has been important for the other.  Ironically since the Act of Union there developed a distinct body of Irish law as distinct from British law due mainly to the separate Irish administration which accepted the notion that Ireland was a separate problem requiring separate treatment, and of 10,000 enactments affecting Ireland between 1310 and 1921 over 6,500 were legislated for between the Union and Partition. Thus there is a different perception of law in Ireland and Britain even though it comes out perhaps of the same roots and there is a different perception of legal process North and South.  Now I quote here from W. C. Byrne straight out of the New Ireland Forum's report on legal systems:</P>
    <P>The most conventional of Englishmen were willing to experiment in Ireland on lines which they were not prepared to contemplate or tolerate at home.</P>
    <P>The case that is highlighted most notably in that New Ireland Forum document was the Criminal Courts of 1814 which, as I say, are reflected in Ireland both North and South to this day.  By 1920 it was possible to identify a separate Irish common law tradition even though there were indeed many similarities with England. Then perhaps the most distinctive feature of all of both the 1922 and 1937 <Col N="2028" /> Constitutions is their departure from British constitutional theory in the affirmation of the ultimate authority of God and of the people as opposed to the supremacy of parliament.  From this, if the Oireachtas enacted a law inconsistent with the Constitution, the courts could declare it void, a power of judicial review denied to the English courts.  Albeit this has been somewhat modified by the accession to the EC, nevertheless it is in essence the situation that applies in Ireland today.</P>
    <P>Since the 1920s where the practice of law continued much as before and while the corpus of common law was retained, the British institutions for legal expression were swept aside initially at the foundation of the State.  If the present predicament that we have was put to arbitration in Europe what would be the result?  Since the 1960s under the indication of the then Chief Justice, Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh the Irish Judiciary entered on a period of constitutional interpretation leading to the implementation of the Constitution with its emphasis on fundamental human rights as opposed to leaving it as a background document of political significance and here again I quote the term: &ldquo;by breathing life&rdquo; into the Constitution its principal standards and guarantees have been highlighted, promoted, discussed and pushed to the forefront of consciousness.  Only since the mid-sixties has the significance of a written Constitution as a general source of law and as a specific basis for the protection of the individual become evident.</P>
    <P>In summary then, as regards the law, I am trying to get across that there are three things the British Prime Minister must grasp when she tackles Ireland on these matters.  One is the historical legacy.  The second is the different development of British and Irish law but in particular the development which has taken place since the 1920s and the reliance on the Constitution as the final bulwark of protection as regards the civil and human rights of the individual.</P>
    <P>In the North of Ireland we have had the notorious Special Powers Act to which I <Col N="2029" /> have already alluded.  We then saw that Catholic opposition to its implications was mobilised in the sixties with a more articulate, better educated part of society, which was little wonder because there were enormous powers granted to the Minister of Home Affairs and the police.  There was evidence of gerrymandering in elections to local councils. There was discrimination in jobs and housing.  Internment without trial was on the Statute Book, and indeed it is in our own Statute Book, which brings me back to the point I was making earlier, that it is time you took up and widened what the Taoiseach said last week by scrutinising southern legislation when you have been prepared to put so much of the northern under the microscope.</P>
    <P>Anyway, in the 1960s as you all know, and it is history now, there was this great opposition mobilised in the form of public demonstration which led to a hostile reaction amoung the Protestant community. The Royal Ulster Constabulary lost the confidence of the Catholic community and all this less than 20 years ago.  There was the Hunt report and then the Protestant people began to feel less and less secure because the only security the felt they knew was the association that they had with the British, association with what is meant to be British in their minds. The only land border they had marched with a country which refused to recognise the legitimacy of the state, and the Northeren Ireland also embraced a large community who felt no allegiance to that state.  It was not surprising then that the Northern Protestant community should begin to feel vulnerable and go on the defensive. They had this fear of attack from within as well as from without.  As a result of the reforms &mdash; and I want to emphasise that there has been reform and to remind this House that reform and progress has been going on now for 20 years in spite of all that is said to the contrary &mdash; the B Specials were abandoned, an Ombudsman was appointed, the local government franchise was reformed, the power and status of local councils was downgraded because of the way in which they were held to discriminate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2030" /> The Army unfortunately was brought into a peacekeeping role and as we all know now a bit late in the day it is totally unsuitable for peacekeeping.  We remember how, as the situation got worse, rubber bullets were brought into action. Real bullets were brought into action. There were the special powers of arrest, the means of interrogation were atrocious and in fact, up intil 1973 there was very little movement, it all seemed to be in a negative direction.  There has been movement since 1972 in the political field.  First of all, we saw the mixture of military and judicial approaches and the political initiative.  We then saw what happened in 1974 when the experiment of a Northern Ireland power sharing assembly was overthrown by the failure of the British Government to face up to what was taking place on the streets.</P>
    <P>Lord Gardiner came in with his plan to try to criminalise paramilitary activity and to &ldquo;Ulsterise&rdquo; the whole process of law and order.  The military were to a large extent to be taken off the streets and the police put in their place.  In 1975 internment stopped.  In 1976 political status and special category status of prisoners was ended; in 1976 we also had the Prevention of Terrorism Act and in 1978 we had the revision of the Emergency Provisions Act.  Many abuses were concerned. In the mid-seventies there was the alleged shoot on the sight policy.  In the late seventies convictions were obtained in Diplock Courts on the basis of confessions obtained by dubious interrogation practices and more recently of course on the evidence of supergrasses, many of which were quashed.</P>
    <P>Amnesty International's criticism of the police interrogation practices was published in the later seventies.  Ninety per cent of all arrested under the emergency legislation between 1 January 1980 and 31 October 1980 were realsed without charge.  Under the normal powers of arrest in English law, an arrester must have reasonable suspicion &mdash; it was just suspicion in the Northern Ireland special legislation &mdash; an arrester has to tell the arrested the nature of the crime and the process of questioning or interrgation <Col N="2031" /> has to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case for trial; if not the will be released.  While this has not always been the case, nor would it have been possible in Northern Ireland, I would ask you to ask yourselves whether in fact, in the application of law down here and the powers of arrest, those conditions always apply here either.</P>
    <P>We have had repressive legislation. There is still repressive legislation on the Statute Book.  There is no getting away from it.  Because there is an unsolved political problem, because there is violence on the streets, because there have been reactions to it and attempts to grapple with it, we have legislation which in normal times would be quite unacceptable and which, therefore, must be continually monitored and continually kept under scrutiny.  As soon as you give free licence to any army or police under special legislation and particularly if it is not resulting in adequate scrutiny in the courts, there will inevitably be trouble, trouble in perception by those who are marginalised, those who feel in minority situations.</P>
    <P>In relation to the complexities, we are struggling in Ireland to see how we can evolve a new politic, based on consensus democracy rather than on the right of majorities to dominate minorities.  That has come across at last.  Consensus democracy is a key in a divided society. It does not matter whether we are talking about Cyprus, Sri Lanka or here.  The right to self determination, as I said before, enshrined in United Nations convenants is a right given to any peoples and, therefore, if Republicans affirm it for the people of Ireland and Loyalists affirm it for the people of Northern Ireland there is inevitable conflict rather than resolution.</P>
    <P>The only way one can get around that is by insisting that the right to self determination must be qualified by achieving consensus because it is from consensus that you get a mandate to give your laws and your orders the justification which they need if they are to be seen to be reasonable and seen to reflect the 99 per cent of the population who can support <Col N="2032" /> them.  In this debate we must define what we mean by consensus, how do we achieve it and how do we assess it.  That is part of the ongoing process which is just in its infancy.  At least people are looking at it.</P>
    <P>The next thing we have to do is monitor the whole process of law and order in a divided community such as the North of Ireland.  This is now also possible through the Anglo-Irish process, so that is in place.  The third thing we have to do is to look at the business of the distribution of power and how people can do effective things where they live in the communities and at their workplace.  Fourthly, and it is not appropriate to do it here, we must find some way of engaging paramilitaries and try to persuade them of what they are doing to themselves if they cannot be persuaded about what they are doing to others.</P>
    <P>What I am saying is that extradition has come of age, so to speak, in Ireland because we are now doing and striving to develop those things about which we talked in 1982.  I suggested in 1982 that, with the legacy of Anaglo-Irish history and secretarian bitterness in Ireland, you could not seek to justify extradition unless you were dealing with the monitoring process, a look at the democratic process, a look at the historical background to the whole position in which we find ourselves. In short, to become aware of what Loyalist consciousness is about and what Republican consciousness is about and see how we can build anew so that we can create in a climate of constructive tension rather than destructive tension, a society in which all can live together. That is beginning and because of that there should be no moral scruples shown about bringing in extradition.</P>
    <P>Extradition is being brought in, I am glad to say, with safeguards.  In the climate that we have, at the phase of development that we are in, when you consider that Fianna Fáil came into politics to take republicanism away from the gun, they have gone that extra stage in showing that they understand the people who feel so let down because there is no extradition.  As they perceive it it is their <Col N="2033" /> folk who have been in uniform or who are in uniform, and many who are not, who are being shot down so ruthlessly and mercilessly.  Therefore, I do not have any problem in supporting either the Bill nor the safeguard, particularly as this is to be reviewed in a year.  That is an excellent idea.  It should be reviewed annually, or perhaps every two years would give a better flow of what is happening.</P>
    <P>On the amendment which suggests that the Attorney General could be susceptible to pressure, I can understand those who know the Attorney General saying that is unnecessary, but you do not know all Attorneys General.  We are all human and I feel that is a very worthwhile amendment.  I am glad the Government have taken it up.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the irregular law process in the North of Ireland but lest the House is in any doubt about the situation that exists and that we are confronting let me just look back a year: October 18, Billy Dickson, former Loyalist paramilitary, shot dead in a Loyalist feud; October 24, Kenneth Johnson, Protestant salesman shot dead by IRA at Magherafelt, a case of mistaken identity; November 10, Derek Patterson, off duty policeman shot dead by IRA Ormeau Road; November 15, Alice Kelly, 66 year old Catholic, Alan McCormack, 29 year old Protestant died and 70 people injured in violence associated with the first anniversary of the Anglo-Irish Agreement; November 17, full time RUC reservist smoked out of his home; November 27, 36 people injured in Newry when an IRA mortar bomb overshot the RUC station; December 9, Kieran Bradley, aged 30, died after being beaten in a secretarian attack; December 12, Desmond Caldwell, killed by IRA by a bomb in a cab in his lorry; December 12, wreath left at Austin Curry's home during a second attack in two weeks; December 13, seven people arrested after police stopped a van carrying 1,200 pounds of explosives near Newry.</P>
    <P>The summary of the statistics for 1986 gives it all.  There were 64 deaths compared with 53 in 1985 showing an increase of 20 per cent.  Of the deaths in 1986, 34 <Col N="2034" /> or 53 per cent were civilians, 24 or 37 per cent were members of the security forces, six or 10 per cent were paramilitary.  Of the agents responsible, Nationalist paramilitaries killed 41 of the 64 in 1986. This included 24 members of the security forces, three paramilitaries and 14 civilians. Loyalist paramilitaries killed 16 civilians.  The security forces killed six people of whom three were civilians.  The religion of the victims, excluding members of the British army, was provided by the Irish Information Partnership, now defunct.  In 1986, 47 per cent of those killed were Catholics and 53 per cent of those killed were Protestants. In the years 1969 to 1986 54 per cent of those killed were Catholics and 45 per cent were Protestants.</P>
    <P>The present conflict began in 1969.  By the end of 1986, 1,418 civilians had been killed, accounting for 56 per cent of the total; 785 members of the security forces had been killed accounting for 31 per cent of the total.  If one were to multiply that 785 by three one would end up with over 2,000 members of your own security forces killed; 202 Nationalist paramilitaries had been killed, accounting for 8 per cent of the total; and 50 Loyalist paramilitaries had been killed, accounting for 2.5 per cent of the total.  Of these killings Loyalist paramilitaries were responsible for 587 or 41 per cent; Nationalist paramilitaries for 523 or 36 per cent; security forces for 167 or 11.7 per cent; and there remained an unclassified number of 141 or 9.9 per cent.  The total provided by the Irish Information Partnership was, therefore, 2,905 at the end of 1986.  I could read the year which I have documented here but the point I am trying to make is that it is against that sort of turmoil that we are now facing the future.</P>
    <P>We have talked about changing Northern Ireland and about slow change with more awareness, more understanding, even though there is still the same polarisation. We have talked about the growing perception of the problem in the Republic, that it is not just a simplistic business of &ldquo;Brits out&rdquo;.  It is a question <Col N="2035" /> of trying to cope with the different strains of Irishmen to build a new fabric.</P>
    <P>Even since the Anglo-Irish Agreement there have been considerable changes and these were outlined in a letter to <i>The Times on</i> on 7 October.  These included: (1) the ending of the so-called supergrass trials; (2) reforms in emergency laws including grounds for arrest&mdash; there now has to be reasonable suspicion; (3) improvement in confidence in impartiality of the police &mdash; one will find in some of the more marginalised communities that that could be questioned but, on the whole, there is a greater perception that the police are endeavouring to be impartial; (4) reducation in the complaints about harassment of the minority by the UDR; (5) abolition of the Flags and Emblems Act; (6) Strengthening of the laws on parades; (7) demolishment of those ghastly Divis, Unity and Rossville flats; (8) improved Catholic representation on a range of appointed bodies; (9) shortening of the period on remand before trial, which was a scandal; (10) improved guidelines for fair employment &mdash; and I would add now the prospect of some new legislation; (11) some improvement in prison arrangements for parole etc; (12) commitment to improve the status of the Irish language &mdash; and all of this against the Loyalist reaction, often violent or potentially violent, following the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>
    <P>It was in the expections of developments in these and other areas and in anticipation of progress towards a more normal administration of justice that it became possible politically to ratify the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.  What we must see here is a modest start because many of those things could be questioned and, indeed, were questioned.  In a report in <i>The Times</i> the following week Fr. Desmond Wilson concluded that:  &ldquo;The overriding political idea that you can solve structural political problems by inserting more Catholics into inadequate and failed systems simply helps to prolong the sectarianism.&rdquo;  There is a lot of truth in that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2036" /> Nevertheless, a start has been made and it is now up to us to try to build a new trust on what has been created here this week.  In that context we should try to help the British prime minister to have a better, deeper and more penetrating perception of the difficulties.  That was the main trust of this fairly lengthy perambulation through history, legal process, and so on.  I am glad that the Extradition (Amendment) Bill has been passed by the Dáil.  I hope it will be passed by the Seanad and I look forward to voting on the safeguards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, may I compliment Senator Robb on what was by any standard in this House &mdash; and this House has very high standards &mdash; a <i>tour de force</i>?  It was full of wisdom and reflection and experience.  He held the mirror up to all of us who have been products of Irish history and tradition.  I would cavil with one or two of the points he made.  I could not bring myself to be quite so generous towards the motivation behind the legislation before us today.  Nevertheless, all of us who were here for the duration of that speech were treated to quite a brilliant expose on the thought of Senator Robb and his analysis of the situation in Anglo-Irish and Northern Irish relations.</P>
      <P>In making my own contribution on the Extradition (Amendment) Bill, 1987, I think it is important at the outset to establish some basic principles which underliethe whole issue of extradition.  In all the welter of debate and discussion &mdash; and there has been so much of it over the past fortnight &mdash; it is important to state unequivocally some very fundamental points.  Most people accept the urgent need to strengthen the laws in order to deal with the menace of international terrorism.  Sadly we have daily reminders of what this menace can inflict on innocent civilians throughout the world.  We need to protect likely victims, so often innocent civilians, going about their daily routines and we desperately need to guard against the concept of a political offence being used to excuse what is, in fact, the inexcusable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in full support of joint action <Col N="2037" /> internationally and within Europe to prevent terrorism.  Sadly, we live in an age of violence, an age of bombing, of hijacking, kidnapping and of removing people from one jurisdiction to another.  As a consequences, joint action is vital.  The legislative history of extradition has been referred to by many people who contributed to the debate in this House so far.  We passed an extradition Bill in 1965 which implemented an international Convention of 1957.  I find the time lag interesting because it happened again.  In 1987 in Seanad Éireann we passed the Extradition Bill, 1987, which gave effect to the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.  That was agreed as long ago as 1976.  So, there certainly seems to be some sort of time lag built in to these mechanisams which is probably an indication of the sensitivity of extradition as much as an indication of the delays which are part and parcel of the legislative process.</P>
    <P>During the 1986-87 debate there was much emphasis on the purpose of the Convention which was to assist in the suppression of terrorism by complementing and where necessary modifying existing extradition and mutual assistance arrangements conducted between member states of the Council of Europe.  Of course the measure before us here in Ireland has to be looked at in the context of Anglo-Irish relations.  During the debate I remember considerable emphasis was placed on that significant element.  Reservations were voiced in relation to preceptions of the UK and Northern Ireland justice system.  There were calls for <i>prima facie</i> evidence which was not part of the 1965 Act.  Political and deeply-rooted patricotic feelings were aroused and entered into the debate. Senator Robb detailed the backdrop which gives rise to those political feelings and patriotic feelings which all of us, with any sense of the history of this country, have to one degree or another.</P>
    <P>None of this is surprising because extradition is an extremely sensitive issue and an emotive issue and it is no more sensitive than when it must operate, as it must here, in an Anglo-Irish context.  The <Col N="2038" /> real difficulty with extradition is this: we must ensure in any extradition legislation or in any extradition procedures that what is occuring is extradition for trial not extradition for questioning and not extradition for trial for some alternative offence.  We have to make sure it is extradition for a fair trial.</P>
    <P>There is a question mark over the administration of justice in Northeren Ireland.  All of this was addressed in the context of the Forum and the Anglo-Irish Agreement and commitments were entered into to effect progress in the area of justice.  Both the British and the Irish Governments accepted there was a necessity to secure better relations between the security forces and the minority community, to improve confidence in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland and on security co-operation. The fact that they acknowledged progress needed to be made did not mean they had reached agreement on the changes required to achieve that progress.</P>
    <P>For all of these reasons, and properly in my view, there was a 12 month suspension of the operation of the 1987 Extradition Act.  Early in 1987 we had a general election and a change of Government. Sadly, progress in the area of Anglo-Irish relations slowed down.  Many of us noticed that dialogue and interaction have been put on the back burner. I cannot agree with my colleague, Senator Ferris, when he felt otherwise. The clear perception was that the Government were extremely preoccupied with the economic issues, the reality of which they had suddenly woken up to after four years of denying that the situation was as it is, and Anglo-Irish relations were, to some extent shelved or as I have said put on the back burner.</P>
    <P>Repeatedly, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Barry, and Fine Gael Leader, Deputy Dukes, called on the Government for action and for visible, tangible, effective signs of progress.  It was known that 1 December was looming and it was known that progress had to be made in the area of security and justice. The 1 December deadline for the implementation of the 1987 Extradition <Col N="2039" /> Act was approaching and what did we hear offstage and on stage?  We heard reactionary noises and they got louder and louder.  Individual Deputies in the Government party stepped forward to voice their objections and those of Cumann members, of Comhairle Dáil Ceantair and of the rest of the paraphernalia of the organisation of the party in Government.  They voiced in one way or another strong reservations based on a kind of atavism which is fed predominantly by the members of that party, and the trickle became a rush.</P>
    <P>Soon it became quite clear that implementation was a major problem for the Government party and there was marked reluctance to fully endorse and satisfy the 1987 Act.</P>
    <P>Tensions heightened, uncertainty abounded and then the entire country was rocked by a series of appalling events.  Dr. John O'Grady was kidnapped, there was a huge demand for ransom and he was subjected to sickening brutality and mutilation.  The <i>Eksund</i>, laden with arms and explosives mainly destined for this country, was seized by French police.  A horrific bombing outrage occurred on Remembrance Sunday in Enniskillen with great loss of life, injury and destruction.</P>
    <P>The awful, appalling danger and threat of terrorism and terrorist offences was brought home to the people of Ireland in a most immediate and dreadful fashion. The Government, despite the grassroots reservations of Fianna Fáil of which I have spoken, decided they had no option but to allow the implementation of the Act.  However, there were indications that legislation was in the course of prepration which would build in a set of safeguards that would act as a brake on the extradition arrangements already in place.  This is the legislation that is before us for consideration today.</P>
    <P>I regret deeply that this Bill was in large part prompted by party political considerations rather than on the merits and necessity of safeguards.  I have no quarrel with the need to have safeguards, with the merit of safeguards and with the <Col N="2040" /> necessity of safeguards; nor has my party. We support the principle of safeguards but it is the manner in which this legislation was conceived and brought before us that I quarrel with and that I find regrettable.  In some way it devalues the principles we are discussing here today. It does not give me any pleasure to state that fact, the fact that this legislation is the directs consequence of grassroots Fianna Fáil pressure and the need to assuage it.</P>
    <P>The safeguards are largely illusory and insubstantial.  The whole thing is pretty hastily contrived and could be, in many instances, described as a fudge.  I am pleased that in response to Fine Gael, the Government have agreed to a review of the effectiveness of these safeguards in 12 months.  That is a reasonable and a considered response.  Again, it was not unconnected with the politics of the situation. It is important to assess the practical application of these measures.  I would prefer to address this legislation on the merits of the case without the backdrop I have spoken of.  It is regrettable for so many reasons that we are discussing this in a narrow political context but not to face up to that political context is in many ways to deny the facts of the situation and the realities as we all perceive them over the past number of weeks.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach underlined the political context I speak of with his threats to make the passage of one section of this Bill a general election issue.  I do not find that kind of approach statesmanlike.  I find it disappointing in the context of a debate on extradition and the necessity to put safeguards in place.  It smacks of political blackmail and I do not think it is democratic.  I hope this kind of attitude will not become a pattern in the context of future legislation which will come before us in the lifetime of this Government. I do not understand the extereme urgency attached to this provision which has us here today and which, I understand, may have us back here again early next week.  I am not unwilling, but I would have welcomed an opportunity for <Col N="2041" /> reflection and a chance to consider the debate in the other House.</P>
    <P>It is a pity the Government felt bound by a time constraint and I would welcome comments from the Minister when he replies at the conclusion of Second Stage as to why he felt there was so much urgency and why he sees the necessity for a time constraint.  It is very important that Senators should consider with sufficient care the various provisions of this Bill and I expect that Committee Stage will give us an opportunity to do this.</P>
    <P>The precise function of the Attorney General is a feature of this legislation in that he &mdash; or, hopefully, one day, she &mdash; is to be given a role in the extradition process.  Is the Attorney General now to have a judicial function and is this constitutional?  In fact, is this whole measure constitutional?  The Fine Gael Party recognises and, indeed, have recognised in the past, and I recognise the need for safeguards in respect of procedures relating to extradition.  Safeguards were put in when Fine Gael were in Government but they were obviously never acted upon by the present Government and we do not know why.</P>
    <P>The need for this legislation is questionable. The proposal to place the Attorney General in a judicial role is not acceptable to my party.  I welcome an amendment which indicates that representations to the Attorney General in the case of extradition will not be tolerated. That is welcome.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech was concise and useful and it is important to recognise the fact &mdash; which does not seem to have been recognised by many members of the Minister's party &mdash; that extradition has been in place in this country since 1965. Listening to the debate over the past three weeks one would have thought that there was no extradition at all and that it was something entirely novel.  There was a lack of clearity and a lack of understanding. I am pleased that ratification of the European Convention and of the 1986 Bill went ahead on 1 December.  It was the only civilised thing we could do as a member of a European Community and <Col N="2042" /> as a member of an international community. Despite our own difficulties and despite the tensions that exist in this area between Britain and Northern Ireland and this State we have to recognise that we must not give succour to, give sustenance to, or in any way appear to be soft on terrorism with its crimes of violence, mutilation and mayhem.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing other contributions on this Bill and, in particular, I look forward to committee Stage when we can tease this out.  I am pleased that safeguards are in place but I regret the fact that there had to be such a vexatious political backdrop to this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1987 Extradition Act, Ireland's ratification of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism, came into force recently and it is an important aspect of Ireland's commitment in the fight against terrorism. It is vitally important that it operates effectively and efficiently and with maximum safeguards.  I welcome the Extradition (Amendment) Bill, 1987, because we need safeguards in regard to extradition.  I will deal with those safeguards later.</P>
      <P>I think we are all agreed that extradition is necessary.  Nobody could claim that a person who for whatever reason, be it political motivation, criminal intent, or just plain madness, commits an act of international terrorism should not be extradited.  Anyone who commits a crime must be brought to justice and there is, I believe, no disagreement about that. Some disagreement arises, however, in relation to a person being brought to justice.  This disagreement may arise when we speak of where we might be extraditing an Irish national to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I cannot understand how we can even begin to contemplate extraditing a person to the Six Counties as long as these counties remain under British occupation. By doing so we are giving <i>de jure</i> recognition to a <i>de facto</i> situation and perhaps the Minister would comment on this.  I may be a lone voice in stating that here today, but I know there are many people who agree with me in this regard. <Col N="2043" /> Secondly, I am opposed to the extradition of any Irish national to what is now called mainland Britain and if I had been around at the time of the original Extradition Act I would have opposed it.  I am opposed to it because it is my firm and passionate belief, a belief I know is shared by many people and, indeed, backed up by any dispassionate view of the workings of British justice as applied to Irish nationals, that no Irish person can get a fair trial in a British court of law.  I was quoted in a Sunday newspaper recently as saying that I would not extradite a dog to Britain.  Let me clarify that: I should have said that I would not extradite an Irish dog to Britain.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of what offence an Irish national has committed I would not extradite him to Britain because, by doing so, we would be denying him the justice he denied to those on whom he perpetrated his act of violence and we would, by so doing, descent to his level. I do not want to descend to the level of those so-called freedom fighters who recently blew to smithereens innocent Irish men and women who were honouring their dead in Enniskillen.  I believe that justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done.  As the Minister for the Environment said recently in the Dáil, it must also be felt to be done.  He said:</P>
    <P>There are many cases in recent times of people of Irish birth being processed by British justice &mdash; and I use this phrase advisedly &mdash; in a way which leaves them without the feeling that justice has been done.</P>
    <P>I would go further than that.  I believe the British have never shown justice to Irish nationals, in the past when we were a colony, or at present, not do I believe they will ever do it in the future.  The British are so arrogant in their dealings with us that they do not even hate us; they just do not regard us.  This arrogance was typified in the recent outburst by the British Prime Minister.  Might I remind <Col N="2044" /> Mrs. Thatcher that the Twenty-Six Counties are no longer under the yoke of British imperalism and are bonded together as a free, independent sovereign nation? May I say to Mrs. Thatcher: &ldquo;The decisions our parliament make with regard to our own citizens &mdash; and I say this respectfully &mdash; are, Madam, none of your bloody business&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>There is a tendency in Britain to find people guilty even before they are brought to trial.  At the end of August 1975, for example, several bombs exploded in London and later on the night of Thursday, 4 September, Scotland Yard released a statement through the Press Association.  A photograph accompanied the statement which described Margaret McKierney as &ldquo;the most dangerous and active woman terrorist operating here&rdquo; and launched a nationwide appeal for information.  The press swallowed the bait; the next morning the national papers convicted Margaret McKierney in inch high letters on their front pages. &ldquo;She is Britain's Most Wanted Woman Terrorist&rdquo; cried the <i>Daily Mail.  The Mirror</i> and <i>The Telegraph</i> called her &ldquo;Terror Girl&rdquo; and <i>The Sun</i> went one better with &ldquo;Death Courier&rdquo;.  &ldquo;The most evil girl in Britain&rdquo; announced <i>The Express</i> and continued: &ldquo;Her Irish eyes may be smiling but her trade is fear and death.  Consider this female of the species but keep well clear for Margaret McKierney is certainly more deadly than the male.&rdquo;<i>The Times</i> and <i>The Guardian</i> which also carried the story on their front pages, were the only papers to attribute the story to the police in their headlines. The same evening, 5 September, ITN carried a five minutes film on the story. The contents suggested that they had been fully briefed by Scotland Yard on Margaret McKierney's movements. Their cameras were present at the McKierney home in Moy, County Tyrone and at the address in Dublin where Mrs. McKierney said her daughter was staying.</P>
    <P>The media were underterred by the fact that there was no evidence to support the police allegations.  <i>The Irish Press</i> pointed out in an editorial:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2045" /> Some of the statements contained in Scotland Yard's list of reasons for wanting to interview the girl are so unfounded that our special branch were able through their own survillance to dismiss them as utter rubbish because she was in Ireland at the times when the Yard alleged she was committing the crimes in England.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Sun</i> newspaper went on to draw another innocent person into the net.  On 11 September, pages 1 and 2 of <i>The Sun</i> carried photographs purporting to be of Margaret McKierney.  Nearly a year later <i>The Sun</i> published a tiny apology, on 16 August, 1976.  This stated that a complaint had been received from Miss Goretta Amenda Kennedy from County Dublin and that the photographs were in fact of her and that <i>The Sun</i> wished to make it plain that before they received a complaint they had no knowledge of Miss Kennedy and had no intention of referring to her.</P>
    <P>At that time a major row blew up here especially over the implication that the Yard's photo of Margaret McKierney might have been taken by a British agent operating south of the Border.  The Irish Governement sent a complaint to the Foreign Office about Scotland Yard's handling of the affair.  The McKierney family started proceedings against the media for defamation.  It soon became evident that there was more to the Yard's action than the mere pursuit of terrorists, Stephen Chibroll in his book, <i>Law and Order News,</i> published by Tavistock in 1977 considered that the McKierney case is the most striking example of the direct exploitation of the media for the purposes of control agency propaganda.</P>
    <P>Commentators at the time agreed that the Yard's launching of the McKierney appeal had been approved at the highest political level at Whitehall.  Some thought the purpose was to divert criticism from the Northern Ireland Office which was under pressure from Unionists and military over its weak security policy.  That was reported in <i>The Guardian</i> newspaper. Others, and Steve Chibroll supports this view, thought that the <Col N="2046" /> McKierney appeal was calculated to put pressure on the Irish Government when it became clear that McKierney was living openly in Ireland.  It functioned as a means of pressurising the Dáil to pass the Bill designated to expedite extradition between Britain and Ireland.</P>
    <P>Whichever of these is true &mdash; both may be &mdash; the only concrete result was that two innocent people lost their lives.  Two days after the media gave Margaret McKierney the full treatment, the McKierney family were given protection by the Irish Garda and the Army after as threat from the UVF &ldquo;to get you or your family, each and every one of you&rdquo;.  The UVF were to make good their threat.  On 23 October, 1975 a man and a woman were found shot dead in a lonely roadside farm bungalow near Moy, County Tyrone.  They were relatives of Margaret McKierney and lived in the same district as her family.  The ultimate responsibility for these deaths must lie with the British police, politicians and media.</P>
    <P>At present there is a young lady, Martina Shanahan, who is on remand in Britain, not convicted of anything.  She is kept in solitary confinement 24 hours a day with a light on and her clothes are taken away at night.  She is not allowed to speak to other prisoners because she is on remand.  I call the House back to the time of Bloody Sunday when William Nash, Hugh Gilmore, Michael McDaid, James W. Ray, Patrick Doherty, Kevin McIlhenny, Joe Young, Gerald Donaghy, Gerald McKinney, Bernard McGuigan, Michael Kelly, Jack Duddy and William McKenney were all murdered by the Paras.  The <i>Mirror</i> of the following day said the officer, Colonel Harry Dalzell-Payne denied reports that the troops fired wildly.  He said the paratroopers who took part in the action were fired on first, the terrorist fire &ldquo;was totally indiscriminater&rdquo; as far as we are concerned.</P>
    <P>During the fiercest ten minutes of the battle the paras fired 164 high velocity bullets and 106 rubber bullets but only at identifiable targets.  There were 18 separate engagements.  Nine bombers were fired at, two were killed and seven <Col N="2047" /> injured.  Nine gunmen were fired at by the paras, two were killed and four hit. If the troops fired wildly Colonel Dalzell-Payne asked &ldquo;why were no women or children killed, only men?&rdquo;  Troops would not fire at random he said because they had some bloody good NCOs and some chaps who knew the form: another example of British justice.  None of these people who committed this murder was ever prosecuted or brought to trial.  There are countless examples of so called British justice and of children mainmed by rubber bullets.  Tobias Molloy, aged 18, was killed in July 1972.  Stephen Geddis, aged 10, was killed on 30 August, 1975. Brian Stewart, aged 13 was killed in October, 1976.  Paul Whitters, aged 15, was killed on 25 April, 1981.  Julie Livingstone, aged 14, was killed in 1981 and so on.</P>
    <P>Not one of these people who shot these bullets was ever brought to trial &mdash; more examples of British justice.  Any nation that cannot even give justice to their own &mdash; this is exemplified in the Stalker affair &mdash; would have difficulty doing so to an Irish national.  Having stated how I feel on the question of extradition to Britain, I nevertheless welcome the amendment to this Bill.  Why?  Because I am a constitutional republican and because I live and work in a democracy.  I accept the will of the majority.  It is a pity that some of those who claim the mantle of republicanism now strive to destroy every institution of constitutional democracy.  I belong to a party whose aims are to reunite the country through peaceful means and the country through peaceful means and I abhor violence in every form.</P>
    <P>I accept that we have extradition.  We have had extradition now since 1965 and I accept that we may be extraditing people to Britain in the future.  It is for that reason that I consider it is necessary to have these safeguards.  I congratulate the Taoiseach, the Government and the Minister who have done their best to build in important safeguards.  The first safeguard is that the Attorney General must be of the opinion that there is a clear indication to prosecute.  This intention is founded on the existence of sufficient <Col N="2048" /> evidence.  This would guard against extradition for questioning which I am sure would be tried.</P>
    <P>The second one is that, as a general principle, persons can only be tried for the offence for which they are extradited and additional charges may only proceed with the agreement of the Attorney General. This is to be known as the rule of specialty.  The third safeguard I laud is that a person whose extradition is sought will be able to apply to the High Court to have his extradition refused on the grounds that, by reason of the passage of time, from when he is alleged to have committed the offence, it would, having regard to all the circumstances, be unjust, depressive or invidious to extradite him.</P>
    <P>The fourth one I commend is the one that the Attorney General will have a statutory obligation to prepare and submit to the Government an annual report on the operation of extradition arrangements in respect of specific cases in the previous 12 months.  The Taoiseach has said that if the arrangements are not upheld in the letter and in the spirit they will be set aside.  On the other hand if they are not working satisfactorily the Government will bring forward revised proposals.</P>
    <P>Section 44B provides that the Attorney General shall give direcation to the Commissioner of the Garda not to endorse a warrant unless, having considered such information as he deems appropriate &mdash; as the Minister said &mdash; he is of the opinion first that there is a clear intention to prosecute, to continue a prosecution for the offence specified in the warrant and, secondly, that the intention is founded on the existence of sufficient evidence.</P>
    <P>Much has been made of the fact that the Attorney General may be open to pressures and so on.  I have absolute faith in the present Attorney General and if we look at the records of the preceding Attorneys General, we find that all of them, from whatever political persuation, have approached their duties in a fair and unbiased manner.  I have no doubt that succeeding Attorneys General will again do their duty in a similar manner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2049" /> I, therefore, have no hesitation in recommending this Bill to the House.  It is a necessary Bill.  It was brought forward quickly, not rushed but quickly.  There is an urgency about it, despite what Senator Bulbulia has said, because of the other Extradition Bill which is in place.  It was done well, fulfils its function and will prove to be a very useful safeguard when extradition cases arise in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill falls to be considered at two levels, first, at the political level and, secondly, at the legal level.  It is appropriate to begin with the political dimension because that is the dimension that has the Seanad sitting on a Friday and next Monday in order to proceed with the examination of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The political dimension is not the purpose of the Bill as set out in the explanatory memorandum.  In my view the purpose of the Bill as set out in the explanatory memorandum is somewhat misleading.  In the explanatory memorandum it states:</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide for certain safeguards in relation to the procedure under which persons charged with, or convicted of, certain offences in the neighbouring jurisdictions (Northern Ireland and England, Wales, Scotland, the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands) may be extradited to those jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>The procedure for the extradition of persons in the provisions of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terroriem have come into effect as of last Tuesday as Members of the House are well aware.  The provisions of the European Convention have been ratified by Ireland whether this Bill goes through the Oireachtas so that this Bill is being brought in but clearly it is not a precondition to ratification because that ratification has already taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real purpose of this Bill has been identified by a number of contributors to the debate already.  It is to resolve internal difficulties within the Fianna Fáil Party and to defuse backbench opposition to the whole idea of extraditing, <Col N="2050" /> particularly, to Northern Ireland but also to Britain.  That being clearly the real purpose of the Bill, it is ironic that after all the emphasis laid, particularly by the Taoiseach, on the significance of the Bill that the Government have agreed by way of amendment in the other House that the Bill would lapse after a year unless a positive resolution by both Houses is passed that it should continue for a further period.  After all the excitement over the past week or so on the subject we have a Bill that is being brought in after the Convention has been ratified by Ireland and a Bill which will lapse after 12 months unless at that time both Houses pass positive resolutions that it should continue.</P>
    <P>At the political level, therefore, I find this Bill difficult to take seriously for the political reasons that have been advanced which I do not find to be convincing. There was a whole political dimension to it.  It was to bring recalcitrant Fianna Fáil backbenchers into line and there it seems to have succeeded very well because those who were totally opposed to the whole idea two weeks ago and who were beginning to mount quite an effective campaign about it appear to have been mollified by the provisions of this Bill and to be content to let the matter rest at that.</P>
    <P>I want to look, in the broader context of this political dimension of the Bill, at what price will we as a country pay for this particular Bill which has a purely domestic Fianna Fáil provenance and purpose.  The Bill is perceived by Mrs. Thatcher to have caused Ireland to renege on a commitment given at the time of the Anglo-Irish Agreement signed at Hillsborough just over two years ago.  Mrs. Thatcher in two well publicised speeches has expressed the view, as Prime Minister of Britain, that this Bill would constitute a step backwards in relation to extradition proceedings between Ireland and Britain because it involves the introduction of a new step, a new procedure involving the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt in my mind that her criticism of the Bill and her criticism of <Col N="2051" /> introducing this new measure which she regards as a step backwards has greatly facilitated the passage of the Bill through the Dáil.  If Mrs. Thatcher gets so cross about it, then it must mean something after all.  If Mrs. Thatcher is getting very annoyed because of the proposals in the Bill, then that must have helped to mollify backbenchers who still had worries and also to get their blood up because she was insensitively clearly poking her nose in this country's legislative affairs.</P>
    <P>Mrs. Thatcher is well known for speaking in a very forthright way.  I tend to doubt if she was speaking off the cuff or in a way that was not very carefully considered and very carefully worked out.  Indeed, I understand she had quite a carefully prepared written script and that what she said was not blowing her top and saying something cross at the particular moment, but very carefully considered and carefully calculated views.  Equally, I have little doubt that Mrs. Thatcher was annoyed.  I believe she felt that the introduction of this Bill was a reneging on the commitment that had been given at Hillsborough and was a step backwards, as she put it, in the extradition arrangements between Britain and Ireland and a calculated criticism of the administration of justice in Northern Ireland and in Britain.  She was annoyed about that.</P>
    <P>She decided to use her annoyance and to make it serve a different purpose.  That purpose was, at least in part, to express publicly her criticism of the Dublin Government, to that extent to distance herself a little bit from the Dublin Government and, in this way, to move a little closer to the Unionist politicians and Unionist community.  Mrs. Thatcher realises, because she is if nothing else a very experienced politician, that there can be no real progress in Northern Ireland without having a basis for involving in some measure the Unionist politicians and Unionist community.  It will not be possible to make any substantial progress in that regard in my view under the framework of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, but expressing anger about the <Col N="2052" /> Dublin Government and accusing them of reneging on the Anglo-Irish Agreement may help towards establishing some basis for discussions with the Unionist politicians, some basis for these talks about talks which have been proceeding so far without much progress being made. The aftermath of the introduction of this Bill may be more favourable from Mrs. Thatcher's point of view in seeking to reopen links there.</P>
    <P>I pose the question, because it is relevant to this Bill and to the background to this Bill, for reflection as to whether that is a good thing or a bad thing.  I happen to believe it is extremely important that a basis be created for discussion with Unionist politicians and representatives of the Unionist community. That is a precondition for the establishment of peace and reconciliation and building better inter-community relations in Northern Ireland.  The difficulty in discussing the Anglo-Irish Agreement in this part of the country is that it has become a kind of holy writ, it has become sacrosanct, it has been firmly implanted in the minds of leader writers in the media that the Anglo-Irish Agreement was a great milestone in the history of this island and that anything that would seek to be critical of it or question some of its premises is not to be accepted or tolerated.</P>
    <P>In fact, in the last two years, a great deal has changed in the parameters of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the parameters that were there at Hillsborough and were reduced into the text of the Anglo-Irish agreement.  It is worth recalling that at the time of the Hillsborough Agreement the first reaction of Deputy Haughey on behalf of Fianna Fáil was a rejection of the agreement as being fundamentally unacceptable because he believed, and he was so advised, that it was unconstitutional.  That was repeated on a couple of occasions but when the reaction to that approach was clearly politically very adverse, the constitutional objection was softened and other criticisms were maintained.  That appeared to be more or less the position until the change of Government last spring.  There <Col N="2053" /> was a very clear perception at that stage in the media of a kind of conversion by Fianna Fáil, particularly by the Foreign Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan to the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  This conversion is more evident in recent months.  It is now regarded as being of great significance.</P>
    <P>It is worth reflecting on why this apparent conversion has taken place.  I am saying apparent not because I am accusing people of being dishonest in what they are doing; I am saying that the conversion is to the present reality of where the Anglo-Irish Agreement has stagnated, not to a conversion to what the Anglo-Irish Agreement was intended to be and to become when it was signed at Hillsborough.  There is a very real difference, both politically and legally, between what was signed with all the fanfare at Hillsborough two years ago and the very minimal stagnation of that process we have now.</P>
    <P>That is a very interesting reality and it explains why it has been possible for a Government, which viewed the agreement as not just politically unacceptable but fundamentally unconstitutional to be able to come around two years later and say &ldquo;yes, we can live and work with this, indeed this is a significant framework and we do not want to do anything that would damage it&rdquo;.  If we look at the text of the agreement itself, apart from the commitment to establish a framework for peace and reconciliation the idea was to have quite a developed structure.  For example, in Article 4 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement it is clearly intended that it would lead early, rather than late, to devolved government in Northern Ireland.  Article 4, paragraphs (b) and (c) state:</P>
    <P>It is the declared policy of the United Kingdom Government that responsibility in respect of certain matters within the powers of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland should be devolved within Northern Ireland on a basis which would secure widespread acceptance throughout the community. The Irish Government support <Col N="2054" /> that policy.  Both Governments recognise that devolution can be achieved only with the co-operation of constitutional representatives within Northern Ireland of both traditions there.  The Conference shall be a framework within which the Irish Government may put forward views and proposals on the modalities of bringing about devolution in Northern Ireland in so far as they relate to the interests of the minority community.</P>
    <P>It was clearly intended that there would be devolved administration within Northern Ireland.  It was also intended that there would be a parliamentary tier involving the United Kingdom and Irish Parliaments, a whole elaborate legal and constitutional framework.</P>
    <P>That allowed the immediate aftermath of Hillsborough to be full of descriptions of the Anglo-Irish Agreement as being almost joint authority, which Seamus Mallon said on a number of occasions, and which the then Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald came close to saying; it was not really joint authority but it was certainly a very considerable involvement. Because of a fundamental defect or flaw in the process, the flaw being the failure to secure if not the active agreement certainly the reluctant acquiescence of Unionist leaders and of the Unionist community, because of the total failure to achieve that, the Anglo-Irish Agreement has not been able to make progress.  It has not been able to get beyond what I have described as a kind of point of stagnation.</P>
    <P>The result in effect, if one stands back and looks at it, is that Northern Ireland is now administered, and continues to be administered, by the British Government under direct rule in a process of consultation with the Irish Government, so that the Irish Government play a kind of fringe role in direct rule of Northern Ireland.  The Irish Government in effect are becoming involved in a sort of neocolonialist approach to Northern Ireland, because we have to acknowledge that the majority of people in Northern Ireland do not want the Irish Government to <Col N="2055" /> have this role, the majority being the Unionist majority and, to some extent that Unionist majority are not just a Protestant population.  There is a certain proportion who are not Protestant but who are Unionist and there is also the Opposition from Sinn Féin and other elements of Nationalists who for different reasons do not support the role of the Irish Government because they see it as being a role in collaboration with the British Government and, therefore, totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>It is unfashionable to criticise the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  I am in a particular difficulty because I was very concerned at the time of the Hillsborough Agreement, and I resigned on the issue, being very strongly of the view at the time that the mix was not right, the approach was not right and it would not work. I have resisted to the best of my ability since then the desire to see my prognosis come true, if I can put it that way.  I have not wanted to be right on this.  I had hoped that my judgment was wrong.  I am increasingly concerned that the flaws which I pointed out at the time have become fatal to a particular process.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement, as I have said, has reached a level of stagnation and stopped, and it is not creating the basis for peace, stability and reconciliation. It probably is a much more acceptable formula to the Fianna Fáil Government because it gives the Irish Government some role within Northern Ireland, but it does not go the step further and create a whole structure of devolved government and a viable Northern Ireland State, a political unit bringing the two communities in Northern Ireland together.  Once it was realised that the Anglo-Irish Agreement was not going to do that, it becomes much easier to support the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  It then becomes a step out on the part of the British Government and a step in on behalf of the Irish Government in cooperating on direct rule in the North.</P>
    <P>If there is any substance in this analysis, and I am afraid there is a lot of substance <Col N="2056" /> in it, it explains why there is such a fractured situation on the ground in Northern Ireland.  There has been more polarisation between the two communities since the Anglo-Irish Agreement was adopted.  It is very unfortunate and it is not countered by the meetings between the two Governments' Ministers and officials.  On the ground, in communities there is more polarisation, more sectarian feeling and more violence resulting from it, whatever scale of measuring violence you want to use.  There is no doubt there has been a worrying increase in violence in the context of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>There has also been a lack of progress in the areas where it was felt at the time of Hillsborough that significant progress would be made.  There has been a lack of real progress on equality of opportunity and, indeed, the lack of real progress has been well tabulated by the report of the Standing Committee on Human Rights in Northern Ireland.  There has been a lack of reform of the administration of justice which would be a way of building confidence in the Nationalist community and creating a context for support from the Nationalist community for the forces of law and order &mdash; if that is what one wants to call them &mdash; and the administration of justice in the North.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons, I believe, at this stage for the lack of progress in some of these areas is that for the majority community, the Unionist community, the impulse for some of these reforms comes from a poisoned source.  They are exaggeratedly both critical and fearful of the whole Anglo-Irish process.  Whatever fears and aversions they had at the start have become deeply rooted and this pollutes the process of reform.  It makes it more difficult to have genuine reforms.</P>
    <P>I believe it would have been possible to make more progress in certain areas, particularly sensitive areas like the administration of justice, if there was not the dimension of the opposition to the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  In a way this difficulty has been highlighted by what was probably a not very helpful focus given to the balance which had been projected in the <Col N="2057" /> communique accompanying Hillsborough. At the time of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, as we know, there was a communique which referred expressly to the commitment by this part of the country to ratify the European Convention on terrorism and also referred in a related way, certainly it has been argued that the negotiations were done in a related way &mdash; to the necessity for reform of the administration of justice in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am now becoming more relevant, perhaps, to the background to this Bill. There was a balancing, on the one hand, that we would ratify the European Convention on terrorism and, on the other hand, that there would be progress in the administration of justice.  It is a pity that the manner of that progress was sort of focused in on the desirability of having three judge courts in Northern Ireland which suddenly became the issue, and the only issue, in relation to the reform of the administration of justice in Northern Ireland.  Perhaps because it was easy to get hold of; people could easily grasp the idea of three judges or one judge.  There are arguments on both sides.  There are also arguments about a three judge court.</P>
    <P>We have not really in this part of the country sufficiently analysed the roughly analogous court to the Diplock Courts, the Special Criminal Court.  There has been too little study and analysis of the Special Criminal Court.  I understand there is a major study being carried out at the moment and I hope that, when that study has been completed, the results will be published widely.  One factor about the Special Criminal Court worth seeing closely analysed is the fact that it is a three judge court at present &mdash; and, of course, it could be three military men or women as there is provision under the Constitution for a military court.</P>
    <P>It is a court of three members of the Judiciary but, they have been almost invariably from different levels in the court structure.  To a considerable extent the president of the court has been a judge of the High Court and he may sit with a Circuit Court judge and a district justice or he may sit with two district justices.  I doubt that they are genuinely <Col N="2058" /> three equals in the pecking order; it is very unlikely.  You have got a much less even distribution and exercise of the function by the three judges of the Special Criminal Court.  It is not as simple as saying that three are always necessarily better than one.  The point made in relation to the Diplock Courts that there is an automatic right of appeal to a court of appeal consisting of three judges who are three peer judges of the court of appeal is a reasonable response.</P>
    <P>The major issues that arise, in my view, in relation to the Diplock Courts, and they are serious issues, relate to the special rules of evidence that apply in the Diplock Courts and the very widespread use of the confession evidence &mdash; a much wider use of confession evidence than is present in the Special Criminal Court. That may itself be in part because of the role played by the Director of Public Prosecutions in relation to cases referred to the Special Criminal Court.  Nonetheless, it is significant.  I have seen some comparisons and there is no doubt that in a very significantly smaller number of cases before the Special Criminal Court the basic proofs were confession evidence. In a very high number, I have seen a figure of over 90 per cent in relation to the Diplock Courts, it is confession evidence.  Confession evidence means that people have volunteered a confession.</P>
    <P>That begs a certain question in the context of the Diplock Courts.  They are the real questions that have to be addressed. Because of the importance of the right of appeal there is also a very important question about any timelags between a conviction and the exercise of that right of appeal.  There were very serious timelags until comparatively recently, but I believe there has been some measure of improvement in relation to them.  A number of the steps proposed by Fr. Denis Faul would go a long way to establishing greater confidence in the administration of justice.  He is correct in calling for much greater use of early release for youngsters who are simply caught up in the situation and have spent already a period in jail.  A number of <Col N="2059" /> the specific measures he has called for warrant clear attention and would probably do more to create support from Nationalists for the system itself.</P>
    <P>We view this Bill against the background, that it was a commitment given at the time of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, an agreement that has not fulfilled its expectations, that has not stood still, that has, in fact, fallen to a lower level of operation and is to say the least of it, not achieving its major objective of creating peace and reconciliation between the communities in Northern Ireland.  Therefore, if there is going to be substantial progress it will be necessary to create a political framework for discussion of all of these issues, a discussion which involves the Unionist politicians and which primarily should be geared to getting the political parties in Northern Ireland and the church leaders and other leaders of the community there into a process of dialogue with a view to being able to create a framework for sharing power and responsibility in that community.</P>
    <P>I said I would begin in relation to this Bill by looking at the political dimension, and of all Bills it simply cannot be disregarded. We are not dealing with this subject in the abstract, we are not dealing with it for entirely internal and domestic reasons, we are dealing with it in the context in which it arose.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn now to the legal dimension of this Bill.  Just as I have confessed that I find it hard to take the Bill seriously politically for the reasons that have been advanced as opposed to the reasons I have identified, I also find it difficult to take it seriously legally.  Any lawyer is always interested in further safeguards.  It would be a strange lawyer who did not want to see genuine safeguards, genuine improvements, genuine monitoring and, therefore, there are parts of this Bill that I welcome.  There are useful safeguards, such as a requirement of an annual report on the Extradition Act procedure as a whole.  I am very glad to see that, it might well have been there from the beginning.  It is a <Col N="2060" /> very welcome development and similarly the safeguard against applying in the case of charges which arise out of incidences a considerable time ago the time bar issue. They are welcome developments.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to believe that the approach being adopted to the role being given to the Attorney General is one that actually has much tangible meaning.  This is my first observation before I go on to see whether it is constitutional and, if constitutional, whether it is desirable. Even if we go through all of these things, what the Attorney General is actually being asked to do is very difficult to do for reason I will come to.  Before I look at the role of the Attorney General I would make one plea to the Minister who is listening very patiently to this debate, and that is he might have regard to the fact that we will now have, once this Bill is passed by the Oireachtas, three very complex Bills.  We have the Extradition Act, 1965, the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, and we now have this Bill.  There is an inter-amendment in them all and let me put it this way, they become a lawyer's charter.  I do not think that extradition should be a lawyer's charter, it should be a reasonably clear codified document so that it can be very clear what the sections say and how they are to be interpreted.</P>
    <P>I now want to come to the role of the Attorney General and I want to look at it from two perspectives.  First, I want to look at this difficult issue of whether what the Attorney General is being charged with doing, given the responsibility for doing under this Bill, is the exercise of a judicial function.  Clearly if it is the Bill is certainly constitutionally unsafe and may well give rise to constitutional challenge. Having looked at that, I then propose to look at the question of whether, if this function is to be exercised, if it is politically, and in a policy way, desirable that it would be exercised by the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>I want to come first to the difficult and complex issue of whether in doing what he is being required or given the responsibility for doing under the Bill, the <Col N="2061" /> Attorney General would be exercising a judicial function.  The essence of what the Attorney General is doing is that he is directing that warrants will not be endorsed unless, and then he is saying unless, having considered such information as he deems appropriate &mdash; that is his first discretion; he has discretion as to what information he deems appropriate &mdash; he of opinion that two things are there; first that there is a clear intention to prosecute, or in the case of a prosecution already begun to continue a prosecution, a clear intention to prosecute the person named or described in the warrant for the offence specified therein in a place in relation to which the part applies &mdash; in other words Britain or Northern Ireland &mdash; and, second, that such intention is founded on the existence of sufficient evidence.  Before I come to whether that is a judicial function or not, is it possible for the Attorney General to actually do that?  I have some doubts.</P>
    <P>The formulation of the Attorney General's opinion requires that he has such information as he deems appropriate. What happens if he cannot get hold of enough information?  What is the information he would deem appropriate? Obviously he would require to have the warrant but what other information?  The Minister, when we come to Committee Stage, can tease out the parameters of the information that the Attorney General would deem appropriate.  Clearly he has a statutory discretion in that matter.  It is an unfettered discretion.  He cannot just have a whim about it but he certainly can determine under the proper application of the section the information which he would deem appropriate for the purpose. He then has to decide that there is a clear intention to prosecute and that the intention is founded on the existence of sufficient evidence.</P>
    <P>I found that very difficult to pin down precisely.  Does that mean the intention is bona fide?  Is it that there is a clear intention to prosecute and that the intention is bona fide?  Does the Irish Attorney General have to satisfy himself that there is the existence of sufficient evidence to secure a conviction?  It would be very <Col N="2062" /> difficult to have that as the matter on which he must satisfy himself.  Such intention is founded on the existence of sufficient evidence.</P>
    <P>What is the basis on which the Attorney-General can form that opinion?  In an important amendment in the other House in the course of the debate on this Bill, a further provision was added that the Attorney General can revoke a direction under the procedure.  Again that provides for a further exercise of discretion. If the Attorney General has assembled such information as he deems appropriate, has formed the opinion that there is a clear intention to prosecute and that the intention is founded on the existence of sufficient evidence and he directs that the warrant be endorsed and the Garda commissioner goes ahead and it comes before the District Court, the District Court deals with it, and then before the end of that process he changes his mind because some other evidence has come to light, what is the effect of that on the court process?  Again that would be very important to tease out.</P>
    <P>If the person has actually been extradited and then the Attorney General learns that after all there is some matter which leads him to believe that there is not the satisfaction of section 44 (a) and (b), being the intention to prosecute on the existence of sufficient evidence, does he then revoke his direction and does that negative the whole process as far as the Irish system is concerned, and if it does what effect does the Minister consider that that would have on the process before the British courts?</P>
    <P>It is obviously important on Committee Stage that we have an opportunity to examine these issues, but it does seem clear that the Attorney General considers and weighs evidence because he has to form an opinion as to the existence of sufficient evidence.  He has a discretion in what he is doing and it is a continuing discretion because he can revoke it; he can consider the matter again and revoke a direction.  These are the kinds of components, as the Minister is aware, that the courts consider in seeking to determine <Col N="2063" /> whether the exercise of a particular function constitutes the administration of justice. Having some familiarity with the authorities in this matter I would say it is an extremely difficult question, and not at all easy to apply to what is a very new kind of power and discretion which the Attorney General will have.</P>
    <P>Let us at least look at some of the cases that would be of relevance and the opinion formed by the court, the judgements that may be helpful.  First of all, as the Minister will be aware, in the Shannon <i>v.</i> Ireland case which is reported in <i>The Irish Reports, 1984,</i> the Supreme Court refused to find that the role of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána in relation to extradition warrants was the exercise of the administration of justice, that is the role of the commissioner under section 43 of the Extradition Act, 1965, in relation to endorsement of warrants, where the warrant has been issued and &ldquo;on production of the warrant to the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána it appears to the commissioner that the person named or described therein may be found in the State, the commissioner shall, subject to the provisions of this Part, endorse the warrant for execution.&rdquo; In the Shannon case, it was very forcefully and thoroughly argued that that gave the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána a judicial function in relation to the warrants, and that argument was rejected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I was quoting from section 43 of the Extradition Act, 1965, which is called the principal Act.  In some recent cases the Supreme Court has come back to this concept of the exercise of judicial power.  In a case The State (Lynch) <i>v.</i> Ballagh, <i>The Irish Reports, 1986,</i> page 203, the Supreme Court decided that the decision in granting bail was a judicial act because, and I quote from Mr. Justice Walsh in that case:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2064" /> A court has to determine the various matters which may be taken into consideration and exercise its discretion according to the law.</P>
    <P>Therefore, taking into account factors, making findings of fact, weighing evidence and exercising a discretion, while they are a conclusive statement are certainly components.</P>
    <P>Before I go on from The State (Lynch) <i>v.</i> Ballagh case, the Supreme Court, although it did not have this as a direct issue in the case, did refer to the powers of a peace commissioner.  Mr. Justice Walsh referred <i>obiter</i> to the functions of a peace commissioner as being in his view judicial in character and again he so characterised them because the relevant section purported to give to a peace commissioner and I quote:</P>
    <P>power to hear evidence, and, having heard the evidence, to exercise a discretion as to whether prisoners should be remanded in custody or on bail.  As Peace Commissioners in the exercise of these functions are not within the provisions of either Article 34 or Article 37, their position appears to be somewhat constitutionally dubious.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the matter was one which affected the liberty of the individual, whether they would be remanded in custody and therefore deprived of their liberty pending trial or whether they would be out on bail.  Again it is the power to have a decision-making role and exercise a discretion in relation to it.</P>
    <P>In a subsequent case the State (Clarke) <i>v.</i> Roche, which is reported at 1987 <i>Irish Law Reports Monthly</i>, page 309, the Supreme Court was concerned with the validity of a summons issued under section 11 of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851, and that section provided that either a District Court clerk or a peace commissioner would exercise the particular role, and the court viewed it as being akin to a judicial discretion before deciding whether or not to issue the summons. But, in fact, in that case the Supreme Court viewed the issuing of computer based summonses as not to <Col N="2065" /> conform with the requirements of section 11 of the 1851 Act, in that it bypassed the requirement that the District Court clerk should exercise his personal discretion as to whether or not the summons should issue.</P>
    <P>The issuing of a summons in that way is very much the initiation of a process. It is not a finding of anything.  It does not determine anything of a sort that actually affects the liberty or other rights of the individual.  It is peculiarly the commencement of a process but in that case the Chief Justice, on behalf of the Supreme Court, said that it was an &ldquo;inescapable conclusion&rdquo; from the terms of section 10 of the 1851 Act that the issue of a summons upon the making of a complaint was a judicial, as opposed to an administrative, act.  He pointed to the reference by Mr. Justice Walsh in The State (Lynch) <i>v.</i> Ballagh case and he doubted whether the vesting of such power in non-judicial personages, such as district court clerks or peace commissioners, was constitutionally proper. The Courts (No.3) Act, 1986, was passed to correct that constitutional infirmity.</P>
    <P>The case which should cause the Minister and the Government the greatest worry is the case of The State (Clarke) <i>v.</i> Roche. When a person makes a complaint and a summons is issued, the consequences are that a person is brought before a court and the whole process takes place.  If that has been characterised by the Supreme Court as a judicial rather than an administrative act, it is difficult to see a significant difference between the step taken in initiating the process of a summons, which is a judicial act under the Supreme Court decision of The State (Clarke) <i>v.</i> Roche and the discretion in relation to a direction which the Attorney General has.  The Attorney General must act within the terms of the statutory provision. That requires that warrants shall not be endorsed for execution if the Attorney General so directs, and he is mandated to so direct, unless, having considered such information as he deems appropriate, its sufficiency and the weight to be given to it, its relevance <i>et <Col N="2066" /> cetera</i>, he forms an opinion that there is a clear intention to prosecute this person for this offence in the part referred to and that such intention is founded on the existence of sufficient evidence.</P>
    <P>I take the point that it appears that the existence of sufficient evidence relates to the intention to prosecute but nonetheless it would seem to be a matter of weighing facts and assessing evidence before him and then exercising a discretion whether to issue the direction under section 44B.  If a direction is issued then the consequences for the individual are serious because it then starts a process which will lead to the person being extradited, even though there is recourse to a court, unless there is some other ground which can be invoked by the individual. It is necessary to bear in mind the implications of the exercise of the function.</P>
    <P>Given that the Attorney General can issue a direction and can revoke the direction, it is difficult to draw a clear distinction between that and the exercise of the district court clerk or peace commissioner in the function of issuing a summons under the State clerk.  In so far as the Supreme Court characterised the issuing of a summons as being a judicial act and not an administrative one, it would seem that there is a considerable doubt as to the constitutionality of this role for the Attorney General.  However, the difficulty in following through on an opinion in relation to the role of the Attorney General is that if this was to be permanent legislation and, there was no further opportunity for consideration of it, then there would be a very strong case for having it referred to the Supreme Court for determination on that issue because the prior case law of the Supreme Court would seem to make it extremely arguable.  I know that legal opinion is divided on it.  Deputy John Kelly has expressed a different view and I have great respect for his view in this area.  I also know that a number of other constitutional experts whom I also respect are of the firm view that it is constitutionally unsound or infirm and, therefore, it would normally be a case where it would be appropriate for the <Col N="2067" /> matter to be referred to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill which lasts for a year and then lapses unless it is renewed.  In those circumstances, if the President took the step of referring it to the Supreme Court under Article 26, half the year would be gone by the time there was a conclusion on it.  The only fairly likely option in the matter is that on the first occasion when the Attorney General comes to exercise the power a challenge will be brought to the exercise of that power.  If that happens it is safe to say that it would be likely to take more than a year for the proceedings to wend their way from the High Court to the Supreme Court. Therefore, from a legal point of view it is difficult to know how seriously to treat this Bill which has been characterised as being of such great importance.</P>
    <P>I have been dealing with the constitutional and legal nature of the discretion being exercised by the Attorney General in issuing a direction under this Bill.  On balance my view would be that it is not distinguishable from The State (Roche) <i>v.</i> Kelly judgement and, therefore, if that is being characterised as a judicial act it is open to challenge.  There is a sufficient doubt about it to mean that it is almost certain to be litigated.  It seems foolish to have an important provision in our extradition law that is almost certain to land up either by reference by the President under Article 26 or because my friend, Paddy McEntee, or one of his colleagues, has been instructed to bring proceedings or to argue a case before the High Court or Supreme Court.  That does not seem to be a very secure ground on which to base our extradition law given how sensitive the whole area is and given the passions that it can arouse.</P>
    <P>The other point which I wanted to comment on, apart from the constitutional and legal issues, was whether it was politically desirable and appropriate that the discretion would be exercised by the Attorney General.  I share the view that has been widely put forward by representatives of a number of political parties in the other House, and also by other <Col N="2068" /> commentators, that it would be preferable that this discretion should be exercised, if it is constitutionally sound, by a person in an independent statutory position where they were not perceived to be, as the Attorney General is, the legal adviser to the Government, a political appointment and necessarily closely linked to any particular Government.  We are talking not about personalities in any sense but about what is the appropriate framework and the appropriate mechanism. It is not a case of saying that only the Attorney General can do this for X or Y reasons.  Nobody is saying that.  The Attorney General has been chosen by the Government to be the person, not because he has to be, but because the Government have chosen him.</P>
    <P>The amendment introduced in the Dáil to provide a similar provision to one in the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974, that no representations can be made and that it is an offence to make representation to the Attorney General takes some of the worry and heat out of the issue as to whether the Attorney General would be subject to political and other representations.  It still does not remove the undesirability of having a person in the position of the Attorney General exercising a function in this area. When there is an alternative, when the Director of Public Prosecutions exists and fulfils comparable functions and can exercise this function with the interests of this country at heart, I cannot see why it must be the Attorney General who performs this function.  I cannot see the merit in disregarding genuine concerns and the genuine view that it is much better to have this kind of direction or certification given by somebody who is statutorily unable to receive any representation from anybody who must be independent in the exercise of his functions.</P>
    <P>If the Government could say the only person who can do this is the Attorney General and that is why they decided the Attorney General should do it, that would be a different argument and the argument could be faced, but that is not the case.  The Government have simply <Col N="2069" /> said: &ldquo;The Attorney General is the most appropriate person and we are determined it will be the Attorney General.&rdquo; That is not a sustainable argument because the Attorney General is not the most appropriate person precisely because of the role played by the Attorney General, the manner of appointment of the Attorney General and the relationship between the Attorney General and the Government. Those are cogent reasons why he is not the most appropriate person and, as the functions can be adequately and completely fulfilled by an alternative existing office-holder, namely, the Director of Public Prosecutions, it would be prudent and it would be better for the optics&mdash; that current topical word &mdash; if it was the Director of Public Prosecutions who was exercising the function.  This would improve the structure.</P>
    <P>That is my argument on the question of whether the Attorney General is the appropriate person, but obviously that is affected to some extent by my view that the power given to the Attorney General may be constitutionally infirm.  Our extradition law is becoming a lawyer's charter.  I envisage that this new procedure will be likely to be challenged at an early stage in our courts.  The Act itself, when it comes into operation, provides that it will lapse within a year.  If not renewed it may lapse for other resons before that year is out or if it is renewed within whatever period it takes to get a final decision from the courts it may lapse after that.  It is difficult, at the end of the day, to really feel that the whole measure is that important.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act came into operation.  We have ratified it.  We need to be concerned and we need to be vigilant about our extradition procedures. We need to be very concerned and continue to be concerned about the administration of justice either in Northern Ireland or in Britain in so far as it affects Irish people.  The major thrust of the concern would be better employed in highlighting cases where injustice has <Col N="2070" /> been done or it is believed that it has been done and ensuring that people who are the victims of injustice have support and recourse to higher tribunal in that regard seeking to put forward under the Anglo-Irish Agreement deeper and more significant reforms of the Diplock Courts than have been highlighted publicly up to now in an attempt genuinely to improve the administration of justice in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The debate on extradition becomes more and more unreal, both at the political and the legal level, as times go on.  We should be concerned.  Extraditing citizens from a country is always a very serious matter.  I have grave doubts about whether this Bill is either politically or legally a positive contribution but it certainly will give a field day to the lawyers in due course.</P>

      <P>Before I go into what I am about to say on the Bill, perhaps at this stage it might be necessary for me to respond very briefly to some points Senator Robinson made in the earlier part of her contribution on what she referred to as the political aspect of the Bill.  I found her emphasis on what she perceived to be Fianna Fáil dissent in this matter somewhat churlish.  I fail to grasp Senator Robinson's point.  Is she suggesting, for example, that valid political objections are somehow less valid because they are discussed and debated within the context of the party Whip? Of course Senator Robinson has had her own difficulties in accepting party discipline and I can understand her difficulty in understanding the <i>modus operandi</i> of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party process. I was surprised by her comments as I understood that Senator Robinson was passionately opposed to the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  Indeed, so much so that she resigned from the Labour Party.  Be that as it may&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as a Member on the Government side of the House, I felt I <Col N="2071" /> could not allow Senator Robinson to make unfounded allegations.  I compliment the Minister for Justice, the Taoiseach and indeed, the Government, on coming up with a formula which I hope will be acceptable to all sides of the House.  Extradition of a citizen is a very serious matter and perhaps it is worth defining what extradition is.  It entails the physical removal of a person from this State to custody abroad, there to be subject to enforced custody awaiting trial, interrogation, delay and, perhaps thereafter, conviction and imprisonment in a foreign country.  The conditions experienced by an extradited person to a foreign jurisdiction are different from the experiences in one's own country.  It is this aspect of the extradition process that I would wish to address.</P>
      <P>I support the proposed role of the Attorney General in the Bill.  I am pleased that the Minister has clarified the position of the Attorney General by pointing out that, as the Attorney General is currently responsible for representing the State in extradition cases, the additional responsibilities envisaged in this Bill are complementary to his traditional role.  I find it difficult to understand the criticism expressed by the Government of the United Kingdom that this proposal will somehow inhibit the processing of extradition warrants.</P>
      <P>With regard to a debate which has been continuing in the British House of Lords over the past couple of weeks and months on a Criminal Justice Bill of which extradition is a central plank, it might be of information to the House to know that the provisions and the proposals which the British Government are making in relation to extradition will result in most of the power being concentrated in the hands of the Secretary of State.  In other words, it is a very political appointment. Many of the Lords during the debate pointed out their concern in that particular area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that we in this country can point to the independence of the Attorney General irrespective of the party that appointed him and irrespective of the <Col N="2072" /> Government he serves.  From that point of view I do not have any real objections to the Attorney General taking on this additional role.  I can see Senator Robinson's point that perhaps in this context it will prove something of a field day for lawyers.  Be that as it may, I do not think it is the function of this House to anticipate the legal interpretations which will be put on the Bill when enacted.  That would be for another time.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has said that the purpose of the arrangements is to eliminate as far as possible the opportunity for requests being refused on technical grounds.  In that context, with all due respect to our honourable friends across the Irish Sea, that my confidence would rest with our Minister for Justice rather than with the Prime Minister of Great Britain.  The concession to extradite one's citizens to another jurisdiction is a serious matter.  It is incumbent on this State to ensure that once the extradition warrant has been issued by the requesting State that we have confidence in the police and judicial system of that country. Also, we must be concerned that the custody of our citizens is in keeping with civilised standards of treatment and behaviour as practised by developed democracies.  We must also concern ourselves that the subsequent trial process is held in an atmosphere conducive to a fair trial, especially a trial by jury.</P>
    <P>It is fair to suggest that the vast majority of our citizens would not object to an extradition request from nearly all the member states of the EC.  I say nearly all because of the controversy surrounding this Bill, and the debate on the ratification of the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, centres around the extradition specifically of Irish citizens to the United Kingdom.  The desire of our people to insist on the best possible safeguards against the extradition of any of our citizens to a system in which I, for one, do not have the fullest confidence is a perfectly natural aspiration.  Indeed, our British friends raised doubts about the integrity of the Belgian police and their judicial system when warrants were <Col N="2073" /> issued by the Belgian authorities for the extradition of United Kingdom citizens to their jurisdiction for heinous crimes allegedly committed at the Heysel Stadium some years ago.  The concern of many people in Britain about the treatment of their citizens is best described by quoting from a speech by Lord Irvine of Lairg, a Scots Peer, during a debate on the United Kingdom's Criminal Justice Bill in the House of Lords.  I quote from <i>Hansard,</i> 14 July 1987, col. 952:</P>
    <P>The tragedy at the Heysel Stadium raised the strongest public feelings in Belgium, and naturally so.  But since Belgium is one of the countries for which we can expect an Order in Council doing away with the <i>prima facie</i> requirements, I submit that public opinion in this country would be utterly opposed to a law which allowed Belgium, in a case where there is such strong public feeling in Belgium, to have extradition on demand of those British citizens whom it would have to do no more than identify and name, as well as specify the crime alleged; that is, manslaughter.</P>
    <P>It sounds familiar.  It sounds familiar to people in this country.  Indeed, it sounds familiar to me in the context of cases before the British courts.  Lord Irvine went on to mount a passionate argument against the proposal to remove the <i>prima facie</i> requirement.  What was revealing about the debate was that in removing the <i>prima facie</i> requirement, a requirement I might add which was not included in our 1965 Extradition Act, the British proposal in to have a requirement that an Order in Council be made; even they are treading cautiously in processing extradition requests.  As Lord Irvine put it, and I quote again from the same speech:</P>
    <P>The procedure is subtly designed to suggest that the only relevant question will then be whether the legal system of the country in question can be trusted. Therefore, is it not correct and proper for the Republic of Ireland, acting as a sovereign independent State, to take whatever steps it feels are necessary to <Col N="2074" /> protect the rights of its citizens when extradited?</P>
    <P>The proposal in the Criminal Justice Bill to change the British process of extradition and do away with the <i>prima facie</i> evidence happens only to those states in which the British Government believe that the system of justice is fair and a system in which they have confidence.  It does not apply to all countries.  Indeed an Order in Council will be required if this Bill passes before Britain will extradite without a <i>prima facie</i> case to a particular country requesting it.</P>
    <P>I listened to my colleague, Senator Ferris, with some interest.  He referred to the Birmingham Six.  I must confess I found it difficult to conclude whether Senator Ferris, in his heart, believed in the innocence of the six or whether he had full confidence in the British Court of Appeal's process to the point that he will accept that ruling even if it goes against the men.  I must say, and I am not bound by <i>sub judice</i> rules in this country in relation to that case, I do not believe the Court of Appeal process inspires confidence and not just as it applies to Irish citizens.  The tradition of Court of Appeal process in Britain is against conceding or admitting mistakes of the past.  However, if Senator Ferris believes that the Court of Appeal, being the ultimate arbiter in this case, and the decision that they take is the correct and right one, then he and I might have to part on that point.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris went on to refer to me specifically in relation to a motion before this House some months ago.  I have not publicly commented on my motives in putting down the motion that Senator Ferris referred to but I now intend to do so.  For some years past I in common with many other people in this country and indeed Irish people living in Britain and those who are concerned about civil liberties in Britain not necessarily Irish have been concerned about the treatment experienced by Irish citizens who find themselves caught up in the British police and judicial process on terrorist or terrorist-related offences.  A prominent Labour MP, Mr. Chris Mullin, who wrote the book <i>Error of Judgement</i> subtitled <Col N="2075" />&ldquo;The True Story of the Birmingham Six&rdquo; said that when it comes to Irish citizens exposed to the British judicial system on terrorist or terrorist-related charges they just throw away the rule book.</P>
    <P>As a newly elected Member I took the earliest possible opportunity to place on record this widespread concern expressed.  The moves to ratify the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act without safeguards caused me and many others deep concern.  I utilised the procedures of this House to give likeminded Members an opportunity to share that expression of concern.  Subsequently, I was pleased to receive assurances that the Government were similarly concerned and would bring forward proposals they were confident would be acceptable to the Dáil and Seanad and to the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>Several months later following the withdrawal of that motion voluntarily by me I believe the Government have gone a long way in satisfying those concerns by the contents of the Bill now before the House.  However, I am still concerned about what would happen to extradited Irish citizens once they leave this jurisdiction. While the cases of the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and the Maguire family were not as a result of an extradition warrant, they do impinge on the current debate in so far as treatment is concerned.  Statements of fact on the appalling treatment meted out to the 17 people during their pre-trial custody and the immediate aftermath of their trial and conviction are not contested even by the British Judiciary.  They raise serious questions about the attitudes of the British police and prison authorities towards Irish people in their official care.  Even if the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and the Maguire family are all guilty as charged, I cannot accept that the manner in which they were treated by the British police and prison authorities is acceptable behaviour for any civilised country.</P>
    <P>I can understand the emotive reactions of a police force and public generated by the carnage of Birmingham, Woolwich, <Col N="2076" /> Guildford and the other locations in Britain at the time of the bombing outrages of the seventies but does that justify this capitulation of those in authority to the law of the jungle?  I think not.  That was 1974, 13 years ago, during a time when bombs were going off all over Britain or so the argument goes.  There has to be a realisation of what the British police and people were experiencing at that time in order to try to understand, and in the eyes of some people perhaps justify the behaviour of which I speak. However, such treatment is still being meted out to Irish citizens even as I speak.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer specifically to the position of Miss Martina Shanahan from Rathfarnham in County Dublin, an Irish citizen arrested and charged along with two other Irish citizens, Finbar Cullen and John McCann, on 30 August of this year and remanded in custody on a charge of conspiracy to murder Mr. Tom King, the Secretary for State for Northern Ireland.  I refer to it in the context of Miss Shanahan's category A status as a remand prisoner at Risley Remand Centre in Cheshire.  Miss Shanahan is the only female category A remand prisoner in the United Kingdom.  In other words, she is deemed by the Home Office in Britain to be more dangerous than even Myra Hinley, the Moors murderer.  Miss Shanahan has had no previous convictions before courts either in this country, in Britain or anywhere else.  She is 22 years of age.  Her incarceration at Risley Remand Centre makes appalling reading.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to those conditions in the context of the debates now taking place on the extradition of citizens to the British jurisdiction.  Since her arrest Miss Shanahan has spoken to no one at Risley except her family for one hour visits over the past number of weeks.  They have to travel from Dublin overnight by ferry to visit her once a week.  They are a family of limited means and they travel because Miss Shanahan does not have conversation with any other human being if they do not travel. Miss Shanahan is prohibited from any <Col N="2077" /> contact with any other prisoner.  When she leaves her cell once a day for exercise which entails walking around an empty prison ground, all other prisoners are cleared from the exercise yard.  Miss Shanahan has kept a log of her exercise periods during October and November and during the month of October she was denied even that one hour exercise for 15 days out of the month, while during the month of November Miss Shanahan was denied that one hour exercise period for 18 days out of the month.  When she did try on one occasion to look out of the window of her cell at other prisoners exercising she was told that was forbidden.</P>

I think it is fair and relevant that I should inform the House of the treatment that is being meted out to an Irish citizen, albeit not one who has been extradited but who has been charged with the type of offence which this particular Bill concerns itself with an indeed the type of offence that ultimately will be used if extradition requests are received from Britain.</P>

      <P>I accept your ruling.  I will conclude on the specifics of it.  It has not been made public before.  I felt it was important that it should be in as unemotional and dispassionate way as I can muster.  Miss Shanahan's solicitor, an English woman, Mrs. Gareth Pierce, said that in her experience of dealing with Irish citizens who have been charged with terrorist or terrorist-related offences, it is impossible for any Irish prisoner charged <Col N="2078" /> with such an offence to be considered on his or her own merits for the determination of prison conditions.</P>
      <P>I might add that Miss Shanahan has given no indication to the prison authorities that she is a violent prisoner. Indeed, she is clearly a polite, well-behaved and very pleasant young women who is a model prisoner.  I will not dwell any further on the conditions attached to Miss Shanahan's incarceration but having the Minister for Justice here I felt that it was important he should hear at first hand and that also it should be placed on the record of the House.</P>
      <P>May I finally say about her particular case that Miss Shanahan has not been convicted of any charge.  She is a remand prisoner and in the eyes of the law is innocent until proven otherwise.  The conditions of which I speak could continue for a period of up to 12 months.  I plead with the Minister to use whatever influences he can to ensure that Miss Shanahan's condition is at least alleviated. I am sure he would agree with me that one would not treat a dog the way she is being treated.</P>
      <P>There are several other examples of inhuman treatment of Irish prisoners at the hands of callous prison authorities in Britain.  The position of Irish prisoners in Wakefield Prison is notorious and the people who suffer the most are the families of these prisoners.  Therefore, I again ask the Minister to convey to the Government a request I have made at another time that an official be appointed to the Irish Embassy in London to monitor, on a full time basis, the conditions under which Irish prisoners are being held in British jails.</P>

      <P>I have to report to this House, reluctantly I might add, that the perception of the role of our embassy in London among those helping to alleviate the conditions of Irish prisoners in British jails is not a good one.  There is a suggestion that the embassy is more concerned with maintaining cordial relations with the Home Office rather than bringing to <Col N="2079" /> their attention on a continuous basis cases such as those which I have outlined.  It is in that context that I am proposing the appointment of such an official.</P>
      <P>I should like to inform the House that the Federal Republic of West Germany has such an official based in their London embassy and British embassies abroad routinely visit all of their nationals held in custody in foreign jails and see to their welfare irrespective of their crime.  I make that emphasis because there are some people in this country who believe that because prisoners in Britain have been convicted of a particular crime they do not deserve basic human rights.  I am sad to relate that according to my information the role of our senior embassy in this area of continuous monitoring of the conditions of Irish prisoners has been sadly lacking.  It is to correct this situation that I am strongly pressing on the Government in the context of the debate they appoint a suitably qualified person as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I feel that the allegations being made against the embassy staff in London are totally unwarranted and I believe them to be untrue.  I would like to say to the Senator that, if he persists in making these allegations, perhaps he should arrange for a meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs to discuss this with him so that somebody there who is very familiar with what is going on can deal with such very wild, exaggerated and dangerous accusations.</P>

      <P>In conclusion I wish to put on record my reservations about the British system of justice as it applies to Irish citizens.  However, I am proud that an Irish Government have stated unambiguously that if extradition is to be continued it will be according to Irish rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish for warm and friendly relations between our two Governments but on a basis of equal respect.  It is past time that we in this country refused to accept the xenophobia of the British people without protest.  If we have no respect for our citizens when they are delivered up to another jurisdiction and do not protect their basic human rights we can hardly expect Britain or any other country to honour and respect our Irishness and our separate identity as a nation.  Lest anyone should misinterpret my remarks today let me clearly and unequivocally state my total abhorrence of violence as a means of uniting this country.  Yes, I am a republican but I was reared in a tradition of parliamentary democracy, a tradition I am proud to uphold and protect as a Member of this honoured House.  Calling for the rights of our citizens abroad to be protected has nothing to do with terrorism but everything to do with human <Col N="2081" /> rights.  So long as I have breath in my body I will champion that cause.</P>
    <P>Once again I compliment the Government on coming up with the proposals contained in this Bill.  It was an exercise in tightrope walking that would do justice to the best of that profession.  Let us hope that when we look back on this debate we will not regret its consequences but all of us will have the opportunity of coming back to the House 12 months hence and reviewing how the Bill has been operating.

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to preface my remarks on the Bill by saying that Labour is not soft on terrorism but we are concerned that justice is not only confined to most areas of the law but to all areas of <Col N="2082" /> the law.  History shows that we are very consistent in matters of law, in trying to protect the innocent.  That goes no matter what the investigation is.  In order for us to deliver on this attitude of ours we seek to ensure that no Irish citizen will be extradited unless there is a case to answer and that hearings on the matter of extradition should take place before a judge in open court so as to afford the defendant the opportunity to challenge the warrant or the <i>prima facie</i> evidence.  We are at a loss to know what is wrong with the supplying of a book of evidence.  It is not a book of evidence that we want to sell on O'Connell Street or on O'Connell Bridge or to publish in our daily papers. We need it for a real reason and that reason is to prove why an Irish citizen has a case to answer in another jurisdiction. That is no less than is required by many other states.  In this respect the United Kingdom has not given up their right in that particular area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our own Government when in Opposition in 1975 opposed bitterly the criminal law jurisdiction legislation because they felt it was drastic emergency legislation and the question posed by the present Government, when they were in Opposition, was whether a democracy can invoke drastic emergency legislation and still remain a democracy.  The questions now posed by the Labour Party on this matter is if it is not a drastic step in legislating to give to a person who attends Cabinet meetings, that is to say the Attorney General, some of the power and authority normally reserved for the judiciary; is it not a drastic move to allow a person who attends Cabinet meetings to take on a function that could lead to the disbandment of the natural division of Government from the judiciary by simple evolving legislation?  Supreme Court judges understand their role in seeing that the State laws do not contravene the word and spirit of our Constitution and up to now we have made no effort to restrict the power of the Supreme Court in these matters.  I do not want to suggest that this Bill offers a challenge to that role because my belief is that the Bill will be tested in the Supreme Court one way <Col N="2083" /> or another.  If it is not referred to it by the President before signature, the first case under it will be tested.  I believe the latter will be the case.  The point I am trying to make is that there will be as many interpretations of what the Attorney General's power is in this matter as there are lawyers in the country. This being the case the safer road to travel is the one of <i>prima facie</i> where the many lawyers would have to deal with the evidence presented to them rather than have a ball at the Attorney General's and the Government's expense.  I suggest that the decision by the Government to give such power and authority to a person who attends Cabinet meetings, namely the Attorney General, is a dangerous road to travel because, I repeat, the precedent that upsets the division between Government and judiciary is not a good precedent and who is to say that it cannot be extended irrespective of the good will of the present Government, that it cannot be changed by other Governments or other people in the Fianna Fáil Government?  As far as we are concerned in the Labour Party every citizen has a right to a law that has checks and restraints.  If you remove a function which rightly belongs to the courts and give it to an attender at Cabinet meetings, I believe you automatically remove these checks and restraints in their full sense and it is only when they are there in their fullest sense that every citizen can be given the protection to which he is entitled.</P>
    <P>It may well be argued that there are safeguards in the Bill before us.  I doubt if they could be described as totally effective checks and restraints in the sense that one process will be openly displayed by the courts but the other will be a sealed-in thing.  I do not think the checks and restraints will be there.  I am a little puzzled as to why we got away so fast from the <i>prima facie</i> concept since Britain still holds on to it.  I must say that, like the others, I view the British system of justice as it applies to Irish men and women not in a vitriolic way or with hatred but I have to look at it with a <Col N="2084" /> jaundiced eye.  I am certainly not anti-British. I am anything but that.  Therefore, I am all the more concerned, since Britain holds fast to this <i>prima facie</i> idea, about our safeguards for the innocent. We must see that they exist.  There is a little bit of hypocrisy there on the part of the British Government.  They want, on the one hand, to retain their own right to <i>prima facie</i> evidence in matters of extradition and, at the same time, they want to make sure we do not give any more protection to the citizen who may face a hostile court or a hostile press or something else that might jeopardise his chances of being acquitted if he is innocent.</P>
    <P>It is an extraordinary thing that the British have a requirement with every country except Ireland for <i>prima facie</i> evidence before they extradite their citizens. It is also interesting to know the UK have not signed the 1965 European Convention precisely because they wanted to keep their own <i>prima facie</i> requirement.  Their attitude seems to be that what is good enough for others is not good enough for them.  However, we are talking about our citizens and what we should do in the best interests of our citizens without British interference. What I am worried about is that if the proposal becomes law it would appear to many of the Irish public as an abdication on the part of the Government of their duty to defend the rights of Irish men and women both at home and abroad.  That is not a nice thing to have going about.</P>
    <P>The Bill has not provided the required and, to some extent, even the minimum safeguards for Irish citizens before they are extradited.  It proposes an unacceptable non-judicial forum which amounts to a gross perversion of our judicial process.  We call ourselves a Republic but we have not got around to a truly republican criminal justice system and we have a contradictory attitude to terrorism in support of this position.  I would point out that extradition within the United Kingdom is still conducted much as it was prior to the limited independence we now enjoy.  It is a simple endorsement of warrants and arrests. The history of our extradition procedures <Col N="2085" /> demonstrates our unwillingness to construct an indigenous truly republican system of justice.</P>
    <P>With regard to the British Prime Minister, she first made allegations when the issue was starting to come before the Dáil.  Obviously that did not help proceedings and it certainly got the backs up of certain people.  What make sit worse, of course, was that she was both wrong in detail and she was also wrong in the sense that it had an effect on the debate. It was a gross interference in the procedures of our sovereign Parliament.  She might have been better occupied I think in looking back to the defective warrants and the defective procedures that were used by her own security people in matters of extradition rather than attacking the Government when they were in the process of putting this Bill through.  I would not like anyone in this House or in the other House to stand up and attack something that was going on in the House of Commons.  It is wrong and she had better be told that.</P>
    <P>What I am worried about most of all is I think that they seem to want us to take an attitude that they themselves have. For example, when the question of McGlinchey arose the attitude was: &ldquo;Don't we all know he is guilty?&rdquo;  This would seem to be the British mentality and I think they would like us to adopt that mentality also.  We cannot adopt that attitude.  In fact, we went very very far indeed in the Coalition Government between 1973 and 1977.  There was a package of legislation brought in covering all aspects of law but particularly having regard to dealing with the question of cooperating with the Brits in the sense of dealing with the matter of terrorists coming before justice, that is to say the guilty ones.  We almost suspended on those occasions Article 40 of the Constitution. We did not quite get around to it but we very nearly did.  We asked the Garda and our Army to associate themselves with the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Bill, 1975, and we introduced in that Bill a very general debate which covered civil rights in a wide sense.</P>
    <P>We certainly did a lot with regard to <Col N="2086" /> improving the relationship between the two States.  Even though we were not just doing it for Britain alone, at the same time, they were to be the main beneficiaries. We introduced a Bill on that occasion that contained many paradoxes and affected civil liberties in our own country in the sense that it was wide and was merely part of a package.</P>
    <P>I do not know how far you can go.  I can understand the reaction to the cynical and barbaric situations that arise out of terrorism and the bloody-mindedness of people who perpetrate these atrocities.  I can understand the feeling when somebody abandons a briefcase and blows people to kingdom come.  I can understand that person can be permanently damaged by opening an envelope.  I can understand the reaction to what happened at Brighton, in the Abercorn case, at Harrods and Enniskillen.  The situation was equally bad when one thinks that in the case of Harrods they were dealing with children being brought to see Santa Claus; the timing was deliberate and was carried out with very clear minds.  The only reason that was not followed up with further atrocities of the same nature was because it was not a success in the sense that the public turned against them and it generally backfired.</P>
    <P>You can understand the feelings we have here, the revulsion we feel at the sectarian killings.  We can understand the car bomb, somebody putting a backup detonator in it so that when there is an attempt to defuse it, if the building is not damaged it will get the people who are trying to defuse it.  We can understand all of that, and have the greatest sympathy for the victims and be very condemnatory in our attitude to it.  It is an easily understood emotion but in the final analysis our job &mdash; not the job of Britain or anyone else &mdash; is to protect Irish citizens in the first instance.  If somebody has to be extradited into Ireland he will have got the protection of his Government and the procedures laid down to justify bringing people into this country to be tried.  That would all have been provided for them by their own Governments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2087" /> Therefore, it is our Government who are concerned and our Government have not only dealt with the whole question of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act and another package of measures to assist in the matter of curbing terrorism but we are also participating in the suppression of terrorism with 35 other states, and they go from Austria to the Soviet Republics. They not only condemn terrorism internally but they condemn international terrorism and they describe it as endangering or taking innocent human lives.  We are in league with most of the countries on the question of human rights and fundamental freedoms.  There are certain areas of human rights which we have not put right ourselves yet, but I am not talking about that; I am dealing mainly with the area of dealing with terrorism, and people who commit crimes and sufficient evidence exists for them to be tried in other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>We can understand that resolute measures have to be taken by us to combat terrorism.  Quite frankly, I cannot see where the <i>prima facie</i> provision would not satisfy all needs.  After all, if the evidence is there that somebody should be brought to justice or put on trial for terrorism or other crimes, then so be it. All of the things we have done would not fall by the wayside, they would still be in existence; they would not be put to one side.  The Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act would still be there; it has not been repealed as yet.  The whole matter of our being involved with 35 other nations in the suppression of terrorism would not be put to one side and our expression of determination to take measures for the suppression of terrorism would not be put to one side, nor would the amount of money we spend on security etc. be put to one side if we wanted a <i>prima facie</i> case established before we extradite people.  It would not stop us from making sure that people refrain from indirect or direct assistance to terrorists or subversives of any description or to other activities designed to overthrow regimes of another participating State.</P>
    <P>I, frankly, cannot understand, when it <Col N="2088" /> comes to the question of protecting your own, why we do not look at the way other nations protect their nationals.  We are quite entitled to do it.  We are in the business of looking for fundamental freedoms: we are in the business of peace, justice and well-being; we are not trying to take away from anyone else and we have, in fact, by the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the Laws we have introduced and the money we spend on security, lessened the tension between Ireland and Great Britain.  I think we have strengthened stability.  We are in a situation where there is a viable and lasting arrangement and by which we will in fact have a viable and lasting attitude towards dealing with our problems by peaceful means in the future.</P>
    <P>All the measures I have mentioned here were designed to increase confidence in the security we have.  We have the right, if we have achieved all those things, to say to anybody, no matter who they are that a citizen is a citizen, whether he be a McGlinchey, an O'Toole or any other person and he should not be exposed to trial unless there is sufficient evidence produced to our judiciary to establish that he will in fact be put on trial if extradited.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Attorney General, another worrying feature, to my mind is that it is a kind of a partial trial because it is not in the open.  I do not know what the procedure will be; I do not know whether in fact the Attorney General who attends the meetings will have to sit down and tell the Cabinet what is happening.  Therefore I am a little puzzled about all this, whether he will weigh up the evidence and make up his mind. It is a partial trial when somebody goes before the courts anyway but at least that partial trial is to weigh the <i>prima facie</i> evidence.  If there is evidence given to the Attorney General and if it is not <i>prima facie</i> evidence then, one can say, if the Attorney General makes a decision that the person should be extradited, that what has happened is that there has been a partial trial of an Irish citizen who did not have the right to challenge.  That is a tremendous denial of a human right and <Col N="2089" /> it is heading in the direction of the Government taking on a function which is at present reserved for the Judiciary.  I would like to understand more about the rights of citizens to challenge warrants and what, if any, sort of accessibility to the courts defendants will have or what redress will be available to them?  If there is redress, will it come too late or what will be the situation?  I am not so sure myself about the whole thing.  The safest way for me to put it is that the ordinary working-class people of both Britain and Ireland would more readily understand it if one of their fellow beings were brought before a court and all the evidence that could be built up was there against him and that there would be an assessment of his position by a trained court in the open. Then, and only then, the Irish and the ordinary English citizen would be happy that this person was being dealt with in a fair and just way.  The main thing about it would be the fact that he had the right to redress in open court and the right to challenge.</P>
    <P>A further worrying feature about it is that we had problems in the trade union movement down through the years.  Laws change, Governments change, people in Government take different roads; different things happen, things evolve.  Change is a thing in itself, Therefore, it is ongoing and this means that somebody is going to get an idea along the line that perhaps he is not happy with the trade union movement or some other body.  I will pick the trade union movement as it is the largest and most widespread in that sense.  In the course of trying to deal with the Acts that cover trade unions this question of Cabinet power and authority exercised through the Attorney General, or some other person, might become more or a reality than we realise.</P>
    <P>We have had difficult situations in the trade union movement.  We have had various instances down through the years. One will remember the educational company, the Irish Union of Distributive Workers, etc.  One will remember the problems regarding what is now the Marine Port and General Workers' Union.  I cannot remember the name of <Col N="2090" /> the case.  I think it was the Irish Seaman's Union.  There were difficulties in all of these areas.  Very difficult judgments had to be made and I am always fearful when dealing with the question of something going to extremes and having to be dealt with.  For example, someone might consider it very extreme to have secondary picketing if the picketing got out of hand. We saw what happened in England. There are these dangers; so, naturally we are concerned about them and naturally we are concerned when we are talking about citizens.  Whether a person is a trade union member or a person who is suspected of being a terrorist, as long as he is a citizen and is on this side of the water, he is entitled to all the protection the law can afford.  The best protection he can be given is the right to have <i>prima facie</i> evidence presented against him and a right to challenge it.</P>
    <P>Somebody mentioned the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I have nothing against the Director of Public Prosecutions as such.  There is a degree of secrecy surrounding that office which does not make people very happy &mdash; often it is the other way round.  People want to know why the Director of Public Prosecutions did not prosecute people, why he did not let trials go on.  There is no way any citizen has any right to know why a trial did not go on, or even get information about it.  I would not be hung up on the idea that the Director of Public Prosecutions would be a better choice in this instance, because that office &mdash; not the person &mdash; by its very nature has caused confusion in the minds of many people.  We are inclined to think of people being able to read, that everybody has a good education and can understand everything.  That is not always so.  People can be confused and are confused.  Anybody who goes into any of the pubs and hears a debate starting will know that some of the ideas expressed are amazing. The beliefs people hold are astonishing. Sometimes they may not have a detailed argument about it but the reaction is that, if the Director of Public Prosecutions has not prosecuted somebody, he must be <Col N="2091" /> onto a good thing.  That is the mentality of some people.</P>
    <P>When dealing with the question of citizens and the rights of citizens one must be above board.  It has got to be seen, it has got to be heard and it has got to be understood that they are getting a fair crack of the whip.  Ordinary people are the majority and it is much better that they should understand what happens. They can understand that a person can be brought to court, evidence presented against him and that he has the right to challenge that evidence through legal representation etc.  But in the absence of that provision we will not do justice to this matter at all.  I do not think the President will send the Bill to the Supreme Court but there will be as many interpretations as there are lawyers in the country and I think we will see the first case we try to deal with being sent to the Supreme Court.  The legal people will have a ball.  That is how it appears to me at the moment.</P>
    <P>I am not against people trying to reach compromises that seem fair.  There is nothing wrong in a compromise provided it is for a good reason.  You are compromising all the time.  If you say you are going to the pictures and somebody else says: &ldquo;No, you are coming to dinner with me&rdquo;, you are compromising.  So we are into the compromise business as a nation; that is our nature and it is a good thing. Therefore, I am not being critical of Ministers in the sense that they had to find an accommodation for their own people. Let us be blunt about it.  If I were in a tricky situation I would be looking for an accommodation, and I would make no apology to anyone.</P>
    <P>I can understand that the Government can have difficulties, that they have to find an accommodation and that it is not easy to do this.  At the same time, we have to bear in mind that we are dealing with this grave question of human rights, which is very, very wide.  We are not legislating here for ministerial good.  That is not what it is about.  We are not legislating for the good intentions of Ministers. We are legislating here for Irish <Col N="2092" /> citizens who will be put on trial in another jurisdiction and may not get the best deal because we did not have sufficient regard to the difficulties they might face, and did not give them the absolute protection claimed by other jurisdictions for their citizens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to have an opportunity to intervene briefly in the Debate on this very important legislation and to congratulate the Minister and the Government on initiating it.</P>
      <P>The legislation now before the Seanad provides specific statutory safeguards for persons whose extradition to Great Britain or Northern Ireland is sought. Quite a number of people have been misinformed about extradition.  Some, indeed, were of the opinion that we were introducing extradition but, of course, we know that this is not true.  The present special arrangements for extradition between this State, Northern Ireland and Britain have been operating since 1965. Under the Act of 1965, up to the present 733 persons have been extradited to Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Under the 1965 Act it is possible to persons whose extradition is sought by a foreign country to claim that they should not be extradited because the offence for which they were sought was a political one or an offence associated with a political offence.  It is this aspect of the 1965 legislation with which we are now concerned. The Supreme Court judgment in the McGlinchey case has given a more restricted interpretation of this aspect of the 1965 Act.  These changes would, of course, have required an amendment in the law anyway.  But if we were to scrap the 1987 Act entirely, extradition under the 1965 Act would continue to operate without any influence from the Legislature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By introducing this Bill the Government are ensuring that a number of safeguards will be enshrined in the legislation to protect the rights of our citizens and ensure against the arbitrary or unreasonable extradition of citizens.  Briefly, these safeguards are, first, that all warrants for extradition must be examined by the <Col N="2093" /> Attorney General.  The Attorney General must be of the opinion that there is a clear intention to prosecute and that this intention is founded on the existence of sufficient evidence.  This guards against extradition for questioning.  As regards extradition on a specific charge, as a general principle persons can only be tried for the offence for which they are extradited and additional charges may only proceed with the agreement of the Attorney General.  This is known as the rule of specialty.</P>
    <P>On the lapse of time provision, a person whose extradition is sought will be able to apply to the High Court to have his extradition refused on the grounds that by reason of the passage of time since he is alleged to have committed the offence it would, having regard to all the circumstances, be unjust, oppressive or invidious to extradite him.</P>
    <P>On the review of the arrangements, the Attorney General will have a statutory obligation to prepare and submit to the Government an annual report on the operation of extradition arrangements and specific cases in the previous 12 months.  The Taoiseach has said that if the arrangements are not upheld, both in letter and in spirit, they would be set aside.  On the other hand, if they are not working satisfactorily the Government will bring forward revised proposals.</P>
    <P>These safeguards are welcome, particularly in the light of recent happenings in Great Britain.  We have every right to mistrust British justice.  The British Prime Minister may lecture us as long as she likes but in the end we will do what we think is right for our citizens, not what she wants us to do.  Indeed, if the British Prime Minister and the British Government had been a little more forthcoming in relation to the system of justice in Northern Ireland the need for this legislation would not have arisen.</P>
    <P>Extradition is an important weapon in the fight against international terrorism. We are a small island on the shelf of the Atlantic but that does not insulate us in any way from the activities of those terrorists.  Over the past 20 years we have witnessed may acts of terrorism within <Col N="2094" /> our shores.  Those acts have become more ruthless and sophisticated in recent years. The Government have had to devote a lot of time and energy to those matters. Recent happenings have brought home to everybody the extent to which those terrorists will go in order to achieve their goals.  The kidnap and mutilation of Dr. John O'Grady; the <i>Eksund</i> affair, which involved the attempted importation of highly-sophisticated weaponry on an unprecedented scale to the country and, of course, the dreadful slaughter of innocent civilians who had assembled in Enniskillen to honour their dead.</P>
    <P>All those events bring home to the Government the need for vigilence. When you are dealing with ruthless terrorists like this you cannot afford to be complacent because there is a definite threat to the security of the State.  In this regard I would like to compliment the security forces, both the Garda and the Army for the role they have played in recent events.  We can truly be proud of them.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements which will come into effect when the Bill is passed will be carefully monitored by the authorities here.  This is important because everybody will wish to be assured that extradition works fairly and properly and also that the person accused gets a fair trial and proper treatment.  The assurance by the Taoiseach that if the arrangements are not upheld in letter and in spirit he will come back to the Dáil and set the arrangements aside is welcome as this means that the situation will be regularly monitored.</P>
    <P>We, as a small nation, will play our part in the common fight against terrorism. The measures now being introduced are an earnest of our desire to do so.  I wish the legislation a speedy passage through the House and hope that we will see the measures proposed in it put into effect in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>My comments will be brief and directed to the general rather than the specific nature of the Bill.  I do not intend to go into the legal technicalities of the legislation; we have <Col N="2095" /> listened to some legal experts in the House and I am sure we will hear from more of them, and as usual they will agree to disagree.</P>
      <P>The whole principle of extradition causes me no heartfelt aches.  I do not have to look very deep into my soul to find out what my views on it should be.  I can categorically state that I fully support the principle of extradition no matter from what country or indeed to what country.  Terrorism is terrorism no matter what flag it flies; violence is violence and murder is murder, no matter what way its perpetrators may try to explain it away or no matter what cause they claim to represent.  We must get rid of, once and for all, the despicable spectacle within the country of the most horrendous crimes of violence being committed against fellow Irishmen in the so-called name of Irish freedom.  We must continue to condemn, no matter how tired we are of doing so and no matter how ineffective it may seem to be, all the awful crimes in our name.</P>
      <P>I understand why so much has been expressed in some quarters, including sections of the Minister's party, about the results of the passage of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism and in particular the effects of the rate of extradition between this country and the UK.  It has been a flag pole of a certain brand of republicanism or, as I would see it, a questionable type of republicanism that extradition between Ireland and the UK for offences of a so-called political nature would not take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes which the European Convention on Terrorism will bring about will bring this ridiculous situation to an end. It will ensure that the men of violence will not find a haven on this island or on any island throughout Europe.  It should ensure, if our Government promote our case properly at European and world level, that no one anywhere will be in any doubt whatsoever about the views of 99 per cent of Irish men and women towards violence and towards the men of violence. It should ensure that the world <Col N="2096" /> knows that the people of this country have no time, sympathy and no safety barriers for those whose methods of politics are bombs and bullets.  We must publicly admit that, as of now, there are still some very far-fetched notions among some of our international neighbours of the politics within this nation of the conflict of Northern Ireland, of its true facts and of our relationship with the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>The simplistic flying of the green flag may have ceased in this State but unfortunately there are far too many people abroad, particularly those who march in St. Patrick's Day parades across the United States and other centres, who still look at the affairs of this nation through green-tinted glasses.  There are far too many people abroad, in particular, those of Irish ancestry who are not fully aware, or do not wish to be aware, of the fact that we in the Republic of Ireland, by and large, have no time for those seeking to bomb together a united Ireland.  There are too many people unaware of the fact that a large majority of Irish men and Irish women no longer see the United Kingdom as some sort of eternal enemy but instead, as our nearest neighbour, an important trading partner and a place of employment for the tens of thousands of Irish citizens we are unable to employ.</P>
    <P>A major question, however, must exist with regard to the process and administration of justice in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Many people will be genuinely concerned about ensuring that Irish people will get a fair trial under these jurisdictions.  This concern, as has been stated by many of the speakers here, is increasing on a daily basis as we learn more of the far from fair trial of the Birmingham Six.  Episodes such as this have done more to harm Anglo-Irish relations than delay in the passage of any extradition legislation.  The recent comments by the British Prime Minister were not just unhelpful but downright unfair.  Britain must go some way yet to get its own house in order.  If Mrs. Thatcher could ensure that British justice, particularly as it applies to Irish people, could be seen to be fair, she <Col N="2097" /> would be taking a major step to ensuring better Anglo-Irish relations.</P>
    <P>This amendment Bill arises as a result of the concerns I have mentioned and also as a result of what can only be described as a near revolt by backbenchers on the Government side of the House and grassroot supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party against the principle of extradition.  The reasons for this revolt, or if you wish to call it concern, are quite obvious.  Firstly, there is within the Mini-extradition. The reasons for this revolt, or if you wish to call it concern, are quite obvious.  Firstly, there is within the Minister's party a long tradition of considering subjects such as extradition as part of the bastion of their form of republicanism.  I would disagree with some of the comments made by Senators Lydon and Mooney, but I suggest sadly that their views are held by many people in their party.  It is obviously extremely difficult for this Government to introduce any Bill dealing with extradition against that background.</P>
    <P>As my colleague, Senator Bulbulia, has stated many of these people seem glaringly oblivious to the fact that extradition already exists since the 1965 Act and these people fear that the passage unfettered of the European Convention on Terrorism would represent a major part of their green plank of republican righteousness.  I would suggest that this has nothing to do with true republicanism, which would promote a spirit of openness, freedom, justice and tolerance but instead is symptomatic of an oldfashioned outdated and dangerous view of how the wrongs of Irish history should be righted.</P>
    <P>The second reason for this Extradition (Amendment) Bill is that the Government, by allowing the passage of the European Convention on Terrorism Act, are doing something which they had promised many within their support group and some other well known figures on the verges of their party they would not do.  In order to backtrack with some degree of honour it was deemed necessary to introduce this Bill.</P>
    <P>There are some advantages to the Extradition (Amendment) Bill.  Its stated purpose, to provide certain safeguards in relation to the extraditing of Irish citizens <Col N="2098" /> to Northern Ireland and the UK, is acceptable to all when you consider the question of extradition to a relatively questionable system of justice.  It is acceptable if you leave it at that.  There is nothing wrong in ensuring that those extradited have a case to answer and that they are not being extradited for the sake of questioning of a specific or general nature.  Ensuring that only those with genuine cases to answer are extradited will help not hinder Anglo-Irish relations and should help improve the view of British justice from this side of the Irish Sea. What I and others would be concerned about is whether this ideal and the provisions in the Bill to bring it about would confuse the scenario so much and tie up the legal process with such red tape as to render the Extradition Act worthless.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Government's decision to allow for a full review of the amendment Act in a year's time will allow us to examine fully who was right and who was wrong, and in the meantime &mdash; and I think there will be 52 very long weeks of politics until then &mdash; the processing of extradition applications will be slowed down and we could be on the road to its withering away.</P>
    <P>The Bill places a major burden on the office of the already hard-working Attorney General.  It is not the extra work I worry about but the placing of this responsibility on a Government appointed adviser usually politically connected in some way, and who, as has been previously stated, while nobody questions his authority or his non-political action, we have to admit has always been a person of political knowledge and connection. Senator Robinson has questioned whether a politically appointed and connected officer is the right man or woman for this job.  I would agree with her.  Surely it would have been far more satisfactory that the new role of judge and jury, if it was to be imposed on anybody, should have been imposed on the DPP with his full back-up staff and with his daily experience of deciding whether changes should be pressed.</P>
    <P>The new role now being imposed on <Col N="2099" /> the Attorney General is not only new but extremely onerous.  The Bill states:</P>
    <P>A direction of the Attorney General under section 44A shall be given unless the Attorney General, having considered such information as he deemed appropriate, is of the opinion that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  there is a clear intention to prosecute or, as the case may be, to continue the prosecuting of, the person named or described in the warrant concerned for the offence specified therein in a place in relation to which this Part applies, and</P>
    <P>(b)  such intention is founded on the existence of sufficient evidence.</P>
    <P>It will be extremely difficult for the Attorney General to satisfy himself as to what someone's else's intention will be. Indeed, who can inform anybody else what his or her intention is or will be.  At least the DPP is dealing on a daily basis with the problem of deciding whether to prosecute and his experience in this matter would clearly have given him an advantage over the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that when the Government were very willing, in fairness to them, to consider changes to the Bill, they could not allow themselves to make this improvement.  I am not an expert, nor indeed am I even knowledgeable in constitutional law.  This Bill, as with all subjects of legality will have all the experts disagreeing.  It will be very disappointing if the Bill will, at an early stage or even at any stage, find itself in the Supreme Court awaiting the long judicial process of judgment on its constitutionality. While this will be happening, and while no further applications will then be taking place for some time or will not be processed, those we would all hope to see answer for their crimes as a result of the Extradition Bill will, instead, be availing of this time to plan cutely their next escape move.</P>
    <P>The Office of the Attorney General will also become a focus for the very people we are trying to see extradited from this country, the terrorists.  This is <Col N="2100" /> something I have not heard many people speak about but we must mention the fact that when you have one man in whose hands the fate of a lot of persons may rest, these people who would certainly use questionable means to carry out their tasks will be in a position to cause a certain degree of worry to the Attorney General and to his family.  Once this new role is given to the Attorney General he will automatically become a far greater rish and his family will live under greater risk than they do now.  Not only are we placing an extra burden on the Attorney General but we are placing a very serious burden on him from his security point of view and indeed from that of his family. No matter who will have the final say as to whether an extradition warrant will take place will live under a certain security risk, but at least if it was coming from the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, we would be dealing with an office in general, whereas now, with the powers being vested in the Attorney General, we will be talking specifically of one man.  We are putting him in a very difficult situation.  It is right that this has been highlighted so much but the people we are speaking about will know of it.  I would certainly hope that the security on the Attorney General will be stepped up very much because it will need to be when these powers have been vested in him.</P>
    <P>I hope, regardless of my reservations about certain sanctions of the Bill, that the main purpose of ensuring that this country offers no haven to any terrorist will come into being once the amendment Bill is passed.  There was a lot of talk about the strains which are put on Anglo-Irish relations as a result of all the questionable decisions by British judges and juries and questionable actions by their forces down through the years.  I do not think simple criticism of that will solve it. It is not so easy to right a wrong but we must look at the whole Anglo-Irish judicial process in a new spirit over the next few years.</P>
    <P>We must make a point of proving to everybody, in particular the people of another tradition among the Ulster community, that we are not offering a haven <Col N="2101" /> to anybody.  Our case has never been highlighted enough.  The action being taken by the Government, the action being taken by our police force and our Army, which in recent weeks has been quite spectacularly successful, has never been highlighted enough.  Too many people have been given too much ground to complain about Irish security methods. Too many people have been given too much ground to speak about us allowing terrorists to run wild in the streets.  I hope that this amendment Bill to the European Convention on Terrorism Act will work and that when we come back here to discuss it in the Seanad in a year's time we will see some concrete results from it &mdash; hopefully the same Seanad &mdash; and that those who are at present questioning our actions against terrorism will not be able to do so any longer.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the Minister for his presence here in the House.  I am sure he will take note of all that we have said, though what action he proposes to take on them I am not sure.  I would like to think that the passage of this Bill will be the start of a new and more positive spirit of Anglo-Irish relations and that, it will help ensure there will be peace on this island and on our neighbouring island over the next few years because that is what we all wish to see.  We are tired of listening to talk about unity of lands, unity of islands and unity of counties.  We must seek unity of people and we must seek peace for those people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief. The Bill before the House is a justifiable and sensible measure.  Extradition, as has already been underlined by the Minister, is nothing new in this country.  It has long been used as a method to fight serious crime, not alone by ourselves but by several other European countries.  As one of the family of civilised European nations, we wish to play our part in combating crime and international terrorism.  As the Minister pointed out in his comprehensive address, he views this Bill as an important weapon in achieving that objective.  Since 1 December we have allowed the European Convention on the <Col N="2102" /> Suppression of Terrorism Act, 1987 to come into operation.  At the same time we are providing by legislation &mdash; I fully subscribe to this measure &mdash; specific statutory safeguards for persons whose extradition to Northern Ireland and Britain is sought in the new situation. The purpose of the Bill, therefore, is to provide safeguards.</P>
      <P>Why has the European Convention on Terrorism, which is now part of our domestic law, become necessary?  The fact is that times change, new forms of terrorist violence have arisen throughout Europe and the Convention represents an attempt by the member states of the Council of Europe to join together in combating this violence.  In future, therefore, certain specific offences shall not be regarded as political offences and their perpetrators shall, therefore, be extraditable. Our Extradition Act of 1965 also provided for the political exception which reflected international practice at the time.  As I have said already, times change and the law should change to reflect the passage of time, where necessary. When we provided, under the 1965 Act for an almost unlimited political exception, the Oireachtas did not and could not at that time envisage that the violence we have witnessed since then would have reached the scale it has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To turn to Northern Ireland &mdash; obviously this is relevant in the context of the Bill before us &mdash; the implementation of the European Convention was delayed until 1 December.  This unusual step was thought necessary at the time the Act was passed because it was considered that sufficient progress had not been made on the issue of public confidence in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland to warrant the commencement of the Act straightaway.  There has been, and still is, a problem of public confidence in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland.  This is not a one sided view. It is clear from the text of the Anglo-Irish Agreement that both the British and Irish Governments in 1985 shared the view that there was indeed a problem of public confidence in the administration of justice in the North and in the related area <Col N="2103" /> the operations of the security forces.  We should, however, acknowledge that progress has been made.  The supergrass trials, for example, have been ended. There is still, however, a long way to go and a great deal of room for further improvement before confidence is restored to the minority population in the north and indeed to the people of the Republic as well.  An increase in the level of confidence is an essential ingredient in the process to which Britain and Ireland alike subscribe, of restoring peace and stability in the North.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn briefly to the safeguards themselves.  The first thing I should say is that there is unanimity in the Houses of the Oireachtas that safeguards are necessary.  While successive governments have obviously been committed to combating terrorism, they also have shared the view that the rights of the individual should be protected in accordance with law.  Therefore, it is a question of balance.  Extradition, especially of one's own citizens, is a very sensitive matter and is regarded as such in every country.  It is not peculiar to Ireland.  Just as in any other country, our source of concern is that an extradited person should get a fair deal in the receiving country.  The concern in the Republic is the perception that a fair deal does not always apply in the North or in British courts.  Extradition clearly affects the right of the citizen to liberty and it is important, therefore, that there should be protection against the possibility that it might take place in an arbitrary fashion.</P>
    <P>Secondly, a well established principle internationally is that extradition is not for the purpose of questioning the person concerned but to bring a charge in a court of law.  Extradition warrants to Northern Ireland and Britain must be endorsed by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána for execution in the State.  The Bill before us proposes that the commissioner will be obliged not to endorse a warrant if the Attorney General so directs.  It will be up to the Attorney General then to form an opinion about the existence of and the foundation for the intention to prosecute <Col N="2104" /> in every case.  In other words, the Attorney General will operate as a type of filter in the extradition process.</P>
    <P>I note it is the intention that this new procedure will be operated as efficiently as possible.  It is not designed to make extradition more difficult, as Mrs. Thatcher thinks, but rather to provide the necessary safeguards for the rights of the person wanted for extradition.  That is our primary concern.  At present there is no safeguard at all on this issue and the Bill fills this deficiency.</P>
    <P>Most of the debate in the other House, and some of it here, has focused on ther role of the Attorney General.  The Attorney General already, as the Minister pointed out in his speech, has duties in the extradition field.  It should be said straight away that extradition cases will continue to be decided by the courts. There is no question of the erosion of the courts in regard to extradition proceedings. The Attorney General will ensure that there is sufficient scrutiny of the evidence presented by the country requesting the extradition.</P>
    <P>I believe this is a good thing and a necessary step.  It is clearly important that the British authorities should co-operate to ensure that the system which we are proposing will operate successfully.  That British response is obviously necessary in order to have the proposed system work. Ireland and Britain, as independent sovereign nations, should be able to agree to this system, promptly I hope, and to operate it successfully without any undue delay.  It remains to be seen how the Bill will work out in practice.  That is the value of vesting power in the Oireachtas to extend and continue the provisions of the Bill when enacted or indeed to let it die.</P>
    <P>I want to make a brief comment on relations with Britain.  The Anglo-Irish Agreement is a valuable political framework which provides us with the means of promoting our objectives by peaceful means.  Mrs. Thatcher's comments in the House of Commons have attracted a lot of attention.  My own view is that as a mature sovereign, independent Republic we should be less concerned with what <Col N="2105" /> Mrs. Thatcher said in the House of Commons but rather redouble our efforts under the Anglo-Irish Agreement to improve dialogue and to advocate political development in Ireland to its full potential.</P>

      <P>I measc na ngníomhartha is measa dar deineadh le déanaí agus rialtais an domhain taobh thiar dóibh, luaim cad tá ar siúl in Afghanistan faoi láthair.  Ní féidir ach terrorism a thabhairt ar an saghas brú atá á chur i bhfeidhm ag Aontas na Sóivéide ar phobal Afghanistan.  A laghad agus a thaitnionn an freasúra in Afghanistan liomsa, cé chomh coimeádach, cé chomh mór i gcoinne chearta na mban agus chearta na ngnáthdhaoine agus atá an freasúra in Afghanistan, ní leithscéal é sin don fhoréigean agus don rud cosúil le genocide atá ar siúl ansin.  Mar an gcéanna, toisc nach bhfuil an fear atá i gceannas ar Libya iontaofa agus nach féidir aon rud a deireann sé a chreidiúint, níor cheart an bhuamáil a rinneadh ar chathracha na tíre sin agus daoine macanta, neamhurchóideacha a mharú chun a chruthú do mhuintir na Stát Aontaithe agus muintir na Breataine go raibh an tUachtarán Ronald Reagan agus an Príomh Aire Margaret Thatcher láidir i gcoinne an fhoréigin.  Níl sé ceart foréigean a úsáid, agus is cuma rialtas nó duine aonar a úsáideann é, tá sé mí-cheart duine neamhurchóideach a mharú chun rud polaitiúil a chur i bhfeidhm ar gháthdhaoine.</P>

Tá sagairt, mná rialta agus gnáthdaoine á marú i Nicaragua faoi láthair agus is Uachtarán na Stát Aontaithe atá taobh thiar de sin.  Tá mise i gcoinne an fhoréigin in ngach áit.  Tá mé i gcoinne an fhoréigin a dTuaisceart na hEireann, i Meiriceá Lár, i Afghanistan agus i Libya.  Níl mé in ann aon rogha a dhéanamh agus, os rud é go dtaitníonn duine éigin liom, mo dhá shúil a dhúnadh agus a ligean orm go bhfuil difríocht ann.</P>
    <P>Violence is violence is violence, and murder is murder is murder, whether it is committed by what is ostensibly a terrorist organisation or whether it is committed in the name of what is supposed to be a democratic Government.  I believe if we are going to strike moral poses about violence as distinct from striking pragmatic poses about violence, we ought to recognise that some of those we regard as acceptable have been responsible for the deaths of more innocent civilians than some of those that we regard as the pariahs of our society.  I say that because on this issue of terrorism and extradition so much has been done in recent times to suggest that those of us who oppose extradition in principle are somehow suspect on the issue of violence. I say that as a proud patron of the Irish anti-extradition committee whose premises were raided by the security forces of this State.  I resent deeply the implication of that raid, that I am somehow suspect on the issue of terrorism.  I have a better record on the issue of violence than most Members of this House because I make no exceptions.</P>
    <P>Whatever my views on the oppression of the people of Northern Ireland &mdash; and they are very deeply held views &mdash; I have consistently told people in Northern Ireland that I cannot and will not equivocate on the issue of violence.  I do not believe the circumstances that exist in Northern Ireland could ever be used to justify the use of violence.  I have said that frequently.  I say it again and I believe it quite deeply.  There is no reason to <Col N="2107" /> justify the use of violence in Northern Ireland, but that is not to say that condemnations of violence should begin or end there.</P>
    <P>There is a much more fundamental question, that is, whether we are prepared to apply morality in a selective or in a universal way.  That is why I resent it. I want to say again in this House, in the presence of the Minister for Justice, that I deeply resent the fact that an organisation with which I am associated should be tainted with a raid by the Garda Síochána under the provisions of the Offences Against the State Act.  I resent it personally and I resent it on behalf of the people who are involved.  The suggestion that there would be something to do with the subversion of the State in the headquarters of an organisation like that is ludicrious in the extreme.  I am quite prepared to accept that there are individuals involved in that organisation about whom the Garda have good reason to be suspicious but I do not accept that the fact that there are individuals connected with an organisation justifies a raid on that organisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As always, I will defer to your ruling.  I respectfully suggest that I do not think I should be circumscribed by one definition of terrorism; I say that with full respect.  I do not think I should circumscribed by one definition of terrorism to which I do not subscribe. However, I take your point and I have said what I wished to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of this Bill and the related one of the European Convention on the Supression of Terrorism, there are mistakes being made.  Most of what I have to say will have nothing to do with that, but I want to put this on the record.  It is suggested that we are talking about <Col N="2108" /> European democracies, democracies in which similar principles on the rights of the citizen, on the freedom of the citizen, on the freedom of expression and freedom of the Press apply.  My views on Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom are that, by and large, they are acceptable democracies.  The United Kingdom is a free society with free citizens, whatever its faults.  There are specific reasons for wondering about that.</P>
    <P>Northern Ireland, in the words of the Taoiseach, is a failed entity.  That is my opinion also, nevertheless, most of the principles of a civilised society still apply there.  But there is one country, a signatory to this Convention, which I do not accept is anywhere near a free society, that is Turkey.  I said that when this European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism legislation was being debated in this House.  I stand over it.  I invite anybody in this House to read the report of Amnesty International on that country, and they will be deeply concerned at the prospect of even a Turkish citizen being extradited back to that country where Amnesty says torture and abuse of prisoners are still endemic.  I want to put on the record that this is not simply an agreement between civilised democracies; it is not that at all.</P>
    <P>Present legislation, quite rightly, needs to be judged in the context of recent events.  All of us who thought we were beyond being shocked were shocked by the treatment of John O'Grady.  It was a particularly offensive, particularly brutal and particularly savage offence.  I think &mdash; and this is not my usual position &mdash; that the Garda were subjected to the most appallingly unfair criticism of their handling of that case.  The idea that the Garda Síochána somehow are different from the rest of us, do not suffer from the same fears and concerns for their own safety, somehow can be expected to perform heroics on our behalf without as much as a nod from the rest of us is most unfair.  The Garda did a magnificent job. They were very brave, very dogged and did a remarkable job.</P>
    <P>I do not think it should be necessarily a matter for apology the fact that anybody <Col N="2109" /> was killed, which is a tragedy.  I do not think there is any room in our society for gloating that any human being was killed. I feel a particular sympathy for the members of our security forces, ordinary people like ourselves, with the same feelings who, in our interests, had to do something which was particularly horrible and which will not please them or make them feel any better.  It is a reflection of us and our society that people in our society, our security forces, had to kill somebody.  It was not their fault.  I do not believe they behaved unreasonably. It is not my usual stance to be defending the security forces but I do not believe there is any evidence to suggest that they behaved unreasonably or unfairly.  On the issue of violence in our society I feel sorry for them and grateful, in a sort of way, that they did it and I did not have to do it because I know all of us would do the same thing in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Garda and Army deserve our sympathy that they have to do things like that.  It is not simply a question of the British tabloids thing of &ldquo;got you&rdquo;.  Somebody was killed, a husband of somebody and a father of children.  He should not have been there.  I am not saying it should not have happened but we should keep our civilised values even in the most extreme circumstances.  That is what makes us better than those who resort to terrorism and violence.  We retain a sense of civilised values and we should do so even in the most extreme circumstances. We ought to remind ourselves of that.</P>
    <P>Similarly on the outrage in Enniskillen this House had a superb, worthwhile and inspiring discussion on what happened there.  Many of us were challenged about many things we took for granted because of what happened in Enniskillen.  I do not think we should allow Enniskillen to lead us into the sort of apologies some people have been making.  I heard Robert Ballagh, the artist, being quoted on the radio this morning.  I want to repeat again: I do not think anybody in this country has to apologise for being Irish because of what was done in Enniskillen or elsewhere. This country has a good history of civilisation, of civilised response to difficult <Col N="2110" /> situations, of tolerance, patience and so on.  Because something was done which was horrific, brutal and wrong does not mean we have to get ourselves into a position of collective guilt and craw-thumping. We have no reason to apologise for ourselves.  We have done things in our history of which many of us would not be proud.  We have done things in our history of which many of us would be very proud.  There is no reason suddendy to begin to feel that we are some sort of inferior species who must apologise for our existence.</P>
    <P>In the context of Enniskillen and of the Bill before us today we ought to address the fact and not fudge or duck the fact that, in Northern Ireland, somewhere close to 40 per cent of what we call the Nationalists, or the Catholic population, vote for Sinn Féin.  I do not think we should describe those people who vote for Sinn Féin as all being either thugs, psychopaths, mindless murderers, or whatever.  We ought to ask ourselves: why do people vote for an organisation which supports violence?  In thinking about that we ought to look both at ourselves and at the régime which controls Northern Ireland.  I do not think we see, hear or listen to sufficient of the experiences of ordinary Nationalist people in Northern Ireland.  We hear their political representatives, or those we are allowed to hear.  We do not hear of the day-to-day oppression and sufferings.  I work with a person who is from west Belfast. He is intelligent, articulate and, like myself, comfortably and affluently middle class.  I hasten to say that he is not involved in any paramilitary activity but his attitude to the security forces is identical with that of any member of Sinn Féin I know, which is that he regards them as oppressors, as hostile and as against him. He sees no fundamental change in their attitudes 20 years ago when he was a child as against their attitudes now that he is a grown adult.  I do not know anybody who is part of oppressed Catholic Northern Ireland who believes there has been any fundamental change in the attitudes of the security forces.  They still make their judgments on the basis of a person's name <Col N="2111" /> and address.  If your name and address is of a certain kind you will continue to be treated with a certain deference, the sort of deference with which most of us are treated if we are stopped at a Garda checkpoint, because we are regarded as respectable citizens.  But, if in the case of the North, your address is in another part of Belfast, you are identified as being on the suspect side and the attitude towards you changes instantaneously.  I challenge anybody in Northern Ireland to suggest that that cultural divide has changed in any way.</P>
    <P>I have said here frequently that I regard the Catholic people of Northern Ireland as perhaps the most oppressed on this island.  They have been oppressed in terms of employment and in particular, unlike those of us who live in this part of the island &mdash; whatever my views on the Judiciary &mdash; who have the right to appeal to the Judiciary for protection from any oppression we suffer and who have a reasonable expectation of fair treatment. Rightly or wrongly, most Catholics in Northern Ireland, particularly working class Catholics, do not believe they have any possibility of a fair hearing if they complain about the security forces or about the way they are dealt with.  Most Catholics and most people from Belfast whom I know still believe that nothing has changed, that the judgments, the values and the cultural perceptions of the majority community still pervade the security forces and the Judiciary, that, therefore, if you come from the wrong part of the divided community you will not get a fair hearing.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that I do not believe it is possible to make final absolute statements about these issues but in making a judgment about something as sensitive as extradition, particularly of Northern Ireland citizens back to Northern Ireland to be tried by the courts as they exist there, if what we claim to believe in has any real meaning, it is not only some sort of dispassionate, detached, intellectual analysis that is required, it is also a deep respect for the perceptions of those whose interests we claim to care about. <Col N="2112" /> That is what I find so difficult about the present legislation.</P>
    <P>In a cold, dispassionate, detached sort of way extradition seems to be a nice idea, particularly when emotive words such as terrorists are produced.  I do not believe or accept that the IRA are a terrorist organisation.  They are a paramilitary organisation who use violence wrongfully, who use violence that is not justified.  They are not a terrorist organisation intent on using indiscriminate terror against the civilian population in order to achieve a particular political objective.  The suggestion that the decent people of Northern Ireland whom I know and respect would support such terrorism is offensive to them.</P>
    <P>The IRA are wrong in total.  There is no justification for violence but to suggest that there is some parallel between the IRA and the sort of indiscriminate terrorism that is being used in Western Europe is to insult the people who, for reasons that I disagree with, support them.  It does not help the cause of peace to pretend that they are terrorists in order to condemn them.  They are entirely wrong but I do not believe that indiscriminate use of words such as terrorism helps to develop a proper perspective that will lead to their rejection any more than I believe that the struggles of the Palestinian people &mdash; I do not believe what they do is right either &mdash; should be described as terrorism.  One can say that the use of unlawful force, unlawful military force or otherwise, is wrong but to use a global word such as terrorism, to encompass, as many people have done, the African National Congress, the IRA, the PLO and the Bader Meinhof in West Germany, is intellectually unjustified and unsustainable.</P>
    <P>I do not say this in any emotive way but if we are to judge what we are doing and how it will be seen we should not pretend that all that has happened for the last 16 years did not happen.  We should not pretend that Northern Ireland began and ended with Enniskillen, however horrible it was.  Perhaps some people in this House saw a programme on ITV last week on the Divis Flats on which the <Col N="2113" /> murder of Peter Rooney by the RUC was recalled.  We should not pretend that Samuel Diviney was not killed by the RUC.  I, and most people in the South, have forgotten those murders because we do not deal with the RUC on a daily basis.  We deal with a police force &mdash; and I rate among their greatest critics &mdash; which by and large operate in a way that most of us regard as reasonably fair.  I have no personal complaint with our police force.  Those who live in the enclaves of Northern Ireland, particulary in Belfast, who come into day to day contact with the RUC, remember what happened 15 or 17 years ago.  It is very hard for them to forget.</P>

      <P>Of all Senators I hate interrupting Senator Ryan but I have given you a lot of latitude and I would appreciate if you could relate your remarks more to the Bill béfore the House which is the Extradition (Amendment) Bill, 1987.  Maybe you are leading to it but this has happened a few times today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate your ruling but I am a bit astonished that the record of the security forces in Northern Ireland is not related to the issue of extradition to Northern Ireland.  I have said most of what I want to say on the issue.  With your permission, and if I am again exceeding your ruling, I will be happy to agree, I want to mention that when 13 civilians were murdered in Derry in 1972 it was a member of the British Judiciary who ruled that nothing had been done that was improper or wrong.  If there is not a connection between the activities of a senior member of the British Judiciary and the fact that we are considering extraditing Irish people to be tried by that same Judiciary, I will have to be guided by you because my own judgment of what is proper is obviously suspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What concerns me about extradition is not that people who commit the appalling crimes that have been committed should be brought to justice.  Whether I think there is an enormous amount of suffering <Col N="2114" /> in Northern Ireland is not relevant to that issue.  What I think about the security forces in Northern Ireland is not relevant to that issue.  The fundamental issue is that the use of violence in Northern Ireland or on mainland Britain to achieve any political end in this country is not justified.  That is a moral position I take, it is not a political position.  The circumstances of oppression, and I believe there are objectively definable circumstances of oppression in Northern Ireland, do not justify the response of violence that is being carried out.  Irish unity does not justify that sort of violence but it does not in any way justify us in ignoring the continuance of real oppression.  The tragedy is that those who should look at us for an alternative route do not trust or believe us.  The fact that many Catholics in Northern Ireland refer to our Army as &ldquo;Free State Brits&rdquo; is a fairly clear indication that we, as much as the British, have to earn and re-earn the trust and confidence of people in Northern Ireland.  That is the context in which this whole issue of extradition needs to be judged, not in terms of whether people should be brought to justice because we all agree on that, not in terms of whether people are wrong or right because we all agree that what they are doing is wrong, not in terms of anything like that, but in terms of those we claim to be close to and those we claim to identify with.  It is through their eyes that we ought to judge the whole issue of extradition.  It is through those eyes that I am endeavouring and have endeavoured to look since this whole issue first arose.  Many of them will feel betrayed by what is being done under the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism. Many of those will feel that we have further abandoned them, and they have felt abandoned for 17 years.</P>
    <P>In the context of what I have just said, that people who commit these crimes should be brought to justice and should be sent to prison if they are convicted, nobody has explained to me what is wrong with the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, why it is that it apparently cannot be used.  My limited layman's experience <Col N="2115" /> is that the other authorities, the authorities in Britain and Northern Ireland, find it excessively cumbersome and troublesome and, in fact, cannot be bothered to understand the differences between the law in this country and law in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland, and I resent that.  There is a suggestion that the fact that this great country called the United Kingdom should have to understand the law and the details of the law of a small country like ours is an unfair burden to impose on them.  Anybody who has watched the British media would have heard talk about recent extradition debacles and the slightly sneering way they talk about our courts and the minor technicalities which they accuse our courts of having identified. I find that almost racist in the implication that our courts are at fault because they quibble with the alleged superior authority of the United Kingdom when they make a mess of an extradition warrant.</P>
    <P>In the same way the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act could and still should deal with these problems.  It is important to remember that a person who is tried for an offence in this jurisdiction will probably receive an equivalent sentence, if not a larger sentence, than he or she would receive in Northern Ireland and will, in addition, receive far less generous terms of remission than he or she would in Northern Ireland.  If one gets 20 years in Northern Ireland one will probably get 50 per cent remission; if one gets 20 years here one will probably get 25 per cent remission.  So I do not understand, dealing with violence, on what principle we have been coerced into extradition, unless there is some overwhelming principle behind it which I have so far not identified.</P>
    <P>I have already spoken in Irish about definitions of terrorism.  The only reason I might speak in English now is for the benefit of the media because they do not, on previous experience, seem to understand Irish.  Perhaps I have said enough on it so I will not say any more.</P>
    <P>In terms of understanding why we are <Col N="2116" /> in the position we are in where we are prepared to approve of extradition, almost at all, it is the success of another country portraying us, implicitly at least, as the haven of terrorists.  Given the number of areas in the law where we are far more repressive, if not restrictive to use a less emotive word, than the United Kingdom, that is a particularly gratuitous offence.  The Offences Against the State Act is not, by any means, a liberal's dream.  The fact that one could be prosecuted for having any of the national daily newspapers in one's possession because they make reference to the IRA as an army &mdash; and that defines a document as a seditious document &mdash; suggests that the legislation is fairly tight.</P>
    <P>The evidence of the past couple of weeks in terms of the use of that Act to search the houses of what I would claim to be innocent people suggests that we are not soft on terrorism: the fact that no British Government would dare to introduce an equivalent to section 31 of the Broadcasting Act to deal with their broadcasting organisations; the fact that our remission policy for people in general and for people who are convicted of crimes of violence in particular suggests that our laws are more restrictive than those in Northern Ireland; the fact that our laws on firearms &mdash; and I agree fully with them &mdash; are far more restrictive than Britain's will be even after they amend them, and infinitely more restrictive than they were until they began to talk about new amendments in the light of the recent massacre, suggests that we have an impeccable record when dealing with violence, and quite rightly.</P>
    <P>Our laws on guns are extremely restrictive. I would be horrified at the idea that the sort of weapons which apparently were easily accessible in Britain should ever become available to anybody here. There is no justification for them.  I find the suggestion that this country is soft on terrorism, that this country is somehow not to be trusted on the issue of violence, highly suspect, highly doubtful and quite questionable.  I will say what I have already said; there is an element of racism in it.  I do not believe that, in certain <Col N="2117" /> emotive circumstances, in the light perhaps of a particularly appalling outrage, an Irish citizen could feel particularly secure or certain that he or she would get a fair trial in a British court.</P>
    <P>The antics of the British tabloids alone are close to guaranteeing that an Irish person would not get a fair trial in a British court.  This is an example of the extraordinary liberalism with which the British judiciary tolerates anti-Irish racism in the United Kingdom.  If the sort of anti-Irish jokes that are tolerated on the British media were to be made about the black community in Britain I am perfectly certain the authors would be prosecuted under the Race Relations Act. The fact that they are tolerated about us when they are not tolerated about anyone else suggests an acceptance that the Irish are, somehow or other, a safer target or a softer target.</P>
    <P>In regard to the experience of the Irish community in Britain of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, what we hear about most frequently are the arrests under the Prevention of Terrorism Act &mdash; and these are only the tip of the iceberg.  Under the Prevention of Terrorism Act in Britain, detention for less than 12 hours is not an arrest and there have been about ten times as many people detained at ports and airports who have not been arrested under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. That comes close to 40,000 people detained for less than 12 hours to be questioned. That amounts to calculated harassment of people simply because they happen to have an Irish passport.</P>
    <P>I do not believe a régime or a system which discriminates against and identifies as suspect the whole of a community can be trusted to give people a fair trial.  Even more so I do not believe, given the divided nature of Northern Ireland, given the massive cultural gap that exists between the forces of security and most of the Judiciary and the nationalist people who come before them, that we are anywhere near being in a position to believe people will get a fair trial.  We keep on forgetting down here, whatever our views on Northern Ireland, the depth of the cultural gap, the depth of the gap <Col N="2118" /> between those who perceive themselves to be British and those who perceive themselves to be Irish, and all that goes with it.  It is simple things that some people take for granted, like the fact that in many areas of public life in Northern Ireland one must take an oath of allegiance.  For 60 per cent of the population in Northern Ireland that is a perfectly reasonable thing.  For the remainder it is an extremely difficult thing, and anybody who does not believe me should ask the SDLP Members of the House of Commons how they felt about having to take an oath of allegiance.</P>
    <P>I do not blame them for taking an oath of allegiance.  It is a difficult and unpleasant ritual to have to go through for people who regard themselves as Nationalist Irish people.  I say this simply to underline the depths of the cultural gap that exists between the majority and minority in Northern Ireland in terms of identity, in terms of perceptions, in terms of attitudes to a whole series of things, not just religious matters.  Those who have one identity would be effectively the forces of law and order and would still be effectively the dominant force in the Judiciary.  They would make judgment on the activities of others, which immediately raises questions about the quality of justice and the capacity of those who administer justice to do it fairly, whatever their own innocent intentions.</P>
    <P>The evidence in the supergrass trials was accepted in most of the Diplock courts by most of the judges even though those verdicts happily were thrown out eventually by the Appeal Court.  Nevertheless, the fact that the evidence was accepted in the first place raises questions not necessarily about the personal integrity of the people involved but about the cultural background from whence they came and their capacity to understand the cultural background of other people.</P>
    <P>Nuala O Faoláin in <i>The Irish Times</i> recently contrasted the British Judiciary's cultural background with that of the six people convicted of the Birmingham bombings and talked about the difficulty of their understanding the experience of <Col N="2119" /> people on the dole, how a huge thing was made about people wanting to borrow £1 from somebody because nobody would make that much fuss over £1.  However, if you are living on £25 a week, £1 is a lot of money.  If you are a senior barrister or Queen's Counsel, £1 is very little money. I am simply saying that to underline the cultural differences that can exist even in societies where perhaps there is not the additional problem of a divided society. The cultural gap between a large section of the Northern Judiciary and most of the security forces and many of those from the nationalist, Catholic community that are dealt with by the courts is enormous. We have not come any way yet towards dealing with that huge division.  That is why I still suspect the Judiciary in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced at all that supergrass trials have ended.  The most recent statements I have heard suggested that the principle of using uncorroborated evidence of a single individual had not been disposed of.  It is not being used at present but there was no guarantee that it will not be used again.  We must remember that in the process the supergrass trials became an extremely effective means of preventive detention.  It would be nice to know we had some absolute assurance that supergrass trials had ended.</P>
    <P>I have such enormous reservations about the whole procedure of extradition to Northern Ireland and Britain for the reasons I have outlined.  I know that many of the people on the Government benches, if they were here, would share those views and indeed many of the people sitting in front of me share those views.  Regrettably we have been intimidated by what we see as world opinion and definitely British public opinion into doing something about which we have the most profound reservations.  I was going to be critical of individuals in the Fianna Fáil Party, but I shall not be. However, I do think they have opened a can of worms which may produce many more problems than they anticipate.  I do not trust the security forces in Northern <Col N="2120" /> Ireland to operate this sort of legislation with any degree of fairness.</P>
    <P>I trust our present Attorney General. I know him, respect and admire him; every Attorney General of whom I have been aware, whatever my views on his ideas in certain areas, I would trust and believe would operate legislation like this fairly.  However, that is not the issue.  The issue is whether those to whom people are to be extradited can be trusted.  I do not think yet that they can be trusted, I regret to say.  I would not make any great distinction between the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions for the certification of warrants. When I have so eminent an authority as Deputy John Kelly, who would hardly share my general political perspective on this matter, saying he does not understand why people are making such a fuss about this, I cannot argue with it.</P>
    <P>The problem is what we are doing and what it will symbolise to those to whom we should be giving hope.  It will symbolise our rejection of the people of Northern Ireland, and particularly of those who have suffered most over the past 16 or 17 years.  That rejection will produce, as most repressive responses to violence do produce, a further violent response.  It is important to remember that virtually every serious escalation of violence in Northern Ireland has been as much a response to repression as it has been a calculated attempt by those who use violence to up the ante.  The level of violence in Northern Ireland prior to the curfew of the Falls Road in 1970 was limited, even though it was unacceptable. The level of violence which followed on internment was greater than that which came before it.  The level of violence that followed on Bloody Sunday was greater than that which came before it.  We ought, therefore, to be careful in the interests, I shall not say of short term expediency but of what is judged to be pragmatic, not to do things which may be seen as sowing the seeds of deeper violence.</P>
    <P>I shall vote against this Bill on Second Stage, not because I particularly object to the safeguards contained in it but because <Col N="2121" /> this Bill represents the Government's effective concession of the principle of extradition to Britain and Northern Ireland.  I shall, of course, introduce one or more amendments on Committee Stage to try to ameliorate the unfortunate consequences of this and, at least, to ensure that the same principle applies here which still applies in Britain, even when they amend their own legislation, which is that our Judiciary should have the final say on whether what people have to face is a real case or not.</P>
    <P>It is not authoritative, but I note a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> of today that the British are endeavouring to remove the <i>prima facie</i> requirements from their own legislation, but they are making extremely heavy weather of it.  They have according to these reports, found themselves obliged to introduce other judicial safeguards, perhaps less than <i>prima facie</i> but which would leave people with the right to seek a judicial review.  I did not say whether it would be a judicial review of the evidence or a judicial review simply of the procedure.  It is quite apparent to me that, notwithstanding their enthusiasm for having us unlimited in our extradition legislation, the same authorities in the United Kingdom are extremely reluctant to allow similar procedures, similar principles, to apply to their own citizens. Regrettably, and to a certain extent the Opposition parties have contributed to this, we have been intimidated into doing something which we would not otherwise like to have done.  I very much regret that it has been done.  It will not necessarily contribute anything to the resolution of the problems in this island and may, indeed, undermine such attempts because it may leave those who are most likely to support the Provisional IRA in Northern Ireland with absolutely no feeling that they have any allies other than those whom they traditionally supported, the Provisional IRA.  That I would regret particularly deeply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall make just a brief contribution to this debate.  At the outset, I should like to say I believe Senator <Col N="2122" /> Ryan is absolutely entitled to his point of view, his approach and stand on this legislation.  It outlined the different political perspectives we have seen and shall see in this whole area of debate.  I claim the right to call those who perpetrate most of the violence in this island, the IRA, the INLA and their fellow travellers, terrorists.  He seemed particularly sensitive and delicate about using the word.  He said he does not like calling the IRA or the other groups terrorists because this would in some way diminish the people who support these terrorists in Northern Ireland, the nationalist community. That is an extraordinary approach to logic.</P>
      <P>Hitler who was a terrorist and a brutal leader in his time was, as we all know, supported by the German people.  Therefore, in the same way, would Senator Ryan not say that Hitler was wrong, that he was brutal and a terrorist?  We have to show the nationalist people of Northern Ireland that the support they give to the IRA is misguided and ill-conceived.  I believe that the framework of the Anglo-Irish Agreement is helping to show that the legitimate forces in Northern Ireland can offer the nationalists the support and protection they need.  Senator Ryan spoke a lot about oppression and took us on a tour of the outrages committed by the RUC and the military during the past 16 years.  I am not saying that the things which the RUC and the British Army did against the nationalist community were right but I think that many people would choose the oppression of the RUC rather than the oppression and outrages of the IRA who give no option or choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide safeguards for the citizens of this country who may in future be sought by Britain to stand trial for offences committed in that jurisdiction.  To date since the 1965 Extradition Act, 733 people have been extradited to Britain and 158 to Northern Ireland.  We have an obligation to ensure that there can be no shelter in this part of our island for anyone who perpetrates violence in any other country.  It would be ignominious, for instance, to believe <Col N="2123" /> that the men who were responsible for the Enniskillen bombing should have cause to feel secure in the Twenty-Six Counties.  There are many people who will still have a half romantic notion about these killers and the extent of the support given to the INLA, if we judge by the access to safe houses the O'Grady kidnap gang had, is very regrettable.  Our actions must send a strong message to those people I can only call closet terrorists that our laws and procedures have the single objective of bringing violent men whose purpose is sinister and evil to justice whether it is justice in this country or in another jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I question whether there is a need for this legislation given the present safeguards. We have to look at what we mean by the word &ldquo;terrorist&rdquo;.  Since last Tuesday the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987 has been in force.  Its title signifies its purpose and enables this country to take its responsible role in controlling and aiming to defeat acts of terror.  No person responsible for offences such as the hijacking of planes, kidnapping and using explosives and firearms may now find refuge in this country.  We are very clear in our minds when we talk about international terrorism because we have seen on television, film of hostages in mid-air, aeroplane seizure dramas, because we know about the bombing campaigns in Paris recently, and in other places and because we know too, of kidnappings and of killings of diplomats and politicians.  We would have little problem in supporting measures to end these outrages.</P>
    <P>However, it is not so simple when we come to our own situation and the violence on this island.  As I have mentioned, it has to be said that there was and, in many cases still is, an ambivalence to our native terrorism.  Some people still tolerate and try to make excuses for the propaganda of the IRA, Sinn Féin and the INLA and all the other splinter and breakaway groups who claim that the atrocities are perpetrated as part of a legitimate political campaign and that the <Col N="2124" /> end, a united Ireland, justifies the means. Such is the public acceptance by us of the reign of violence here and it is an acceptance which is born out of helplessness that we do not always see the many acts of killing and destruction as terrorism but they are nothing else.</P>
    <P>There are no instances of brutality and cruelty committed in the international arena which have not been exceeded in horror and sadism by the IRA.  It is only when we see the image which this country has abroad that the degree to which we are regarded as a cradle for terrorists comes home to us.  I am not suggesting that this State or the forces of law have had a <i>laissez-faire</i> policy to terrorism because that is not the case.  It is just that the awful events, such as Enniskillen, flashed by the media around the world, form opinions and attitudes around the world of Ireland and things Irish and they are negative attitudes.</P>
    <P>The people involved in the campaign of violence have access to a horrific armoury and explosives.  They use legal systems and country boundaries to their own advantage and for their own invalid purposes. There is good evidence to show that the terrorist network is well organised, well funded and has access to the training facilities and refuge of other countries.  This was seen very clearly recently in regard to Libya.</P>
    <P>Given that backdrop, most reasonable people would support the action taken by the Coalition Government last December in bringing the necessary legislation through the Oireachtas to enable the ratification of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism with a 12 month delay procedure but the events of the past six months, particularly the kidnapping of Dr. John O'Grady and the cruel treatment to which he was subjected, the horror of Enniskillen and the apprehension of the <i>Eksund</i> with its lethal cargo, make it imperative that we ratify the convention now.  Anything less would subject this country to international resentment and reproach and rightly so.</P>
    <P>I do not think, however, that the Bill before us is necessary.  There has been a <Col N="2125" /> great deal of posing by people who should have known better on this matter.  The Bill gives a special role to the Attorney General and extends discretion to him on all applications for extradition to Northern Ireland and Britain but the experience of cases taken through our courts up to now would indicate that the greatest care is already taken to ensure that any person who is party to such a warrant would be assured of a fair trial in a British jurisdiction.  This is clearly seen in the recent case of Shannon <i>v.</i> the Attorney-General where Justice Henchy said that if an individual can show that they would not receive a fair trial in the country seeking their extradition, the court will not allow the extradition of that individual. The interesting thing about the Shannon case and indeed about the McGlinchey <i>v.</i> Wren case is that both McGlinchey and Shannon were acquitted after being extradited to the North.</P>
    <P>In this context, I would like to refer to what the Fine Gael spokesman for Justice said in his Second Stage speech on this Bill in the Dáil.  He said that the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Dukes, in the debate last December recognised that there has been some problems in our dealings with the United Kingdom in the context of extradition.  He informed the House that a tightening up of the administrative arrangements had been agreed whereby a warrant for the return of a fugitive would not be sought unless the Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland or the Crown Prosecution Service in Britain had considered the evidence and were satisfied that there was a clear expectation of a prosecution.  The Minister said we, for our part, had made a reciprocal decision that we would continue our existing practice of having our warrants assessed for evidence by the Office of the DPP before they were sent for execution in Northern Ireland or Britain.</P>
    <P>The Minister informed us also that the British authorities had also agreed an addition to this arrangement, i.e. in all cases where a warrant was sent to this jurisdiction for backing that the British Attorney General would send to our <Col N="2126" /> Attorney General, through diplomatic channels, a confirmatory note to the effect that the British Attorney General has satisfied himself that the relevant prosecuting authorities had complied with the arrangements set out.  As Deputy Barrett asked too, I ask the Minister now if these arrangements have worked satisfactorily or if it is the case that his Government did absolutely nothing to bring about the implementation of the arrangements.  If these new arrangements were satisfactory, what do we need this legislation for?</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister's speech was peppered with the evidence of Fine Gael amendments.  The attitude of Fine Gael on this Bill, as on the primary school circular, was consistent with constructive opposition and shows that a creative role can be played by an Opposition party with concrete results.  It is regrettable to see the role of the PDs who continue to pursue hamfisted politics, opposing for opposition's sake and, in this instance, prepared to disregard the consequences for the country of an election on this issue.</P>
    <P>The matter of extradition is one to be addressed by us as parliamentarians presenting the views and wishes of the electorate.  They rightly should resist any outside interference such as the attempts made by Prime Minister Mrs. Thatcher this week.  She showed an insensitivity in making a provocative statement on this debate in Westminster.  Our Government and the Houses of the Oireachtas should not allow it to influence what we do one way or the other, and in a similar vein the stand of MP Ken Livingstone must be seen.  His support for the IRA and his refusal to understand and be guided by the wishes of those who democratically represent the Irish people put him into an autocratic status.  He epitomises the stance of a number of left wing people who, despite all efforts to reason with them, seem to believe they know better what is good for the Irish than the Irish themselves.  They are somehow regarded as letting the side down if they do not embrace every anti-establishment group including the violent IRA and INLA.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2127" /> I note in many of the speeches made in this debate in the other House and here that Government speakers have emphasised that this legislation is not &ldquo;introducing&rdquo; extradition, that extradition has been here for many years. Once again we have seen the new hysteria that has been created and whipped up by some unscrupulous factions who have cared very little for an honest approach and a correct interpretation of what this legislation is about, but they have chosen to distort the debate with the suggestion that it is about bringing in extradition rather than changing existing law.</P>
    <P>There has been a satisfactory resolution to the differences which divided the Government and my party at the start of the debate.  I am particularly pleased that the new section 44A prohibits improper communication being made to the Attorney General for the purpose of influencing him and that the Bill's operation will be monitored and reviewed by the Dáil in 12 months.</P>

      <P>Like my colleague Senator Fennell, I listened with interest to what Senator Ryan had to say.  I can only say that, if people plant bombs such as in Enniskillen and take a number of human lives as a result, they are terrorists and I make no apology for calling them so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system in operation between this State and Britain strictly speaking is not about extradition at all.  For a number of years we have been involved in backing warrants.  It is a relic of the old days when British rule prevailed throughout these islands.  Each country had its own jurisdiction and judiciary and, when a warrant was sent out, it was simply backed or endorsed by the chief of police in the relevant area.  There was no need to bring a person before any court.  Then in 1965 there was a celebrated case when, although the High Court had granted <i>habeas corpus</i> to a wanted man, he was taken out of the jurisdiction and the Supreme Court then delivered a condemning judgment.  As a result of this the Extradition Act, 1965, was introduced. It provided for extradition from this <Col N="2128" /> country to countries other than Great Britain and Northern Ireland but the old system was maintained with the difference that the wanted person would be brought before the District Court and the District Court would than explain to him what rights he had.  He had a right to challenge the matter in the High Court unless he signed an agreement to be extradited.</P>
    <P>It seems strange now, but in 1965 the idea of a person pleading a political offence, although the Act provided that a person could not be extradited for a political offence, seemed unlikely. However, due to the continuing violence in our country for a number of years many people put up this plea of a political offence.  It was enough to say that the motive was political and it did not matter how horrendous the crime or the circumstances of the crime were, the fact that it was politically motivated provided an exemption from extradition.  In the McGlinchey case the Supreme Court held that murder was murder and that the old definition of a political offence was now obsolete.  The court, in effect, said that something could be political only if fair-minded citizens regarded it as such, and since fair-minded citizens believed in the rule of law the concept of a political offence was obsolete.</P>
    <P>At present, however, there is concern for any Irish person who is standing trial in a British court.  I would say that the climate is so much against Irish people on trial in Britain that anyone would do better before a single judge in the Diplock Courts in Northern Ireland than before a British jury.  That is saying something when one realises that in the Diplock Courts alleged confessions with corroborative evidence are enough to put people away.</P>
    <P>The courts in Northern Ireland may have their defects, but when it comes to the administration of justice &mdash; again let me refer to Senator Ryan &mdash; I would rather accept a defective administration of justice in the Northern Ireland or any other court system than the kind of administration of justice that is handed out in <Col N="2129" /> the kangaroo courts of the IRA and other such violent groups.  Only when it comes to your own door do you realise this. Over two years ago a citizen of Northern Ireland living in this State, about 100 yards from my house, was one day driven in his own car to his own house and there executed by paramilitaries.  There was no court of appeal in that case.</P>
    <P>Defects in the court systems in Northern Ireland and Britain are all very fresh in our minds today especially when we read the daily accounts of the Birmingham Six trial.  We must be grateful to the Irish media, especially <i>The Irish Times,</i> for the detailed reporting of evidence in this case.  From reading the evidence I cannot help but feel, and I am sure many people share my view, that if the lawyers who are now representing the appellants had defended them in the original case then the verdict might have been a different one.  One thing I am certain of is that the men who were involved in that case were beaten up when they were in the custody of the police or prison officers or both.  I hope their Lordships, when examining the evidence before them, will bear these facts in mind.</P>
    <P>It is only reasonable, in view of our experience with the British and Northern Ireland authorities, to insist that the extradition process be made as watertight as possible by ruling out the possibility of sham warrants intended to hold a suspect for questioning.  That is not what extradition is about.  The amended Bill before the House is to provide additional safeguards to our extradition procedure. Under the new Bill the Attorney General is required to give a directive that a warrant shall not be endorsed unless there is clear intention to prosecute and that such intention is founded on the existence of sufficient evidence and that a suspect can only be tried for the offence named.</P>
    <P>It has been argued in the other House that the role of the Attorney General in this matter is unconstitutional.  I would not argue as a layman that his function is unconstitutional but I disapprove of the Attorney General's function in this matter.  I accept he is not a member of the <Col N="2130" /> Government and is only a legal adviser to the Government.  The Attorney General is expected to balance up both the legal and political considerations in every case. In view of the closeness between law and politics, is it any wonder that in every constitutional state Government the Attorney General is cast as a political friend of the Government rather than a career legal civil servant?  Until 1974 the Attorney General bore responsibility for initiating criminal proceedings in all trials of indictment.  In that year, because of the danger of a conflict of interest between his two separate duties, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions was constituted.  This was to remove the danger of party political rather than political, motives being of interest to the Attorney General.  For that reason I would prefer if the Attorney General's duties in the area of extradition, as outlined in the Bill before us, would be performed by the DPP.</P>
    <P>The protections guaranteed to an individual in having his case examined by the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions in a sense gives a stronger protection rather than having the matter considered by the courts.  The court can only examine documentation before them but the Attorney General and the DPP check the facts and the background in each case.  Due to the fact that all criminal proceedings pass through the Office of the DPP he would be best suited to carrying out the duties outlined in the Bill.</P>
    <P>As well as providing additional safeguards, the new legislation has all the old safeguards.  The safeguards that the case has to go before the District Court, that a suspect's rights have to be explained to him, and that he has a right of appeal to the High Court to seek <i>habeas corpus</i> are still preserved.  I am glad that the members of my party in the other House made very constructive contributions to this Bill.  I am glad also that the Minister has initiated some of the amendments to the Bill.  That is what constructive opposition is all about.</P>
    <P>Referring back to the view of the <Col N="2131" /> Supreme Court, I think that we, as fair-minded citizens, want to see terrorists who commit these terrible crimes brought to justice either in the state in which they commit the crimes or some other state that might have evidence against them.  However, we also want to ensure that they are tried in a fair-minded manner.  Two recent cases that come to my mind under our extradition law are the McGlinchey and Shannon cases. They were extradited out of this country but there was not sufficient evidence to find them guilty of the offences they were charged with and they were handed back. I sincerely hope that is the way extradition will continue to operate.  As fair-minded citizens we will be watching anxiously and I am glad that Dáil Éireann, as a result of an amendment to the Bill, will review the workings of the Bill each year.</P>

      <P>A. M. Connolly in a recent article entitled, &ldquo;Non-Extradition for political offences: A matter of legal obligation or simply a policy choice?&rdquo; stated:</P>
      <P>It has come to be accepted by an ever increasing number of states in the world, irrespective of geographical location, ideology or political structure, that there are certain types of behaviour for which persons should be brought to justice, and not allowed, merely by crossing an international boundary, to avoid accountability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1981 following a decision by the US Court of Appeal, Seventh Circuit, Ziyad Abu Eain, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, the PLO, was surrendered to Israel notwithstanding that an extradition treaty between the United States and Israel provides that extradition shall not be granted when &ldquo;the offence is regarded by the requested party as one of a political character&rdquo;.  He pleaded that his offence was of a political character.  He was accused of placing a bomb in a rubbish bin in a crowded market in the Israeli city of Tiberias.  The bomb exploded killing two young boys <Col N="2132" /> and injuring more than 30 people.  The United States judges expressed their concern that the United States should not be regarded as a &ldquo;safe haven for terrorists, and that such persons should have to answer for their acts&rdquo;.  The US court said: &ldquo;We recognise the validity and usefulness of the political offence exception, but it should be applied with great care lest our country becomes a social jungle and an encouragement to terrorists everywhere&rdquo;. Having exhausted all the judicial remedies Abu Eain petitioned the Department of State for relief.  This was denied and the Department of State endorsed the United State Court of Appeals' view of a political offence and issued the following caution:</P>
    <P>Anyone contemplating the murder of innocent civilians in a misguided effort to further a political cause must be on notice that he will not be permitted to take refuge under a political offence exception.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, of course, the Legislature and the courts have in the past approached the task of definition of a political offence in an empirical fashion and have accepted that where there is sufficient evidence of a political motive on the plaintiff's part in committing the alleged offence he should not be extradited. However, since the early eighties there has been a shift &mdash; and I believe a welcome shift &mdash; in judicial attitude towards such a plea.  Thus in Hanlon v. Fleming, 1981, the plaintiff who was wanted in the United Kingdom for the offence of handling stolen goods, namely, a number of electronic detonators and a small amount of high explosives sought to argue that this was &ldquo;a political offence or an offence connected with a political offence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Before the High Court, Hanlon presented evidence of his involvement with the IRA and it was contended that the proceeds of several robberies, cheque book and credit card frauds which he had perpetrated in England over a number of years had been transferred to the IRA. In the absence of corroborative evidence <Col N="2133" /> the High Court was not prepared to accept, and I quote:</P>
    <P>That any of the proceedings of his criminal activities was used for the purposes of the IRA in such a way as perhaps to lend political colour to the offence.</P>
    <P>On appeal, the Supreme Court saw no reason to disturb the finding of fact by the High Court and in doing so stated as follows:</P>
    <P>Even if the judges findings were otherwise, even if it had been found as a matter of fact that the explosive material referred to in the charge specified in the warrant had been intended for transmission to the IRA, it would not necessarily follow that the accused would be exempt from extradition on the ground that the charged offence is a political offence or an offence connected with a political offence.  There has been no decision of this court on such a point.  It must be left over for an appropriate case.</P>
    <P>In December 1982 the Supreme Court confirmed and elaborated upon this sentiment in the now well known case of McGlinchey <i>v.</i> Wren (1982).  In that case McGlinchey was wanted by the authorities in Northern Ireland for the murder of an elderly women who had been riddled with bullets early in the morning in her own home.  Before the High Court he replied, <i>inter alia,</i> on section 50 (2) (a) of the Extradition Act, 1965, claiming that at the time of the killing he had been an active member of the Provisional IRA; that this organisation had claimed responsibility for the murder and that what he had done was in the context of being a political offence or was connected with a political offence.  The Supreme Court, unanimously &mdash; all five judges &mdash; decided per Chief Justice O'Higgins and I quote:</P>
    <P>The excusing <i>per se</i> of murder or of offences involving violence and the infliction of human suffering by or at the behest of self-ordained arbiters and the very antithesis of the ordinances <Col N="2134" /> of Christianity and civilisation and the basic requirements of political activity.</P>
    <P>Chief Justice O'Higgins also stated in this case, I quote:</P>
    <P>All that can be said in this case is that with or without the concession made on behalf of the plaintiff this offence could not be said to be either a political offence or an offence connected with a political offence. Whether a contrary conclusion would be realised in different circumstances would depend on the particular circumstances and on whether those particular circumstances showed that the person charged was at the relevant time engaged either directly or indirectly in what reasonable civilised people would regard as political activity.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court developed the case law further on this subject in Shannon <i>v.</i> Fanning in 1983 and Quinn <i>v.</i> Wren in 1985.  These cases substantially paved the way for the last Coalition Government to bring forward a Bill in 1986 to ratify the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.  I welcome the decision by the Government, and by the Minister for Justice, to allow this Act, the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, to come into operation as from 1 December 1987.  As from that date, in the case of particular categories of crime, such as hijacking aircraft, kidnapping, killing by the use of explosives or automatic weapons, the murdering of a diplomat or a high official, it will not be possible for persons accused of committing a crime in this category to plead the political offence exception as to why they should not be extradited.</P>
    <P>I am glad that we have ratified the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism and that we have brought this Act into operation.  As a member of the Community of European Nations, sharing common values and principles, we must join in the common fight against terrorism.  The campaign of violent subversion which we face today is <Col N="2135" /> not limited to the confines of any country or continent but is a campaign which is international in character and which uses, as the Taoiseach said in the Dáil, legal systems and frontiers for its own ruthless purposes.  The people organising this campaign have access to a vast amount of deadly weapons, explosives and materials.</P>
    <P>It must also be emphasised that we have had extradition for a very long time. I notice that it has been said both in the Dáil and in this House that we have had extradition basically since the foundation of the State.  Until 1965 extradition for trial in other countries was governed by: (1) section 29 of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851, in the case of Britain; (2) section 3 of the Fugitive Offenders Act, 1881, in the case of what was formerly called the British dominions; and (3) the Extradition Acts, 1870-1916, in the case of other countries. The procedure for extradition to Britain, contained in section 29 of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851, was based, as has been said &mdash; this was referring to the more recent legislation &mdash; on a system of backing or endorsement of warrants by Irish police officers issued in Britain.</P>
    <P>The 1851 procedure was declared by the High Court in the State (Dowling) <i>v.</i> Brennan and Kingston (1937) to have been continued in force in Saorstát Éireann by virtue of Article 73 of the Free State Constitution of 1922.  In 1950 the continuance of section 29 of the 1851 Act, under Bunreacht na hÉireann 1937, was established in the State (Duggan) <i>v.</i> Tapley (1950).  In 1964 a turning point came and a case, the State (Quinn) <i>v.</i> Ryan (1964), arrived in the Supreme Court which moved that court to reverse the earlier authorities.  The position created by this decision was that there was no lawful machinery for the extradition of alleged offenders to Britain.</P>
    <P>The position &mdash; and this is of interest &mdash; in regard to Northern Ireland had been irregular even before the Quinn case because the 1951 procedure envisaged Britain and Ireland as a single political unit.  No adaptation of that procedure <Col N="2136" /> authorised, or ever attempted professedly to authorise, the handing over of persons arrested in the Republic of Ireland to the authorities in Northern Ireland.  In O'Boyle and Rogers <i>v.</i> Attorney General and O'Duffy (1939) this point was successfully made in the High Court.  Thereafter, from 1929 up to the decision in Quinn's case in 1965 extradition across the Irish Border appears to have been carried on reciprocally and informally by the respective police authorities without any lawful authority or even ostensible authority. After the Quinn decision, extradition generally was based on a comparatively new statutory basis with the passing of the Extradition Act, 1965.  The British enacted, simultaneously, The Backing of Warrants (Republic of Ireland) Act, 1965, which had the effect of making the new system reciprocal.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House&mdash;the Extradition (Amendment) Bill, 1987 &mdash; seeks to provide for certain safeguards in relation to the procedure under which persons charged with, or convicted of, certain offences in the neighbouring jurisdictions of Northern Ireland, England, Wales, Scotland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands, may be extradited to those jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>In summary, the Attorney General will have to be of opinion that there is a clear intention to prosecute on the existence of sufficient evidence.  The rule of specialty will ensure that, as a general principle, persons can only be tried for the offence for which they are extradited and any additional charges can proceed only if the Irish authorities agree.  A new régime of observation and monitoring of those arrangements will be instituted on the basis of which the Attorney General will submit an annual report to the Government. The question of what exactly is &ldquo;the exercise of a judicial function&rdquo; or &ldquo;a judicial power&rdquo; such that only a judge can constitutionally exercise it is perhaps one of the greyest areas in constitutional law.</P>
    <P>We have it, however, on the authority of Deputy John Kelly that there is no evidence that the 1937 Constitution or, <Col N="2137" /> indeed, its promoters intended to make any change in the pre-existing general patterns, and that before 1937 no one would have challenged the present Bill on the grounds that it infringed the constitutional preserve of the courts by giving this discretion to the Attorney General. However, the argument advanced on RTE radio by Deputy O'Malley on Sunday is certainly wrong.  He said that the Supreme Court had recently decided that the act of returning somebody for trial was a judicial act and impermissible if performed by the Attorney General or the DPP.  This, of course, was not the case in the Supreme Court in Costello <i>v.</i> the Attorney General and DPP, 1984, when that court merely decided, and quite rightly, that once a district justice had decided not to return a person for trial, it was unconstitutional for the Attorney General or the DPP to effectively overrule that judicial decision.  But there is no constitutional bar to a purely administrative authority returning someone for trial in the first instance.  This was acknowledged over 20 years ago by Mr. Justice Walsh in the State (Shanahan) <i>v.</i> the Attorney General, 1964.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell was also quite wrong in his reading of this Bill when he told the media that the Garda Commissioner was entitled to bypass the Attorney General altogether, for the necessary and clear implication of this Bill is that before endorsing an arrest warrant the Garda Commissioner must know that there has been no direction given by the Attorney General, and this presupposes that the Attorney General has had the opportunity to consider whether to give a direction.  To interpret the Act otherwise would be a deliberate frustration of the Act's clear intention and would amount to unconstitutional conduct.</P>
    <P>Whether this Bill is constitutional, I would much prefer the safeguards envisaged by the previous Governments and outlined by Deputy Dukes, when, as Minister for Justice he introduced the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1986, into Dáil Éireann.  On 4 December 1986, <Col N="2138" /> he stated, as reported at column 1386 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, a full review has taken place and it has been decided bilaterally that a warrant for the return of a fugitive will not be sought unless the Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland, or the Crown Prosecution Service in Britain, has considered the evidence and is satisfied that it is sufficient to ground a clear expectation of a prosecution.  This means sufficient evidence of a kind that is admissible in court.  In effect, this means that a warrant will not be sent from Northern Ireland or Britain for execution in the State &mdash; or <i>vice versa</i>&mdash; unless the case has been examined at a high level to see if there is sufficient evidence on which to bring a charge. This accords with the principle that extradition is for the purpose of charging a person and not merely for questioning him.</P>
    <P>At a later stage in the debate, Deputy Dukes went on to say:</P>
    <P>The British authorities have now agreed an addition to this arrangement. In all cases where a warrant is sent to this jurisdiction for backing, the British authorities will send to our Attorney General through diplomatic channels a confirmative note to the effect that he, the British Attorney General, has satisfied himself that the relevant prosecuting authorities have complied with the arrangements described.  That note will serve as an additional reassurance that those arrangements had been complied with in each case.</P>
    <P>If, however, these powers have to be given to a designated State officer, I believe that they should be given to the Director of Public Prosecutions who has a clear and unambiguous functional independence from the process of Government. In modern Ireland the source of the Attorney General's authority and the warrant for the existence of his office is Article 30 of the Constitution.  That Constitution clearly provides that the <Col N="2139" /> Attorney General relates very closely to the Taoiseach both in his appointment to office and in his resignation or removal from office.</P>
    <P>One feature which has not changed is the practice whereby the holder of the office of Attorney General is a member of the party currently in Government. Established long before independence, this tradition was continued in the new State, and the 1937 Constitution did not change the practice.  Indeed, by providing in Article 30.2, that the Attorney General is nominated by the Taoiseach and in Article 30.5.4º that he retires from office with the Taoiseach, the Constitution has, by implication, confirmed this tradition.  As a matter of practice, therefore, the Attorney General is a member of the Government party and under section 6 (2) of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, he may represent that party in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, therefore I hope this Bill achieves the twin objectives of combating and defeating international and cross-Border terrorism on the one hand and of protecting the rights and freedoms of our citizens as individuals on the other.  As a commonsense approach in this direction, I welcome the assurance given by the Taoiseach in the Dáil that there will be a review of this legislation in 12 months and that this assurance will be enshrined in the legislation on the basis of a Fine Gael amendment tabled in the Dáil.  I wish this Bill well and I look forward to the review in 12 months time.</P>

      <P>It is, I believe, a very sad reflection on this Oireachtas that, on a day that it was announced that the unemployment figures have gone up by 3,000, the Seanad should be debating the Extradition (Amendment) Bill 1987, which in real terms is nothing more than useless legislation and which, even if we stretch probability to its limits, will make no difference to the extradition procedure that already operates in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The impression has been created, and it is an onerous one, that individual warrants can only be proceeded with if the <Col N="2140" /> Attorney General agrees with them.  It must be stressed that the Bill imposes no obligations whatsoever on the Attorney General.  The Attorney General would be given the power to stop a warrant. There is no obligation on the Attorney General to involve himself in any stage in the proceedings.  This point cannot be overstressed.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the Seanad has been cobbled together to placate Fianna Fáil backbenchers on the one hand and, on the other hand, has been amended in the other House to provide Deputy Dukes and the Fine Gael Party with a face saver in their determination to avoid a general election and to keep Fianna Fáil in power.  I will return later in my speech to the amendment relating to the situation where, to quote the Minister, &ldquo;the Attorney General might be subjected to representation or improper attempts to influence his decision as to whether to give a direction under section 44A.&rdquo;  The Minister went on to state that the Government did not think it necessary to include a provision of this kind in the Bill in the first place.  However, once the Fine Gael amendment was put down, this was the price the Government paid to ensure its survival, that is, to include in the Bill what they saw as an unnecessary amendment. Out there in the country emigration continues apace and unemployment figures rise.  The Oireachtas responds to this by bringing in useless legislation and engaging in cynical exercises inspired by nothing more than the desire to avoid putting seats to the test of the electorate.  Is it any wonder the young people are leaving our shores?</P>
    <P>The Bill must be put in context.  Under section 43 of the 1965 Act, the Garda Commissioner is obliged to endorse an extradition warrant for execution, provided certain minimum things are complied with.  Under section 44, the Minister for Justice is empowered, but not obliged, to refuse to endorse that warrant if he believes it should not be endorsed. The Minister for Justice also has powers to refer any question in his mind to the High Court which may, on referral, refuse to endorse the warrant.  There is no <Col N="2141" /> obligation on the Garda Commissioner under the present Act or under the amended Bill to consult the Minister or the Attorney General.  The Garda Commissioner must back a warrant irrespective of the offence involved and the Minister and the Attorney General can stay out of the proceedings.</P>
    <P>This is where we get to the nub of the uselessness of this Bill in terms of providing safeguards for our citizens being extradited to Britain or the Six Counties.  In the 23 years of the operation of the 1965 Act, during which time upwards of 1,000 people have been the subject of extradition warrants to Britain and the Six Counties, the Minister for Justice has not once intervened to refuse to endorse a warrant.  Warrants have been refused in the High Court where political offences were involved on the application of the suspect to the High Court under section 50 of the 1965 Act. The Taoiseach, when Minister for Justice, put in the safeguard in the 1965 Act that the Minister for Justice could refuse to endorse a warrant but this safeguard has never been used.  This present so-called safeguard now adds the Attorney General to the list and it is hardly likely that it will be used either.</P>
    <P>An amendment to the Bill states where in the extremely unlikely situation the Attorney General becomes involved with a warrant for extradition, it is unlawful to make representations or improper attempts to influence his decision.  This has mind-boggling implications in terms of its practicality.  For instance, the Attorney General attends Cabinet meetings. Must he, under the amendment provisions, be instructed to leave any Cabinet meetings where a particular extradition warrant is discussed?  Is he precluded from having any discussions with the British Attorney General, the Taoiseach or the Minister for Justice other than those which relate to the proper communication of information that is relevant?  How will this area be monitored and the spirit and letter of the amendment implemented?  The Labour Party are far from satisfied with this Bill. <Col N="2142" /> We contend that further illusory safeguards have been produced.  The Labour Party are concerned with real safeguards and will be seeking to put down amendments on Committee Stage in that regard.</P>

      <P>I am surprised and disappointed at Senator O'Shea who said we were wasting time by discussing a useless Bill while there are so many unemployed. They may be unemployed but they can all go home to bed tonight. The poor people in Enniskillen who were going about their merciful duty of praying for the dead are now buried as a result. I am surprised to hear that comparison when over the past few weeks the events, the stark terms of the threats which terrorists made, the vicious kidnapping of Dr. John O'Grady, the <i>Eksund</i> affair and the atrocity of Enniskillen have been brought home to us.</P>
      <P>One thing that has not been touched upon by the various speakers although the Bill has been fairly well debated &mdash; it has been avoided in another House too &mdash; is the matter of safe houses for terrorists and murderers.  If we had civic spirit, it we pointed out these people, if there was no room or haven for them here, we would not have half the problems or crimes.  One can compare it to stealing property; if there were no buyers there would be no thieves.  If people reported those looking for succour to the police force they could save many more lives.  O'Hare was able to drive through the country and to live in different houses and when he was trying to make his escape caused another murder.  The garda who raided the house is lucky to be alive because he, too, could have died as a result.</P>
      <P>I should like to pay tribute to the army, and the police on both sides of the Border, to the medical profession, the nurses and all those who helped after the Enniskillen atrocity.  I should also like to pay tribute to the great courage of Dr. John O'Grady for what he suffered when he was brutalised by the cutting off of his fingers with a chisel and to pay a tribute to the people who saved him.</P>

      <P>Portlaoise Prison should more properly be called a Grade A hotel; they have televisions, snooker and billiard tables, libraries and videos to pass the time until they get out to commit more crime.  It costs £30,000 a year to the taxpayer to keep them there.  Because of keeping the Garda and the Army on the Border, successive Governments have paid only £40 a week or £2,000 a year to an old age pensioner on which to survive,</P>
      <P>Senator Robinson said that the Bill is a charter for lawyers but every Act is a charter for lawyers.  A senior counsel can make as good a case for or against; it is only a matter of which side he chooses to represent.  Doctors differ, patients die. Lawyers differ, the Bills die.  There are different viewpoints.  People should talk about the victims, not about fine technical and legal points.  What protection will they get?  Who talks about them? Who will do something for them?  You would think it was the victims who caused these crimes, not the perpetrators.  It is a terrible situation.  I welcome this Bill.  I am very happy about it.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>The contributions today have been very interesting, especially the contribution by Senator Robb who this morning reminded the House starkly of what the underlying cause for this legislation has cost, in human suffering, apart from the campaign doing away with places of employment over the past 15 or 16 years.  This was a sad story.  I listened to Senator Robinson's clever analysis of the procedures and of the impact that this Bill will make.  There has been many wide-ranging speeches here today.  The Minister listened very attentively to all of them.  Every word spoken here in the Seanad this afternoon will, I am sure, be taken into account at some future time. <Col N="2144" /> This Bill has evoked a great amount of debate not only in the Oireachtas but in the United States as well as in the UK and in other places.</P>
      <P>Section 7 sets a time limit of 12 months on this Bill.  Will the Minister clarify whether this section refers only to the 1987 Bill and to this Extradition (Amendment) Bill, 1987, or does it actually mean that, after the middle of December of 1988, Ireland will have no extradition laws unless the Oireachtas by a positive order decides to renew the Acts of 1965 to 1987 and continue them for a further year?  We would be unique in Europe if we were to decide that we would remain aloof from the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.</P>
      <P>Over the past 15 years this country has played its role, and has benefited to a great degree in many areas from our membership of the European Community. The aftermath of the work of terrorists of any nationality damages the freedom of the individual.  As long as this country is free, we should in a very wholehearted way, subscribe to anti terrorist Acts, and we should strengthen our laws to ensure that people who live by terrorism will not have a safe haven here or, indeed in any of the countries that have come together to improve the living and working conditions of their people. I hope we will continue to be a signatory to the European Convention and that we will join in a very determined way in a united fight against terrorism both at home and abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone has seen on TV and read in the papers of the ruthlessness, brutality and arrogance of the persons this Extradition (Amendment) Bill is designed to deal with.  We should not do anything to render it more difficult for our courts to deal with those savage criminals.  These criminals invariably do not recognise our 1937 Constitution, our courts, our Government or any of the institutions of the State, but when it suits them they appear to be the only sector in the community who constantly claim and benefit from &ldquo;constitutional rights&rdquo; under a Constitution they do not recognise.  If ever there was a daft country, we certainly <Col N="2145" /> have one, because there is a mass of contradictions here.  Not only do these people claim the benefits of their constitutional rights under the Constitution with which they do not agree, but under that Constitution they get free legal aid and they can go from the District Court right up to the High Court and the Supreme Court at enormous cost to the State.  The taxpayer pays the lot.  I do not know if there is any other country in the world that provides that kind of comprehensive service to dissidents in the State.</P>
    <P>I was very taken with the speech by Senator Doyle, when he spoke about the administration of justice in Northern Ireland and in the UK.  I do not set myself up as a legal luminary, and I do not like to judge the administration of justice either at home or abroad, but I know that our courts system, the system that has evolved in this country, by and large has served our people in an exceptional fashion.  There are very few people who complain about the administration of justice in this country.  Senator Doyle made the point that the sectors of the community who are most loud in their condemnation of this Extradition (Amendment) Bill, and who attack the administration of justice in Northern Ireland and in the UK are the paramilitaries and the Provisionals and those categories of persons.  They, on the other hand appear to be the only people in the European Community, and in many countries in the world, who seem to hang on to a system of capital punishment.  It is indeed, extraordinary to find that even at the end of the 20th century, a person can be condemned to death by a firing squad by these paramilitary people for even taking on a contract to work for the public service in Northern Ireland.  Even colleagues of these paramilitaries who find that some of the takings of the armed robbery sticks to their fingers, they do not hand it all up, can find themselves knee capped or sentenced to some similar horrendous type of penalty by kangaroo courts.  Unfortunately many people read the papers one day at a time and do not <Col N="2146" /> seem to correlate the activities of these people.</P>
    <P>There is still, as has been said so many times here today, a double think in this country.  People have a certain amount, some would say too much, sympathy for people who are against the State and its institutions.  I still have great sympathy for many of the young people who become ensnared in paramilitary activities and then find themselves before the courts and in the prison system.  It is indeed very difficult for them.  From experience I have seen that once a person joins a paramilitary organisation there is no way he can get out of it.  It is a horrifying ordeal to see the finest specimens of young men languishing in a place like Portlaoise with a 30 to 40 year prison stretch to serve.  That is very sad.  The structure that these people organise for themselves means that even in prisons these people do not have freedom from their organisations, whether they be the Provisional IRA or any of the other smaller branches of that movement. Those in prison have to toe the line and take whatever exercise is handed down to them.  Again we have a very difficult situation and one that I think is misunderstood. In every Irish person, irrespective of their political or religious views there is to be found a streak of nationalism, a love of and interest in the country and a desire to work and live for it.  It must be our educational system that is responsible.  The way in which Irish culture and history are taught seem to leave an indelible mark on people and make them look on Irish nationalism in a very negative way.</P>
    <P>History should be taught to our young people in a way that so would provide them with a basis from which they would learn to love and serve their country rather than leave them with a picture of hate figures going back for over 1,000 years and an inspiration to go out and take revenge on the fourth, fifth, sixth or tenth generation.  That is nonsense.  I do not want to have the INTO on my back, it is bad enough to have to deal with them in their present campaign without attracting more into the firing line, but <Col N="2147" /> there is something amiss in our educational system.  I suppose we are not unique, though, because if you look at the Greeks and the Turks they still have a big problem, which stems from the Trojan wars and that even predates our skirmishes.</P>
    <P>This country has been blessed in its institutions and in its public service.  I would like to take the opportunity of paying a special tribute to the Department of Foreign Affairs for the work they have done in so many countries for people who find themselves in trouble for whatever reason, whether by way of having lost their belongings &mdash; money, passport, etc. &mdash; while on vacation or otherwise.  The people who represent this country in the 100 or so countries around the world, would drive hundreds of miles to facilitate, to rescue, to assist, to repatriate and to provide accommodation, shelter and finance for an Irish citizen in trouble.  I would like our appreciation of these people to be expressed from this House.  We recognise the personal sacrifices that are made by our Foreign Affairs personnel.</P>
    <P>However, to get back to the Bill, I suppose one of the big problems the Minister finds, is that when the Extradition Act, 1987, was going through the House, there were sections that did not appeal in a full sense to the party who were then in Opposition and who are now in Government.  Now that the roles have changed it is difficult to have a complete change of face.  The Fianna Fáil Party in Opposition were a strong, determined <Col N="2148" /> and fearless Opposition.  The Government of the day had a fairly rough time with them.  In government, I think Fianna Fáil should apply the very same tactics and should do what is right for the country, without fear or favour.  I know that the Minister will not mind me saying that. Some of the difficulties with this legislation may have arisen from the difficulty the Minister has has in recharging the party's batteries to take on this issue.  I know the Minister has given this a lot of thought.  The Bill, certainly in the present circumstances is needed and I hope that whatever form this legislation leaves this House in early next week, it will serve the country and its people and strengthen the hands of those whom the taxpayers pay to protect life, limb and property.</P>
    <P>This legislation should put the criminal elements in our society on notice that there is no soft hiding place for people who do not respect our laws, that people who abuse in such a terrible fashion the rights and privileges of the ordinary citizens of the State who only want to be left to get on with their everyday business will be dealt with by the law.</P>
