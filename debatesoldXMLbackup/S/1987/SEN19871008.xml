      <P>I have notice from Senator Philip Hogan that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The present position regarding building projects for the national schools at Lisdowney, Graiguena-managh, Mooneenroe and Castle-comer community school.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Brendan Ryan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The urgent need for the Minister for Health to ensure that funds supplied by his Department to the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children are used for the intended purpose.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Maurice Manning of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for immediate clarification from the Department of the Taoiseach and the Office of Public Works on the reported illegal removal from this country of £12 million worth of historical and archaeological artefacts; to ensure that all steps are being taken to have the artefacts recovered and to have assurance that the full rigour of the law will be used to ensure enforcement <Col N="232" /> of the National Monuments Acts, 1987.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Hogan, Ryan and Manning as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Hogan's motion and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Ryan and Manning may give notice for another day of the matter they wish to raise.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday on the Order of Business I indicated, as I do today, that the Opposition have shown a good deal of co-operation in the workings of the House.  We have been very constructive and very helpful and the aim of all Opposition parties is that we have an effective and hardworking Seanad.  Yesterday I indicated that I was unhappy with the way in which business was being ordered.  The Leader of the House, for reasons best known to himself, seemed to take this personally.  That was not meant, as I assured him then and I assure him now.  Today I am even more unhappy about the way in which business is being ordered.  We have before us this morning the Insurance Bill, a complex Bill of 53 sections which was published on Monday. Yesterday half the people in my group had not even got a copy of this Bill.  We may have been told last week the Bill would be taken this week but because many Members of the House did not have a copy of the Bill yesterday, it is absolutely unreasonable to take it today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leader of the House may say, and I am sure he will say, that this Bill is merely a replica of a Bill published by the previous Government last January. That is certainly all right.  It is not the first time outgoing legislation has been lifted by the present Government.  Surely this <Col N="233" /> Bill could have been published in June, July or August if it is merely a replica of obviously very good legislation prepared by the previous Government.  It could have been made available, published and circulated to Members of the House last July or August.  Why the sudden urgency about this Bill?  Previously Insurance Bills were rushed through the Houses of the Oireachtas only when there was a real sense of emergency &mdash; the PMPA case and the ICI case are two examples in point.  There was real urgency then.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, who will deal with this legislation, to tell us why this Bill is so urgent at this stage.  We want to give the Bill the fullest and most detailed consideration and that is not possible in the present circumstances.  People who wish to speak on the Bill would like to have a couple of days at the very least to do their research, talk to people and enter into consultations.  What the Government party are proposing today debases this House.  Clearly Government Departments who do not have the manners or the consideration to circulate a Bill which has been lying there for eight or nine months, in time for people to give it full consideration are now asking that it be rushed through.  Is there something hidden in this Bill?  I do not believe there is, so what is the urgency?  Why was it introduced at the last minute and why are we being asked to give it an urgent despatch from this House?  It simply is not good enough.  Unless the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, either personally or through the Leader of the House, can give us a compelling reason this morning as to why this Bill should be taken today, having only arrived on many people's desks this morning, unfortunately I will have to say we will be opposing the Order of Business today.  We are not doing it lightly.  We are doing it in the interests of the House and in the interests of the proper consideration of important legislation.</P>

      <P>The Bill was sent to every person's home and they would have received it yesterday morning but most of them were on their way to Dublin at that time.  I was fortunate enough to collect my post before I left home.  Whoever sends out the Bills should send them to this House, especially a Bill that is circulated at such a late stage.  If it is posted to Leinster House people have a much better opportunity to get it on time.</P>

      <P>I have not got the Bill even at this moment.  There is a certain amount of sense in what Senator Willie Ryan said, but I would go a bit further and say that instead of posting documents to the Members of this House they should be left at the General Office or the Inquiry Office and we could collect them.  When I am in Dublin I reside in Dublin 2.  I do not receive post at my Dublin address until two days after it is posted.  I took this matter up with An Post and they said the fault lies with the people who send the letters, that they do not send them out in time.  I had an appointment to meet people here on 31 July.  Those people posted a letter in Dublin 2 and I got it on 4 October of that year.  I have the envelope as proof and I took the matter up with An Post.  I did not get the letter until four months after it was posted.</P>

      <P>With all due respects, Senator Ryan, I have the brief as spokesman on Industry and Commerce, and even if the Bill was there on Monday or if I had it on Tuesday, it is very intricate legislation, and will take more than one or two days to get advice and to suss out the Bill.  The Government Departments have treated this House very unfairly in this circumstance.  I call on the Minister of State, Deputy Séamus Brennan, to state why he wants this Bill put before the House at such short notice.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take items Nos. 1 and 2.  I apologise to Members who did not receive the Bill as was intended.  It is not without precedent that this has happened.  Anybody who suggests that we got the Order of Business for the day earlier than we got it this week would be mistaken.  We always receive the Order of Business on the morning we arrive.  It is important that Bills be circulated well in advance and, in general, this has happened.  The Insurance Bill is an important Bill and we are not going to rush it through the House.  There will be no speedy exit of this Bill from the House.  Second Stage will commence today.  Everybody will have an opportunity to speak on it and there will be plenty of time to deal with the Bill in detail.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 10 are related and may be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;`authorised body' means a health board or other body designated by the Minister as being a body authorised for the purpose of making an application within the meaning of <i>section 4</i>* of this Act;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Just to keep the record perfectly clear, Senator Robinson and I have a standing arrangement that we each agree to the other moving amendments in the absence of one of us to the extent that both of us feel that is possible.  Having read the amendments Senator Robinson has proposed I feel that they ought to be discussed. They raise issues that have implications for how this Bill will work in practice.  Amendment Nos. 1 and 10 &mdash; and amendment No. 10 is the important one &mdash; are designed to take consideration of a situation where circumstances arise where the safety or welfare of a child may be threatened and the parent of the child is unwilling or unable &mdash; for reasons that one could imagine to do with either threats of violence or the possible excessive optimism about the future of the relationship &mdash; to take the necessary action to protect the welfare of the child. This amendment is designed and intended to enable a body authorised by the Minister to act in the place of the parent where the parent is unwilling or unable to do so.  It is a reasonable precaution.</P>
      <P>There is a fair amount of evidence in my experience from talking to people working in this area that between the incidence of an event which may be a threat to the safety of the child and the possibility of a court case many parents of children develop a considerable reluctance to seek the necessary protection to guarantee the safety of the child.  That is why I move these two amendments, to ensure that where children are at risk and the parent is either unwilling or unable to take the necessary action, an authorised body, for example, a health board or other body designated by the Minister, would have the necessary legal authority to ensure that a child's safety is secured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support <Col N="239" /> this amendment.  I am pleased that we are going ahead with this Bill because it is a good Bill and it is necessary and timely.  It is timely in view of the fact that only this week we have had a report from the main group dealing with the problem of violence in the home.  Womens' Aid brought out a report and the women in the refuge have themselves taken some action to try to highlight the difficulties that exist.  We all know that there is domestic violence in this country the same as in every other country.  Changing attitudes and educating people is important, but the law must be seen to be protecting the vulnerable party, and in this instance it is the wife and the children.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that this Bill should cater for all the needs that could be there at present because we have not had any amendment since 1981 to the original Act which was in 1978.  Senator Robinson's amendment is important.  We are talking about a situation where a wife is too frightened to take a case.  There could be a situation where the children in the house are being abused and beaten and the wife might be colluding.  I would say that would be unusual but the provision should be broadened in scope to be able to cope with that type of situation.  We must ensure that the agency, health board or other body designated by the Minister as being a body authorised for the purpose of making an application within the meaning of section 4 can deal with such a problem.  I know there are many circumstances where this is necessary. At present the hands of social workers or the bodies who deal with families are tied.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider this amendment given that this problem is, if you like, growing all the time.  We are learning more about it.  Women have become more outspoken and are able to say quite clearly what are their needs.  I support this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is too early in the morning for that.  First, the amendments do not take account of the purpose and rationale of a barring order, which was originally created by the 1976 Maintenance Act to enable one spouse to have the other spouse ousted from the family home, notwithstanding their mutual duty of cohabitation arising from the marriage bond.  Prior to that, the only effective civil remedy available to a spouse who was subjected to violence in the family home was to seek an injunction in the High Court ordering the offending spouse to leave the home.  This procedure was expensive and slow, and there were difficulties of enforcement.</P>
      <P>A provision which would enable a third party to seek a court order suspending the right and duty of spouses to live together as man and wife is completely at variance with the concept of the barring order, which is essentially a remedy as between spouses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of these amendments, namely, the protection of the children of married couples, comes within the ambit of the Children Act, 1908, which confers powers on health boards in this regard. As Members are aware, the Minister for Health has that legislation under review at present and a new Children (Care and Protection) Bill will be circulated in the very near future.  I would suggest that a <Col N="241" /> debate on that Bill, or on the Private Members' Bill on the same subject at present before the Dáil if it were to reach this House, would be a more appropriate occasion to raise the matters covered by these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has corrected one point for me in that.  I think I said that the original Bill was in 1976. However, I would like to say to the Minister that what was appropriate in 1976 is not appropriate now.  In the 11 years since we have had a number of reports, a great deal of insight into the motivation for this brutality or violence, has been the toleration level and the desperation level of it.  To talk about intent in 1976 and mutual duty to cohabitate and all of that, is very old-fashioned, if the Minister does not mind me saying so.  We should be prepared to look to the future.  We are not going to get another piece of legislation or amendment on this Bill, until goodness knows when.  It is better when a Bill is going through the two Houses that the views of people who have first-hand experience of these cases, as has Senator Robinson and as, indeed, I have had, and the options suggested by them are seriously considered rather than, with all due respect, the views of the parliamentary draftsman and the staff of the Department.  They are excellent in terms of the theory of legislation but who, I suggest, do not know what is happening in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One has to concede that there is a certain logic in the Minister's argument.  The trouble is, unfortunately, that, first, we do not know what is going to be in a children's Bill or when the Bill will be published.  I have to concede that the Government have been quite expeditious in producing legislation, far more in many ways than their predecessors. I do not know if that is simply because they are producing legislation which was almost finished by their predecessors&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; I will leave that for <Col N="242" /> former members of the previous Government to comment on.  Nevertheless, there is a certain argument from authority here in that the drafter of these amendments is a reasonably well-qualified lawyer, qualified both in academic terms and in terms of professional experience.  The Minister would have to convince me a little bit that something similar to the provisions contained in amendments Nos. 1 and 10 was going to be contained in the children's Bill and also to persuade me that the children's Bill was going to be produced reasonably quickly before I could consider withdrawing these amendments. It is quite clear that there is a problem in this area.  The Minister in his reply did not attempt to deny that there was a problem in the area relating to amendments Nos. 1 and 10, that children are at risk and that in our legislation the primary concern must be for the welfare of children.</P>
      <P>In many ways we have delayed long enough.  The children's Bill, and the flaws in our children's legislation, were identified as far back as 1969 or 1970 when the Care Memorandum was produced.  We have waited through commissions of various kinds since then for amending legislation to do with children.  It appears to me that in the light of the amendments proposed to the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) (Amendment) Bill, 1987, it would be appropriate to incorporate into this Bill what has been learned about the deficiencies of the law in relation to the protection of spouses and children over the past number of years arising out of the operation of the existing legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister specifically, will there be a provision in the children's Bill, or can he give any sort of an undertaking, that would meet the requirements of amendment No. 10? To say that it would be more appropriate in another Bill is not the same as saying that it will be there.  I would like to know if the Government yet have a view on the principal contained in amendment No. 10 because that is what I would like to talk about rather than the appropriateness of it in this legislation.  When it comes to <Col N="243" /> the appropriateness of it in this area, as Senator Fennell has already said, I would have to defer to the opinion of Senator Robinson who is reasonably conpetent to judge the appropriateness of an amendment like this and where it properly fits in legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">

      <P>I must say that I have not always had the same confidence in the competence of the Senator who proposed these amendments as has Senator Ryan but, I suppose I am entitled to disagree when the occasion presents itself.  I would certainly not like the House to think that I, or everybody here, would take it that there is only one such authority in legislation such as this, namely, the Senator in whose name the amendments stand. Nothing could be further from the truth. That should be put down as marker No. 1.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan appeared to be somewhat confused with regard to what is going on right here and now.  I hope I am paraphrasing him correctly.  If experience shows that legislation needs to be amended &mdash; this can very well and does happen and many amendments come about as a result of experience of how legislation works &mdash; it does not necessarily mean that you can amend a Bill which does not provide for the type of amendments we are talking about.  The point I am making is that this Bill does not allow for the type of amendments we are discussing as additional amendments from Senator Fennell.  I have said here what is involved in the amendments and I would like to refer Senators and Senator Fennell in particular to the Long Title of the 1981 Bill which is</P>
      <P>an Act to make proper provision for the protection of a spouse and any children whose safety and welfare requires it because of the conduct of the other spouse ...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I have shown to the House that the proper place for the type of amendment the Senators are supporting here today is within the legislation which I mentioned that the Minister for Health <Col N="244" /> will have before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the reasonably near future.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan, as an old, seasoned campaigner must surely know that it would be very unwise of me to give him an assurance here and now whether my colleague, the Minister for Health, will accept or not accept amendments put forward.  Senator Ryan must know, as we all know, that to any Minister of any Government coming in here on matters in which we are all keenly interested, matters on which we all want to be 100 per cent helpful, any reasonable and fair amendment would be acceptable.  I believe that what is in the amendment set down by Senator Robinson is very appropriate to the health Bill which will be coming before the House shortly.  If a reasoned case is made then, and I have no doubt but that that can be and will be done, I would be confident of its being given every consideration.</P>

      <P>I would have thought that if these amendments were outside the scope of this Bill they would have been ruled out of order by you, a Chathaoirligh.  It appears to me that the authority as to whether amendments are appropriate or are proper for legislation is yours and not the Government's, the Minister's or his advisers.  The Minister and his advisers may be of the opinion that there is a better place for the amendments but these amendments are accepted as being within the scope of this Bill by virtue of the fact that they are accepted as amendments which are in order to be considered on Commitee Stage of this Bill.  Consequently, I am at a little bit of a loss to understand the Minister.  If the Minister is saying that he thinks there is somewhere better for them, that is fine, but he cannot tell me that somehow, because the Long Title of the original legislation said something, that these amendments are outside the scope of the Bill.  If they were outside the scope of the Bill they would not be in order.</P>

      <P>I have to concur with that because I do not understand how <Col N="245" /> providing for these amendments can be outside the scope of the Long Title as read by the Minister.  It seems that that wording leaves room for quite a degree of manoeuvring.</P>
      <P>Further, the Minister suggested that the amendment concerning the protection of children will come in under the proposed Children Bill and that will do nothing for the wife, the spouse in question. I am asking the Minister to look at her case in the event that the circumstances she is living in are so dangerous and so intimidatory that she cannot take this barring or protection order.</P>

      <P>Just in case there is some misunderstanding here about a difference between my ruling and what has been said by the Minister or by Senator Brendan Ryan, let me say that I ruled that these amendments were in order under Standing Order 88 and I ruled that we would take them on Committee Stage.  I thought at the time I ruled that the amendments were in order, that they were not in conflict in any way with the principle of the Bill.  However, because, as the Minister has just said, there is other legislation coming from the Government which is very close to the Bill before him today as Minister for Justice, the grey line between the amendments we are debating and the Bill which may be the next legislation may be very narrow, but I thought, as Cathaoirleach, that the amendments were relevant to the legislation before me when I made my ruling.  It is one of these grey line areas again.</P>

      <P>I support the principle of Senator Fennell's argument.  It is an opportunity in a Bill where we are protecting the rights of spouses &ldquo;where spouses are unable ...&rdquo;.  For different reasons emphasis must be laid on the word &ldquo;unable&rdquo;.  I do not put so much weight on &ldquo;unwilling&rdquo; as on &ldquo;unable&rdquo; because the alternative may be put on a spouse by the other spouse.  This is an opportunity to correct and protect that.</P>
      <P>The Minister is quite right to refer to the Children (Care and Protection) Bill. I happened to be a member of the select committee who dealt with Committee Stage of the Children Bill under the previous administration.  There are certain difficulties with that Bill, or with parts of it, and that was one which took up much of our time.  If we can put an amendment to this Bill I think this would be an opportune time to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I promise that this will be my last contribution because I do not have evidence in depth to pursue a long discussion on this.  I want to associate myself with what Senator Fennell has just said.  I cannot understand how a children Bill can contain a clause which is specifically related to the difficulties of a spouse. We are talking essentially about a children Bill which would contain a clause enabling a health board or similar authority to seek a protection order or, presumably, a barring order against a person living in a family home, as opposed to a question of taking a child into care or protecting a child outside the home.  We are talking about protecting a child inside the home by excluding somebody from the family home.  I make no bones about the fact that I was not particularly well <Col N="247" /> prepared for this discussion because the notice of the job I had to do was rather short.  It is, as you said, a Chathaoirligh, a grey area.</P>
      <P>The issue here is effectively the protection of the right of a spouse to do something he or she would wish to do but which he or she is unable, for one reason or another, to do.  It is essentially the child who is being protected, but the intent is to protect the child in a manner or in a form which it is presumed the spouse would wish if he or she were able or willing to do so.  Therefore, it is not necessarily a matter for a children Bill.  It is a grey area but on balance it ought to be in a Bill like this.  Parts of this amendment would seem, I think, inappropriate in what would be designated as a children Bill because it effectively would be a protection of the rights of a spouse rather than the protection of the rights of a child.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like to make one other small point.  I do not think this power would be used very often.  It would be very rarely used because, in the main, women will go and get their own protection or barring order.  Certainly, there have been cases which I have come across in the past.  In one instance, long after I had been involved with the case, a woman was killed by her husband.  We have had over the past five years a number of wives who were killed by their husbands.  This is a terrible thought, but it is a reality.  If we look at that kind of violence, viciousness and determination to beat a spouse, we are talking about a woman who would be unable, because of fear, to take out a barring order.  I would like the Minister to consider that.  I do not think it is something that is going to be taken every day or every week in the courts, but that the power would be there for a board for a designated body, if that was necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a problem with what the Senator suggests, regarding when the power should be used and when it should not be used.  One just cannot say it could be used once a week or twice <Col N="248" /> a month if the power is there.  There is that difficulty.  It is very easy, in legislation like this, to cross over the line unintentionally on marriage law, on law for the protection of threatened children and on law which has to do with the protection of spouses.  There are three different matters and this is the first of them.</P>
      <P>The amendment put forward in the name of Senator Robinson states: &ldquo;In circumstances where there are reasonable grounds for believing that the safety or welfare of any child so requires,&rdquo;. What is suggested in that amendment, having regard to its wording, makes it far more appropriate to the Children Bill.  I am quite satisfied that that is the case. While I share the concern and see difficulties and would like to see provision made for the circumstances outlined, and would be very sympathetic with the cases made I truly believe it is a matter for the other Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `person sharing the household' means any person who normally resides in the home of the applicant spouse;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="249" /> This is again an attempt to reflect some of the realities of life today, in particular in the area of the protection of children. The Bill as it stands talks about protection orders prohibiting what is called here the respondent spouse from using or threatening to use violence against, molesting or putting in fear the applicant spouse or the child.  I emphasise the child, but it could be either the applicant spouse or the child.  The only person against whom a protection order can be sought is the respondent spouse.  That is a very narrow vision of what is the reality of many people's experience today, where the threat of violence, or of molestation, or of putting in fear can often emanate from somebody other than the spouse.  A person may not necessarily be a spouse in law.  A person may be a relative other than a spouse &mdash; an uncle or a grandparent. There have been a number of horrifying and spectacular court cases recently involving molestation of children by people who were living in the family home but who clearly were not one of the parents of the children.</P>
    <P>It is a logical and reasonable extension of the intent of the Bill to extend the protection contained in this Bill so that any person residing in the home who is a threat, who is threatening to use violence, threatening to molest, or threatening to put in fear either the applicant spouse or a child should be the subject of a protection order.  It is not a fundamental amendment that the Minister should have any problems with.  It is not an amendment which in any way undermines any other principle of family law.  It is a reasonable reflection of the problems many people have in domestic life today. It is an amendment which would extend the protection of the Bill without in any way altering the principles involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with this amendment but I am conscious of the fact that it is something the Minister possibly will be able to refer down the line to the coming Children Bill.  This could cause some great difficulties.  It would be anything but straightforward.  We are talking <Col N="250" /> about the molestation of children.  I would like to think we could bring it in at this point because one is always anxious to insert amendments into existing legislation rather than have them deferred for some other pending legislation. I would like to think that this would be desirable, but I accept that there will be difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions.  Amendments Nos. 1 and 10 are, I suspect, based on a misconception of the purpose of a barring order.  It is a statutory remedy available as between spouses in cases of domestic violence whereby the applicant spouse can have the respondent spouse ousted from the family home notwithstanding the matrimonial duty of cohabitation. Apart from the argument of principle, there are practical reasons, as Senator Fennell has said, why these amendments were unacceptable.</P>
      <P>Consider a situation where a married couple are living in a room in their landlord's house.  If the landlord is anxious to get rid of the tenants and uses violence, or threatens violence in his efforts to evict them, under these amendments either of the couple will be able to seek to have the landlord barred from his own house. In other words, what would otherwise be a dispute between a landlord and tenant, for which the courts can already provide adequate remedies, could end up in the family courts with the landlord being put out of his house.  This would clearly be a wholly inappropriate and unwarranted use of the barring order remedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that, in many cases like this, the householder may well be the parent or in-law of one of the married couple concerned does not make the use of a barring order in such circumstances any less inappropriate.  Nor, indeed, where violence is offered by a person sharing the household to a child of the married couple rather than to one of the spouses. The fact is that there are appropriate remedies available for this kind of situation. In particular, in the case of children at risk of domestic violence, there is, as I have already said in relation to <Col N="251" /> earlier amendments, the Children Act, 1908, which offers health boards a number of courses of action.  Again, I would suggest that the subject matter of these amendments would also be more appropriate to the debate on the proposed Children (Care and Protection) Bill or on the Private Members Bill on the same subject at present before the Dáil.  In this particular instance I would hope the cases that can be made will be made and that they will be given every consideration by the Minister who will be dealing with that legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing this amendment because if it were accepted it would mean that a barring order could be made in summary proceedings putting a spouse out of his or her own home without notice and without affording that spouse any opportunity to argue the case before the court or challenge the evidence on which the order was granted. This is a draconian solution to the problem of domestic violence which, in my view, simply cannot be justified.</P>
      <P>The right to live in one's own home is far too important to be set aside except on the most serious grounds, and after due process of law.  That process requires that a person against whom allegations are made should be entitled to be heard in his or her own defence.  To put a spouse out of the family home on the untested evidence of the other spouse &mdash; no matter for how short a period &mdash; would in my view be in breach of that principle and is unacceptable.  If the degree of violence being committed by one spouse against the other is so gross or persistent as to demand that the offending spouse be removed forthwith from the family home, then the remedy surely lies in invoking the criminal law.  The offender could then be arrested and brought before the court and remanded in custody if the court considered that necessary.</P>
      <P>The existing provision for the grant of a protection order on an <i>ex parte</i> basis pending the hearing of an application for a barring order would seem ample to deal with any less serious situation.  The grant of a protection order in such circumstances is quite acceptable since it merely directs the respondent spouse not to use or threaten violence or molest or put in fear the applicant spouse; these are acts which no person has a right to do in any event.  The particular advantage of the protection order is that the Garda, who are notified of every such order, have the power to arrest without warrant for breaches of the order.  The possibility of immediate arrest is generally acknowledged to be effective in preventing offenders from engaging in further violence.</P>

      <P>In page 4, between lines 8 and 9 to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>5.&mdash;Section 14 (1) of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the addition of the following:</P>
      <P>but a Report of the details and decisions taken shall be kept for publication maintaining the anonymity of parties to the case.</P>
      <P>I would like to apologise for the lateness of my amendment.  I canvassed the views of a number of groups about the aspect of the hearings of the proceedings under this Act.  There has been general unhappiness and concern over the years since 1976 that because cases are heard <i>in camera</i> we do not have any idea of the details, the numbers or the circumstances. This has led to a situation where two things have happened.  The public have no perception of the extent of the problem in family law.  I think this was very much in evidence during the constitutional referendum on divorce legislation.  When people cannot speak about the very real problems that come up in family law because most of the cases are held <i>in camera,</i> it is as if they did not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I knew that this Bill was coming <Col N="256" /> before the Houses of the Oireachtas I asked groups like the ICA, the AIM group and a number of others as to what they felt about the cases being held <i>in camera</i> and if they would favour an open court hearing, with the proceedings being reported.  I did not feel happy that this would be the right move as I remembered the times I sat in court and listened to a couple arguing over the price of a towel or a pair of shoes for a child and this was in between all the traffic offences and stolen bicycles cases with the public there listening.  That is not appropriate or right either.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is that the details of these cases are buried.  When the groups came back to me, the ICA &mdash; I suppose because of the nature of where their members live &mdash; did not want to have the cases publicised at all.  They were quite happy with the situation as it is phrased in section 14 of the Principal Act.  The <i>in camera</i> provision should continue. The AIM group, who would be more familiar with the cases and the outcome of cases, felt that some change might be brought about.  I am putting it to the Minister but I do not know what his response will be or what he can do about the matter.  AIM said that, with regard to section 14 of the Principal Act, they are in favour of the publication of certain facts and figures.  They said that in the present situation it is easy to minimise the extent of family violence.  They give the instance of people saying there is no incest or little incest in Ireland.  We know now that is not the case.  It is equally easy to exaggerate aspects of the problem. Any woman can get her husband barred if she so wishes.  AIM group feel that the following details could be published without threatening the essential anonymity of the plaintiff and the defendant: the number of cases heard monthly; the number of barring orders granted; the reason in brief for making the orders; the number of protection orders made by the court; and the reason in brief for making the orders.  They said that in this way a picture of the real situation in respect of family violence and the judicial attitude to it could be formed.  AIM feel that <Col N="257" /> the general public and the press should continue to be excluded from these hearings and that a court official could record the information which would be for publication. That really is the position.  We should have a report on the cases, the reasons they were taken and the decisions made by the court to enable us to have a body of information which, I think, is important for many reasons.  It is important in the long term for policy and planning. It should be available also for researchers and for people who are interested in the process of law within the family.</P>

      <P>Members will appreciate that I have difficulty in dealing with this amendment at such short notice.  It raises the whole issue of whether family law cases should be reported and, if so, how.  The general rule is that cases are heard otherwise than in public.  The only source of reports of such cases is in legal reports of cases where the names of the parties are not disclosed.  Any change in that position should be considered carefully in the overall context and not just in relation to barring orders and protection orders.  I fully appreciate the Senator's disquiet at the present situation but I would prefer to consider the matter as a whole and come up with a solution which will have general application in family law cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that the points made by Senator Fennell are very valuable points and I hope that she can understand my difficulty with regard to acceptance of her amendment.  The issue she has raised is a general issue, not just a specific matter in regard to this Bill.  It is a general issue concerning the reporting of family law cases generally right across the board. Changes in this Bill cannot be made without considering the effects of such changes on other areas of family law.  I appreciate Senator Fennell's concern. Even though I cannot accept her amendment I will certainly give an undertaking to have the matter looked at, having regard to the case she has made, to see if we can come up with some solution to the problem in an effort to get a general <Col N="258" /> application on the matter.  It would be a wrong move to agree to a specific amendment at this stage without giving the matter consideration.  I share the Senator's concern.</P>

      <P>I am mentioning it in the context of this Bill because it is the first one of its kind that has come before me as a legislator.  I think the Minister is right.  It is something that has to be examined across the board in all family law cases.  As compared with other countries we are ill-served by the lack of case law and the reporting on family law cases.  I would like to ask the Minister if it is something that can be incorporated in legislation or is it something that has to be directed to the court?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a long awaited Bill.  I know it will be recognised by all sides as an important step in strengthening and securing the position of the policyholder, not alone in his dealings with insurance companies but in his dealings with insurance intermediaries as well.  I look forward to a welcome for this Bill from all sides of the House, and to an interesting and informed Second Stage debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill as published has three basic objectives: first, to strengthen the Minister's legislative powers in relation to the supervision of insurers; second, to <Col N="260" /> regulate commissions paid to intermediaries, where the policyholders' interests so require; and third, to introduce a form of regulation for insurance intermediaries.</P>
    <P>The text of the Bill before the House was presented by my predecessor to the 24th Dáil in July 1986 but lapsed on its dissolution.  Since assuming office in March last I have received many submissions from interested quarters on this Bill.  Most of these supported the broad thrust of its provisions.  In the light of these submissions, I will be proposing amendments on Committee Stage, many of which will be of a detailed or technical nature.  A number of amendments will deal with the substantive issues in Part IV of the Bill, dealing with insurance intermediaries, where the Government have decided on certain changes; I will be addressing these aspects in detail later in my speech.</P>
    <P>Before discussing the provisions of the Bill, I want to dwell for a short time on the role of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to insurance and on the problems facing the insurance market in the State.  The basic duty of the Minister in relation to insurance companies is the supervision of insurers to see that they are capable of meeting their liabilities and that they are solvent, and to take appropriate measures to rectify the situation if they are not.  This is a duty laid down by both national and EC law.</P>
    <P>It is not the role of the Minister to run the businesses of insurers, to make commercial judgments for them, or to exercise business acumen on their behalf. The directors and officers of an insurer are responsible in the first instance for the direction of the insurer's affairs, and for compliance with the law.  Others such as auditors and actuaries who are charged with specific statutory duties to the company must also play their part.  In this Bill I am adding to some of these duties.  I am also taking power to require that those appointed as directors or officers of an insurer are suitably qualified or experienced to handle the task.  Of course, these powers do not amount to underwriting the effectiveness of such persons in rising <Col N="261" /> to the task.  This is something which no amount of legislation could do.</P>
    <P>What interests most people about insurance is not the supervisory aspects, except when crises occur, but the issues of cost, availability, and coverage of insurance, in particular motor and liability insurance.  We have problems in these areas.  Insurance costs are too high. Some classes of risks have difficulty in securing cover.  Let us all be clear on a few things, however.  The reasons for these difficulties are almost wholly outside the direct power of the Minister to control, and indeed in many cases are down to the individual actions of the citizen and the views which people take of their rights.</P>
    <P>A large element of cost of motor insurance must be attributed to the irresponsible attitudes of many motorists to driving and to the law.  We see examples of this daily.  In the workplace an improved attitude to safety by both employers and employees is called for to reduce the number of incidents giving rise to claims.  We can no longer afford to be tolerant of petty crimes and vandalism if we wish to see the cost of property insurance come down.  In all cases it is action by the individual or by the community which counts.</P>
    <P>The greater awareness of many citizens in claiming their full rights and entitlements to compensation under the law has meant that many more claims are made nowadays in respect of events which ten or 20 years ago would not have attracted a claim.  Undoubtedly as citizens we value these rights and we would resist efforts to curtail their exercise.  We should, however, be aware that increased claims consciousness and a more litigious environment have a direct adverse effect on insurance costs.</P>
    <P>We have to tackle the roots of these problems and not just the symptoms.  The problems are not amenable to simplistic solutions.  Issuing directions to insurers to take on risks they do not wish, at premiums they cannot afford to charge, will only spell disaster.  Putting provisions in law to make it obligatory to quote for certain classes of business will drive up <Col N="262" /> the cost so that the very worst risks can be provided for and quite probably result in fewer insurers wishing to compete here.</P>
    <P>I do not deny that there are things that can be done by Government.  Much has been done.  In motor and liability insurance, procedures have been instituted with insurers to deal with cases where the market has declined cover.  We now intend to concentrate on measures which will influence the cost and availability of insurance cover.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided to tackle costs by proceeding in the next Dáil session with the Bill to abolish juries in personal injury cases.  The Minister for the Environment plans to introduce new legislation to strengthen the road traffic code and to deal more effectively with certain aspects of uninsured driving and other offences.</P>
    <P>An inter-departmental committee under my Department's chairmanship have recently completed a study into the various factors which are responsible for high premiums.  The report will be put before the Government in the near future.  Measures which are likely to be recommended are: as a follow on from the abolition of juries in personal injury cases, the establishment of a book of quantum of damages for use as a guideline to future awards; a pre-trial procedure system to thrash out much of the time consuming aspects of cases; abolishing the two senior counsel rule; putting into effect the recommendations of the Barrington Commission report on safety at work; greater involvement by the insurance industry in the areas of road and work place safety and increasing public awareness and personal responsibility for safety at work and on the roads.</P>
    <P>I would hope for rapid progress on most, if not all, of these points so that we can start to tackle and get under control as soon as possible these component elements of insurance costs.  All these actions are positive proof of this Government's determination to grapple with the problems which have built up over many years.  Changes will not happen or take full effect overnight but I for one am <Col N="263" /> confident that the decisive action taken by this Government will be seen in times to come as the turning point in the insurance fortunes of this State.</P>
    <P>Within my Department we have built up a considerable body of expertise in dealing with insurance.  The training and calibre of staff have always been high and are constantly being added to.  We are a small administration.  We cannot afford the depths of staff resources employed in other countries but I am happy that the provisions in this Bill to allow for the charging of fees for supervision will ensure that the required level of staff resources and expertise will continue to be made available.  Steady progress has also been made with the computerisation of the insurance branch of the Department which will contribute to the efficiency of the supervisory service.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn to the content of the Bill and to describe briefly its main provisions.  Part I contains the usual preliminary matters to be dealt with in any Bill.  There is no need to go into detail except on one or two sections.</P>
    <P>Section 3 introduces substantial penalties for offences under the Act and increases existing penalties for breaches of insurance law to modern day levels. Stronger provisions are also being laid down in respect of penalties for the deliberate provision of false or misleading information.  This is important since the authorisation and supervision of insurers must rely on true and accurate data being submitted to the Minister.  Section 7 confers fee-charging powers on the Minister. Fees of this nature are not uncommon in other States.  No level of fees has been settled on yet but the intention will be to charge on a break-even basis for the costs of supervision.  Section 9 of the Bill repeals some provisions of earlier insurance law, which are long spent.</P>
    <P>Turning to Part II of the Bill, sections 11 to 14 contain provisions which are at the heart of insurance supervision.  These relate, <i>inter alia</i>, to the submission of regular information by insurers, supplemented by specific requests for <Col N="264" /> additional data or special examinations; and to the specification by the Minister of the essential rules regarding the estimation of insurance liabilities and the nature, spread and valuation of assets to meet these liabilities.  This is, of course, the system we have been operating for several years past.  The returns are currently made under various powers in four sets of regulations made between 1976 and 1986 under the European Communities Act, 1972.  Also relevant is a set of administrative rules made in 1976 governing the assets of non-life insurers. The powers now being taken in sections 11 and 12 will copperfasten these rules and requirements in substantive insurance law.</P>
    <P>In section 13 the powers are being extended to give a general power to the Minister to require information, both in relation to insurers themselves and in relation to a widely defined category of bodies which may be connected with insurers.  Practical experience suggests that this extension of powers is necessary. Insurers, of their nature, will have many and diverse investments in, and relationships with, other commercial concerns. The fortunes of such connected bodies may be intimately bound up with those of the insurer.</P>
    <P>Section 14 entrusts formal powers of investigation to the Minister and enjoins on insurers full co-operation in these exercises.  Furthermore, if the investigation reveals practices which are not in the policyholders' interest, the Minister may order these practices to cease.  The practice of special examinations of insurers' affairs is not unusual.  As a matter of routine, a number of insurers are selected each year by my Department for study by outside consultants, particularly in relation to any special aspects that have arisen from the examination of the insurers' annual returns.</P>
    <P>Insurance supervision cannot guarantee an insurer's solvency and it is important that the Minister should have the powers to take immediate action when problems come to light.  Section 15 of the Bill provides the Minister with the power to intervene in the running of the business <Col N="265" /> of an insurer who has encountered financial difficulties and whose solvency is in doubt.  The powers of intervention include directions to cease taking on new business, to dispose of investments, to limit premium income, or to localise assets in the State.  The powers are also exercisable on a number of other grounds specified in the section.  While not directly related to solvency, these grounds are obviously of importance in a financial context, namely, the power to intervene where unsatisfactory reinsurance is in force, or where the level and nature of business being written is radically different from the financial projections set out in the business plan submitted by the insurer when seeking authorisation.</P>
    <P>With the House's indulgence I will skip section 16 for the moment, since section 17 deals with the qualifications of directors and managers and is relevant in finishing off this overview of insurance supervision.  At present, under EC directives, insurers seeking authorisation are required to submit details of proposed directors and managers, and the Minister does not authorise the insurer if he has an objection to any such person proposed. Section 17 retains this system but extends the Minister's powers of requiring information to existing office holders in insurers and to any new appointments to such offices.  More importantly, the Minister may object to any person holding a position of responsibility with an insurer if it appears to him that the person is not suitable.  The Minister may require the insurer to take certain measures, along the lines discussed in connection with section 15, for as long as the person in question holds the position with the insurer.</P>
    <P>Additionally the Minister may veto the appointment of any director, chief executive or authorised agent, if the person to be appointed is not in the Minister's view a suitable person.</P>
    <P>The powers in section 17 are new in an Irish context but they are a common feature of supervision abroad.  It is vitally important that those responsible for directing the affairs of an insurer should be open to the tests of suitability and <Col N="266" /> competence which this Bill provides.  A very heavy duty falls on the shoulders of such persons and the public should be able to know that an independent mechanism exists to weed out those who are unsuitable or not qualified for the task.</P>
    <P>While my first role is the supervision of insurers from a solvency point of view, I have also a function to play in the supervision of the insurance market &mdash; in seeing how insurers operate and how they meet the demands put on them by those seeking insurance.  The provisions in sections 16 and 18 fall under this heading of market supervision.  Section 16 gives me the power to monitor insurers' pricing practices and the contractual terms on which business is offered.</P>
    <P>I am also taking power to require insurers by order to display premium rates and to provide information to consumers on policy conditions and rates in specified classes of insurance.  The obvious candidates for such orders are motor, household and possibly life insurance, and I am sure the taking of these powers will be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Section 18 deals with a different problem. The possession of an insurance authorisation means a responsibility to write business and to make a market in the class of business authorised.  Unfortunately cases can arise where insurers make little or no use of the authorisation in specific classes, or temporarily withdraw from underwriting.  There may be very good reasons for insurers doing so. We cannot force insurers to write insurance but we should certainly be able to act to withdraw or suspend authorisations in classes where no business is being done, or where the scale of business has been so reduced as to amount in effect to a cessation of business.</P>
    <P>The central focus of insurance supervision is on &ldquo;direct&rdquo; insurers, that is, insurers who deal directly with the public. Insurers themselves in taking on risks seek to minimise their risk exposure by reinsuring risks, or parts of risks, with other direct insurers and with specialist reinsurers.  Reinsurance is an international and specialised form of insurance.  It is regulated in many countries <Col N="267" /> abroad, but not here, except to the extent that it is engaged in by direct insurers authorised by the Minister.  To attempt purely local supervision of specialist reinsurance in an Irish context would be ineffective.  However, there are measures we can take to regulate a limited aspect of reinsurance and to promote a degree of transparency in the operations of specialist reinsurers in the State. This is the purpose of section 19.  First, on grounds of commercial prudence it prohibits direct insurers from accepting reinsurance except in a class for which they are authorised as a direct insurer. Thus, to take an extreme example, a life insurer would not be permitted to take on non-life reinsurance.  Second, it requires specialist reinsurers established in the State to identify themselves to the Minister and to publish accounts in such form as the Minister specifies.</P>
    <P>Section 20 of the Bill requires a minimum paid up share capital of £500,000 of insurers seeking authorisation and empowers the Minister to regulate the nature of the share capital.  This section incorporates into law present administrative practice and requirements in relation to the authorisation of insurers.</P>
    <P>Section 21 deals with the attachment of conditions to authorisations and requires insurers to adhere to such conditions on penalty of suspension or revocation of authorisation.</P>
    <P>The next section of the Bill relates to a type of insurance which has its origins in the last century in different social and economic times.  I refer to industrial assurance &mdash; the type of life assurance paid for by weekly premiums and collected on a door-to-door basis.  The individual sums assured tend to be low.</P>
    <P>Within the past ten years the number of industrial assurance policies in force has declined spectacularly.  At the same time the number of ordinary life assurance policies has trebled.  The decline in industrial assurance policies, combined with the increased cost of collecting premia, has led to a situation in which the cost of running the business eats up <Col N="268" /> so much of the premium that, after providing to meet death claims, there is little left for investment on behalf of the policyholder. For this reason, as many financial commentators have noted, the value for money of industrial assurance has declined.</P>
    <P>Changing social patterns, better social welfare provision, the increased use of bank accounts, the expansion of credit unions, have all combined to reduce the importance which this type of insurance once had as a prudent and convenient means of saving.  I do not wish to denigrate the continued value of this insurance.  However, the fact remains that sums assured under industrial branch business in 1985 amounted to just 3 per cent of sums assured under ordinary life business.</P>
    <P>Industrial assurance companies have for some time sought a number of changes in the law relating to industrial assurance to facilitate the continued underwriting of this class of business.</P>
    <P>The first change desired is the removal of the current legal requirement that the funds in respect of industrial assurance and in respect of ordinary life assurance be kept separate by the insurer.  The removal of the requirement would allow life assurers to write mixed insurance policies, where the premia could be either collected at home, or paid via a direct debit, at the choice of the insured, or in certain cases, at the requirement of the insurer.  Section 22 (1) of the Bill facilitates the amalgamation of funds.  I want to make it clear that there are no adverse solvency implications in this amalgamation. While the funds had to be kept separate under insurance law, there was never a requirement to keep assets separate.</P>
    <P>The second request by assurers was to be allowed to reduce the frequency of collection of premia in certain areas where collection costs were very high. This is allowed in section 22 (2), although a frequency of not less than two months is still required.  Both the changes I have detailed are permissive rather than <Col N="269" /> mandatory.  Insurers need not amalgamate the funds, or revise collection periods unless they so wish.</P>
    <P>In agreeing to these changes the Government were conscious of the position of the policy holder.  We have to face the choice either of making changes now to ensure that industrial assurance continues to be written and that policyholders get a better return for their premiums, or of allowing the present position to continue and a situation to be reached where industrial assurance fades away.  I feel we have struck the right balance in the changes without prejudicing the rights of policyholders in general.</P>
    <P>Finally, section 22 (3) increases to more modern day amounts the sums which can be assured under industrial assurance policies.</P>
    <P>In dealing with industrial assurance we have delved into the past.  This is also the case in section 23 which seeks to remove certain impediments to the writing of group policies of insurance contained in 18th and 19th Century Insurance Acts. The provisions of section 23 are uncontroversial.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections in Part II of the Bill are a rather mixed bag.  Section 24 extends to the Industrial Credit Company and Fóir Teoranta certain facilities to conduct suretyship and guarantee business which were extended to licensed banks in the State by the Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1978.  The effect of the present section is to place ICC and Fóir Teoranta on a similar footing.</P>
    <P>Section 25 and 26 are technical in their construction but straightforward in their intent.  They are designed to close off a possible loophole whereby, under present legislation, a friendly society could be formed to conduct commercial insurance activity, without being supervised under the Insurance Acts.  Section 25 will mean that the insurance activities permitted to be carried on by friendly societies, and in section 26 by trade unions, will be strictly mutual self-help activities &mdash; the sort of activities one associates with the <i>raison d'être</i> of these <Col N="270" /> organisations anyhow.</P>
    <P>Sections 27 and 28 deal with the unfortunate aspects of insurance resulting from the demise of an insurer.  Section 27 is merely a precautionary measure to ensure that no petition can be presented for the winding-up of an insurer without the Minister being involved or heard. There are, after all, a number of courses open to the Minister which could be preferable to the winding-up in particular situations &mdash; for example, the appointment of an administrator or the promotion of a take-over by another insurer.</P>
    <P>Provision is being made in section 28 to alter the applicability of the Insurance Compensation Fund.  The fund will continue to be available to the two existing companies under administration but no future administrator of a non-life insurer would have access to the fund.  The appointment of any further administrator is not foreseen but the legislative framework, which is in the Insurance (No. 2) Act of 1983, will stand.</P>
    <P>At present, in addition to administrators, the fund can be used to meet claims arising in the liquidation of the non-life insurer.  In future, in any such liquidation the fund would support only non-commercial personal claimants, and in their case a limit of £650,000 or 65 per cent of the claim, whichever is the lesser, will be applied.  Refunds of premiums, or liabilities in respect of policies issued outside the State, will also be excluded.</P>
    <P>These changes represent a significant reduction in the present levels of protection offered by the compensation fund.  For that reason they are not lightly proposed.  The changes are, however, absolutely necessary because the present arrangements are quite simply too generous, exposing the fund to a potentially unlimited liability.  Adequate arrangements have been made to cater for all foreseeable demands arising from the present administration of two companies but it would be completely untenable to continue to leave the fund exposed to the possibility, however remote, of any further new demands in the future.  The current statutory arrangeabl <Col N="271" /> ment under which the Minister strikes a maximum levy of 2 per cent on non-life premium income each year is the most that could reasonably be demanded of or borne by policyholders to provide against insolvencies on the part of insurance companies.</P>
    <P>It is to be hoped that the fund will not be called into action again, but if it is it seems reasonable to try to strike a balance between the burden this would place on it while, at the same time, providing some measure of compensation for those who might lose out most.  This is what the Bill seeks to achieve.  I hope the House will appreciate the reasons for the change.</P>
    <P>The final section in this part of the Bill contains important new requirements in relation to actuaries.  In future all life insurers with head offices in the State will be required to appoint an actuary to the company, if they have not already done so.  In fact most, if not all, such life companies have an appointed actuary and actuarial staff.  All new life insurers, upon authorisation, will be similarly required to appoint an actuary.  Section 29 further gives formal statutory recognition to the status of the actuary in the company.  The Minister is also empowered to specify the qualifications and experience of the appointed actuary, and in this way to add to the existing actuary qualification rules set out in regulations of the same name made as far back as 1940.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill concerns the commissions paid to intermediaries.  The provisions in this part are based almost entirely on similar provisions in the Insurance Bill, 1982, which was not proceeded with at the time because insurers arrived at a self-regulatory agreement on life insurance commissions.</P>
    <P>One may well ask why the State should concern itself in what might be regarded as private remuneration arrangements between insurers and insurance intermediaries. The answer is obvious.  It is the policyholder who ultimately pays for the commissions paid to intermediaries. <Col N="272" /> Increased commissions mean higher premiums or reduced benefits.  Additionally, excessive commissions can cause policies to be sold to unsuspecting customers on the basis of the return to the intermediary rather than of their intrinsic merit or suitability to the client.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year a few life assurance companies set out to get business by offering over-generous incentives, including holidays abroad, to intermediaries who were selling their policies. If this had proliferated, the customer's interest would have been seriously threatened.</P>
    <P>Following an immediate intervention by the Minister, there was a very welcome response from the industry in the form of a new commission agreement, subscribed to by all life offices in the country, which was put into effect from 1 August last.  This new agreement signals a return to common sense, and it is being monitored very closely to make sure that it is implemented not alone in the letter but also in spirit.  It is the Government's strong preference that the insurance industry regulates itself, but that regulation must be effective and must be seen to be effective.  Otherwise I will act in the consumer's interest.</P>
    <P>The form which this action can take is set out in sections 30 to 32.  Section 30 allows the Minister to serve notice on insurers requiring reductions in commissions. Section 31 prohibits payment of commission through benefits-in-kind or by way of loans, and prohibits the payment of commissions in advance. These prohibitions are necessary to prevent the controls in section 30 being circumvented. Section 32 empowers the Minister to revoke an insurer's authorisation if the insurer is convicted of an offence in relation to commission payments.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections in Part III of the Bill deal with certain consequences of the control of commissions.  Section 33 restricts a person convicted of an offence under sections 30 or 31 from advertising his insurance business, unless the commission <Col N="273" /> rates are reduced to those set out in the Minister's notice and do not contravene section 31.  Section 34 makes it an offence, subject to certain defences set out in the section, for an intermediary to accept a commission payment which is higher than that set out in the Minister's notice, or which otherwise contravenes the provisions of this Bill.  Section 35 allows a person to seek a refund of premiums on a life policy where excess commissions were paid.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the main object of this part of the Bill is to concentrate the minds of all practitioners in the industry on the desirability of continued and orderly self-regulation, but its provisions will be applied either in relation to life or non-life insurance if circumstances warrant.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the innovative part of the Bill, innovative in so far as no provisions exist in statute dealing with the important area of insurance intermediaries.  First of all, let me say that the vast majority of insurance intermediaries go about their business in a very responsible fashion. However, there have been calls in recent years from some quarters for provisions in law to deal with the difficulties that arise very occasionally in consumers' dealings with insurance brokers or agents.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill as it was published last year proposed a scheme for the statutory recognition of insurance brokers as meeting certain professional standards in the conduct of their business.  The raising of standards is an important issue which I know the two bodies representing the broking profession are pursuing vigorously. They are to be commended for their efforts.  High standards of integrity and professional competence are very desirable from the consumer's viewpoint. But financial protection for the consumer in the event of failure to meet such standards is the critically important factor at the end of the day.  The Government started with this basic premise in their consideration of how best to deal with the whole area of insurance intermediaries.</P>
    <P>The primary concern is to protect the consumer as far as practicable.  I emphasise <Col N="274" />&ldquo;as far as practicable&rdquo;.  Legislation cannot be expected to cosset the proverbial man in the street from every possible eventuality.  While, theoretically, a scheme of regulation could be designed to remedy all possible defects in this area, in practice the direct and indirect costs and inherent rigidity in any such system would rebound ultimately to the disadvantage of the consumer.  By outweighing the benefits conferred, such a scheme would be open to as much objection as the features it sought to remove.</P>
    <P>The Government do not believe that the provisions in relation to ministerial recognition of brokers in Part IV of the Bill as it stands, as opposed to those measures to financially protect consumers, would justify the setting up of a supervisory structure such as that proposed. This view is reinforced by many of the submissions which my Department have received since publication of the original Bill last year.  For example, it was envisaged at that time that most brokers would opt to join a recognised broking body and that the scheme of recognition would be a self-regulatory one with the recognised bodies exercising the necessary functions to protect consumer interests.  However, numerous individual brokers have made it clear to me that, for various reasons, they would not be prepared to join either of the existing broking bodies.  Accordingly, it is not intended to proceed with a scheme of formal recognition of brokers as originally envisaged.  The appropriate modifications will be proposed on Committee Stage.  At the same time, Part IV will strengthen certain financial protection elements for the benefit of consumers.</P>
    <P>The Government's intention is that Part IV of the Bill will establish minimum criteria for persons wishing to act as insurance brokers, to protect consumers. By far the greatest abuse that arises, from the perspective of the policyholder, is the loss suffered when an insurance intermediary goes out of business with substantial sums of clients' money unaccounted for.</P>
    <P>For this reason, two provisions in Part <Col N="275" /> IV of the Bill will be of considerable interest.  First, the requirement in section 39 for an insurance bond to be held by brokers and, second, the requirement in section 40 for brokers to keep a separate bank account for money owed to clients and to insurers.  The purpose of the bond is to provide a safety net for clients. However, it is important to recognise that the bonding requirement cannot be so onerous as to be unaffordable for some brokers or to create a closed shop situation, both of which would erode consumer sovereignty.</P>
    <P>The two main broking representative bodies in Ireland have expressed concern that a large number of their members will have serious difficulty in complying with the requirement in section 39 to hold a bond of £100,000.  Individual brokers and other interested parties have represented to me that the level of £100,000 may be either too much or too little, depending on the scale of operations of the broker concerned.</P>
    <P>In non-life insurance, bonding for brokers is not required to any great extent to protect consumers, as the effective position is that brokers are acting as agents of insurance companies for the purpose of collecting non-life premiums, which they hold in trust on behalf of the companies concerned.  In other words, payment of a premium to a broker in respect of non-life insurance is accepted in nearly all cases as payment to the insurer.</P>
    <P>In this connection, the broking representative bodies have pointed out that a possible interpretation of section 44, dealing with the treatment of premiums paid to agents, is to infer that premiums paid to a broker might no longer be deemed payment to the insurer.  To avoid misunderstanding, they have suggested that section 44 refer explicitly to brokers as well as agents.  I agree that this is a desirable clarification which can be dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>With most forms of life assurance, once a proposal has been accepted premiums are invariably paid direct to the insurer <Col N="276" /> and brokers are not involved.  Nevertheless, there are some gaps in financial protection for the consumer &mdash; for example, where money is entrusted to a broker before a proposal is accepted by an insurer &mdash; and this is where the bonding requirement will improve matters.  I favour a bond related to annual turnover, as opposed to a fixed sum of £100,000.</P>
    <P>A figure of, perhaps, 10 per cent of turnover may be appropriate, subject to an absolute minimum bond amount of £25,000.  I am in consultation with industry sources on this particular aspect and will return to the matter on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The position of insurance agents is catered for in the Bill.  Broadly speaking, the onus will be on insurance companies to stand over the persons they appoint as agents.  In the case of both brokers and agents, there are restrictions and prohibitions on certain persons from acting in the capacity of insurance intermediary. The sort of persons involved are those who have shown that their financial and commercial dealings leave a lot to be desired.</P>
    <P>I am also taking powers to lay down codes of conduct for brokers and agents in their dealings with their clients, insurers and other parties.  This will be of important benefit to consumers.  The two representative bodies of brokers in the State already lay down such codes, but I consider it desirable to have powers to lay down codes and make them mandatory on all brokers and agents where necessary.</P>
    <P>I have decided not to include reinsurance or specialist reinsurance brokers in the scheme.  The clients of such brokers are insurers and reinsurers themselves who can be expected to look after their own interest without statutory protection.</P>
    <P>Some may ask, &ldquo;Will this Bill catch those who seek to describe themselves as something other than a broker or agent?&rdquo;.  I am happy that the definition of &ldquo;insurance broker&rdquo; and &ldquo;insurance agent&rdquo; will include such operators, but, if it does not, there are supplementary <Col N="277" /> provisions in section 45 of the Bill to meet the situation.  Section 45 provides that, apart from the employees of insurers, commission can only be paid to a broker or agent who complies with the Bill.  If there are persons who manage to escape from the Bill, and I doubt it, by describing themselves as insurance advisers or by some other term, they will have to provide their services free, or will have to seek remuneration in some other way from their clients.  I cannot imagine that there will be many intermediaries who will work for no remuneration, or who will prosper by charging clients a fee when other similar intermediaries will not be doing so.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill refers to miscellaneous final matters.  These include in section 50 the right of appeal by insurers to the High Court against the suspension or revocation of an authorisation, or against a direction or objection of the Minister under the provisions in the Bill relating to qualifications of directors.</P>
    <P>Section 51 deals with procedures to be followed in suspending or revoking an authorisation, particularly in regard to the notification to be given to the supervisory authorities of other member states.  The removal of a suspension is also catered for and the position of contracts of insurance issued before a suspension or revocation is clarified &mdash; they continue in force as valid contracts.</P>
    <P>Section 52 is a technical amendment to require the Minister to seek the consent of the Minister for Finance to the waiving of any debt due to the insurance compensation fund.  Finally, section 53 is a minor amendment to allow a realistic fee to be charged for inspection of the register of insurance authorisations.</P>
    <P>I will also be proposing on Committee Stage to take powers to appoint authorised officers under the Insurances Acts for the purposes of entry and inspection. These powers will augment existing powers available in secondary legislation under the European Communities Act, 1972.  The powers are enabling only and I do not anticipate an immediate or widespread need to use them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="278" /> I hope the House has found this exposition of the Bill useful and informative. Given the subject's importance, I felt it necessary to speak at some length.  I will be happy to answer points on which further clarification is needed by Senators.</P>
    <P>Again I repeat there is no mad rush regarding this legislation.  It is a very extensive Bill which appears long overdue. The House will have all the time in the world to discuss it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to welcome the Bill which the Minister has introduced to the House.  As he has said himself in his concluding remarks, it is very important legislation in the interest of the consumer.  I know the Minister and everyone else is well aware of the uncoordinated and haphazard approach to insurance sales which are taking place and which have long been transacted in this country.  It is like all legislation that comes before either House of the Oireachtas; it is well after its time and it has been discussed long enough, over the past decade or so.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has now introduced a very extensive Bill.  It is very similar to the legislation that was published last year which was thoroughly researched by the Department of Industry and Commerce at the time.  I know that they have received submissions, particularly from the broker organisations but also from the Irish Insurers' Federation, in order to meet and fine tune the requirements that various interests would have in regard to this legislation, in putting it into practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his opening remarks the Minister referred to the high cost of insurance and the necessity to bring down that high cost in order to meet the great competitiveness of industry and, in order to make insurance companies more competitive, to bring about a reduction in insurance premiums to the various individual policyholders.  I, too, share his concern about the high cost of insurance. It is probably one of the greatest overheads <Col N="279" /> that any business person has in the community today.</P>
    <P>I am extremely concerned, in particular, about the high cost of employers' liability and public liability insurance premiums to businesses.  Companies are now running the risk of having no insurance cover at all because of the prohibitive premiums that are being quoted. Insurance has become very difficult to get for certain walks of life.  I am speaking, in particular, about engineering firms where there is a high risk involved.  In the general insurance area, the cost of liability insurance to the building and construction industry is extremely high.  That has reverberations on the competitiveness of the quotations given to individuals who are building houses or a factory.  They are competing against a black economy with no overheads.</P>
    <P>Companies are often prepared to go into receivership if they get a large claim, rather than meet the cost of the insurance claim from their own sources.  This confirms the view that insurance premiums are now preventing job creation and are contributing, in my view, to job losses. Various companies such as steel erection companies, for example, in the agricultural sector, because they have such an excess on their policies, perhaps up to £20,000, are prepared to take part of the risk in any case.  Why should they take any of the risk at all in taking out any insurance cover?  A sum of £20,000 would often be enough of an excess to put that company out of business, with margins so tight nowadays.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to take very quickly the action which he proposes and which he has outlined in his speech today. The quantum charges that he has spoken about on a tribunal type system have been in operation in the UK for a considerable length of time and this is something which is long overdue in this country.  I agree with him that it is more an attitude of mind in this country.  People have become very claim conscious and are looking around every corner for opportunities to make a claim.  Often in our various dealings <Col N="280" /> with people in our constituencies we hear people boasting at pub counters about the amount they are going to get out of an insurance claim.  That is not good for society.  It is not a good type of attitude that is permeating society, gathering soft money, as it were, from an unfortunate insurance company or, in particular, from an unfortunate policyholder who will eventually have to pay for that claim.</P>
    <P>As regards a tribunal type system for personal injury awards, in Canada, for example, there is a compensatory mechanism of paying an insured pension a certain income per week rather than a lump sum.  Perhaps under the terms of the recently ratified Single European Act, where insurance will become a sensitive area in the internal market, more competition can be garnered from the various insurance companies throughout the European Community, in order to bring about even greater competition in this country for quoting insurance premia.</P>
    <P>A more strict régime of departmental inspection is essential to ensure that employer and employee adhere to proper safety procedures in the workplace.  The Minister referred to the two senior counsel situation in High Court cases.  The settlement cost in each case would probably amount to 25 per cent of the total cost of the claim put forward by the legal profession.  It would add significantly to a reduction in premia if this two counsel rule on each side of the case were to be abolished.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Incorporated Law Society and the Bar Council to come together themselves and bring about a self-regulatory situation rather than have the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the day forced to wave the big stick, as it were, in order to bring people to heel.  He has successfully achieved that in the insurance industry in recent days, which I will refer to later.</P>
    <P>The jury system, certainly, should be abolished.  I hope the Government will bring forward the Courts Bill in the coming session so that we can bring about a lowering of the cost of insurance transactions <Col N="281" /> and litigation in the courts as quickly as possible.  I am often surprised, as well, at some of the people who go before the court, the High Court in particular, and here I am talking about members of the medical profession and, perhaps, the engineering profession, to give evidence on behalf of insurance companies or various clients in that the fees they charge are a little exorbitant.  One could hardly justify, in any walk of life, paying any person a couple of thousand pounds a day to give evidence in a High Court case.  Unfortunately, that is the kind of figure we are talking about.  The Minister should put a limit on the amount of money that can be charged by these professional people.  I accept that they are important to a case in that they are needed to give evidence and to convince the justice but the fees they charge could be much lower.  If their charges were lower, perhaps the cost of insurance premiums to the policyholder would be substantially reduced.</P>
    <P>The waiting period for a case to be heard by the High Court often adds to the cost of a claim.  At present there is a three year waiting list for cases outside of Dublin.  I hope the proposed Courts Bill will allow the High Court to sit in other parts of the country as this will allow more cases to be heard quickly, with a waiting list of not longer than six months.  The cost of a claim increases rather than decreases the longer the case goes on.  Industrial competitiveness is important and it will not be achieved if we fail to get the high cost of insurance down.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the initiatives that he has outlined here today will be put into force as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an important milestone in that it brings together the many regulatory features of the insurance world which have failed to materialise over the past 20 years.  The two insurance organisations have made various submissions to the Minister.  I would like to remind the Minister that the vast majority of agents and brokers are not members of these two organisations.  In fact, the National Insurance Brokers Association, <Col N="282" /> the larger of the two, have 300 members at present, and the Corporation of Insurance Brokers have less than 100 members.  From reading the Bill I note that the Minister has taken cognisance of that fact.  Senator Fallon is an astute observer of the insurance world &mdash; I must declare that I also have an interest in this matter as I derive my livelihood from the sale of insurance &mdash; and I must say that the amendments proposed today bear the hallmark of a man like Senator Fallon.  I hope the Minister will continue to take any advice he gets from brokers such as he.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 7 refers to the fees that may have to be paid by applicants. In the past whenever a fee or a levy was put on an insurance company it often found its way back to the consumer.  For example, in the case of the PMPA a 3 per cent levy, which included the 1 per cent Government levy, was charged on all insurance premiums.  Unfortunately, it is the policyholders who will end up picking up the tab rather than the insurance company it was intended should pay the costs.  These fees will, undoubtedly, also find their way back to the policyholder.  I appeal to the Minister to prevent that happening.  I regard these fees as nothing more than an indirect tax on policyholders, if past experience is anything to go by.  Should the Government decide to introduce special fees, I hope prior discussions will take place with the brokers' organisation and, in particular, the insurers' federation in order to ensure that whatever levies are collected will only go to cover the administrative costs.  I hope they will be kept to a minimum and, as far as possible, that it will be the insurance companies who pick up the tab rather than the policyholders as has happened in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the general powers being introduced, the Minister may only request additional information where he has good reason to doubt whether an <Col N="283" /> insurance company is complying with its obligations under the Insurance Acts. The additional information which the Minister may request is wideranging. Therefore, it might be costly and time consuming to provide.  At times, this information might take a long time to collect and it might be quite expensive to do so.  It is only fair that the Minister should be asked to show good reason why this information is being sought rather than seeking information just for the sake of it.  It is important also that insurance companies should be asked to produce information which they are in a position to obtain.  It may be impossible, for example, for a company to obtain detailed financial information on a connected body.  Problems could arise in getting that type of information quickly, particularly in the case of a company becoming insolvent.  Perhaps a minor amendment could be made in order to make clear that an undertaking is only expected to provide information which the company could reasonably be expected to and, more important, have the power to obtain from a connected body.  Here I am referring to subsection (13) of section 13.</P>
    <P>Section 14 deals with investigations. Obviously, these can have a negative effect, if we are not careful about how we implement the section.  An investigation into the affairs of a particular insurance company can lead to rumours.  Often rumours become more extensive than they should.  We have noticed in the insurance industry over the past number of years that when the difficulties being faced by some insurance companies which led to the collapse of two were investigated the brokers and policyholders began to get fearful that they would face the thin end of the wedge if following the Minister's examination of the company it was found to be insolvent. I appeal to the Minister to be very careful when he uses his powers to intervene in the day to day commercial operations of a company.</P>
    <P>The Minister's pet subject at present is the financial services sector on the <Col N="284" /> Custom House Docks site, and he is appealing to international companies to set up on that site.  In the implementation of this section the Minister would need to be extremely careful to ensure that he does not turn these companies off by interfering in their day to day commercial operations.  I ask the Minister to look again carefully at section 14.  It will not apply to any other sector of the financial world and will not apply to banks, building societies or other financial intermediaries. All the Minister needs to know is whether the company is prepared to meet or able to meet its financial obligations and whether it is solvent.  Any provision which could be introduced in order to remove the fears of companies in relation to this matter would be welcome.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) of that section would then be unnecessary because the Minister would have sufficient powers under section 15 to deal with any undertaking of doubtful solvency.  Therefore, section 14 may not be necessary at all.  If it is intended that this section should cover more than the financial affairs of a company I will strongly oppose such moves, although I have no desire to stop the Minister fulfilling his duty to protect both policyholders and consumers.  The Minister has already ample powers under both insurance and consumer legislation to deal with any abuses.  If in the future it can be shown that the existing legislation is not adequate it will be up to the Minister to propose new legislation and this can be thoroughly debated in both the Dáil and Seanad and by all interested parties.  If there are anomalies in the section that we can come to terms with I am sure that on a future occasion we could introduce an amendment to cater for any gaps in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 18 deals with the revocation of an authorisation.  This could cause difficulties for the Minister in operating this section in the Bill because the conditions under which he may revoke or suspend an authorisation following the temporary cessation of business or the reduction of the scale of business written in a class or part of a class of life or non-life insurance lack the necessary legal precision.  As part <Col N="285" /> of their normal commercial and underwriting philosophy insurance companies do reduce their exposure in certain classes of business from time to time.  It is vital, therefore, that companies know precisely what reduction in the scale of business the Minister would deem to be grounds for the revocation or suspension of an authorisation.  Without specific guidelines this section might be impractical. I would be interested in whatever regulations the Minister would bring before the House in order to see how he could bring the implementation of section 18.  Otherwise I would be opposed to the section.</P>
    <P>Section 19 deals with reinsurance. There is not much reinsurance taking place in the Irish market for Irish insurance companies in particular.  One is dealing in most cases with international companies.  The Minister is more than aware that the level of losses sustained by non-life companies in particular in underwriting business is very serious at times.  Therefore, there will have to be an unloading of certain risks at various times, which the companies are able to do, and some reinsurance to protect the interests of the insurance company will have to be allowed.</P>
    <P>In the next ten years the insurance companies in Ireland who go to the Stock Exchange to provide some immediate source of cash in order to meet their financial requirements will have to advertise themselves on the international market in order to attract more reinsurance business into their companies if they are going to meet the level of liabilities that might arise over a huge level of claims.  The Minister might be going a bit too far in banning too many aspects of reinsurance under this section.  Another Minister could probably come back during the next few years looking for an amendment to that section because companies would not be able to continue their business satisfactorily if they have not access to premia from reinsurance activity.</P>
    <P>I would also like to draw attention to the fact that the acceptance of inwards reinsurance is a very useful way of generating <Col N="286" /> overseas business at present and would be a boost to the financial services sector.  When and if freedom of services is introduced in non-life insurance then local companies may seek to increase the level of inwards reinsurance business they accept in order to replace the inevitable loss that is going to take place in business to foreign insurance writing business in Ireland on a service basis.  I would suggest, therefore, that it is inappropriate at this stage to consider imposing restrictions on the ability of local companies to accept reinsurance business.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Insurance Compensation Fund, the effect of section 28 (2) (1B) would appear to deny the small family-owned corporate body or the unincorporated body the protection under the Insurance Compensation Fund.  I would be extremely concerned if unincorporated bodies were not able to get access to the Insurance Compensation Fund.  The fund should be available to all bodies whether they are incorporated or unincorporated and the limit of £650,000 or 65 per cent should be available to all.  I do not think that the Minister could honestly exclude small businesses from section 28 of the Bill.  It is a reserved power of the Minister and I am sure he will be more than anxious to facilitate those businesses.</P>
    <P>Section 30 in Part III of the Bill refers to commissions.  As the Minister stated, it is the view of both brokers' bodies that the Minister's intention to assume powers to reduce the level of commission payable to intermediaries is one he has not taken lightly but it was important for him to take some power into his hands in view of the fact that commissions have been getting out of hand, particularly in recent times.  I am glad that the life offices in particular have come to an agreement. Since 1 August they have laid down certain objectives which would reduce the benefit-in-kind objections that people would have, which would have given an unfair advantage to one company over another.  It is worth noting that certain exceptions cannot be avoided in the elimination of benefit-in-kind, particularly in the marketing of products, and improvements <Col N="287" /> in software and computer technology which are becoming a feature of many brokers' offices at present.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would take on board the fact that life offices in particular have come forward now with an agreement of their own on a self-regulatory matter which has been working extremely well since 1 August.  When he is implementing this legislation he should take into account that where self-regulation is operating satisfactorily there is no need for a Minister to interfere.  If it gets to the stage where holidays abroad are the order of the day other inducements are given to the various intermediaries in order to sell one company's product over another, then I agree that he would have to step in and do something about it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the timing of commission credits, it is important to understand that there will be technical difficulties in the implementation of section 31 because of the premium payment plans and deduction schemes operated by various firms and the fact that a broker would pay over a net premium to a life company in particular in relation to his commission.  This section of the legislation would militate against that. The legislation should take account of the fact that some premiums are so exorbitant that they cannot be paid in one lump and that premium payment plans are now very essential because they spread the burden of the insurance premium over 12 months.  Deduction schemes &mdash; and perhaps such a scheme is operated in the Minister's firm &mdash; are very important to employees because they provide some protection for their families in terms of life cover and provide investment funds for future occasions such as education of their children.  I would appeal to the Minister to introduce an appropriate amendment in order to take account of the difficulties which would arise in the implementation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Section 37 deals with the qualifications of insurance brokers and this is probably going to cause the greatest controversy <Col N="288" /> in the Bill.  Much discussion will probably centre around the question of whether a broker is a broker or whether a broker is an agent.  The overriding concern of insurance brokers at present is the enormous competition that they face from agents such as bank managers, accountants, solicitors and people who are not professionals in the insurance world but who have tied agents with particular firms and transact business accordingly.  If a person goes into a bank to get a loan and the bank manager asks him if he wants life cover or a life policy, Joe Soap is not going to say: &ldquo;I do not want it&rdquo;, particularly in view of the fact that he wants a loan.  This is the kind opf unfair competition which is being experienced in the insurance market at present.  I am glad that one of the main banks has decided to remove their bank managers from that system, even though they have set up their own insurance company in its place.</P>

I hope the Minister will take cognisance of that development and that the competition element that is so essential to the consumer is protected and that the policyholder gets the best value for money at the end of the day in that instance.  The Minister will come under pressure from the building societies who wish to enter into the financial services market as well.  The building societies are no bad hand at getting an extra cut of the commission from certain insurance companies.  I am sure various building societies have netted a nice sum of money in commissions.  As insurance brokers we get 12½ per cent commission on a house while the building societies get 35 per cent from insurance companies. These inconsistencies exist in the insurance market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Brokers have to establish proper offices.  They have to pay their rates, <Col N="289" /> income tax and staff.  They have to provide the expertise.  They have to be professional people.  The cowboys are gone. I hope this Bill will finally eliminate any remaining cowboys.  Many policyholders have expressed disdain and disgust at the type of policies they were sold, at the outturn of their investment or the cover that they were supposed to have received.  It is time the Minister ensured that professional insurance people deal with the consumer.  People who are not professionals in the categories I have mentioned are not in the business of advising people on insurance.  They have enough to do in advising people in their own walks of life as it is.</P>
    <P>Regarding the qualifications of insurance brokers, there will be a tremendous debate on the agencies.  I can see a problem with this.  The Minister has to resolve whether it means four general agencies and four life agencies or four agencies in total between life and general. An insurance broker at present who has six or seven agencies in life and seven agencies in the general business is now being compelled to get a fidelity bond and take out professional indemnity insurance, which at present costs £5,000 per annum.  Many brokers throughout rural Ireland will think about reducing the number of agencies they have to four in the life and in the general insurance sector, and calling themselves agents. This will eliminate the harassment of a bond or professional indemnity for most of them.</P>
    <P>No insurance intermediaries or small brokers could afford an overhead of the significance of £5,000 per annum.  They will take a chance and become agents. By and large they will be able to service their customers adequately with a smaller number of agencies.  However, this is not in the best interest of the policyholders.  It is not in the best interest of the consumer because the consumer is entitled to the widest possible choice of agencies at his or her disposal so that he or she can get the best policy at the lowest price and at the end of the day get the best value.  The Minister could have a problem on hand with that section of the Bill.  I look forward <Col N="290" /> to the way in which you interpret this regulation on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>The Senator should address his remarks through the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Being a new Senator I am only getting used to protocol.  The major concern of brokers in the proposed legislation is that they will have to provide for the £100,000 insurance bond, not a guarantee bond as they often have to provide for in other parts of their affairs. This is to be applied for the benefit of the client.  I would certainly agree with that. I compliment the Minister on the initiative he has taken, in amending that section, to phase in the operation of providing this bond for the smaller broker, starting at £25,000 or a percentage of turnover.  I appeal to the Minister to use his good offices to ensure that the prohibitive premiums being charged for professional indemnity and for the acquirement of a fidelity bond will not put small brokers out of business or terminate their employment.  Any underwriter prepared to write an insurance bond would want to see the accounts of every insurance broker for whom they would provide the cover.  Apart from the fact that it is unlikely that brokers would grant access to their accounts, I question whether it would be wise to allow one insurer access to such detailed information as it would give some advantage over other insurers in the market.</P>
      <P>The most serious worry as far as the insurance brokers are concerned is the cost of the bond.  I appeal to the Minister to reduce the percentage turnover and the cost of this bond.  Otherwise the Minister will have more trouble than he bargained for.  Insurance companies would have more administrative costs in sending policyholders renewal notices directly rather than dealing with their broker, if the broker goes to the wall.  Brokers are going to the wall still.  It is an unfortunate fact of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The keeping of a separate bank account under section 40 is very imporgaine <Col N="291" /> tant.  It is about time it formed part of the legislation.  Some insurance brokers think that when they receive the premium from a policyholder it is their money.  Unfortunately, when the crunch comes and they have to meet other financial obligations they resort to the insurance account.  I certainly welcome the inclusion of a separate bank account as part of the legislative process.  It should protect the interests of the insurance company and also ensure that the client's money is actually passed over from the broker to the insurance company.</P>
    <P>Section 43 deals with the scope of the agency.  The Minister will have to decide whether the agent represents only one life and one general company and in that case would not need a fidelity bond and professional indemnity.  If an agent has two life agencies and one general agency professional indemnity is important and a fidelity bond will be required.  Otherwise we will have unfair competition between the professional insurance brokers and tied agents.  It should be mandatory on the company representative of a particular insurance company to declare his interest in the company when selling insurance to a policyholder.  Often people who are tied agents to a company do not indicate that in their letterheads.  Tied agents or insurance brokers should indicate on the letterheads the company or agencies they represent.</P>
    <P>Section 44 deals with the treatment of premiums paid to brokers or agents.  This section of the Bill exposes a difference in practice between life and non-life markets. Perhaps it will require redrafting in order to avoid the anomaly.  In the life market the premium is not deemed to have been paid until it has been received by the insurer.  In the non-life sector the position depends on the standing of the intermediary in the community or the standing of the intermediary with the insurance company, which is more important.  While payment to the broker has been long accepted as payment to the insurer, the same is not true with some classes of agents.</P>
    <P>In the O'Donoghue report, of which <Col N="292" /> the Minister would be aware, it was proposed that the position with regard to agents be clarified.  This proposal is reflected in the Bill but it needs to be tightened up as there could be anomalies. On reading section 44 it is possible to conclude that payment to the broker might no longer be deemed payment to the insurer.  This interpretation would be very damaging to the position of bona fide brokers.  We feel sure that was not the intention.  To avoid any misunderstanding I suggest that this section be redrafted to include the words &ldquo;or broker&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;agent&rdquo;.  Section 45 deals with the payment of commission by brokers to others.  The Minister will be aware that there are intermediaries who will introduce business to insurance brokers.  For example, perhaps an accountant at this time of the year will be advising a client on how much of a personal pension he would have to provide in order to get personal tax relief to which he is entitled under the law.  At present an accountant is entitled to have an agency of his or her own.  If the accountant does not wish to consider insurance business in the future whatever arrangements such people make with insurance brokers &mdash; for the division of commission and so on &mdash; should not be interfered with.  The policyholder, the person of prime importance under the provisions of this Bill should be afforded the best deal by having this introduction to a broker by an accountant.  Commissions paid in such instances should be treated sympathetically.  The provisions of this section might create difficulties in that regard and, as such, might be damaging to insurance brokers' business.</P>
    <P>In section 47 (a) the use of the word &ldquo;is&rdquo; appears to imply retrospection.  It should be pointed out that no time limit applies to that subsection as currently drafted.  The use of the words &ldquo;after the coming into force of this Act&rdquo; might be considered appropriate.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for having introduced this Bill in the Seanad but we regret its speedy introduction.  I did not get a copy of the Bill until I arrived in Dublin. The Minister may not be at fault but <Col N="293" /> somebody is.  The nitty gritty that will have to be teased out in the various sections means that the Minister will have to propose amendments or, alternatively, we shall have to propose amendments.  I hope the Minister will accept any such amendments in the helpful way in which he has always considered legislation in this House.  I am quite certain that in that way we will have a Bill in the insurance sector that will regulate intermediaries, stamp out the cowboys in the trade, give fair value for money to policyholders, at the same time protect the consumer which is the main purpose of any Bill in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this important Bill, first published in July, 1986, and placed on the Order Paper by the Minister of the day.  It lapsed with the dissolution of the Dáil in January this year. The Bill has been long awaited by the insurance industry and will be widely welcomed. The Minister is to be complimented on having brought this Bill so speedily before the Seanad.</P>
      <P>The rules and regulations governing the operation of insurance companies in Ireland are covered by the Insurance Companies Acts, 1909 and 1985 and by various regulations imposed under the provisions of the European Communities Act.  The Bill proposes to clarify and extend these powers in a number of respects and to update certain aspects of the Insurance Acts.  The Bill is in five Parts.  In essence it highlights three main themes &mdash; (a)  to provide new supervisory arrangements in relation to insurance companies; (b) to regulate the payment of commissions to insurance intermediaries and (c) to introduce a system of regulation of insurance brokers.</P>
      <P>Part II deals with the supervision of insurers and responsibility is given specifically to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Minister is known as the supervisory authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill puts into substantive law what is already in practice in the insurance industry.  Under this Part the Minister can demand that insurance companies submit for inspection financial returns in <Col N="294" /> relation to the company or particular aspects of a company's performance.  The Minister can also obtain similar information on all bodies connected with the insurer.  Failure to provide the information within a specified time may incur the suspension or revocation of an authorisation. It permits the Minister to investigate the business of the insurer where public interest or the interest of the policyholder so requires.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill ensure that the Minister can obtain full information in order to carry out a full investigation. Where practices detrimental to the interests of policyholders are revealed the Minister may direct that these practices cease.  Failure to comply may result in the suspension or revocation of an authorisation.  It is obvious that powers of this nature are vital to the Minister if he is to exercise effective control over the running of insurance companies. They are to be welcomed.  We are well aware of the need for the Minister to be in a position to ascertain the financial health of any insurer and to act swiftly in taking the necessary remedial action if so required.  The Minister has a responsibility to ensure that companies have adequate reserves to meet claims lodged but which may take several years to settle.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains the necessary provisions to enable the Minister to direct the insurer to take specific measures where he has reason to believe that an insurer may be unable to meet their liabilities or the required margin of solvency.</P>
    <P>It is most important in the public interest that the Minister monitors the solvency of insurance companies on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>Many people, particularly those in industry, are concerned at the escalating cost of premiums which is placing insurance cover beyond the reach of many small companies and, in turn, many jobs at risk.  Many people believe insurance companies are making huge profits.  This is not the case.  In 1985 &mdash; excluding the ICI, insurance companies dealing in liability underwriting &mdash; had a <Col N="295" /> loss of £34 million and motor insurers incurred a loss of £17.5 million.  Claims are increasing constantly.  It appears now that for many reasons, people are becoming more claim conscious, believing insurance companies are an easy touch in respect of any small injury or accident. Jury awards are believed by many to be much too high.  Losses are sustained by insurance companies by utilising their investment income.  One might well pose the question: how long can insurance companies continue on this basis?  How long can companies in the industrial sector continue to pay ever-increasing premiums which comprise a very serious overhead for small companies in respect of employers' liability, public liability and other types of insurance.  There is a great need for a reappraisal by all parties to recognise that premiums must be pitched at a cost that insured companies can afford and claims awarded that will allow insurance companies to remain solvent and be in a position to honour these claims.  Insurance brokers will claim that the imposition of section 31(2) could result in increased premiums.  Section 31(2) states:</P>
    <P>The holder of an authorisation shall not pay to, or credit to the account of, an insurance intermediary a commission payment in respect of a policy of insurance until the premium to which the commission payment relates is received by the holder, and recorded by the holder as having been received by him.</P>
    <P>Does this mean an end to the premium payment plans operated by companies?  I could visualise the implementation of this section causing a cashflow problem for brokers who at present are paid commission upfront.  Everyone agrees that it is desirable that the cost of insurance is reduced, but what can be done?  I believe safety at work must become a daily ritual for both employers and employees.  We must ensure that the number of accidents in the workplace is substantially reduced or eliminated.  I understand that the Department of Labour's interim board <Col N="296" /> is starting to translate the report of the Barrington Commission which deals with health and safety at work into legislation and practice.  I believe the insurance companies have a vested interest in investing time and money to encourage safety at work and safety on the roads.  I welcome their initiatives in this area.</P>
    <P>What can the Government do to reduce the cost of insurance?  I welcome the statement made in the introductory remarks by the Minister that the Courts Bill which will be enacted will abolish juries.  This Bill, I understand, will introduce a system of pre-trial procedures which will reduce legal costs.  In addition, it will abolish the two senior counsel rule which requires that two senior counsel and a junior counsel are employed on each side in a typical High Court action.  I am aware of a number of small companies who just cannot afford to take the risk to go to the High Court.  I am aware that one company in particular tried to ascertain what the cost might be in a High Court action and the quote was £5,000 for the first day and £1,000 for each day after that.  These are the types of costs that are very hard to justify.  The Courts Bill is being sought by the insurance industry.  I am glad to note that the Minister will expect insurers to pass on immediately any savings made resulting from the proposed legislation.  The Bill, however, will not be addressing the problems of high cost and low availability of insurance.  I am aware that other measures are in the pipeline to do so.</P>
    <P>In Part III of the Bill the Minister is taking powers in relation to the payment of commission to intermediaries.  The Bill empowers the Minister to require insurers to reduce the rate of commission where he is of the opinion that these are excessive.  These powers are reserved and he will use them when necessary.  If, for example, the Life Insurance Industry Federation Commission agreement broke down the Minister would move swiftly, I am sure, to restore order to the market.  In the early eighties insurance companies were paying over the odds to brokers and agents in competition for business.  These excessive rates were paid <Col N="297" /> at the policyholders's expense.  Part III of the Bill was introduced in the Seanad in 1982 as a separate Bill.  However, the industry came to an agreement among themselves and the Bill was not proceeded with.  Earlier this year the old problem of excessive rates surfaced again but the industry came into line with a new inter-company agreement following the threat of new legislation.  Part III will go a long way in underpining this new agreement.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill sets out mainly to give financial protection to policyholders in their dealing with agents or brokers.  In the past a broker did not require bonding. This legislation will not make it a mandatory requirement that an insurance broker holds a bond to the value of not less than £100,000.  However, as indicated by the Minister, some flexibility will be allowed in this area.  I welcome this because I wonder how many companies could afford a bond of £100,000. I think it is wise to move flexibility in this area.  However, it is fair to say that most reputable brokers have professional indemnity insurance and insurance bonding. In the event of the broker failing to meet his financial obligation the bond will become available to a person nominated by the Minister who will apply the proceeds for the benefit of any of the brokers's clients who have suffered financial loss.</P>
    <P>Section 40 provides that an insurance broker must lodge premiums paid to a client's bank account.  This, I understand, will give protection to the investor in the event of the broker going into liquidation. In fact, the banks or the Revenue Commissioners will not have any preferential claims on these moneys.</P>
    <P>Section 37 specifies the qualifications required by persons before they can act as insurance brokers.  Section 37 (b) states that the broker must be in a position to arrange contracts on behalf of his clients with at least five insurers.</P>
    <P>Section 41 defines insurance agents' qualifications and I quote:</P>
    <P>(a) he holds an appointment in writing <Col N="298" /> from an insurer,</P>
    <P>(b) he states on his letter headings and business forms the name or names of every insurer for which he is an agent, and</P>
    <P>(c) he informs any proposer of an insurance contract of the names of the insurers for which he is an agent.</P>
    <P>It would appear that the Bill deals adequately with the qualification requirements of brokers but does not demand similar high standards from agents.  A person may still trade as an agent without any professional qualifications or experience and is not obliged to have any professional negligence insurance or bonding.</P>
    <P>Section 43 states that if the agent is acting on behalf of the insurer the insurer must accept full responsibility for the agent's actions.  At present the agent is deemed to be the agent of the client.  This legislation reverses significantly the legal position.  However, while this protects the policy holder it leaves the company in a very vulnerable position and leaves scope for unscrupulous practitioners. Insurance brokers would deem it desirable that a subsection be added to the Bill stating that anyone holding more than five agencies must be a registered broker in the eyes of the law.  In view of the fact that agents are not required to have negligence insurance or bonding, should they be restricted to the number of agencies they might hold?  In relation to the bonds, is there an underwriter on the market to underwrite the £100,000? As I said earlier, that matter is dealt with in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 41 (b) compels agents to state on their letter headings and business forms the names of the insurance companies they represent.  I wonder if this regulation will apply to bank managers, accountants and other such persons.  The legislation contained in this Bill should apply to everybody, with no exceptions. Should bank managers be allowed to continue to act as intermediaries?  It is fair to say that when people obtain a housing loan from a bank they are usually so <Col N="299" /> relieved that they are reluctant to seek insurance quotations or terms, other than those possibly recommended by the bank manager.  In these days of high unemployment is it right and proper for bank managers to engage in the selling of insurance when small brokers and agents employing one and two people are struggling to survive and are in a less privileged position?</P>
    <P>The Bill is directed at consumer protection and will be welcomed by the public at large.  I welcome the inclusion in the Bill of the section on the proposed code of practice which lays down codes of conduct for the brokers and agents in their dealings with their clients, insurers and other parties.  This will give further protection to the consumer.  This is very important legislation in the field of insurance and will be welcomed generally throughout the industry and by the public at large.</P>

      <P>A key speaker here this afternoon read his speech word for word.  As I understand it, that is not allowed under Standing Orders.  Tolerance for one should be tolerance for all in an egalitarian society.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I have certain criticisms of it which I hope to translate into amendments later.  The idea behind the Bill is a good one.  The problems the Bill sets out to solve need to be resolved.  I have queries on the Bill and I suppose I am taking a very easy way out in that I am giving a stream of consciousness kind of contribution on the Bill.  I will be raising questions rather than supplying answers but I expect that makes matters easier for the Minister when responding to the debate.</P>
      <P>It is worth noting at this stage that people involved in all aspects of life will be quite concerned about this matter and will welcome the fact that the State is taking a very keen interest, not just in the question of commissions which are of course very important but also in the whole area of how premiums are set, how the insurance business regulates its own affairs and how it sells and buys within the market.  I want to give one example &mdash; that is the funding of primary schools at present.  A recent survey carried out by the INTO, of which I am a member, showed that under-funded as schools are, 25 per cent of their total capitation grant goes towards insurance costs.  Insurance premiums affect all our lives.  I pay more on insurance annually than I pay by way of my mortgage repayments.  That is significant for someone so young.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking from a trade union point of view the Bill is desirable.  I welcome the increased powers the Government are taking on themselves in this area.  I disagree with my colleague, Senator Hogan, in that regard.  I do not think they are being over-interventionist, quite the reverse.  The State should concern itself with the workings of the companies at all levels.  As I understand it, the State has attempted during the last number of years to get involved and understand what is happening in insurance companies in such a way as they can intervene <Col N="301" /> before problems arise.  In the last couple of years the two great problems which arose were with PMPA and the ICI.  I do not believe that what is proposed in this Bill can prevent similar problems arising in future.  I hope the Minister will respond to that point.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that what is being proposed here is not adequate to cover future problems.  We must have a more &ldquo;hands on&rdquo;, interventionist approach, be it to the insurance market or the insurance industry.  At the moment the idea of the Government getting year end statements of account and statements of affairs from insurance companies is all very well on paper, but it takes too long to assemble that information, to synthesise it, to make it available and to act on it.  I would like the State to work much more closely with the insurance industry because I am sure people will recall in the last number of years scare stories and rumours that spread about an insurance company or about banks.  Some years back regarding a number of insurance companies and the Trustee Savings Bank the rumour went out that they were in trouble.  Of course, once rumour starts all confidence is lost in the institution concerned.  The fact that confidence is lost means that they begin to lose and even if they were not in trouble previously they are going to be in trouble now.  That means that, acting on information received if the Department send in a team of inspectors to see what is happening in an insurance company that information cannot be kept quiet and the minute it becomes public it is seen in the public eye as a major problem.  It may not be a major problem, but the fact that the team are sent in to investigate means that public confidence in the company will be lost.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides that the Minister may direct an investigation at any time of the business of an undertaking or any aspect of the business of insurance wherever he considers that the public interest or the interest of the policyholders so require.  I approve of that idea and I support it, but people may see it again as a sort of fire brigade action, that &ldquo;there <Col N="302" /> is a problem, let us get in there&rdquo;.  If we were getting in there quite regularly it would not be seen as a matter of major import that the Department were inspecting an insurance company and, therefore, there would not be a public response to it.  I believe that as soon as you send in that team you can shut down the company or else restructure it completely because nobody will have confidence in it any more except the people who are tied into it by virtue of being policyholders and who cannot get out at that time.  It will be seen from this that the Government still see the extra powers coming into force when they consider that a problem exists and they need to investigate the matter and, as I have said, there is no concept here of working hand-in-hand with the insurance industry with a view to being in there before the errors are made.</P>
    <P>Otherwise, the difficulty is simply that of enforcement.  The Minister states in his speech &mdash; or in his notes to the speech &mdash; that it is unfortunate that in this country we have not the resources to have perhaps the same input into the insurance industry as have other countries.  I take that point.  This is a pity and it is one of the problems that I see in the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to how the Government will enforce, there is obviously little point in increasing powers unless at the same time the Government can properly enforce a system.  As I said here yesterday on another issue, I do not want to propose legislation that cannot be enforced and if the Minister is saying that this is as far as we have the resources to enforce I accept that point but I regret it.  We need to go a little further on the issue.  The past performance of the Department of Finance is such that the case for an independent supervisory authority of all financial institutions is becoming stronger. I will come back to that.  I feel that it is a matter of grave importance in this whole discussion about where one financial institution or service begins and the other starts.  Nobody knows at this stage. Examples have been given here today of insurance companies acting as banks, banks acting as insurance companies and <Col N="303" /> building societies acting as everything.  It is time we had a look at where that leaves us.  I will refer to that again.</P>

      <P>Thank you for that clarification.  I am not too well informed on the whole area of commission by insurers, but I found astounding the figure given by Senator Hogan that building societies can claim up to 35 per cent of a commission while brokers have to live on 12½ per cent.  I consider that to be not just a business venture but &ldquo;white-mail&rdquo; if not blackmail.  I am one of the people tied into this &mdash; I have no choice about my house insurance.  I am told where I have to take it, which company to go to.  It seems that the Registrar of Friendly Societies should have some powers in this area.  If building societies are supposed to be friendly societies then they should act in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem is also that the Government have gone for self-regulation here in this part of the industry.  It should be a statutory type of regulation under the State, not just the industry looking after its own problems.  I am totally and utterly confused about the difference between an insurance agent and an insurance broker.  I have read the Bill closely and I know what is intended by it, but no <Col N="304" /> matter how anybody goes about it, will it allow people to decide which they want to be?  I would like that explained.  Section 37 provides that a person has to be a member of a body of insurance brokers and to be in a position to arrange insurance for at least five insurers.  That is the broker qualification. The agent's qualification is that he shall hold an appointment in writing from an insurer and that his letter headings, business forms etc. will make this quite clear.</P>
    <P>Most people are badly informed on financial matters.  Most people do not know how to deal with banks, bankers, accountants or financial institutions and there is no way that the general public are going to know the difference between an insurance agent and an insurance broker.  It is made too easy here for people to opt out from one and decide to be one rather than the other.  I would like to have that part of the legislation addressed much more firmly.  There should be statutory regulations to cover the activities of both.  As we have it here, the brokers decide on their own regulations and the agents are just agents of the insurance company.  There is far too much leeway there, it is too loose.  The problem of defining who is a broker is not really faced.  On the one hand there are the established brokers who, presumably, will continue to be designated as such provided they satisfy the terms. On the other hand, there are the agents who will not be able to satisfy the requirements and will, therefore, be defined as insurance agents under the legislation.</P>
    <P>In the middle of this is a whole range of people who are loosely referred to as insurance intermediaries.  Who will decide which category they fall into? Where banks, agents of banks, building societies, garages, accountants or whoever they happen to be are involved in this area, who is to decide whether they are going to be brokers or agents?  Is this decision up to themselves?  Will there be requirements which they will have to meet one way or the other?  It would appear that it is open to any of these intermediaries to decide for themselves whether they wish to be an agent or a <Col N="305" /> broker and that there is no requirement regarding bonding or professional indemnity insurance which can be made binding upon them if they have this choice.  They can just opt for the easier option as I understand it, and I stand to be corrected in that area.</P>
    <P>It would not be so bad if there were a total absence of any connection in the legislation for greater levels of commission payments to insurance brokers. As it stands, by opting to be an agent rather than a broker the benefit in the form of commission is the same and the requirements are considerably less. Where is the protection for the ordinary citizen in that?  The citizen goes looking for insurance cover and will not know the difference between a broker and an agent.  We know here and the law will know the difference between them and the cover and bonding that one is supposed to have, but that information will not be understood very clearly by the public.</P>
    <P>A requirement under the Bill is that insurance companies must keep a list of the different agencies.  This is quite right and to be welcomed.  What about the list of brokers?  Where does that come into the Bill?  Will their own body keep that list, or will there be a list available to the State?  Why are brokers not included in the list which can be seen publicly at any hour of the working day?  Is there something in the Act which I am missing in relation to that area?  That should certainly be covered.</P>
    <P>The two-tiered approach of insurance brokers and agents is unsatisfactory.  The word &ldquo;broker&rdquo; has no great significance for the public at large and the public will not be aware that they are dealing with a non-broker intermediary and of the implications that it might have for them in that they do not have bonding or protection. If a person is dealing with an insurance agent, under the terms of the Act, his protection is substantially less. How will we make people aware of the differences, apart from their notepaper?</P>
    <P>Insurance companies must give a detailed response each year to the Department in terms of information <Col N="306" /> about the company.  What we are doing is trying to give that a statutory force. However, end of year information is too late.  It will not get us into a position where we can solve problems.  There is a conflict of interest within the Department in that the Department have a vested interest in companies remaining solvent. They have a responsibility to see that companies remain solvent.  At the same time, they have a vested interest in keeping premiums as low as possible.</P>
    <P>These two areas are in conflict.  On my reading of the Bill, it would not have stopped the PMPA problems from developing.  They were in trouble for years and everybody knew it.  The Minister of the day talked with them a long time before they went to the wall.  The employees of the company, the Minister, the Department and the industry at large were aware of their problems and of the fact that they did not have the resources to meet the claims, that they were relying on the premiums of the following year to meet the claims of the current year and so on.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in this Bill to stop that happening again.  If I ring up an insurance company and say I have been involved in a serious accident, that my car is a writeoff and that four people in the other car were seriously injured, the company will have to make allowances for the cost, whenever it arises, of the court proceedings and the damages that may arise. If they put too much aside they are burying their profits and if they put too little aside they could go to the wall.  Nothing in this legislation would allow us to know what might happen in a company.  How do we get to the bottom of such a problem? I appreciate that the Minister says he does not have the resources to work on a &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; basis with the insurance companies but people should not think they are now protected from the type of problems that arose before, because they are not really protected.  It can still happen.</P>
    <P>The industry will consider that this Bill goes too far and that the State should not intervene as much as it proposes to intervene in this Bill.  On the other hand, <Col N="307" /> the workers and the unions representing the workers in the insurance industry will feel that this legislation does not go far enough.  We in the trade union movement would say that to wait for something to go wrong before intervention is to wait too long.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the edges of financial services are becoming more and more blurred.  There is hardly any distinction between where an insurance company stops and a bank begins and where a building society stops and an insurance company begins.  The financial institutions have varying supervisory bodies over them.  We have banks which are building societies and insurance companies acting as banks and the Bank of Ireland does everything.  All of these institutions are responsible to different supervisory authorities.  The Registrar of Friendly Societies looks after building societies; the Central Bank looks after banks; and we are now proposing another group to look after insurance.  What we really need is to be conscious of the developments in the financial world and the fact that all these institutions are tied in together and our legislation should reflect that.</P>
    <P>This Bill which attempts to control insurance would be welcome if insurance was developing in isolation, but it is not and the development in the financial world shows that all these institutions are offering the same service.  It is not beyond belief that An Post might some day offer banking services.  They are moving closer to it.  The edges are becoming blurred. If we now have companies offering a complete financial package from insurance, to house loans, to banking services, to buying and selling stocks, what we really need is an overall monitoring body for all financial institutions.</P>
    <P>Recently we discussed the question of the financial centre in Dublin.  During that debate I said we did not want to get the international financial cowboys moving in.  I am worried about something which I read in <i>Business and Finance</i> on 13 August.  It is absolutely relevant to this Bill and I implore the Minister to take <Col N="308" /> this matter on board and to see if the Bill can put the regulation of insurance into a much wider context.  <i>Business and Finance</i> says:</P>
    <P>Looser regulation than in other markets was a major attraction for the European Mercantile Exchange to set up in Dublin, according to one of the directors from Chicago, Bill O'Connor: &ldquo;Regulatory bodies in other countries place stumbling blocks all over the place.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The stumbling blocks of the financier are the protections for the individual.  What he refers to as stumbling blocks are what we would call controls.  It goes on:</P>
    <P>It is very encouraging to see the different attitude of (the Irish) Government.</P>
    <P>I do not find that encouraging, but very worrying.  It goes on:</P>
    <P>It is very encouraging to see the different attitude of (the Irish) Government.&rdquo;.  Financial futures are highly leveraged instruments and both the UK and the American authorities do not allow the sales of certain products developed in the home of futures, Chicago.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Futures&rdquo; is obviously the whole market where one can buy and sell commodities whether it be coffee from Brazil, or rubber from the Far East, or simply a Government bond that will ripen to maturity at some stage.  This person goes on to say that, following the provisions of the 1987 Finance Act, Irish law would not prohibit the sale of these funds.  That is the person on the ground, who is trying to make money on the issue, saying he is coming to Ireland because there are looser controls.  We know this.  I am not saying that this reflects on what is being planned in the insurance area.  I am saying that insurance is just part of the whole set of financial institutions, and we should look for and demand an overall monitoring body so that we do not have international financial cowboys setting up house in Dublin or in Ireland to the detriment of the rest of the population.  I <Col N="309" /> think I have pushed that as far as possible. The problem is that in Ireland if we set up some body to look at insurance companies, if there is not a problem already, there is certainly a problem at that point because nobody will believe otherwise, and that will affect the confidence of the public in the company.</P>
    <P>In other countries, Germany for example, there is a very high level of intervention by the State.  I know that part of the Irish psyche is that we do not like people meddling in our affairs and therefore we do not do it.  This is perhaps a racist point, but the Germans are a more regulated race of people who approach things differently.  In Germany there would be a large state staff involved in the insurance industry, in the setting up of premiums, in the setting of targets. In all the major decisions there would be constant communication with the state. There is no objection there from the insurance industry.  I picked the German example &mdash; I could have picked many others &mdash; because Germany is one of the countries that governments point to as showing the headline for where we should be going.  I am saying that I would welcome what goes on there if we had it here.  By being involved very closely with the workings of the insurance industry, the Government would be in a position to see how the companies are working and to report any problems as they perceived them long before the problem became major ones.</P>
    <P>To hark back to the PMPA, by the time we were aware of the problems it was too late to do anything.  Will somebody please tell me what is in this Bill &mdash; because I am saying there is nothing &mdash; to stop this happening again?  It was those accidents, for want of a better word &mdash; I do not believe they were accidents &mdash; it was those collapses in the insurance industry that were the catalyst for seeking this Bill, and it does not solve the problem and does not stop it happening again.</P>
    <P>I also wonder about this intervention. What happens afterwards?  Let us take the position of the PMPA.  The State intervened, put in somebody to run the company, guaranteed, in a sense, the running of the company, but does not <Col N="310" /> own the company.  Who owns PMPA now?  Whose company is it?  That is not a rhetorical question.  I want to know the answer, because if we are to be intervening in the future, I want to know on whose behalf are we intervening.  The Government took over the running of the company but do not own it.  Does that company belong to the State at the moment?  I know it does not but I want to know who owns it.  More important, I want to know who gets it when it is turned around and back in profit.  These are not rhetorical questions because we are leading into the same area with this Bill of intervening, putting in a team or whatever, of picking up the pieces.  Where are we at that point?  Where do we go from there?</P>
    <P>It was similar with ICI.  I am not absolutely sure of this but we bought it for something like £1 from AIB.  It was bad value at £1 for those of us who pay taxes and we shouted and screamed long and hard about it at the time.  But it is now being run again and is working again and will soon be back in profit.  When do we get our £1 worth back, or do we get it back?  Who gets the company when it is back in profit?  That area has not been addressed in this Bill and there are people paying taxes who have a right to know what happens to the companies after we intervene.</P>
    <P>That brings me back to my first point. It is better not to have to intervene.  It would be better to be there already to see how it is working, to anticipate problems rather than to solve problems.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to be negative about the legislation.  I am putting forward what are fairly heartfelt views about the industry and about the way we should be moving.  Those questions about ICI and PMPA are ones that concern a lot of people.  I am worried that we are heading into a similar situation again.  I know the Bill has started off with the best of intentions. I agree that all the problems specified in the Bill should be sorted out.  But some of the areas I mentioned should be taken on board, and I would like to think that the Minister will develop some of those points.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusCullimore" hpid="Mr. Cullimore Mr. Cullimore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullimore</NameTxt>
      <P>First I would like to compliment the Minister on introducing this Bill.  I welcome it because, in general, it offers protection to the insured.  Its central aim is to provide statutory protection for policy holders.  People look to the insurance business to protect them when things go wrong.  They pay dearly for this security.  It is a cruel blow then to find that this protection does not exist. Those situations where rogue directors or agents have left members of the public high and dry are far too common.  I do not have to go outside my own constituency to meet people who have suffered from the fraudulent action of rogue brokers.  Measures taken to combat these injustices are to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>Section 37 sets out the qualifications a person must have to act as a broker.  He must be a member of a body of insurance brokers recognised by the Minister.  It provides also that he must have contracts with at least five companies.  I welcome these provisions.</P>
      <P>Section 39 (1) requires a broker to hold a bond of not less than £100,000.  Sums considerably larger than this have been involved when brokers left people high and dry.  Subsection (6) suggests that this figure may, from time to time, be altered by the Minister.  It suggests that turnover could be used to set the size of the bond. Should not the bond be automatically related to the previous year's turnover? The onus for having the bond correct would lie with the broker and it would be subject to inspection by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Section 40 insists that an insurance broker should keep a separate bank account into which all moneys received by him or her in connection with premia should be deposited.  This is a very welcome development in the light of past experiences of proving fraudulent brokers guilty of misuse of premia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 41 deals with the qualifications required by an agent.  I welcome the provision whereby a premium paid to an agent is treated as having been paid to the insurers.  It offers protection in the situation where the agent does not pass <Col N="312" /> on the money to the insurance company.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to call for a public register of disqualified brokers or agents to be compiled and maintained by the Minister's office and available to the public at reasonable times in all local authority offices or Garda stations.  This list could be published on an annual basis in the national papers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to put on record my objection to the late circulating of this Bill.  I received a copy of it yesterday.  As a new Member I do not have any idea of how the programme of legislation is presented to the House. We all agree that the Bill before us is intricate and needs detailed examination. In my view the Department have displayed a certain amount of arrogance towards the House and I hope we will not see a repetition of it.</P>
      <P>Generally, I welcome the Bill because, as the Minister said, it represents an important step in strengthening and securing the position of the policyholder not only in his or her dealings with insurance companies but also in dealings with intermediaries.  Insurance is becoming a major problem for the ordinary consumer and also for employers struggling to survive in a very competitive environment.  I am concerned at a number of features in the insurance industry and I should like to put forward concrete proposals to confront this problem. The features in the insurance industry that need to be addressed fall into the following categories, cost, availability, competition and safe practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many things have contributed to the high and escalating cost of insurance in Ireland.  I am very concerned about the high cost of motor insurance, particularly on young motorists.  There is no doubt that today cars are a necessity and no longer a luxury but, unfortunately, the high cost of insurance is encouraging people to drive vehicles while uninsured. There is no doubt that uninsured drivers are costing the country, and the companies, a lot of money.  If we succeed in bringing down the cost of motor <Col N="313" /> insurance we will reduce the number of uninsured drivers on our roads.  It is worth noting that the Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland are paying out £18 million &mdash; the equivalent of £20 on the typical insured driver &mdash; in personal injury claims to the victims of uninsured drivers.  It is claimed that up to 20-25 per cent of drivers are uninsured.  The MIBI payments are only part of the cost of uninsured driving.  The cost of damage to property has to be met from insurance premia and many innocent victims suffer loss with no compensation.</P>
    <P>The legal costs of wrangling over liability absorb 20 per cent of the total claims paid out by insurance companies which is never received by the victims being compensated.  It is also worth noting that the difficulty of getting insurance at any sort of bearable cost is becoming very common.  In some businesses it is virtually impossible for employers to get cover for employers liability and public liability. More and more employers are being forced to operate without any insurance. This is a frightening development, when one considers the plight of victims of accidents.  This problem applies in particular to the small businesses that are finding it very difficult to survive in the economic recession we are going through.  I appeal to the Minister to investigate this area in an effort to get a reduction in the cost of insurance for businesses.  There is no agreement with the insurance industry for dealing with what are described as declined cases for employer's insurance, comparable with that for motor insurance.  Voluntary and sports organisations have found it imposible to proceed with some of their normal events because the terms being quoted for insurance cover is entirely beyond what a non-profit making body could face.</P>
    <P>Competition in the insurance business is another area that should be looked at. Recently, the European Court ruled that Ireland was acting illegally in the way in which it tried to keep overseas insurers out of certain insurance business here. This ruling heralds competition from overseas into the Irish market.  A move <Col N="314" /> to reduce costs and improve service to its customers is clearly in the insurance industry's own interest.  Lack of competition is clearly contributing to the high cost of Irish insurance.  In my view it would be helpful to insurance companies, particularly since the passing of the Single European Act, if they were made aware of the market available in the EC.  They could benefit greatly in that market.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that the growth in management expenses in insurance companies has averaged over 20 per cent per annum in recent years, about 1.75 times the rate of inflation. There is a huge variation in efficiency within the industry.  Among the large motor insurers general expenses range for 8 to 20 per cent of gross premium income.  That means that some companies are unprepared for competition and their clients are bearing excessive costs.  Management expenses of insurers in the UK are less than two-thirds of those in Ireland.  Along with improved efficiency there is also a need for better services to the customer.  There are many areas where improvement is needed. There should be much more access for the consumer to information about the terms of his policy, the structure of premiums and the level of commission and service charges so that the consumer can shop around freely.  There is need for the preparation of a code of practice for brokers and agents to protect consumers from unfair selling practices and a need for the industry to establish an insurance ombudsman to provide a simple mechanism for settling complaints by clients about their treatment by insurers.  Such a scheme has been found to be cheap and highly effective in the UK.</P>
    <P>There is a need for the removal of insurance practices that unfairly victimise particular groups.  For example, disabled drivers still face a 10 per cent loading that has no actuarial foundation.  Even more unjust, victims of untraced drivers receive much lower compensation for personal injury than victims of uninsured drivers.  That practice has no logical foundation. Another area of the insurance industry that should be investigated is in <Col N="315" /> regard to safe practice.  The traditional approach to quoting for insurance is to accept the risk to be covered as fixed. The main concern of the insurer was to ensure that the client would not find it in his interest to deliberately bring on a hazard.  As a result, the structure of insurance terms have not paid sufficient attention to the opportunity to improve safe practice through the structure of premiums. In my view the premium structure should be tailored to give bonuses to those who are willing to improve safety standards, both on the road and in the workplace.</P>
    <P>Faced with those numerous problems in the insurance industry some people have advocated dramatic changes in present practices such as the introduction of a no-fault system and the funding of motor insurance by a levy on petrol. Having looked at those suggestions I have come to the conclusion that they offer little prospect of cost reduction in the near future.  Those proposals in my view would present numerous problems.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision of the Minister to proceed with legislation to abolish juries in civil actions.  I urge the Government to treat this legislation as a high priority and have it into law before the end of the year.  The operation of a new system should be closely monitored so as to ensure that it achieves the promised cost savings and that they are passed on in the form of reduced premia.</P>
    <P>In my view some sections need to be amended.  I have a query in regard to section 31 which states that the holder of an authorisation shall not pay to or credit to the account of an insurance intermediary a commission payment in respect of a policy of insurance until the premium to which the commission payment relates is received by the holder and recorded by the holder as having been received by him.  Does that mean an end of the premium payment plans operated by companies, as it would be unfair to ask brokers to wait up to ten months for commission in such cases?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to put before the House on the Adjournment this evening the subject matter of a number of building projects in County Kilkenny, particularly in the primary school area about which I am extremely concerned to get them started as soon as possible.  The first one I refer to is Lisdowney national school.  This school was built in 1829 by Lord Mountgarret, two years before the commencement of Stanley's national school system.  To date that school has never been replaced by a permanent structure.  In 1956, when the school had been in operation for a century and a quarter and was in a dreadful condition, with rats competing with teachers for lunch, application was made for a new school.  The process begun at that time is still continuing, the dates of the excuses being the only things that have changed. The struggle to gain a school for the children in this locality, which I am sure the Minister will agree is their fundamental right, has continued under the patronage of three bishops, the management of three parish priests and through the passage of three decades.  At present the children of Lisdowney have no school.  The insurance company are not prepared to insure the building any longer because of the risk it would impose on the children and teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one peruses the history of this school, a number of interesting but depressing points emerge. First, plans and specifications for a new permanent school were drawn up in 1965 at a cost of £4,500.  Two years later a prefabricated structure was put in place at a cost of £4,500 and seven years later a general purposes room was added at a <Col N="317" /> cost of £3,650.  By 1978 the new school of 11 years' standing had been condemned by the medical officer and the Department of Education refused any further grants for the upkeep of this temporary structure.</P>
    <P>Since the erection of the present building, enrolment has grown from 45 in 1967 to 85 at present.  The school now has three teachers.  This is probably due to the fact that Lisdowney is in the shadow of Avonmore Creameries which have provided very important employment in the area.  In October of 1984 the Chief State solicitor, in a letter to the chairman of the board of management, indicated that he was preparing a lease for the new school.  Plans for the new school were prepared in 1984 at a then cost of £185,000.  Those plans are still in place in the Department of Education but the estimated cost is now £240,000.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the existing building has been condemned by the area medical officer, by the environmental health officer, by the INTO, by the Department of Education when they said in 1978 that they would refuse to pay any further grants towards the upkeep of the school and in view of the fact that the insurance company are not prepared to underwrite the risk at that school any more, the provision of a new school is long since overdue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason advanced for not proceeding with the new school is the state of the nation's finances.  To the people of Lisdowney, after 30 years of waiting, this has certainly a familiar ring to it.  In the meantime, the people of the surrounding parishes have been provided with excellent educational facilities.  In fact, within a radius of ten miles £2 million has been spent on various new schools and extensions to existing schools.  The question is not the entitlement of other parishes which have benefited from these facilities, but it seems that the building of a school in Lisdowney would not have such dire consequences <Col N="318" /> for the nation's coffers.</P>
      <P>The people of Lisdowney have met, through their various representatives, the officials of the Department of Education and various efforts have been made to arrive at a compromise.  A full school building as planned to be provided with the minimum delay will be their first demand.  However, they have a number of fall-back positions which the Department of Education have been investigating. First, if a full school building as planned by the Department is not feasible in view of their financial situation, perhaps a more scaled down version could be provided.  A structure could be erected as soon as possible by the local community with grant-aid from the Department of Education to enable the children to go back to school.  It has been estimated by local people who have professional qualifications that the cost of providing such a school could not incur any more expenditure than £120,000. When one considers the local contribution of £30,000 and that the Department of Education are providing £45,000 for temporary accommodation in the form of prefabricated buildings, that sum of money would go a long way towards initiating the project in Lisdowney within a matter of weeks.  I know that Mr. Rowley from the Department of Education has been in the area and has provided the Minister with the technical details of how the community would be in a position to provide this expertise and get the work in progress as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Minister that the board of management are not in a position to provide schooling facilities for the children. The children of the fifties are now the parents of the eighties in that area. In no circumstances, will pupils be allowed to return to the existing building. All possible democratic means at the disposal of the people of Lisdowney have been exerted on the Department to provide a new permanent school with the greatest possible efficiency and within the minimum amount of time.  Every cooperation <Col N="319" /> would be given to the Department to carry out that work.  I appeal to the Minister to look sympathetically on the project as outlined by the local community.</P>
    <P>The second matter is the Graiguenamanagh boys' national school.  This school was built in 1929.  It consists of three rooms, two of which are divided by a mere partition.  The management are faced with providing facilities for 120 pupils and four teachers.  The main hall cum cloakroom, with wash-hand basin and toilets nowhere near the building, and in an appalling condition, provides the entrance to the classrooms and also provides storage facilities for the equipment of the school.  Two prefabs have been provided since 1970.  They have rotted away over the years, leading to rat infestation.  There is no general purpose room, no PE room or no staff room. As at Lisdowney, Dickensian conditions persist in the area.  Again this school has gone to tender, but the contract has not been sanctioned.  The management were assured by the Department of Education over a year ago that they would get first priority in County Kilkenny for a new national school.  I would be grateful if the Minister could tell us what kind of timescale we are talking about in getting a new national school for Graiguenamanagh.</P>
    <P>In relation to Moneenroe national school, I understand that improvement works were carried out during the summer.  This work involved the provision of new windows and various structural repairs.  The amount of the contribution which will be expected from the people of the Moneenroe area should take into account the high unemployment in the area.  The local contribution should be as minimal as possible and, perhaps, the Minister will give us an idea as to what will be expected from the community and tell us the total cost of the work being carried out there at present.</P>
    <P>I now want to deal with Castlecomer community school.  It has been the policy of the Department of Education for a number of years to promote the concept <Col N="320" /> of community schools and this in the long term will remove many of the administration costs and provide a more efficient second level education system for pupils in a wide area.  With that in mind, the Presentation Convent in Castlecomer and the local Vocational Education Committee decided to amalgamate to form a community school in Castlecomer.  Everything that the board of management of the community school were asked to do was carried out and the community school came into being formally on 1 July 1987.  This was done on the understanding that the new building project which was promised by the Department of Education would commence in 1987.  It would be regarded as a breach of faith and a breach of the commitment given by the Department to the board of management if this project does not begin.  The board of management made their plans on the basis that this project would begin in 1987 and all that remains to be done is for the contractor to commence his operations and he is already known to the board of management.</P>
    <P>The school will cater for between 600 to 620 pupils in the 1987-88 school year in the most appalling conditions.  They would tolerate another winter &mdash; this winter &mdash; in order to provide those educational facilities but they certainly would not tolerate a second winter because the prefabricated structures which are scattered around the various schools at present will not be there for a second winter.  The teachers and children of Castlecomer deserve to know now when construction of this building will commence and I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us this evening that it will be started shortly.  I look forward to his reply.  Perhaps, Senator O'Toole would also like to say a few words.</P>

      <P>Go raibh maith agat, a Sheanadóir, as ucht an cúpla nóiméad seo a thabhairt dom.  I want to compliment the Minister for being able to come back here, like a rubber ball, for a third or fourth time to deal with a lengthening list of primary schools which <Col N="321" /> appear to be becoming the homes of the rodent population of Ireland.  I want to talk about Lisdowney in particular.  I have inspected the school and I met the principal, Mr. Larry Hamilton, and his staff. They are a decent, hard-working and committed people who, against all the odds, have provided an excellent service in that area over the years.</P>
      <P>The national school system in Ireland was founded in 1831 but Lisdowney primary school was built in 1829.  Therefore, it is two years older than the whole system.  It is twice the age of the State. What has been written about it, in terms of inspection and in terms of people going into the place, would make a very good novel or a very good local history at this stage.  I want to refer to one report that was written about the school in 1956. In that report the writer stated that he observed rats competing for lunch with members of the teaching staff.  I am told they have had repetition of the same event intermittently over the past 30 years.</P>
      <P>I am not going to go into the particular details of the case because they have been dealt with very comprehensively by the previous speaker.  All I would like to say is that the pupils, the parents and the people of Lisdowney have been treated diabolically by the system over the years and they deserve every support at this point.  I hope that the Minister is not going to stand up again today and tell us what happened during the term of the last Government because the one thing that the teachers, the parents and pupils in this area do not want to know is the history part of it.  They want to know what is happening now and where they are going from this point on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now the responsibility of the Minister to take this problem in hand and resolve it.  The parents, teachers and management are at one on the matter; there is total agreement on it.  It speaks volumes for the commitment of the people of this area that having seen the Department of Education's project, which was costed at £260,000, stopped &mdash; this is how they see it, the Department would see it otherwise &mdash; and certainly <Col N="322" /> procrastinated on it, they drew up and sought tenders on a similar set of plans which would allow them build a similar structure for £130,000 or half the price.</P>
    <P>I think that that is a very good deal &mdash; it means the saving of £130,000.  The Minister could sort out the problems at Frenchpark with the same amount of money.  He could build two for the price of one.  If he let the business people of Lisdowney take over the disadvantaged schools in Ireland and let them present plans and provide builders they would do a far better job than what is being done at present.  It is a bit unfair on those working in the building section in the Department of Education, who have had their backs to the wall on this mainly because they are not getting the support of the Government on it.  I believe that this outmoded, substandard structure must be replaced.  The lack of movement by the Department and by the Minister is a clear abrogation of their duties and responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The physical condition of the school makes the implementation of the curriculum impossible.  The health of both pupils and parents is suffering and the development and progress of pupils, both their psychological and educational development, are seriously inhibited. There is no way in those circumstances that the primary school curriculum can be in any way effectively taught.  This Seanad must demand of the Minister and of the Department that the educational service to the pupils of Lisdowney be restored.  It can only be done by the provision of an alternative and acceptable new building.  What I saw there really put me in a rage and it cannot be allowed to continue.  I call on the Minister of State, and on the Minister for Education to take up their responsibilities and to take action on this matter immediately.</P>
    <P>There has been a mountain of verbiage spoken on this problem and there has been tons of correspondence and leaflets and many phone calls about it.  It is now time we saw some action.  I appeal to the Minister to tell us about some action in this case.  We would like to hear of some action rather than a history of the school <Col N="323" /> to date.  Similarly, on the other schools, only one of which I have personal experience but which fit into the same category, I ask the Minister to give us a positive response today.</P>

      <P>First, I will deal with Castlecomer community school.  The architectural planning for this project has now been completed and tenders were received some time ago. The next stage is the awarding of the contract.  Unfortunately, because of the financial constraints I do not envisage that it will be possible to place a contract for this project earlier than 1989.</P>
      <P>Lisdowney national school has an average enrolment of 85 pupils and the staffing comprises of three teachers, including the principal.  The accommodation consists of three teaching spaces, two of which were originally provided as classrooms and a third as a general purposes area.  The last mentioned is now used as a classroom.  The whole of this building was grant-aided by my Department and is of prefabricated construction. My Department have accepted an application from the school authorities for a grant for a replacement building of traditional construction to comprise three classrooms, a general purposes area and the usual ancillary accommodation.</P>
      <P>The project has reached the stage where tenders are being sought and examined.  It is one of a number where the next stage will be the placing of a contract.  Unfortunately, again, because of the difficult financial climate, my Department are not in a position to proceed to the next step.  This has been explained to the school authorities by my Department who have also stated that the only relief that can be offered is a grant for the provision of new prefabricated classrooms and toilets.  In response to this, as both Senators mentioned, the school authorities recently put forward certain alternative proposals to us in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to acknowledge that the present <Col N="324" /> prefabricated accommodation at Lisdowney is unsatisfactory and the provision of a new school building would be the ideal solution to the school's current difficulties.  Unfortunately, because of the financial constraints which I have mentioned I am not in a position to approve the placing of a contract for the permanent building as proposed. However, I wish to assure the House that the practicability and the cost implications of the recent proposals, to which both Senators referred, which have been submitted by the school authorities are being examined as a matter of urgency and a decision on these will be conveyed to the school authorities at an early date. We are keen to examine proposals from communities such as this one which involve a substantial reduction in cost. Because of the difficult financial situation this is the only way that I can see us making any significant progress in the coming period.</P>
    <P>With regard to Graiguenamanagh school which has an enrolment of 132 pupils and staffing comprising four teachers, including the principal, the present accommodation consists of three classrooms of traditional construction and two prefabricated classrooms.  The proposal is to provide a new school comprising four classrooms, a general purpose area and the usual ancillary accommodation.  The existing school building is to be demolished.  Tenders for the new school building were received in my Department on 12 May last and they are at present being examined.  However, irrespective of the outcome of the examination of the tenders it will not be possible, because of the difficult financial climate which I have already referred to in the case of the Lisdowney project, to proceed immediately with the placing of a contract for the Graiguenamanagh project. My Department will communicate with the school authorities as soon as the examination of the tenders has been completed.</P>
    <P>With regard to Mooneenroe national school, my information is that a major scheme of improvements has recently <Col N="325" /> been completed with substantial grant-aid from my Department.  The works covered attention to toilets, heating and lighting installations, provision of a teachers' room and replacement of windows and doors.  My understanding is that there is general satisfaction locally at the outcome of this scheme and this school is now operational in its improved condition. I am not aware of any difficulties with regard to the contribution which Senator Hogan mentioned but I will bring any such difficulties to the attention of my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, I did not suggest that there are difficulties but I am asking the Minister if he could supply me personally with information about how sympathetically the Department are looking at the local percentage contribution in view of the high unemployment rate in the area.  Normally a percentage contribution is given by various communities but an exception should be made in this case so that the people in the area would not have to make a contribution.</P>

      <P>The Department will provide you with the information of what contribution has been demanded and if you are not happy with the level I would be glad to discuss it further with you.  I am sorry that the news is not positive.  I feel the same way as the Senators do about the condition of those schools and <Col N="326" /> I am sorry that I cannot report any progress. It is a serious problem but the financial state of the country dictates it to be like this.  I do not see any major improvement in the foreseeable future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell us when the decision on the alternative proposal will be made and conveyed to the board of management of Lisdowney school?  I was sorry to hear the Minister talk about 1989 for Castlecomer.  That will be a major disappointment for the people of that area.  If he had said 1988 it would not be as bad.  Perhaps the Minister could reconsider that date in view of the fact that the school caters for such a large number of pupils.</P>
