      <P>I have notice from Senator Jack Daly that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Government to reverse their decision to abolish Bord Scann·n na h…ireann (Irish Film Board) in the interests of the Irish film industry.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Paul Bradford of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to indicate when it is proposed to start a building programme at Rahan national school, Mallow, County Cork, as a serious accommodation problem will exist there in September 1987, as some of the present accommodation is extremely unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Mick Lanigan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to use his considerable influence to ensure that the United Nations renew the UNIFIL mandate in Lebanon which expires on 19 July.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Brian O'Shea of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2170" /> The need for the Minister for Finance to expand the recent decentralisation programme to include other areas than those designated in order to redress regional imbalances.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Brendan Ryan of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to ensure that funds provided by him to the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children are used for the purposes he intended.</P>
    <P>I regard all matters as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Daly's motion and it will be taken at the conclusion of business this evening.  Senators Bradford, Lanigan, O'Shea and Ryan may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended that we take items Nos. 1, 2 and 3 today and that we take all Stages of items Nos. 1 and 2.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I would like to know the intentions of the Government over the coming weeks as far as the programme of work is concerned.  We are particularly concerned on this side about the possibility of the Abattoirs Bill.  It is very complex legislation, with some 66 sections in all. There are many interests who need to be consulted and we would not like to see this Bill go past Second Stage.  Likewise, if possible on the Adoption Bill we would like to see as full a debate as possible on Second Stage.  I believe it is not proposed to take the Companies Bill until September. As has been pointed out, we will be back before the D·il in September so there is no urgency about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a somewhat similar point on the Business ordered for today.  I would be reluctant to see the House take the whole of the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Bill. This is quite an important and detailed <Col N="2171" /> Bill.  It is quite a significant rationalisation, both of competition law and consumer protection legislation.  I would be happy if we took Second Stage today but I would ask that there would be a period before Committee Stage is taken. This seems to make sense for the reason that Senator Manning gave.  This House is coming back in September.  The D·il is not sitting anyway and it would afford us an opportunity, which I would welcome, to consider and put down, if necessary, amendments to the Bill and have a proper Committee Stage debate on it.</P>
      <P>Since Senator Manning has moved to the Business which it is proposed we would take during the week, may I mention another matter?  I mentioned this privately to the Cathaoirleach but I think it is probably appropriate to mention it on the Order of Business if we are considering the programme for the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that of the two family law Bills which have been published by the Government, the first is a very brief Bill simply abolishing proceedings for restitution of conjugal rights.  I am quite happy that that would go forward but I do not think there is anything very urgent or significant about it.  The second Bill, the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) (Amendment) Bill, 1987 is an important Bill, which I welcome very much.  It is an important amendment to a very sensitive area, the whole area of barring orders, protection orders, potential abuse of either spouses or children, including child sexual abuse.  My plea to the Leader of the House is to ask if, instead of ordering that Bill for this week, which I understand may be our last sitting week before the summer recess, it would be possible to postpone Second Stage until September.  I say that because it would be important, even on Second Stage, that Members of the House would get some feedback, particularly from lawyers and social workers, or possibly from members of the Law Reform Commission who are dealing with child sexual abuse.  I have furnished a copy of the Bill to a former distinguished Member of this House, Catherine McGuinness, who is <Col N="2172" /> chairperson of the Family Lawyers' Association and I know that association want to prepare a memorandum to be available to Members of the House.  We are not going to lose any time because if we take this Bill on Second Stage in September on foot of having some considered feedback on it, I think we would have a better debate.  It is a matter for the House if people want to go ahead with Second Stage but the Bill has only been published.  A great many people with a very significant interest do not know that this Bill has been introduced in the Seanad.  We would get a better debate on Second Stage and a better Committee Stage if we could put it off until September.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the line of questioning of the Leader of the House about his intentions, may I ask him what are his intentions for the sitting hours for today? Is it intended to sit late?  I understand that the House is likely to be sitting Wednesday, Thursday and Friday in addition to today.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Abattoirs Bill, this is very important legislation on which there has been much discussion and debate at interdepartmental level and from interests involved.  I notice that it is No. 9 on the Order Paper.  The Leader of the House has not set a date for Second Stage.  It is down as being ordered for Second Stage and it has not been ordered this morning.  Perhaps he would advise us because we would like to start off the process on that Bill, certainly before the summer recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Manning that it is very complex legislation which will want the fullest debate.  I welcome the fact that it is being initiated here, where it will get the kind of debate it deserves.  There is a lot of interest involved in this &mdash; I will not say that there are vested interests &mdash; consumer, producer and the people at the coalface so to speak.  It is important legislation and will need a good bit of time.  We would want to know when it is intended to begin Second Stage.  Perhaps the Leader would answer that question and also give the hours of sitting and say <Col N="2173" /> if I am right in assuming that the House will be sitting for the rest of this week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On the same issue and with particular reference to the Abattoirs Bill, the Companies Bill and the Adoption Bill, because those three have been initiated in the House and because all three are quite complicated and very critical, it would be important to get an assurance from the Leader of the House that he would not intend going beyond Second Stage with those three Bills until the next session.  If we are to put down meaningful amendments, we would need that time to study them.  I have not received a copy of the Abattoirs Bill. Perhaps this is due to postal difficulties, but a period of three or four days to try to take in the amount of legislation proposed is not enough.  I would ask for longer notice before Bills are introduced.</P>
      <P>I would also like to get some indication from the Leader of the House as regards the number of hours we are to sit this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of points have been raised about the hours and days of sittings between now and the end of the session.  Somebody said that this would be the last week before September but I cannot agree with that analysis.  It does not look as if this will be the last sitting week.  The intention is that today we will sit as late as is necessary to complete the three items before us and that tomorrow we will take the Family Law Bill and the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) (Amendment) Bill.  I understand the problems that Senator Robinson has in regard to item No. 5 but it is intended to take Second Stage of that Bill tomorrow.  Because it is a highly technical Bill I think she will agree that Committee Stage is going to be of major importance. Adequate time will be given to Senators to reflect on Second Stage and put down whatever amendments they feel are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Bill is a complex one but it is intended that we take all Stages today.  I <Col N="2174" /> take the point that it might not be desirable that we go directly from Second Stage to Committee Stage.  However when Second Stage is going through, the Whips can get together and decide whether there should be a short adjournment between Second Stage and Committee Stage to allow Senators who want to put down amendments to do so.  I take the point about the undesirability of dealing with the Bill in this way but it is a Bill that needs to be got through because it has implications for the general public.  Therefore, we should get it through as soon as is possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot advance it because the D·il is not sitting so exactly the same principles apply.  I would ask the Leader of the House to reconsider the position in the course of the debate on Second Stage.  It would be important to have time to consider the question on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point fully in regard to item No. 5 but I do not think anybody could suggest they were unaware the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Bill was coming to the House today and that we would be taking all Stages.  On 24 June I referred to that Bill and said that all Stages would be taken.  That is one of the Bills that was specifically mentioned on the Order of Business on 24 June.  It is intended to take item Nos. 4, 5 and 6 tomorrow and to commence the Independent Senators motion on education.  It is intended that the Companies Bill be taken to the completion of Second Stage on Thursday. Because there have already been over 21 hours of debate on Second Stage on that Bill in the House, we will take it to the conclusion of Second Stage on Thursday. The Abattoirs Bill has a large number of sections and we will take that to the conclusion of Second Stage also.  The Adoption Bill will not be taken any further than conclusion of Second Stage on Thursday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the remainder of the session, I do not think it is going to be possible to give sufficient time to debate <Col N="2175" /> very important Bills, in particular, the Companies Bill, the Abattoirs Bill and the Adoption Bill and I do not think we should rush to try to have those concluded this week.  If Members have adequate time to discuss Second Stages of item Nos. 8, 9 and 10 and there is a possibility that we may finish on Friday we may sit on that day.  However, that will be a matter for the House to decide between now and Friday.  If we do not get through all the business we will sit on Wednesday and Thursday next week.</P>

    <Title>Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Bill, 1987: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to bring this Bill before the House.  The Bill is an important step in strengthening competition and consumer protection policy.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to streamline the operation, and to extend the scope, of existing competition and consumer protection legislation.  I am introducing this Bill on the basis of a detailed examination of the matter which has been undertaken in my Department. The previous Government undertook to strengthen competition policy through the restructuring of current institutional arrangements and by means of new legislation to amend the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972.  The Examination which has been carried out included consideration of the overall effectiveness of the work of the Restrictive Practices Commission, the Examiner of Restrictive Practices and the Director of Consumer Affairs in the promotion of greater competition and efficiency in the economy.</P>
      <P>In considering the need for new measures in the regulation of competition, it is important to bear in mind the purpose of competition legislation and, indeed, the function which competition fulfils in the economy.  When operating fairly, competition is a healthy element in the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should not be viewed as an aim in itself but, rather, as an essential means towards the improvement of production so as to encourage an efficient economy and to benefit the consumer.  Restrictive practices reduce the choices open to the <Col N="2177" /> consumer and can lead him to pay higher prices than might otherwise prevail in an unrestricted market.  Also, an informed consumer is a valuable stimulus to industry, requiring procedures to remain efficient and in touch with consumers' requirements.</P>
    <P>Before moving on to deal with the contents of the Bill, it may be useful to describe briefly the nature of the various institutions at present involved in the implementation of competition and consumer protection policy in Ireland. Before the enactment of the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, the functions which are now carried out separately by the Examiner of Restrictive Practices and the Restrictive Practices Commission were discharged by a single body, the Fair Trade Commission.  This situation was regarded as unsatisfactory by trade and industry as it was felt that the Fair Trade Commission, in the conduct of inquiries, were both prosecutor and adjudicator and therefore could not be acting impartially in their adjudicating function.  In response to these arguments, the 1972 Restrictive Practices Act created the new post of Examiner of Restrictive Practices who was given the investigatory functions under the legislation, with the adjudication aspect being retained by the new Restrictive Practices Commission.  The later Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, conferred further functions on the examiner and the commission.  Under that Act, the examiner is required to investigate any proposed merger referred to him by the Minister while the commission carry out inquiries into apparent monopolies, again at the request of the Minister.</P>
    <P>In the area of consumer protection, it is the Director of Consumer Affairs who acts as watchdog.  The post of director was set up under the Consumer Information Act, 1978, which was the first major piece of consumer protection legislation in this country.  Generally, the functions of the director under this Act and under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, are to ensure the reliability of information conveyed to the <Col N="2178" /> consumer in the advertising, promotion and sale of goods and services.</P>
    <P>The posts of Examiner of Restrictive Practices and Director of Consumer Affairs are now occupied by one person. This was, in my view, a necessary first step on the road towards improved efficiency in the areas of competition and consumer protection.  The Bill goes further down this road by the assignment of the examiner's functions under the Restrictive Practices Act to the retitled Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade and of most of the examiner's functions under the 1978 Mergers Act to the Restrictive Practices Commission, to be renamed the Fair Trade Commission. This rationalisation, together with a number of provisions in the Bill designed to strengthen the powers of the commission and the director will result in greater overall efficiency and a reduction in the number of State bodies and will, I believe, help towards the more coherent and integrated administration of related policy measures.</P>
    <P>A second element in the strengthening of competition policy is the extension of the scope of competition legislation to include a number of regulated service sectors such as communications, banking and electricity.  These services were generally excluded from the legislation on the basis that they were already subject to the control or direction of another Minister or regulatory body.  In recent years, however, the international trend has increasingly been to re-examine the rational for the exclusion of such &ldquo;regulated&rdquo; sectors.  In the area of competition policy, in particular, the OECD have urged member countries to review the matter in order to establish whether the original justifications for exemption were still valid.  The areas of energy, transport and banking were particularly mentioned in this context.</P>
    <P>The Bill, therefore, removes the exclusions from the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, and the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, in the areas of communications, banking and electricity.  In addition, the exclusion <Col N="2179" /> relating to services provided under a contract of employment is being removed from the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972. In view, however, of the responsibility of the Minister for Labour in this area, I am proposing that his consent will be necessary before any regulatory activity in relation to such services can take place under the Restrictive Practices Act.</P>
    <P>I am also availing of the opportunity presented by this Bill to remove a significant exclusion from consumer protection legislation.  I believe it to be untenable that banking is not subject to the provisions of the Consumer Information Act, 1978.  While acknowledging the controls exercised by the Central Bank over the licensed banks in relation to various matters, I believe that the banks should be subject to the same controls as other businesses in relation to advertising.  I have, therefore, provided in the Bill that the exemption which the licensed banks enjoy at present will be removed.</P>
    <P>In pursuance of the policy of increased efficiency, I am providing in this Bill for the centralising, as far as possible in a single agency, of the enforcement functions contained in a whole range of legislation in the consumer protection area. I am speaking here of enforcement in relation to such areas as food labelling, textile labelling, price display and safety standards for particular products.  What I am proposing is that the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade should be the principal enforcement agency. Enforcement functions, including powers of prosecution, are at present vested in me as Minister for Industry and Commerce. I have provided in the Bill for the transfer of these functions to the director. The director will assume these functions in addition to his existing functions and I am confident that this arrangement will lead to the more effective enforcement of legislation for the consumer area, and hence, to better protection for the consumer.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am availing of this Bill to effect a number of amendments to consumer legislation which will, I hope, serve <Col N="2180" /> to improve the efficiency of the administration of that legislation.  For example, the Bill will confer on the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade the power to seek an injunction against somebody who is seeking to evade his obligations under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980.  I am also providing for the creation of a number of specific offences relating in particular to the impersonation of authorised officers and the supply of short weights or measures.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn to the content of the Bill and to explain the main provisions in the Bill to the House.  Part I of the Bill contains the usual preliminary matters common to all Bills.  There is no need to go into detail except, perhaps, on section 3.  This section provides for the repeal of the enactments listed in the Second Schedule to the Bill.  These repeals are, to a large extent, designed to remove my powers of prosecution under various pieces of consumer legislation.  These powers are, as I have already indicated, being transferred to the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade.</P>
    <P>I have already explained that the Bill will extend the scope of competition legislation by removing the exemption which relates to certain services.  The relevant parts of the definitions section of both the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, and the Mergers Act of 1978, together with section 25 of the Restrictive Practices Act and section 52 (1) of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, are being repealed to give effect to this proposal.</P>
    <P>The repeal of section 13 (1), and paragraphs 1, 2, 4 and 5 of the Second Schedule of the Restrictive Practices Act, is consequent on the abolition of the post of Examiner of Restrictive Practices, to which I have already referred.  These provisions relate to the appointment of the examiner by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 16 of the 1972 Act, which is also being repealed, deals with the reporting procedures of the examiner on the basis of investigations carried out by the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade are being simplified in the <Col N="2181" /> interest of improved efficiency.  The new reporting procedure is contained in section 15 of the Bill, which amends section 14 of the 1972 Act.</P>
    <P>The repeal of section 2 (2) of the Prices (Amendment) Act, 1972, follows from the abolition of detailed price controls, which the previous Government decided on in 1986.  At present, under section 2 (2), any statutory power to fix or control prices may only be exercised with my consent.  With the lapsing of price controls generally, it is appropriate to remove the requirement for this consent and to permit the statutory powers to revert to the Minister and bodies concerned. The final repeal which should be mentioned is that of section 23 of the Consumer Information Act, 1978.  This section is being repealed in order to remove the exemption which licensed banks at present enjoy, thus making them subject to the supervision of the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade in so far as advertising is concerned.</P>
    <P>Turning now to Part II.  This Part contains the major thrust of the Bill, providing for amendments to the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, and the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978.  Sections 5 to 7 are concerned with the change of name of the Restrictive Practices Commission to the Fair Trade Commission and the Director of Consumer Affairs to the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade and with the transfer of the functions of the Examiner of Restrictive Practices to these agencies.  Section 8 is designed to make the procedure for making orders under the 1972 Act more efficient by allowing me, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, to make such orders, subject to consultation with certain interested parties, without having first received a report from the Fair Trade Commission.  I should point out, of course, that any orders made under this section are subject to confirmation by Act of the Oireachtas, as are all orders made under the Act.</P>
    <P>The purpose of sections 10, 11 and 13 is to strengthen the role of the Commission by allowing them to exercise their <Col N="2182" /> powers under the Act on their own initiative, that is, without the existing requirement to have first received a request to do so from either the examiner or myself. Sections 14 and 16 also strengthen the Commission's powers by conferring on the Commission power to require information when conducting a study or analysis under section 12 of the Restrictive Practices Act.  Considerable powers of investigation are also being given to the authorised officers of the Commission under section 16.  These powers already apply to authorised officers of the examiner under section 15 of the 1972 Act. As a further measure to strengthen the Commission's powers, section 15 of the Bill allows the Commission to request the Director to carry out an investigation under the 1972 Act.  At present, only I, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, can request the examiner to carry out such an investigation.</P>
    <P>Sections 17 to 19 are designed to ensure the efficient and effective enforcement of restrictive practices legislation, first of all by giving the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade power to seek an injunction to enforce compliance with an order made under the 1972 Act, secondly by giving the director powers of prosecution under the 1972 Act, thirdly by extending to 18 months the time during which offences under the 1972 Act may be prosecuted, and, finally, by increasing the fines payable, on conviction of an offence to a level which will bring them into line with present day money values.</P>
    <P>The amendments to the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, which are contained in sections 21 and 22 of the Bill are, once again, designed to improve the efficiency of the administration of the legislation. Section 21, for example, permits the Fair Trade Commission to delegate one or more of their members to carry out a particular investigation into a proposed merger.  This type of investigation is at present one of the examiner's functions but is being transferred to the commission under section 7 of the Bill.  Section 22 of the Bill gives to the director power, first, <Col N="2183" /> to seek an injunction to force compliance with an order under the 1978 Act and, secondly, to prosecute for summary offences under the Act.</P>
    <P>Parts III and IV of the Bill are, for the most part, designed to effect the establishment of the director as the principal enforcement agency in the consumer protection area.  Sections 23 to 25 confer on the director powers of prosecution under the prices Acts and makes some consequential provisions in relation to authorised officers under those Acts.  I should like to emphasise once again that although detailed price control has been abolished all the Minister's powers under the prices Acts are being retained and will be used where necessary.</P>
    <P>Sections 26 to 35 contain the major amendments in the consumer protection area, and I would like to deal with these, if I may, in some detail.  The main purpose of section 26 is to confer on the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade the powers necessary to enable him to carry out his functions efficiently. For instance, the provisions of the Consummer Information Act, 1978 in relation to authorised officers are being amended to take account of a recent Supreme Court decision affecting authorisations. The section also removes local authorities' powers of prosecution under the Consumer Information Act and the merchandise marks Acts.  This is in line with the policy of having, as far as possible, a single enforcement agency.  However, the powers of the Minister under the Consumer Information Act are being retained as there may be circumstances in which use of such powers by me may be necessary in the public interest. Section 28 confers on the director power to seek a High Court Order to ensure the observance of the obligations imposed under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, and the Sale of Goods Act, 1893.  Section 31 confers prosecution powers on the director in relation to a wide range of consumer protection legislation. The full list of the legislation in question is the First Schedule to the Bill <Col N="2184" /> and, as I have already mentioned, concerns matters such as food labelling, textile labelling and product safety.  This legislation is at present enforced by myself, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, but these powers of prosecution are now being transferred to the director.  Sections 32 and 33 further strengthen the enforcement function by, first of all, prohibiting the disclosure of information obtained in the course of an investigation and, secondly, providing for the creation of a specific offence for the impersonation of an authorised officer under any competition or consumer protection legislation.  The offences created under sections 32 and 33 will be prosecuted by the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>I should like now to deal briefly with just a few of the remaining sections of the Bill.  Section 27 amends section 40 of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, and has the effect of bringing electricity services within the scope of the Act.  This amendment is in keeping with the overall policy of bringing regulated services within the scope of competition and consumer protection legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 34 provides for a pension scheme for the holder of the office of Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade.  This scheme will be subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance and must also be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Section 35 introduces a new offence in the consumer protection area which will form part of the weights and measures legislative code.  The section prohibits the sale to the public of short weights or measures.  It is an important provision in the context of consumer legislation.  Prosecutions for an offence under this section will be brought by the weights and measures inspectors. Finally, section 36 is a straightforward section the purpose of which is to provide that judicial notice should be taken by all courts of the signature of the director or a member of the commission.  Under the existing legislation, it is necessary for the relevant officer to attend in court to prove his signature.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2185" /> I hope the House has found this explanation of the Bill of use.  I will be happy to answer points on which further clarification is needed.  I recommend that the Bill be read a Second Time.</P>
    <P>I might add that in the period since this Bill was circulated originally we have taken the opportunity of introducing some technical amendments and indeed one amendment to take account of the abolition of the post office users' council and the users' council in Telecom …ireann as well.  Basically those are the amendments that will be brought forward on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is the product of work carried out by Fine Gael in Government.  I am glad to see that the Government are adopting Fine Gael policy in this area as well as in other areas.  This Bill gives due recognition to the importance of competition policy and consumer protection.  It also seeks to streamline the operation of the present Restrictive Practices Commission, the Examiner of Restrictive Practices and the office of Director of Consumer affairs. From an efficiency viewpoint it is correct that these separate offices be combined. This will centralise information and expertise and should lead to more effective use of resources both in financial terms and in terms of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This charge is also important for the general public as it provides a local point for the protection of consumer interests. Up to now responsibility for protecting consumer interests was spread throughout too many agencies.  The Examiner of Restrictive Practices carried out investigations into unfair or restrictive practices in the supply and distribution of goods and the provision of services. Meanwhile another body, the Restrictive Practices Commission held public inquiries on the recommendation of the examiner or at the request of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  A third agency under the Director of Consumer Affairs was concerned with consumer interests generally but dealt primarily with accuracy and reliability of information conveyed to the consumer in the advertising <Col N="2186" /> promotion and sale of goods and in the provision of services.  At the end of the day the most effective way of ensuring that consumers get a fair deal is through competition.  Hence the best approach is one which ensures that the conditions for effective competition exist and that competitive pressures operate.  For this reason I hope that the new position of Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade will be one which will be active rather than passive in the way it is operated.</P>
    <P>The director should be in a position to carry out studies and investigations of all markets to ensure that those markets are operating in a competitive manner.  The director should not have to wait for problems to arise before carrying out investigations into markets or into practices which operate in an anti-competitive way.  Sections 10 to 13, inclusive, of this Bill must be welcomed as they give greater initiative to the new fair trade commission.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum states that competition legislation is being extended to include banks, communications, and electrical services.  On reading the Bill I could find no reference to this.  Perhaps the Minister will inform us as how he proposes to include these activities and when he will do so.  Indeed I see no reason why any market for goods or services, be they public or private sector, should be excluded from competition policy and from the protection of consumer interests.  Some of the worse abuses of competition take place in the public sector.  While in the past there was a greater belief in the role of the public sector in providing certain services through a monopoly, today it is increasingly the case that people see a greater role for private involvement in providing these services.  There is no reason why there could not be private involvement in providing, for example, telecommunications. Indeed the introduction of an element of competition into many of these types of services could only operate to benefit the consumer.  Given the move towards the removal of barriers to free trade in the internal market of the <Col N="2187" /> EC it is imperative that we in Ireland prepare for the increase in competition by getting our own act together here at home.  We must be more willing to adopt a positive attitude to competition rather than a fear of competition.  There is some respects of legacy of the old protectionist attitudes in our approach to new entrants in to supplying goods and to other areas such as opening hours of premises, licensing arrangements for different businesses, etc.  All of these issues should be subject to analysis with a view to ensuring that the consumer gets a fair deal.  Only by adopting a positive approach to competition in Ireland will we be able to cope with the efforts at European level to complete the move towards the internal market.  We can, if we wish, sit back and merely react as changes take place in Europe, or we can prepare in advance for such changes and put ourselves in a position to capitalise on the changes.</P>
    <P>The benefits to Ireland will be far greater if we instil an aggressive attitude to competition rather than adopt a purely defensive approach.  The new post of Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade has a key role to play in this respect in generating a fresh and positive approach to competition and to the interests of the consumer.  This new approach will pay dividends in other respects also.  For too long our attitude in industry, agriculture and the services has been based on the interest of the supplier rather than the consumer.  If we are to maintain our share of the domestic market and to obtain a greater share of overseas markets, we need to adopt an approach in tune with consumer needs. The only sure way to guarantee greater sales for our products and greater job opportunities is to become more aware of what the markets and consumers want rather than what is most convenient for the suppliers to provide.</P>
    <P>This Bill, prepared by Fine Gael in Government, is important and can represent an opportunity to bring pressure for change of attitudes.  It can help make us more competitive on the international stage by ensuring that enterprises pay <Col N="2188" /> greater attention to the needs of consumers and adopt a positive attitude to competition.  It can also ensure that we are prepared for the challenges which will come when measures are adopted to bring about greater competition in Europe.  However, I hope that the passage of this Bill will not see an end to the attempt to bring about greater competition. Whether we like it or not, markets are changing.  Deregulation is the order of the day, be it in airlines or financial services.  Possibly we can withstand such changes temporarily but there is a certain inevitability about such changes that we will have to adopt to.</P>
    <P>Having continued Fine Gael policy of rationalisation of some of the agencies involved in competition policy and protecting consumer interests, the Minister should now go on to consolidate all this legislation and gather together the various Acts ranging from the Weights and Measures Act, 1889, and the Sale of Goods Act, 1893, up to the present day legislation.  The effort involved in such work will be well rewarded through the benefit it will bring to the economy.  Consolidation of all this legislation will provide a clear picture to consumers and suppliers of their rights and duties and act as a positive boost for competition, bringing with it greater benefits to the economy through higher sales in both the home and export markets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill and I welcome the measure wholeheartedly. The Bill is an amending Bill amending the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, and a number of other consumer protection Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to extend the scope of competition and consumer protection legislation and to improve the efficiency of the operation of this legislation, as the Minister pointed out in his introduction.  This is being done by amending the institutional arrangements under these Acts.  The post of Examiner of Restrictive Practices is being <Col N="2189" /> abolished and his functions are being transferred to the new Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade and the Fair Trade Commission.  The powers of the Fair Trade Commission are being strengthened principally by their being given power to exercise their functions on their own initiative.</P>
    <P>The next important aspect of the Bill is the removal of the exemptions which apply at present to certain services, in particular those of banking, electricity and communications.  Until now banking was excluded from the Restrictive Practices Act.  Therefore, the activities of banks or building societies could not be investigated by either the examiner or the Restrictive Practices Commission.  I understand that these exemptions have resulted in the Minister not being able to make restrictive practices orders in such areas as conveyancing, advertising by solicitors and banks, tour operators and travel agency services and the policies of building societies in regard to insurance for mortgaged properties.  I welcome the removal of these exclusions as I feel it will contribute towards a more competitive economic climate.</P>
    <P>The Bill also brings those activities of Bord Telecom …ireann and An Post which are subject to competition within the scope of the Restrictive Practices Act and the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act.  This in no way affects the monopoly position of An Post and BTE but will, I feel, ensure that the other activities of these bodies will be operated in a competitive manner.  For example, BTE have set up a company called Telecom …ireann Information Systems who supply communications equipment in competition with other suppliers. It is important that the monopoly position of BTE should not be used to give an unfair advantage to them, and this Bill will ensure that this will not happen.</P>
    <P>On the consumer protection side, the Bill provides for the enforcement by the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade of the consumer protection legislation. Up to now, some of this enforcement was the responsibility of the director with some Acts and regulations <Col N="2190" /> being enforced by the Minister.  This resulted in areas of overlap and possible confusion for the consumer.  This rationalisation of the administration of consumer protection legislation will benefit the consumer greatly.</P>
    <P>Section 28 of the Bill will help to increase the level of protection available to consumers.  Under the section the director is being given power to seek an injunction in the High Court against the person who fails to comply with his obligations under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980.  This will add more muscle to the existing protection of the 1980 Act.  Overall, this is a very welcome consumer oriented Bill and will give the man in the street ammunition in the event of having a grievance whether it be by virtue of a restrictive trade practice or being sold faulty goods or equipment.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the Bill is a cleaning up operation of bits and pieces of legislation in the consumer affairs area.  It centralises all the functions under one office, namely, the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade.  I am very pleased to support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I also broadly support the objectives of this Bill which, as has been stated, is a carry over of a proposal from the previous Government for a streamlining and rationalisation both of our competition and our consumer protection legislation.  It is an important Bill and it will have very considerable implications. That is why I made a request, which I repeat, that we would have a reasonable opportunity for discussion on Committee Stage.  I say that in particular because the Minister is going to introduce amendments on Committee Stage and we have not seen them.  I hope we will not go straight to Committee Stage: I will be quite happy if we take it later tonight or tomorrow.  For reasons which I will develop, the Bill has far-reaching implications and it merits close attention. There is no reason to rush it through because the D·il is not sitting at the moment.  We can either consider it fully on Committee Stage before the end of <Col N="2191" /> this session or we can come back in September and consider it on Committee Stage then.</P>
      <P>As the Minister has already made clear in his speech when introducing the Bill, it basically provides for rationalisation by establishing a Fair Trade Commission to replace the present Restrictive Practices Commission.  It enlarges the powers of the Commission, particularly to inquire into anti-competitive and unfair trading practices and also gives it the function of investigating any proposed merger or takeover, which is referred to by the Minister under the Mergers, Take-Overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978.  I would like the Minister, in his reply, to give the House some indication of how the existing provisions have been operating. Previously those functions were carried out by the Examiner of Restrictive Practices. For example, how many requests for investigations have been made by the Minister to the Examiner of Restrictive Practices?  Have the commission a substantial workload?  How have they been operating?  I ask these questions so that we can see the background to the replacement of the examiner by the newly established Fair Trade Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another significant purpose of the Bill is to broaden the jurisdiction or the remit of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  This is recognised by the fact that the director will be retitled Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade.  When looking at the Bill, my overall impression is that the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade will be one of the most powerful offices in the land.  It will be an extremely important position.  The office will be in charge of legal enforcement, almost entirely in the competition and consumer protection areas.  That involves not only competition law and consumer protection but it also involves, in so far as there are European Communities provisions, European Communities competition regulations or European Communities provisions in the area of consumer protection, which we have implemented by the European Communities statutory instruments.  I hope <Col N="2192" /> the Minister will outline the extent of that European jurisdiction, particularly under Council Regulation No. 16/72, the main Council Regulation.  Will it be the Director or the Fair Trade Commission who will be represented at the advisory committee under Regulation 16/72?  Regarding the various hearings which the commission holds to investigate competition policy, how is that to be tied in with the changes the Minister proposes in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind that the director will have a very wide range of subject matter over which he will exercise important powers and also bearing in mind that he alone will have responsibility for consumer protection and competition, it would be useful to obtain information from the Minister about, for example, the staffing and resources of the director. If the director is to fulfil all the functions which are now being rationalised and streamlined under this Bill, he will require substantial manpower and resources for that purpose.  I would like an assurance from the Minister that that will be provided for, notwithstanding cutbacks etc., in the public service.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of competition legislation to include banks, communications and electricity services. I agree with the Minister's approach and with the recommendation of the OECD that these areas should be brought in under national competition legislation.  I support that extension.  I hope the Minister, in his reply, will explain how the competition legislation will extend in the area of communications.  How is it to be reconciled with the monopoly exercised by Bord Telecom in certain areas of communications? That is an important feature on which I would welcome clarification from the Minister.</P>
    <P>There are certain specific provisions in the Bill with which I am not entirely happy.  These would be normally more appropriately dealt with on Committee Stage but since I am not clear when we are going to take Committee Stage or how long we will have to discuss it, perhaps I could refer to some of them now. Why does the Minister feel it necesary to <Col N="2193" /> take to himself the wide powers in section 8 of the Bill?  In his introductory speech he said:</P>
    <P>Section 8 is designed to make the procedure for making Orders under the 1972 Act more efficient by allowing me, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, to make such Orders, subject to consultation with certain interested parties, without having first received a report from the Fair Trade Commission.</P>
    <P>He pointed out that any orders made under the section would be subject to confirmation by an Act of the Oireachtas. It is clear under section 8 (3) that there is that control, that it requires an Act of the Oireachtas to confirm the order. However, I am sure the Minister will agree that Restrictive Practices (Confirmation of Orders) Bills go through Leinster House like a dose of salts, usually at the end of an evening when they go through before anybody realises it and nobody quite knows what order is being confirmed.  It is not always a very effective method of control and I would have some worries about it.  What is the basis for giving the Minister the power to make these very wide-ranging orders without requiring, as in previous legislation, a previous report of the Restrictive Practices Commission?  That was the basis on which the Minister would make an order. It came to him on the basis of a report from the Restrictive Practices Commission.</P>
    <P>I would find it very difficult to draft section 8 in broader terms.  Section 8 allows the Minister to &ldquo;empire build&rdquo;&mdash; it really is extremely broadly drafted. Whenever the Minister considers it expedient, in the interests of orderly and proper regulation of competition, then he has to consult, but only with the commission, the director and any other Minister. Under section 8 (1) (a), (b), (c) and (d) the Minister has very broad powers. For example, under paragraph (c) he may make such provision as the Minister thinks necessary to ensure the equitable treatment of all persons in regard to the supply or distribution of goods or the <Col N="2194" /> provision of services.  What does that mean?  What are the constraints on the Minister under that subsection?  Perhaps he could tell me how limited he feels by that wording.  It seems to be a sort of omnibus provision.  The Minister is divesting himself of certain powers &mdash; for example, he is handing over the role of enforcement to the director and there is a coherence and a rationalisation in that. Is section 8 just one of these reserve sections in an Act which makes sure there is a safety net and which gives very wide powers to the Minister?  If so, then to have a measure such as that in a Bill is not good legislation and I feel it would be appropriate to consider amending it.</P>
    <P>The other section about which I am concerned is section 14 of the Bill which amends section 12 of the Principal Act by extending the powers of the commission. I am not against the Fair Trade Commission's powers being extended.  I want to make that clear because it is necessary in certain circumstances, that they should have the power, for the purposes of their functions when conducting a study or analysis, to require a person to produce to the commission any document in his power or control or to give the commission any information which the commission may reasonably require.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that the protection for the individual is a helpful measure.  It seems to be terribly cumbersome and rather unwieldly.  Under section 3, it is a criminal offence to refuse to give the information or to produce the document. But then there is the possibility for a person who has been asked to furnish the paper, the document or the information and who has refused, to apply to the High Court and there is expense involved in that &mdash; within seven days.  Secondly, they are to apply to the High Court for a declaration &mdash; they are to apply to the High Court for declaratory release.  It is clear from section 14 (4) (c) that it is intended that there should be a full hearing because it says: &ldquo;The High Court, having heard such evidence as may be adduced and any representations that may be made by the commission and a person...&rdquo; is being asked to furnish the <Col N="2195" /> document or the information.  What is envisaged is a full High Court hearing. At the end of that hearing, the High Court has to make an extraordinarily difficult declaratory order.</P>
    <P>What is sought from the High Court is a declaration that the exigencies of the common good do not warrant the exercise by the commission of the powers conferred on them by this section.  I am not so sure how competent High Courts would consider themselves to be in weighing up the exigencies of the common good in this particular context. It is a difficult one, but it seems to be a very elaborate mechanism for protecting somebody against a possible abuse of power by the Fair Trade Commission.  If the Fair Trade Commission are abusing their powers and wrongly looking for information, I do not see it as being a particularly appropriate way to approach that.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of other technical points which are very detailed and I do not propose to go into them at this stage but I think we are beginning to realise&mdash; certainly lawyers are increasingly beginning to &mdash; the importance both of consumer protection legislation and competition legislation.  This Bill will reinforce and, to a welcome degree, rationalise the existing bodies.  The director will be the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade.  I am concerned that we should have an opportunity for very careful consideration of the implications of this legislation and that we have a fuller opportunity to examine the existing situation so that we will know why we are rationalising it to the extent we are.  For example, to some extent, there has been a gap in control.  I am interested to see whether the Minister has any views on that which he could make known to the House since price control legislation has not been in operation for some time.  Has that had an impact on prices?  If not, to what does the Minister attribute that?  This would be useful to know.</P>
    <P>Normally in a Bill of this kind where <Col N="2196" /> you have for the first time certain significant areas included, such as, for example, banking or telecommunications, it would be anticipated that there would be representations from certain sectors.  I do not know whether it is because this Bill has been recently reintroduced, revised and introduced to this House &mdash; it was presented by the Leader of this House on 23 June and it is now being taken for debate today &mdash; but I have been surprised not to have received representations in the normal way from certain sectors.  Whether or not I would agree with the representations, it is important that Members should have a feedback from those who are to be affected by the Bill.  I have personally been able to carry out a certain amount of consultation on it.  There is a danger if this Bill goes through the House today that we will not have done the job which we have the time and the opportunity to do if we simply regulate our business more carefully.</P>
    <P>Broadly I welcome the Bill.  I support the purposes of it, but I am worried about such a far reaching Bill reinforcing and extending such an important office as the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade without fuller and more reflective consideration in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Members in welcoming the Bill and I believe the general public are very interested in it.  The improved legislation will encourage those who engaged in fair practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill will help in some key areas, not least those who are promoting industry, especially small industries.  I believe some people starting up small industries are discouraged when they find they have to offer their merchandise to monopolies. I can see this Bill making a useful contribution and encouraging those people who have to depend on distribution and sales outlets.  The Minister's recent statement of his intention to bring the oil companies under notice was very useful and very helpful but the Bill &mdash; Fine Gael may claim credit for having drafted it&mdash;<Col N="2197" /> is much more important than that, and I do not think there is any serious division within the political parties on how necessary the Bill is.</P>
    <P>The whole area of trading stands to benefit.  There are a number of areas of distribution which, unfortunately, are controlled by monopolies, some of them bread and butter areas.  When the legislation is passed I hope some positive action will be taken.</P>
    <P>The distribution of flour is essential for a big number of families but it is controlled by a monopoly.  The distribution and price of bread and flour can vary by as much as one third from one supermarket chain to another.  I see the Bill providing the important machinery to deal with such situations and I hope it will be successful and that it will be implemented on the ground.  You can pass as much legislation as you like but if it is too cumbersome and too difficult to implement, it will not bring us one step further.  I urge the Minister, when this legislation is passed, to provide the backup machinery to implement it.</P>
    <P>On the question of pricing, it puzzles me how some major distributors and supermarket chains can sell an item at a third below its recommended retail price. That is a deterrent and is destroying the small distributors and retailers.  Another area in which there is much abuse is in the distribution of drink.  Some of our major drink suppliers have agents who continually operate a monopoly in certain areas and very severe restrictions are imposed on the licensed trade.</P>
    <P>I know of a case where a distributor for a major drink firm also distributes soft drinks.  If the retail licensed trade do not buy the soft drinks manufactured by the local distributor they will not get the supply of the brand name drink in question. I hope that no firm, distributor or monopoly will be too big to avoid effective action being taken against them under this legislation.  The general public are very interested and will be keeping a keen eye to see how effectively the new legislation will work.</P>
    <P>There can be as many amendments as one likes.  Perhaps some Senators feel <Col N="2198" /> they would like more time but the legislation has been necessary for a very long time and is long overdue.  There is nothing rushed about its presentation to this House and I hope it will have the desired effect.  The trading section are very interested in this legislation, especially the small trader.  The reason is that there is serious monopoly control, much of it from outside the State, which must be tackled.  I support the Minister's efforts and I hope this legislation will succeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">

      <P>Is mian liomsa ar dt˙s f·ilte a chur roimh an Bille seo, an Bille um Chleachtais Srianta (Leas˙), 1987.  In his annual report dated 26 March 1986 Gordon Borrie, Director General of Fair Trading in the United Kingdom stated:</P>
      <P>As one man's keen business practice is another man's unfair trading, it is never easy to be the referee.  But to the best of my ability I will endeavour to carry out the philosophy implied in the title of my post and do what I can to ensure fair trading conditions.</P>
      <P>It is in the spirit of that philosophy that I support this Bill to ensure fair trading conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the timely introduction in Seanad …ireann of the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Bill, 1987, the main purpose of which is, as indicated by the Minister, to streamline the operation and to extend the scope of competition and consumer protection legislation.  The provisions of the Bill were announced as far back as 17 January 1986 by Deputy John Bruton when, as Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, he outlined major new measures to promote competition and efficiency in the economy and a radical shake up of the existing consumer and competition bodies.  These measures will enhance the role of the new Fair Trade Commission in a number of ways: one, by bringing banks, electricity and transport undertakings within the scope of the legislation for the first time; two, by giving the Fair Trade Commission the power to undertake and to initiate inquiries on their own initiative <Col N="2199" /> for the first time and three, by giving the Fair Trade Commission additional powers to obtain information for the purpose of any studies which they undertake.</P>
    <P>The extension of competition legislation to banks, electricity and transport services is an historic step forward.  Up to now these had been restricted from scrutiny for restrictive and unfair trading practices.  Ireland is now in the forefront of European countries in opening up these important sectors to the scrutiny of fair trading agencies.  Both the OECD at international level and the National Economic and Social Council at national level have advocated a widening of the scope of the legislation to enable it to deal with unfair and collusive practices affecting the consumer in hitherto excluded areas.  In the words of Deputy John Bruton:</P>
    <P>It is very important that anti-competitive practices in all forms of public transport, electricity and banking are capable of being attacked.  It is not right that any sector of the economy should be exempt.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill gives the Fair Trade Commission new powers to make fair practice rules on their own initiative with regard to the supply and distribution of goods or the provision of services.  At present the commission can only make these rules on the recommendation of the examiner or at the request of a representative association.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the Bill gives the Fair Trade Commission new powers to initiate public inquiries, again on their own initiative.  At present such inquiries can only be initiated at the request of the Minister or the Examiner of Restrictive Practices or by a person whose request for an inquiry has been refused by the examiner.  These new powers, the power of initiative and the power directly to investigate, are of crucial importance.  In the words of Myles O'Reilly, the present chairman of the Restrictive Practices Commission:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2200" /> We will in future be able to authorise and organise dawn raids.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With the power of initiative comes the transfer of responsibility to the commission for ensuring competitive markets. This new legislation, therefore, should bring about a radical transformation in competition policy activity. As a result of the changes proposed in the Bill, the number of bodies dealing with competition in prices and restrictive practices will be reduced to two, namely, the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade and the Fair Trade Commission.</P>
    <P>The remit of the Director of Consumer Affairs is being widened to include fair trade and additional functions in the area of consumer protection, including the enforcement of prices and other consumer related legislation.  The title of the office is, accordingly, being changed to the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade.  The director will take over the role of Examiner of Restrictive Practices under the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972.</P>
    <P>Section 19 of the Bill provides that prosecutions under the 1972 Act may be brought by the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade and may be initiated within 18 months of the date of commission of the offence.  As the Minister has indicated, at present the Minister for Industry and Commerce is the prosecuting authority and proceedings must be initiated within 12 months.  The problems associated with the enforcement of restrictive practices orders have been summed up by Myles O'Reilly, chairman of the Restrictive Practices Commission, when he stated in a recent publication:</P>
    <P>Under the legislation up to now, enforcement of Restrictive Practices Orders has, in the first place, been the responsibility of the Examiner.  When the Examiner was satisfied he had a case, then he advised the Minister who in turn asked, if he considered he should do so, the Chief State Solicitor's Office to prosecute.  The effect of all this was that there were not many prosecutions and of those that were brought not all that many were successful and <Col N="2201" /> even where success was achieved, the fines imposed were paltry.</P>
    <P>Therefore, one of the most encouraging features of the provisions of this Bill is that prosecutions will be undertaken directly by the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade in the same way as the Director of Consumer Affairs has successfully enforced the provisions of consumer affairs legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a Fair Trade Commission which will replace the present Restrictive Practices Commission. The new commission will have greater powers to inquire into anti-competitive and unfair trading practices. They will be able to initiate examinations rather than waiting for someone else to do so.  They will be empowered to get people to release documents and provide information or else run the risk of being in breach of the law.  The Fair Trade Commission will also assume the responsibility for investigating any proposed merger or take-over referred to them by the Minister under the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978.  As the Minister has indicated, such examinations are at present being carried out by the Examiner of Restrictive Practices whose office is being abolished. Mr. Jim Murray, the present Director of Consumer Affairs, who is also the Examiner of Restrictive Practices, is in favour of this change.  Since his appointment as examiner he has had to deal with just one referral &mdash; Cantrell &amp; Cochrane's take-over of Dwans.  Mr. Murray states in regard to that:</P>
    <P>It confirmed my view that the review process would be better if it involved up to three people rather than just one person.</P>
    <P>Fines for offences against fair trade orders are also being increased.  This is most welcome.  Section 27 of the Bill abolishes the exemption from the provisions of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, which currently applies to contracts for the supply of electricity.</P>
    <P>I share the views expressed regarding <Col N="2202" /> the importance of this Bill so aptly expressed by the then Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy John Bruton, when announcing these major measures in January 1986:</P>
    <P>The new arrangements aim to create a more positive and active competition policy and better measures to protect the consumer's interests.  From now on the Fair Trade Commission and the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade will be taking the initiative in pushing for changes to improve competition and efficiency and benefit the consumer.</P>
    <P>In addition to their statutory duties, under the Acts, the former Restrictive Practices Commission acted as Ireland's representative on Restrictive Practices Committees of the OECD and the EC. Within the European Economic Communities member states are trying to establish the so-called four freedoms&mdash; the free movement of people, goods, services and capital.  Since Ireland joined the European Economic Communities on 1 January 1973 the competition rules of the EC are directly applicable in this country. These rules of competition are derived from several sources, namely, the Treaty of Rome, particularly Articles 85 and 86, the regulations issued by the Council of Ministers and by the European Commission, the formal decisions of the commission and the judgments of the European Court of Justice.</P>
    <P>The objectives of European competition policy can be summarised as follows: first, to prevent companies from reestablishing by means of market-sharing agreements and export bans &mdash; less visible but equally effective barriers to trade &mdash; to replace the customs frontiers abolished by the EC.  Both consumers and traders benefit from this policy.  The consumers benefit because they can take advantage of the lowest prices available in any of the member states and traders benefit because they are given access to a market on a European scale.  Second, to prevent excessive concentrations of economic power from damaging the interests of consumers, competitors or <Col N="2203" /> subsidiaries, free competition and free movement of goods are protected by preventing companies from abusing dominant market positions and preventing the concentration of economic decision-making in too few hands.  Third, to prevent national aids from affording unfair advantages or distorting competition in such a way that economic forces are disturbed and the very existence of the Common Market threatened.</P>
    <P>Apart from the fact that all firms in Ireland are subject to EC rules of competition, EC competition policy has particular relevance to Ireland because of its approach towards small and medium-sized enterprises, namely, the SMEs which, in the European context, includes most Irish firms.  First, the EC competition rules aim to protect the SMEs against unfair competition from groups of other firms and from dominant firms. For example, an SME which feels that its competitors are behaving unfairly, may complain to the European Commission, or the European Commission itself may act to expressly prohibit certain types of behaviour and may impose very heavy fines on those who breach the competition rules.  Second, the European Commission have actively encouraged certain types of co-operation especially among the SMEs.  Provided that firms have a combined turnover and market share below certain limits, any agreements they make are regared as of minor importance, applying the <i>de minimes</i> rule, and escape the prohibition of Article 85 of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>As regards consumer affairs, although there is no specific reference to consumer protection policy in the treaties which set up the European Economic Communities, the first impetus towards consumer protection policy was given by the Heads of member states in October 1972. At a meeting in Paris they called on the Community to adopt a programme to augment and co-ordinate national measures in favour of the protection of consumers. This policy was formally inaugurated in April 1975 with the adoption of the first programme of consumer <Col N="2204" /> protection.  The programme set out to guarantee briefly five basic consumer rights: First, the protection of the consumer against health and safety risks; second, the protection of the economic interests of consumers; third, the improvement of the consumers' legal position; fourth, the improvement of consumer education and information and, fifth, appropriate consultation and representation of consumers in the taking of decisions affecting their interests.</P>
    <P>In a publication of the Commission of the European Communities entitled <i>The European Community and Consumers</i> published in Brussels June-July, 1985, they state as follows:</P>
    <P>The variety and complexity of the goods and services available to consumers often cause confusion and frustration. Over the years as prosperity has increased, marketing conditions have been transformed and the traditional relationship between supplier and consumer has been overturned.  At one time the consumer shopped locally in a limited market where he or she often knew the suppliers personally. Nowadays the consumer faces a mass market where producers and retailers are relatively faceless.  They have gained considerable power through the process of mergers and are better placed than the shopper to control market conditions.  For this reason, consumers are becoming increasingly conscious of the quality and safety of goods.  They crave objective information on which to base their purchases, according to their needs and financial means.  They also want an improved right of redress if the goods or services purchased do not match up to expectations.</P>
    <P>It is in that context that I welcome the provisions contained in this Bill and the strengthening of the powers and functions of the Free Trade Commission and of the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade because I believe that these <Col N="2205" /> measures will ensure fair trading conditions. I wish to compliment the Director of Consumer Affairs and the Restrictive Practices Commission for all that they have done in the past and I wish the director and the commission every success in their endeavours in this regard in the future.  I am pleased therefore to welcome this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not delay the House too long on this Bill, except to say first that I welcome it.  I would like to comment on the remarks of Senators Reynolds and Kennedy.  One would imagine that this Bill was being brought in by a Fine Gael Government and that Deputy John Bruton was the Minister who was in the House today.  Unfortunately for them, it is not John Bruton who is in the House; this Bill was introduced by a Fianna F·il Government under Minister Albert Reynolds and is being taken here today by the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, Indeed, Fianna F·il had been to the forefront in introducing legislation of this nature and this Bill is a follow up to the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, the Mergers, Takeovers and Monopolies (Control) Act 1978 and, indeed, the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, all of which were brought in under the aegis of Fianna F·il Governments.  Fianna F·il have always been to the forefront in caring for the consumer.  There are many people who are of the belief that consumers are not as well protected here as they would be in other countries within the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to try to maximise the efficiency of those bodies who have as their remit the protection of the consumers.  I am delighted that a new title of Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade has been created and that this director will have assigned to him the role of the former examiner's functions under the Restrictive Practices Act.  Each time that legislation is adopted which is for the protection of consumers, there are many people who feel that they will be affected and one will hear cries from manufacturers and distributors that the more restrictions that are placed on <Col N="2206" /> them, the higher the cost of goods is going to be and that, whereas there might be a certain amount of extra protection given to the consumer, this protection is at a cost.</P>
    <P>In the past, there have been extra cost factors involved in the increasing protection of the consumer, particularly where it has meant the re-labeling and re-packaging of many materials.  There was a hullabaloo when the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980 came in; we were told that it would add at least 4 or 5 per cent to the cost to the consumer.  I do not think that these forecasts have proved true.  There is no doubt in my mind that consumers benefit from Bills of this nature.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the only people who were affected by the introduction of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980 were the fly-by-night and back street operators.  It is no harm that these people should be got at.  Legitimate suppliers and manufacturers were not affected to any great degree.  Competition is the life of trade.  It is essential that not alone should there be competition but that competition should be true competition.  For this reason I am delighted that banking, in particular, is being brought under the aegis of this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a consensus view around the country that there is not competition amongst banks, that the banks operate a cartel, that they are fairly well controlled under various Acts and by the Central Bank.  Nevertheless, there may be slight differences in the way fees and charges are operated but at the end of the day fees and charges for banking in Ireland are much higher than they are in other countries throughout Europe.  I am not mentioning interest rates here because interest rates vary throughout the EC and, indeed, throughout the world.  I am glad that we have seen today one of the major banks, AIB, bringing down their interest rates.</P>
    <P>I would at this stage appeal to all of those who are in the banking world to consider carefully any actions they might take over the next few months in terms of strikes, go slows, or disputes within <Col N="2207" /> the banking system.  I would appeal to the unions involved and in particular to the IBOA, an association of which I was once a member, and to the associated banks to consider carefully the problems that could accrue to Irish industry at all levels if disputes come to the fore in the banking system at this time.  It is unfortunate that today in one part of the country a dispute has reached the stage where pickets have been placed on the premises concerned.  Those of us who were in business during the periods of the two last protracted bank strikes saw the damage that was done to businesses because of these strikes.  I am not laying blame on any side.  I am asking all involved to consider their own positions.</P>
    <P>Bankers are in a relatively safe situation. They are relatively well paid. Bank profits are increasing and though it might appear, because of the takeover of one particular bank, that banking was not as profitable as it might be in this country, when one looks at the returns for what was the Northern Bank in Ireland one finds that the problems the Midland Bank had were not associated with any problems that the Northern Bank have had here in the South.</P>
    <P>There are many small firms in this country which could not afford to bear a bank dispute of any nature for a short or a long period.  We saw the situation in the past where business people were asked to act as unpaid bankers.  They cannot afford to do that now.  They cannot afford to hold moneys, to cash cheques or to hold cheques for even a day.  Equally, a protracted or short bank dispute would have huge effects on our credibility as a manufacturing nation.  In the past, maybe suppliers from outside this country would supply goods on extended credit during the period of a bank dispute.  I do not know that there are any companies outside this country who would do that now. I appeal to those in the banking community to iron out their differences before they have an effect on the Irish economy which might not be easy to overcome.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2208" /> I am glad that the area of communications has been brought in under the aegis of this Bill.  Since we have a virtual monopoly situation, it is essential that the communications area should be regulated and examined.  I am sure that when this Bill comes into force there will be cries to have that particular area investigated thoroughly.  I notice that when the Ombudsman gives his report each year the biggest proportion of criticism deals with the communications area and in particular with the area of telephone charges and costs.  Because Telecom have a total monoploy on communications in the telephonic area, it is essential that they produce telephone bills which are legible and which everybody can check out.</P>
    <P>I noticed in the papers again over the last few days that bills which were under dispute were not being dealt with as they should be, that customers were cut off even though the bills were still under dispute and that Telecom would not take from the subscriber the amount of money that the subscriber felt was the amount due.  That is something that a normal business would not be able to stand over. It is essential, in an area where there is a virtual monopoly, that the company should be open to scrutiny and not alone open to scrutiny by the Director of Consumer Affairs but equally that each telephone subscriber should be able to look at his bill and decide from the evidence in front of him whether he or somebody else was responsible for the amount of the bill.</P>
    <P>The supply of electricity is another area that is now being brought under the aegis of this Bill.  Many statements have been made by people in business that the cost of electricity is too high.  There may be very good reasons for this and there may not be.  The cost of electricity and the strength of the ESB can be checked out. I welcome the removal of a number of exclusions from the Restrictive Practices Act in these three areas.  I expect that this Bill will be welcomed by most people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  The many points that have been made by <Col N="2209" /> other speakers have been the subject of major discussion for a long time.  The Minister had no reservations in saying there are many areas where he feels there is not fair trading.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister made reference to the cost of banking in our country in comparison with other countries.  For a long time I have been saying that the banks were bringing about a situation where we could not be competitive <i>vis-a-vis</i> other countries.  If a business person is prepared to change a customer's cheque whether it is a cheque from the Allied Irish Banks, the Bank of Ireland or any other bank he is asked to pay a fee to the bank.  The banks charge this fee even at a time when the amount of money they seem to be making is enormous.</P>
      <P>According to their annual reports the Allied Irish Banks had profits in the region of £43 million in 1984 and of over £104 million in 1987.</P>
      <P>In a country that has been going through so much trauma since 1980 it is wrong that three or four groups can be so demanding, can even question what Governments do while making so much profit for so few people.  The four major banking groups are sucking from their one million customers &mdash; the other two million either do not save or do not spend &mdash; something in the region of £750,000 a day.  That is not an exaggeration.  It is the amount the major banking companies are making.  Yet up to now nobody has had the right to question them about this.</P>
      <P>I would hope the Bill is not going to be put on the shelf, because there are many areas we could have questioned but never did so because of the pressure these people were able to put even on Governments. I am not saying that we should not heed what the Central Bank say but they are telling many people to make sure this, that and everything else is done, yet we have no right to question the amount of money that is being made by so few.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to 1973 when a Coalition Government came into power no moneys had been coming into central Government from banking practices.  After seven months in power the then Government asked the banks for £5 million a year and <Col N="2210" /> after another 12 months they asked for £20 million per year.  This money is still being paid by the banks.  As soon as the order for paying the money was implemented the banks took more money from their clients &mdash; I will not say &ldquo;customers&rdquo; because the definition of a &ldquo;customer&rdquo; and that of a &ldquo;client&rdquo; is different. A client is a person one tries to hold on to and from whom one may get more money than would be got from a customer. Banks use their clients in every way possible to get every penny they can from them.</P>
    <P>I am a businessman and when I am making a lodgment or get a cheque book I have to pay for those services.  If I change a cheque for one of my customers &mdash; not a client &mdash; the banks charge me for that transaction.  What an insult it must be to have to charge people 12p, 13p or 18p for changing their cheques. Because of the problem of terrorism people are encouraged to pay by cheque. Yet the banks make sure that they are charged for doing so.  Nobody questions why they are allowed to do this.  Irrespective of what Government are in power somebody should question the banks about the profits they make.  The profits of the Allied Irish Banks rose from £43 million in 1984 to £104 million in 1987. That is an increase in profits of over 100 per cent and we never question them about that.  How can we say to the general public that we are not going to give them an increase of 50p a week in their social welfare allowance or we are not going to give them a double week's social welfare allowance at Christmas when we do not question people who make over £1 million a day?  I hope that the Bill will address that issue so that at long last the silent majority of clients will see that somebody is asking questions.  We all know that the vast majority of people and in particular business people, owe money to the banks but they are not going to ask questions because there might be intimidation in an indirect or even in a direct way.  Unfortunately that is a fact of life in our country.  Now that we are prepared to question the banks I hope we will continue to do so for a long time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2211" /> The cost of electricity is 30 per cent higher here than anywhere else in Europe.  We have nearly 300,000 people unemployed and we expect industrialists to set up here where energy costs are 30 per cent higher than they are 60 miles across the Irish Sea, in Britain.  How can we compete?  Yet they argue that there is no way there can be a reduction.  It is unbelievable.  If I said to somebody who lives in South Wales or in Holyhead that to use the same one horse power motor car in Dublin would cost me 30 per cent more I would be told to get lost.  That is a fact of life and we are not getting to grips with it.  They have no right to say they should be charging higher than anybody else.  If we are to be competitive&mdash; I understand the way the Government of the day are talking &mdash; our costs generally should be in line with those of everybody else.  Otherwise we are, and we all know it, dying the death.</P>
    <P>That does not necessarily point to Bord Telecom or the ESB.  Let me give one example in the ESB; they are the only energy company who can provide energy. During the ESB strike some time ago it was recognised as an energy which is needed all the time.  Yet if a new client is looking for energy such as light, he must get some other customer to act as a guarantor.  In other words, the ESB are not prepared to take the responsibility of saying: &ldquo;We will not give you power unless you get somebody to sign as guarantor.&rdquo;  Yet that person cannot go somewhere else for electricity.  That is illogical.  How can the ESB say they want more clients?  The ESB do not treat the person looking for power as a customer. That person is not a customer but rather a client because a client cannot go anywhere else.  There is no reason why the ESB as a company should say that client must get a guarantor when he cannot get that commodity elsewhere.</P>
    <P>We have a responsibility, in this House, to say to the ESB they they must give power to the person seeking it.  The reason they ask for a guarantor to sign is in case that person, whether setting up house or renting accommodation, runs <Col N="2212" /> away or does not pay the bill.  The guarantor must take responsibility for the bill.  A similar situation obtains with the banks. How can the ESB say to me that they provide energy which I cannot provide on behalf of the State and that they need a guarantor for the person looking for electricity?  Is it possible that the ESB cannot find the said person?  Is it possible that the ESB cannot take the responsibility without another customer taking it? It is immoral to ask another client &mdash; not a customer &mdash; to accept responsibility.  I would like to be corrected if I am wrong in saying that a person receiving a commodity which can be provided only by one person is a customer.  We have every right to question that.</P>
    <P>Bord Telecom have brought about a situation in which telephone bills&mdash; Senator Lanigan referred to this and I am aware of cases in Cork &mdash; were unbelievably high for private customers.  They are not customers.  These people cannot go anywhere else.  We must protect them, but we are not doing so.  I question whether the Bill will be strong enough.  I have been in the Seanad for nearly five years and we have discussed similar issues before but nothing has come of them.  We must question these people.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to one area where there have been vast improvements, that is the Office of the Ombudsman.  Problems are being solved for many people. He has proved, even to us as Oireachtas Members, that something can be done. With a small number of staff and the amount of money being spent by that office he has shown his concern, and interest is being shown by the public in that area.  I deal with ordinary people many of whom have said that they have written to the Ombudsman.  The public know they can now go to somebody.  It has proved to us as Oireachtas Members that the right people should be involved.</P>
    <P>We read about oil prices and the cost of fuel generally in other countries.  A similar situation applies to the banks where there are cartels.  Oil companies will give such things as a dozen glasses, wares, footballs and so on, but they will not give a reduction in the price of fuel. <Col N="2213" /> I would like to ask the Minister if it is true that the prices commission were eliminated.  I understood when the Minister eliminated the prices commission that he could always question prices. Have we still got the right to bring in price controls on fuel?  If we have, we should make it quite clear that price controls are not eliminated.  I understood the commission were in abeyance and that we had the right at all times to bring them back.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister and I hope that in the immediate future, we will see vast improvements in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Members of the House I welcome the Bill and the thinking behind it which is to tighten up and streamline several pieces of legislation. The statutory bodies are being brought together and rationalised. Indeed, looking at Part II of the Second Schedule &mdash; the revocation of statutory instruments &mdash; I note that 20 Acts are affected by this Bill, one dating back to 1851.  It is interesting, however, that of the 20 Acts going back over a period of 130 years, well over half&mdash;in fact 13&mdash;which affect the consumer, were introduced in the past 20 years while four were introduced in the last century.  Only three Acts affecting consumer rights were enacted from the foundation of the State until the late fifties.  This is an indication not so much that there was any lack of caring on the part of the founding fathers of the State, or of the people they represented, that there is a growing &mdash; and has been for many years &mdash; awareness and consciousness of the length to which some companies, some product merchandisers and marketeers will go to bring before the public products that are questionable either in the quality or manner in which they are promoted and marketed.  All this legislation is being affected by this Bill. From that point of view, since it is a help and a benefit to the consumer, obviously it is to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to concentrate on one or two aspects of the Bill as the inclusion of <Col N="2214" /> the regulated service sectors interests me. The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>A second element in the strengthening of competition policy is the extension of the scope of competition legislation to include a number of regulated service sectors such as communications, banking and electricity.</P>
    <P>I know previous speakers have touched on this and on the monopoly that these three areas, in particular, have enjoyed.  It seems the reason the Minister is now looking at this area is that the communications, banking and electricity sectors traditionally were set up to do business in a specific area.  For example, communications, formerly part of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and now Telecom …ireann, were set up primarily to service and to provide telephones and telecommunications generally.  Similarly with banking in their area.  The ESB were set up primarily and exclusively to provide energy for people and the means to avail of that energy. However, in the way of the world, with modern technology these companies have expanded into many other areas which impinge on the private sector.  The private sector felt for some time that these three areas &mdash; specifically communications, and electricity to a lesser extent than banking had an unfair advantage. The services were generally excluded from consumer legislation on the basis that they were already subject to the control and direction of another Minister or regulatory body.  To that extent the fact that these areas are now being included in the scope of the legislation is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Banking has been discussed and, I suppose, will always be a somewhat emotive subject, as the question of money is concerned. The fact that banking is being brought in under this Bill is welcome because it has to result in the long term in greater benefits for the consumer.</P>
    <P>The abolition of price controls and with it the termination of the activities of the National Prices Commission resulted in a legal limbo which some powerful international companies exploited to their <Col N="2215" /> own advantage in recent years.  I refer, among others, to the petrol companies. The timing of the abolition of the NPC by the last Government was somewhat foolhardy.  It came at a time when petrol and oil prices generally were falling as a result of the difficulties faced by the OPEC countries in coming to an agreement on production figures.  Consequently the price of oil reduced dramatically in the past 18 months to two years, at a time when we in Ireland abolished price controls.  The oil companies, in the scramble to provide some order in what had become a chaotic situation, were not too concerned about the consumer and were more concerned about protecting their profits.  The Minister is negotiating with the oil companies and attempting to get them to reduce their prices, particularly their prices at the petrol pump which, of course, is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The suggestion is that the oil companies are charging the consumer more than is fair.  Because they have a monopoly both nationally and internationally, in that they operate a cartel, they have an opportunity to take unfair advantage in the marketplace.  A previous Minister attempted to curb the excesses of the oil companies in this regard some years ago and was unsuccessful. I hope the present Minister is more successful.  Knowing him and his temparament I have no doubt but that he will ultimately provide petrol at the pumps at a fairer price.  In the context of the abolition of the National Prices Commission the Minister said: &ldquo;The repeal of section 2 (2) of the Prices (Amendment) Act, 1972, follows from the abolition of detailed price controls, with the previous Government decided on in 1986.  The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>With the lapsing of price controls generally, it is appropriate to remove the requirement for this consent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;that is, the consent to fix or control prices&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;and to permit the statutory powers <Col N="2216" /> to revert to the Minister and bodies concerned.</P>
    <P>The suggestion is that since the abolition of the National Prices Commission&mdash;and Senator Cregan touched on this briefly in his contribution earlier &mdash; a legal limbo, or a grey area has operated over the past 18 months to two years.  Obviously, with the introduction of the Bill that legal limbo will no longer exist and the Minister will have the statutory power and the full powers accorded to him to decide on price controls, not only in regard to oil and petrol but in a wide variety of areas.  The nation as a whole will welcome any reduction in the price of petrol at the pumps.</P>
    <P>I welcome in a general sense the whole thrust of the Bill to provide an environment in which competition will flourish fairly.  Competition is a healthy element in the market place.  We are an open market economy.  Obviously the legislation has been long promised and its introduction how is timely.  I might add that a section of the Bill refers to food labelling, textile labelling, price display and safety standards for particular products. Obviously, providing enforcement in these areas will be of benefit in the long term to the consumer.</P>
    <P>I hope the Irish consumer will take cognisance of the new statutory instruments in this Bill and will realise that their rights are being continually updated and protected.  It seems to me, as someone who travels a great deal, the Irish, taking their cue from their near neighbours in Britain, are a somewhat passive people when it comes to complaining about shoddy standards, be it in quality or in packaging.  For far too long companies, perhaps because they have been in a protected marketing environment, seemed to adopt that attitude that anything would do for the Irish consumer. The Irish consumer seemed to reciprocate by saying: &ldquo;We will take what you give us&rdquo;.  It is only in very recent times &mdash; and I would not say there is a coordinated effort in this regard; it seems to be very patchy &mdash; that the consumer is beginning to fight back and is beginning <Col N="2217" /> to talk back to the people who provide various products.  I hope that, after the passage of this Bill together with the publicity which will obviously surround the debate in this House, the consumer will become less passive.  I do not know whether it is part of our national psyche. It does not happen in other countries, specifically in America where there are very tight consumer laws and where there are consumer watchdogs who constantly keep a weather eye open for any company whose products do not come up to acceptable standards.  That does not seem to be the case here.  The public are to blame to a great extent.  I do not think in this instance they can blame the legislators. The legislators have provided the framework and the laws.  If anybody goes into a store and is not happy with what he gets and if the shopkeeper refuses to facilitate him, the law is there to back up the consumer if the merits of the case deem it to be so.</P>
    <P>Without repeating myself I hope that after the passage of this Bill the Irish consumer will not accept second or third rate goods, that they will demand what is their entitlement and, if products in stores are not to their advantage or not what they seem, they will complain on the spot.  If they are not accommodated by the shop owner or the manufacturer, whichever the case may be, the remedy is there.  The Director of Consumer Affairs and all the various statutory bodies are there to help them out.  Overall I think the thrust of the Bill and its contents are to be warmly welcomed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this legislation in the House. I am glad the Minister had decided to initiate this legislation so quickly in order to speed up the process by which we can remove some of the appalling restrictive practices currently in existence.  It is now over 30 years since the Fair Trade Commission, the predecessor of the present Restrictive Practices Commission, submitted the first report on an inquiry into the grocery trade in Ireland.  In the interim there have been two public inquiries, two reviews of the operation of <Col N="2218" /> restrictive practices orders relating to the grocery trade and one informal intervention undertaken by the commission. However, price competition in Ireland 30 years ago was nothing like it is today.</P>
      <P>The 1973 groceries order contained a prohibition on advertising below cost products covered by the order.  It was the first attempt to stamp out the malpractice of below cost selling but, in my opinion, the commission had not the staff or the will to pursue the matter to a successful conclusion.  In their 1980 report on their inquiry into the retail sale of grocery goods the Restrictive Practices Commission examined again the situation regarding below cost selling.  The commission considered that below cost selling was an undesirable practice involving a distinct element of unfairness.  Never-the less, the commission did not ban the practice but said that if concentration in the grocery trade reached such a stage where competition between the multiples appeared to fade or the independent sector ceased to be economic, all factors which might increase the degree of concentration, including the practice of below cost selling, would have to be seriously reconsidered.</P>
      <P>This is the background against which the Bill is introduced before the House today.  Undoubtedly, the supermarket chains have increased their share of the market substantially, to such an extent that small family grocer, a feature of every town and village in the country, is beginning to disappear.  It is regrettable that it has taken so long for successive Governments to act on the need to ban below cost selling by the retail sector. This House must come down firmly on the side of the family business which is keeping many rural communities alive and protecting much rural employment. At present 174 multiples are operating in Ireland with a turnover in excess of £1,200 million annually.  That would absorb a tremendous amount of the existing market and inevitably it is leading to a monopoly, which is undesirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has initiated a total ban on below cost selling, that he has increased the penalties to which multiples <Col N="2219" /> will be subjected and has enlarged the scope of the director and the Fair Trade Commission to encompass other consumer areas such as electricity supply and banking.  A ban on below cost selling will not necessarily mean higher prices, as has been propounded by many supermarket chain chiefs.  It will not mean higher prices to the consumer but, more important, it will help to protect about 22,000 jobs in the retail food sector.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to use the opportunity to examine the amount of credit being levied by multiples on some of their smaller suppliers.  Often the length of time a small supplier has to wait to receive payment from a supermarket owner, in the first place, to get the order leads to the winding up of a small business and drives that supplier out of business. This is an infringement of what a supermarket chain is all about, an infringement no Minister for Industry and Commerce should allow to continue.</P>
    <P>The food industry at the moment is working on very low margins of about 2 per cent.  Obviously, this will create enormous pressure on the grocery trade. The leaders of the attack on below cost selling for many years have been RGDATA and I take this opportunity to compliment them on keeping the pressure sustained on successive Governments in order to bring forth this measure.  I hope the necessary stability which RGDATA seek for the trade will come to pass as a result of this measure.  Buying power in this country is very concentrated and the Restrictive Practices Commission report found that we are in the top four of 23 countries in the concentration of buying power.  I quote from that report:</P>
    <P>It is apparent that the large multiples in particular...have significant buying power and they use it to obtain better terms than those available to the remainder of the trade.  The obtaining of more favourable terms than one's competitors can be facilitated by the power to delist one or all of the products of the supplier or manufacturer. Even without delisting, particular <Col N="2220" /> products can be given a smaller amount of shelf space or unfavourable locations which will reduce the sales of the product.</P>
    <P>Such malpractice is widespread.  We heard the Minister on a number of occasions speaking about gross interference in the marketplace by the &ldquo;hello money&rdquo; concept.  In the milk sector I see this problem increasing in many supermarket chains with various co-operatives and various people involved in the milk sector introducing incentives to supermarket owners or paying substantial amounts of money in order to occupy the premier space on a particular shelf or in a particular supermarket chain.  This is the activity which this Bill addresses in an effort to stamp it out, and I hope it succeeds in that area.</P>
    <P>Many speakers referred to the restrictive practice which is gathering momentum in the petrol retail area.  Senator Mooney and many other speakers referred to it and it is causing increased concern to the consumers.  The extent of the gimmickry on offer by petrol outlets is not in the best interests of the consumer and the Minister should impose a ban on this activity immediately.  The consumer wants a lower energy price, not inducements to buy from one company over another.  The overriding condition and overriding factor in any of this activity should be the best value for money for the consumer, not the best value for money for the company.</P>
    <P>Another area which has been the subject of scrutiny by the Restrictive Practices Commission has been building societies area.  The new regulations introduced by the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy John Boland, are not working satisfactorily.  The spirit of the regulations is not being implemented by the societies.  Recently I came across a number of instances of a client wishing to change insurance cover from the building society's insurer to another insurance company, or an insurance intermediary of his or her choice, and the building societies in question are seeking unnecessary valuations and surveyors' reports to ensure that the market value <Col N="2221" /> of the property is maintained for their own purposes.  That is a classic example of the spirit of the regulations not being compiled with and building societies using every opportunity to satisfy the age old maxim of &ldquo;what we have we hold&rdquo;. The insistence on surveyors' reports and unnecessary valuers' reports is an extra tax, an extra cost on the consumers who have suffered badly under these regulations for a number of years.</P>
    <P>All to often we hear about the financial institutions and the way they are exploiting the consumer.  It is probably easy for Members of the Oireachtas and easier for the various consumer interests to &ldquo;have a go&rdquo; at a financial institution if you want to get some pressure off your chest, so to speak, but the insurance companies, banks and financial institutions have been levied for years by various Governments to attract a significant amount of finance into the Exchequer.  I regret to say that it is a malpractice of the highest order that this levy imposed on a bank or insurance company finds its way back to the consumer. For example, the levy put on insurance companies of 2 per cent for the PMPA compensation fund and 1 per cent on the insurance premiums of all premium holders originally was intended by the Government of the day to be extracted from the insurance company themselves, and the Government should insist on that.  After all, the companies are making sufficient profits for the Government to extract this money from the insurance company.  It is unfortunate that the consumer and the general public have to pick up the tab for whatever levy is imposed on the consumer in the budget each year.  I ask the Minister to examine ways in which he can control financial institutions and prohibit them from passing this levy to the consumer, to whom it was never intended to be passed in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the recent announcement by the Minister that the Restrictive Practices Commission examine the legal profession.  Without pre-empting what is in the report I know that many people are concerned about the regulatory nature of the legal profession and for example, the <Col N="2222" /> practice of solicitors not releasing papers to other solicitors if so requested by a client.  This is leading to tremendous problems and to the client being tied up in enormous bureaucratic knots between various solicitors and not getting anywhere at the end of the day with the matter in hand.  I regret that this restrictive practice is not being tackled by the legal profession who have a regulatory body under the Law Society.</P>
    <P>The drink trade is another area where varying levels of prices apply between Dublin and the rest of the country, between bars and lounges and between city and country areas.  The failure of the enforcement of the prices order and of the other various practices need to be examined in depth.</P>
    <P>Finally, I welcome the powers being extended to the Fair Trade Commission to take their own initiative on instituting restrictive practices proceedings.  I welcome also the power that the Fair Trade Commission will have to enforce compliance of these procedures.  Only in that way will consumer interests and responsibility for consumer interests be protected. Taken out of the political arena and given to a full time director of consumer affairs who will ensure that the present irregularities in the case of restrictive practices will cease to exist. The Bill is to be welcomed.  It is the exact copy of the Bill which was introduced by the previous Minister.  It is worthy legislation and very timely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill particularly in view of the fact that its main purpose is to streamline the operation and extend the scope of competition and consumer protection legislation to include banks, communications and electricity services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many years a considerable amount of legislation for consumer protection has been in existence.  Unfortunately, it took the form of a multiplicity of Acts.  It is good that so many sections of other Acts are being brought under the scope of this Bill.  The problem was that consumer problems, in particular, were dealt with by different Departments.  It might be <Col N="2223" /> said that if one had a problem with regard to agriculture some form of administration by the Department of Agriculture was necessary to process the grievance but overall the direction and effectiveness of that legislation was not in accord with current ideas on consumer protection.  Under previous legislation designed to help the ordinary consumer, any complaint had to be pursued by the consumer alone.  This deterred people from making complaints.  However, I am pleased that the Ombudsman deals with the whole question of consumer protection. This has been a great advantage.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if the Bill will cover sufficiently the question of misrepresentation and high pressure selling. Will it be more informative and responsible in creating the right attitude among traders?  Certainly it will go far enough to enforce the law and to make it more effective.  An imbalance always existed between the powers of the consumer and those of manufacturers and suppliers, with the consumer being on the wrong end for a number of reasons.  The spread of technology and the development of the consumer society with its concentration on mass production etc. did not help the consumer to a great extent.  Instead it contributed to widening the gap.</P>
    <P>In both manufacturing and retailing outlets the emphasis has been on larger units.  This has not been good for the consumer but I am confident that the legislation before us will be of great assistance in making less acute the problems experienced by consumers over the years.  It is understandable that manufacturers have to encourage people to buy.  It is also understandable that they would want to buy in ever increasing numbers so they can get the full plant value and there is higher productivity. An element of that was the full scale advertising which was carried out.  There was a period when even this hyped up advertising to get people to buy goods did not satisfy many manufacturers.  They tried to ensure that people would have to continue to replace goods at frequent intervals.  This is evidenced by the <Col N="2224" /> number of products you can buy nowadays but which, instead of being usable for some years, have to be thrown away in a year's time.</P>
    <P>These are inevitable trends in today's society and I do not want to get ideological about it.  There will be need for greater advertising campaigns and for people to design advertisements in such a way that there will be some dissatisfaction with the goods in existence and more products will be sold.  This will probably in some cases lead to the production of goods of a lower quality which will become unsatisfactory quickly and, consequently, have to be replaced much earlier than would otherwise be the case Mass producers do not make products that have to be serviced fairly regularly; they want the consumer to replace a product rather than have it repaired.  I am not suggesting that this is a great plot on behalf of manufacturers.  These are the inevitable consequences of mass production. From the point of view of the manufacturers it does not make a great deal of sense to spend a lot of money on servicing.  Nevertheless, the consumers are the victims of that hyped up campaign. The producers try not to put too many goods on the market which would need servicing.  They want people to buy their products, throw them away and then buy more.  This is part of the system. It is encouraging to see consumer protection being introduced and I am sure the Minister is doing everything in his power to further this end.  I do not believe this will be the end of it.  I believe we will see the pace change, necessitating another look at this area in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>I do not know what powers the local authorities have regarding consumer protection, or if there is scope for local government to provide different types of advisory services so that the people could take advantage of the provisions in this legislation. I do not know how the weights and measures will be affected by this Bill.  This is another area of consumer protection which can be added to the local government advisory services.  I am <Col N="2225" /> not talking about the setting up of bureaux or anything else like that.  I am talking about the extension of the terms of this Bill.  We were talking about the devolution of power and this is an area where we might think seriously about that.  We have to bear in mind that there is a desire among people who are in competition to reconcile their antagonistic interests and to make competition less aggressive but that does not take care of the consumer.  In my view, the Bill goes a long way in this direction and I welcome it.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for a very fine debate and for their very fine contribution on Second Stage.  As always with the Seanad, the debate was constructive although in my time here I am not so sure that it was so constructive&mdash; perhaps because of my interventions.</P>
      <P>I am glad the House has accepted the general approach in this Bill and that they agree the general thrust of it is correct. I am happy that through the efficient operation of competition policy, which is in line with EC thinking at the moment. I am also happy that the consumer will be protected to a greater extent as a result of the measures proposed in the Bill before the House today.</P>
      <P>I recognise that there are elements in this Bill which can be improved and I am grateful to Senators for the detailed points they raised.  I have taken on board the points which they raised today and, to the extent that I feel they can improve the Bill, we will certainly look very closely at them.  A small number of points, mainly of a technical nature, have come to light since this Bill was published. We will be introducing amendments in relation to these on the Committee Stage which, I understand, has been set for next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators raised a number of points of detail which I will try to deal with as quickly as possible.  Senator Reynolds inquired in what part of the Bill the exclusions being removed were laid out. At present, they are contained in the <Col N="2226" /> Second Schedule, but I will be proposing an amendment on Committee Stage to bring them into the body of the Bill, so that the body of the Bill will be crisp and clear as to the removal of the exclusions.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson dealt with a number of issues.  She asked how many requests to the examiner had been made under the legislation.  In that regard I can tell the Senator that there were seven notifications since 1982.  Of these, two were subsequently withdrawn, four were allowed to proceed, and one order was made relating to the Irish Civil Service Building Society and the Bank of Ireland. I hope that is the information Senator Robinson was seeking.  She asked if I would outline whether the director or the commission would be responsible for Regulation 16.72 meetings.  Normally the Fair Trade Commission will be represented in view of their primary function in relation to mergers and monopolies. Senator Robinson also raised a point about the resources available to the director. The number of persons involved has been increased from a total of nine in 1983 to a figure of 19 at present.  The director will also have a further six people from the examiner's office.  The estimate for 1987 is £321,000, and the outturn for 1986 was £192,000.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson was anxious about the reconciliation of Bord Telecom as a monopoly with the new provisions in the legislation.  An Bord Telecom maintain their monopoly, but if the director is investigating a particular activity of An Bord Telecom, where, for example, competition is involved, he will be able to look at all of Bord Telecom's activities in this context.  That is something into which we can go in greater detail on Committee Stage.  In that regard, Senator Robinson spoke about section 8 of the Bill.  She was concerned that the powers in section 8 were too wide.  It is envisaged that those powers will be used only in very urgent circumstances where time does not permit the ordinary procedure to be applied.  An inquiry by the commission could take a very significant amount of time and that time may not be available in a particular set of urgent circumstances <Col N="2227" /> where the public interest might be involved.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that the legislation makes it clear that, even where an order like that is made by the Minister, subsequent confirmation orders &mdash; that is, subsequent Acts of this House and the D·il &mdash; will have to be passed.  That is a safeguard and a protection to what Senator Robinson regards as the wide powers in section 8.  She also dealt with the time available for debating the measure, and so on.  Obviously that is a feeling most legislators have in regard to all legislation. The Bill was published in November 1986.  While it lapsed with the D·il, it has been around for some time and there has been a considerable amount of time to study it.</P>
    <P>I have been asked whether price control legislation is in operation.  That legislation is still in operation in the sense that prices are being monitored and the legislation can be used if necessary.  From a general point of view, a number of other issues arose.  Senator Cregan asked if the National Prices Commission were still in existence.  The Senator will recall that the National Prices Commission have been abolished, but all the prices legislation is being retained, with the powers to control prices therein and these can be used if necessary.  While the National Prices Commission are not actually in existence, the legislation and the powers are there to be used if necessary.</P>
    <P>I want to comment on some points Senator Cregan made in regard to the banking system.  I have no brief whatsoever, nor does any member of Government, to defend the banking institutions but one should not let those remarks pass without putting on the record some little piece of the other side of the story.  I can understand how Senator Cregan and other Senators might feel that financial institutions were &mdash; some of the words he used were &ldquo;intimidatory&rdquo; and &ldquo;exorbitant&rdquo; and so on &mdash; and I can understand how any business person would feel that on a daily basis in regard to their own bank but we have to keep the matter in perspective.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2228" /> A substantial amount of money has been coming back to this country in recent months.  One of the reasons for that is that we have worked, through successive Governments, to maintain a sound, solvent banking system.  I would like to point out to Senator Cregan that the return on investment for the major banks, the return on shareholders' funds, is running at 10 per cent to 12 per cent. It is easy to quote millions of pounds per day in profits, but if you are dealing with figures of that order you have got to keep them to a percentage to get a feel for their size.  The banks are talking about 10 per cent to 12 per cent return on shareholders' funds.</P>
    <P>When Senator Cregan or other Senators make remarks like that about the banks they must be very careful to consider whether we want our banks to earn less than 10 per cent on shareholders' funds.  If we do, then that is fine.  There are steps available to do that through the taxation system and through various arms of Government but I do not believe anybody is seriously suggesting that our banks should be forced down below that particular level.  If you do that, you damage the banking system and the credibility of the financial structures of the State.  If they were not earning at least that type of return on shareholders' funds we might be faced with a lot more difficult legislation in the House of the Oireachtas and we might not have many of the funds which have been attracted in recent months back to this country.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of giving banks a free ride or a free rein but of sensibly controlling and monitoring their activities and, at the same time, allowing them to earn sensible returns on shareholders' funds.  I do not regard that kind of figure as exorbitant.  I disgressed to put those comments on the record because of the remarks made by a number of Senators in regard to the financial institutions lest my silence in that regard should be interpreted as some form of agreement.</P>
    <P>Senator Hogan spoke about below cost selling.  While it was interesting and I accepted some points he made, that calls for separate legislation and is being dealt <Col N="2229" /> with by a different route.  He also spoke about restrictive practices by the building societies and he said that the new regulations were not working.  The Bill will ensure that these activities can now be investigated by the director whereas up to now any investigation by the examiner or by the Restrictive Practices Commission was stymied by the exclusions in the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972.  The Senator is quite right to be concerned about that.</P>
    <P>Senator Kennedy spoke about the EC and we are all conscious of our EC obligations in relation to competition and consumer protection.  This Bill is a step towards what Senator Kennedy wants to achieve, which is greater competition in a regime of genuine consumer protection.</P>
    <P>I want to thank Senator Harte also for his very comprehensive analysis in regard to the manufacturing area and his welcome for the advance in consumer protection. I will certainly take his remarks on board to see if any advances can be implemented.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney spoke about petrol prices.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is keenly aware of the question of petrol pump prices charged by individual retailers.  I want to thank all the Senators who contributed to this constructive debate.  This Bill is complicated and detailed and I look forward to joining Senators on Committee Stage next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is to provide for the extension of the Custom House Docks area.  The present boundaries of the area were defined in the Schedule to the Urban Renewal Act, 1986, and the Act made no provision for <Col N="2230" /> their alteration.  It quickly became clear, when the Development Authority were set up and discussions with potential developers commenced, that there was an immediate need to extend the area to include the River Liffey quays adjoining it and, furthermore, that the successful redevelopment of the Custom House Docks area should not, and could not, be tackled in isolation from the adjoining docklands to the east of the present area. The Government decided that the area should be extended immediately in a southerly direction to the centre of the River Liffey and should, subsequently, be extended eastwards on a phased basis once development of the Custom House Docks has got under way.  The Bill, accordingly, provides for the extension of the Custom House Dock area by order made by the Minister for the Environment with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  The Bill deals also with other matters which arise, or will arise, as a consequence of the extension of the remit of the Authority.</P>
      <P>The Government are committed to securing the early redevelopment of the Custom House Docks area in a manner which will benefit both our capital city and the economy as a whole.  Indeed, the whole thrust of the present redevelopment effort has its origins in legislative proposals put forward by the Fianna F·il Government in 1982 in the Urban Development Areas Bill, 1982.  That Bill lapsed with the dissolution of D·il …ireann on 4 November 1982 and it is regrettable that it took until March 1986, almost three and a half years later, before the Coalition Government revived those proposals and presented them in the form of the Urban Renewal Bill, 1986.  It is a pity that this time was lost in securing the redevelopment of the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government are determined to ensure that there will be no more delays in securing completion of the task.  I made it clear to the Authority last March that early and sustained progress was expected and I am pleased to say that the Authority responded by bringing forward their target dates for completion of the necessary stages of preparation, planning <Col N="2231" /> and development.  Senators will be aware that an important milestone was reached last month when the Authority presented a planning scheme to me for approval.  I will make a decision in relation to this scheme as soon as possible, taking account of the submission made to me by Dublin Corporation in relation to it. Senators will also be aware that the development work began on the site within the last few weeks with the demolition and clearance of some of the buildings which are not intended for preservation.</P>
    <P>For my part, I have given an undertaking to keep under continuous review the legislative framework under which the Authority operate and to bring forward any necessary proposals to deal with any hindrances to the Authority in securing the redevelopment of the area.  I have been in frequent contact with the chairman of the Authority in this regard and, arising from these contacts, the present Bill is both necessary and timely.</P>
    <P>The basic purpose of the Bill, as I have already said, is to allow the Custom House Docks area to be extended and I have indicated the extensions which are proposed.  The Bill allows extensions to be effected by order made by the Minister for the Environment with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  This is in line with the procedure under section 6 of the Principal Act which allows an area to be designated by order for urban renewal purposes.  Extensions are confined, however, to lands immediately contiguous to the existing area and situated between the southern boundary of that area and the centre of the River Liffey, or to the east of the area and lying between the Liffey and Sheriff Street Upper and Lower.  It will be clear, therefore, that the purpose of these extensions is not to expand the Authority's jurisdiction to lands which are separate and distinct from the existing area.  Instead, the purpose is to expedite the redevelopment of the existing Custom House Docks area by providing potential developers and investors with an assurance that the Government intend to see to it <Col N="2232" /> that the entire dockland area in the vicinity of the Custom House Docks is progressively renewed and redeveloped.  In addition, the Bill will enable redevelopment of the existing area to be carried out in a manner which relates well to its surroundings and which reincorporates the site and the quayside into the life of the city.  This is essential because of the importance of the site, the nature and scale of the development and the impact it will have on the whole fabric of the city centre.</P>
    <P>The southern boundary of the area at present lies along the Custom House Quay but does not include the road, the quayside or any part of the River Liffey. It quickly became apparent that this situation was unsatisfactory and would restrict excessively the options available to the Authority in relation to roads and traffic arrangements, pedestrianisation schemes and environmental improvement and amenity works necessary to exploit fully the potential of the river and the quayside.  One of the most important objectives of the redevelopment of the area must be to maximise the quayside and the river as an integral part of the fabric of the city and to exploit its value for the purposes of communication, recreation and amenity, and as a unifying link in the appearance and structural organisation of the city.  The present boundary of the area militates against this objective.  For this reason, the Government decided that the area should be extended to the centre of the River Liffey as soon as possible and I made an announcement to this effect on 10 May 1987 so that it could be taken into account by the Authority in the preparation of the planning scheme.</P>
    <P>In addition to the riverside frontage to the south of the existing area, it is important that redevelopment enhances and relates well to other adjoining areas. Senators will be aware that the area is bounded on the western and northern sides by the Custom House, Busarus, the Postal Sorting Office and Connolly Station, all of which are unlikely to be the subject of major redevelopment in the foreseeable future.  However, there is <Col N="2233" /> considerable potential for improvement and redevelopment to the east of the area where a good deal of land is in the hands of public bodies.  The extension of the remit of the Authority in an easterly direction is, therefore, a logical and necessary step and provides the best means of realising the full potential of this area.</P>
    <P>I would mention, in particular, that the local authority housing complex at Sheriff Street is already the subject of review by a special working group drawn from Dublin Corporation, the Department of the Environment and the Authority. There are serious social and environmental problems associated with the Sheriff Street flats complex which warrant attention in their own right.  It is appropriate, however, that this area should be addressed also in the context of the redevelopment of the Custom House Docks area and the working group is required to consider all the options in relation to the Sheriff Street flats having regard to the need to improve the environmental conditions of residents, the development of the inner city and the redevelopment of the Custom House Docks.  I wish to dispel any suggestion, however, that any decision has been made about the future status of this housing area, much less that it is to become the responsibility of the Authority.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill will increase the number of ordinary members of the Authority from four to seven.  This increase is needed to broaden and strengthen the range of expertise available on the Authority and to include, for example, more persons who have direct experience in the financing and carrying out of large-scale development proposals. The Authority at present consists of a full time chairman and four part time members.  This is the smallest number of members on any of the 16 bodies under my aegis.  The average number of members of these bodies is 14.  Actual membership ranges from five to 36.  The number of members of any statutory body must, of course be related to the functions and requirements of the particular body.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2234" /> In the case of the Custom House Docks Development Authority, it is relevant to compare it, for example, to An Bord Plean·la which has a full time chairman and five full time members.  In contrast, the size and structure of the Authority, with a full time chairman but only four part-time ordinary members, in my view, is not commensurate with the size and urgency of the task and the diverse range of functions to be performed.  The Authority needs to be strengthened and supported by an increase in its membership, particularly having regard to the special expertise which will be required in the promotion and development of an international financial services centre.  I should say also that the present approach of the Government to the size of the membership of the Authority is entirely consistent with their proposals in this regard in the Urban Development Areas Bill, 1982, and in the amendments which were put forward last year in both Houses to the Urban Renewal Bill, 1986.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that the chairman of the Authority will have the statutory duty of ensuring the efficient discharge of the business of the Authority.  A similar provision applies to the chairman of An Bord Plean·la under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1983.  It is desirable that an express requirement on these lines should apply to the chairman of the Authority who is, of course, a full time executive chairman.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 and 6 confer necessary powers of land acquisition on the Authority. The Urban Renewal Act, 1986, allows only for land acquisition by agreement. The special powers of transfer of land by ministerial order under section 13 of the Act relate only to land in the Custom House Docks area held by the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  All such land in the existing area has already been transferred to the Authority.  Therefore, while these powers were adequate in relation to the existing Custom House Docks area, they would neither be appropriate nor adequate in relation to new areas which can be added under the provisions of the Bill.  Sections 5 and 6 reflect the considerable differences in terms of <Col N="2235" /> land use and land ownership between the present area and the areas to be added to it in the future.</P>
    <P>Section 5 confers powers of compulsory land acquisition on the Authority. The intention is that the Authority will have the same powers in this regard as a housing authority under Part V of the Housing Act, 1966.  This section does not apply to land held by statutory bodies but will enable the Authority to acquire any other land that is situated in the Custom House Docks area, as defined for the time being.</P>
    <P>Section 6 enables land held by a statutory body in the Custom House Docks area to be transferred to the Authority by order made by the Minister for the Environment with the consent of the appropriate Minister and the Minister for Finance and after consultation with the body concerned.  Consequential matters, including the assessment of compensation and any necessary application or modification of other enactments, are provided for.  As with section 5, this section will apply only to land which lies within the Custom House Docks area, as defined for the time being.</P>
    <P>I think it well to point out that neither section 5 nor 6 can be used in relation to land forming the bed of the River Liffey, which is, of course, foreshore and is vested in the State.  The granting of a lease of foreshore or a licence to erect structures on it would be a matter for the Minister for the Marine under the Foreshore Acts and this is not affected in any way by the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 7 extends from two years to five years the period within which grants can be made to the Authority under section 14 of the Urban Renewal Act, 1986.  The existing period of two years from the establishment of the Authority is unrealistically short and needs to be extended having regard especially to the provision for an extension of the remit of the Authority.</P>
    <P>The Bill as a whole is a reflection of the responsive and supportive role of the Government in relation to the redevelopment of this important area.  The <Col N="2236" /> potential for redevelopment in this part of the city is immense.  I believe that the redevelopment of the site and future extensions of it will contribute substantially to renewed growth in the building industry and the general economy.</P>
    <P>There is great scope for imaginative and innovative design within the overall framework for the redevelopment of the Custom House Docks.  The area offers a unique opportunity to exploit the relationship between buildings and water and to create a visually dramatic and at the same time attractive place for people to live and work in, and to enjoy as a leisure and recreational amenity.  In other cities it has emerged that dockland development of this kind becomes a major attraction for visitors who come just to look and wander around, as well as serving as a major focus of commercial and social activity for the residents of the city.</P>
    <P>One of the most important elements of this development will be the establishment of the new International Financial Services Centre.  Arrangements for this development are well under way under the guidance of a special committee appointed by the Taoiseach and on which the Custom House Docks Development Authority is represented. Already, on the recommendation of the committee, special tax provisions to encourage the development of the International Financial Services Centre have been included in the Finance Act, 1987. These incentives are in addition to the incentives already available for other development on the site.  The latter include rates remission and taxation allowances in respect of the capital costs of commercial buildings, the rent payable by traders and &ldquo;section 23&rdquo; type allowances for rented residential accommodation. The Finance Act, 1987 also enables these allowances to be applied to any extension of the Custom House Docks Area.  Altogether, they add up to a very keen incentive package and should not only encourage primary development on the site but also allow rental costs to be held at very competitive levels compared with those obtaining in other centres. <Col N="2237" /> This will be particularly important in the case of the International Financial Services Centre.</P>
    <P>Financial services is one of the fastest growing sectors of economic activity in the world and our aim is to put Ireland into the main stream of that growth.  The south west corner of the site, adjoining the Custom House, has been earmarked for the centre in the planning scheme devised by the Authority.  All the indications are that this centre will be an outstanding success.  Major financial institutions from all over the world have expressed interest and a major marketing campaign is underway.  In addition to the centre and other commercial activities, it is envisaged that the site will contain retail, cultural, residential and amenity facilities.</P>
    <P>The important thing now is to ensure that every possible effort is made to achieve the objective of getting the right kind of development under way quickly, and that the momentum for progress is sustained. The Bill is an important step in this direction and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The city of Dublin, shortly to celebrate its millennium, has a long and proud history.  Its location has been shaped by invasion and occupation and the ancient form has been determined by builders and merchants.  We were fortunate that during the commercial development of the city in the 18th century James Gandon was encouraged to come here as a young architect, to design the new Custom House and the related dock area.  Gandon's dock was superseded by the present dock basin which is commonly known now as the 27 acre site.</P>
      <P>This area was the centre of commercial activity in Dublin for many years and I remember distinctly as a young boy walking down the docks which were always a hive of activity.  Unfortunately, social and economic forces dictate that the city is constantly changing and the great change in this area occured over the last 20 years, when new cargo handling technology made the inner dockland redundant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2238" /> I suppose we can say as citizens that we are very fortunate to have an inner city dock, the construction of which represents a substantial engineering achievement in its day.  It was also a political achievement for the previous Government when they established in November 1986 the Custom House Docks Development Authority under the Urban Renewal Act, 1986, the principal Act to which this amendant relates.  I am sorry to hear the Minister say that there was such a delay from the time the Urban Renewal Bill of 1982 was introduced. There is a complete distinction between that Bill and the present one.  The 1982 Bill so far far as I remember, had not the financial incentives the present Bill has.</P>
    <P>The Authority were charged with the exciting and challenging task of redeveloping the now largely redundant, but once thriving Custom House Docks area.  The purpose of the Urban Renewal (Amendment) Bill now before this House is to provide for the extension of the Custom House Docks area.  It is difficult to understand how after such a short term an extension of the area is necessary.  Of course, it was always the objective of the proposals for the Authority that they might extend their activities progressively and hopefully, as happened in other cities &mdash; especially in London &mdash; and that there might be a total regeneration of the entire obsolete docklands.  I want to come back to the point at a later stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister, speaking in another House, stated that the passing of the Urban Renewal (Amendment) Bill will demonstrate clearly the Government's intention and will enable the Authority to allay any fears that potential development consortia may have regarding the future of the lands surrounding the existing site.</P>
    <P>On the easterly side of the 27 acre site there is a large housing development known as Sheriff Street flats; I understand there are over 400 flats in this complex. They were built at a time when there was full employment.  Most of the inhabitants of these flats in the past <Col N="2239" /> worked on the docks.  Indeed, by all standards it was a very thriving area and the parish of that area, Seville Place, was one of the most sought after parishes in Dublin at that time.  Unfortunately, as I said earlier, the fabric of the area has changed completely due to new technology on the docks and many of the people living in the Sherriff Street flats complex have been scarred by unemployment. The quality of the flats leaves a lot to be desired in modern day living.</P>
    <P>This morning in <i>The Irish Times</i> I found an interesting article on the 27 acre site.  I quote from part of that article because it is quite relevant.  It refers to the docklands in Britain.</P>
    <P>The docklands were seen as the worst problem area in Britain, a backyard isolated from the mainstream of the city they used to serve.  Close to half the area became derelict.  Then, in 1981 came the London Docklands Development Corporation, established by the Tory Government to redevelop the area.  The Docklands Corporation moved fast.  In came £1,200 million of private investment in offices, warehousing and industry, and private housing.  In came a plan for a £1.7 billion financial services centre. House prices soared spectacularily as young and upwardly mobile beneficiaries of the new &ldquo;Big Bang&rdquo; financial markets queued up to buy the now ultra fashionable riverside housing, with some flats going for over £300,000 a piece.</P>
    <P>The casualties were the local community who had lived there for generations. Their appalling housing was pulled down in many places, to be replaced by developments for the new-inhabitants of the area.  For those who remained &mdash; and there are a few &mdash; there is nothing offered.  A whole community was moved on, the stragglers remained &mdash; together with some left wing activists calling themselves Class War &mdash; to harass and intimidate the well-off newcomers, and occasionally <Col N="2240" /> attack them, rob them or steal their cars.</P>
    <P>It would be very regrettable if this happened in the area which we now refer to as the Sheriff Street flats.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, the Sheriff Street complex is already the subject of a review by a special working party drawn from Dublin Corporation, the Department of the Environment and the authorities under the chairmanship of Mr. Paddy Morrissey the housing co-ordinator of Dublin Corporation.  If this working party in their report were to recommend that the Sheriff Street flats were to be detenanted and the residents to be rehoused in newly built houses on the eastern side of the 27 acre site in the kind of housing complex that would complement what has already been built by Dublin Corporation on the opposite quay, would the Minister be prepared to make the necessary funding available?  That is the logical solution to the problem.  The people in the area deserve new housing along the eastern side of the River Liffey. I asked the Minister this question because I understand that up to as late as last Thursday the Minister, since he became Minister for the Environment, has not sanctioned one inner city development for Dublin Corporation even though there are quite a number in his office awaiting approval.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to note that in the planning scheme drawn up by the Authority there is a section dealing with community liaison.  It states that in order to maximise the full potential for the development and to spread the benefits throughout the community, every effort should be made by developers to engage local skills and in particular to include workers from nearby communities.  This is very laudable on the part of the Authority. I trust it is not just a pious hope because time and time again I have seen it written into development contracts that the developer will engage local skills and include local workers but, unfortunately, when a construction starts there are <Col N="2241" /> rarely any local people employed.  If the development of the 27 acre site is to be successful it must have the harmony and good wishes of the local communities.  In a strange way they are at the bottom of the social ladder and they will see the development as one which will provide for those at the top of the social ladder if they do not participate in some real way in the wealth that will be created.  This would leave a greater scar on them than the unemployment and bad housing conditions which they suffer from at present.</P>
      <P>I note that in the recent Finance Act the Minister moved an amendment giving himself power to extend the Custom House Docks area by order allowing for the rates incentives to be applied to the extended area.  I want to reflect on the financial incentives there are available in the 27 acre dock site.  The incentives will apply to all construction and reconstruction works carried out within a five year period following the approval of the planning scheme by the Minister for the Environment and the making of the relevant order by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These incentives have an advantage over the incentives that are available in other designated areas in the city of Dublin.  This is a little unfair.  Under the Finance Act, 1986, a capital allowance for commercial development at 100 per cent will be provided by way of writeoff of capital expenditure.  Only half this amount applies to the other designated areas in the city.  When I spoke on the Private Members' Motion on the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission I said that if we are to succeed in revitalising the city of Dublin we must pay special attention not alone to the 27 acre site but to the other designated areas especially along the quays because developers will look on Dublin as a whole before they invest in the 27 acre site.  It is important that this should be borne in mind and a fresh look should be taken to see what can be done to give developers elsewhere the same opportunities as developers on the 27 acre site have.  If we fail to do this, the financial incentives for the other sites will not have the desired effect and could <Col N="2242" /> easily turn developers away from the 27 acre site.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed to note that the Minister intends to increase the number of ordinary members of the Authority from four to seven.  The present Authority have the necessary expertise to carry the project through.  If the planning scheme they prepared is anything to go by, I feel they should be very successful.  I am in favour of the extension of the site to the quayside, but I am not in favour of taking in half the river.</P>
    <P>We are very fortunate in having two large docks &mdash; St. George's dock and the inner dock &mdash; which are contained on the site and I hope that an area will be found between the docks and the river for the provision of a marina which can be a very attractive amenity in a city.  For a long time I have pressed for the establishment of a marina in the canal basin in Ring-send. There are many areas around the city which are right for this kind of development.  I welcome also the fact that we will have a cultural centre and museum in one of the stacks.  This is a very laudable idea.</P>
    <P>Senator Haughey will know that at our cultural meeting yesterday we discussed the lack of facilities at the National Museum and the Municipal Gallery of Modern Art to display all the paintings that are there.  It is very unfortunate that many good paintings are never put on display in this city because there is not sufficient room for them.  I hope a cultural centre or museum like this will provide that facility so that we can put on display the wonderful treasures we have.</P>
    <P>The development offers a unique opportunity to add to the social, economic and environmental qualities of Dublin and for that reason I look forward to the progress of the Custom House Docks Authority and I wish them well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief.  I want to extend a very warm welcome to the Bill and I believe it has already received that warm welcome universally. When the Urban Renewal (Amendment) Bill, 1986, was discussed in this House I spoke at great length on the philosophy <Col N="2243" /> of design in general.  At the time the Cathaoirleach thought I was speaking outside the terms of the Bill but as an architect I believed I was entitled to and would be expected to define the broad parameters of the philosophy under which I approached the Bill.  At that time I took into consideration all the matters Senator Doyle has mentioned.  There is no need to repeat what I said then because it is on the record of the House.</P>
      <P>I said then and I want to say now that it is a pity the Government at the time did not take over wholesale the 1982 Bill because it was a far superior Bill both in terms of flexibility with regard to areas and the urban development commissions. It was a pity that these were not incorporated in the Bill.  Members will recall that under the 1982 Bill the urban development commission were to consist of up to six members.  It is consistent on the part of the Government to increase the membership to seven.  I would opt for a greater number, perhaps eight.  The Minister in the last Government said they were an executive body rather than a representative one.  I accept what the Minister said and I believe this Bill is a big improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Bill was debated in the D·il a Deputy said that most of the problems in planning arise because planners draw lines on maps without a thought for the communities.  I think there is some truth in that.  On several occasions I asked for greater participation by the public.  A weakness inherent in this Bill may be that the public may not get an opportunity to make suggestions before plans are approved.  The Minister might consider greater liaison with the public.  In other countries when plans are being prepared the communities participate.  For example, in Sweden, as I mentioned in this House many times, when a housing scheme is being prepared the people who will live there, the people of the locality, the people who will matter when the scheme is completed, are taken in at the planning stage; their ideas are incorporated in the plan and in that way they become a central part of the plan.  It is <Col N="2244" /> unfortunate that in this country we do not do the same.  It is unfortunate also that we have reached a period of urban and rural decay in certain areas.  From a broad point of view since we had the major planning Act in 1963 many people would have thought that we would be prepared for the development since then. Many people looking at the position would ask the question: &ldquo;Would we be any better off if we had no legislation at all&rdquo;.  I do not think we could be much worse off.</P>
    <P>There are problems with regard to planning.  These should be looked at and now is an appropriate time to do that. The development plans, for example, which the local authorities prepare are more or less ideal plans or concepts by the local authority but the local authority have no power and no finances to incorporate those plans.  They are simply a yardstick against which proposals by individuals and groups in society are compared. There is an inherent weakness here.  There is a weakness too, for example, where local authorities are not obliged to seek planning permission. They should be so obliged.  I am aware of some instances of where housing schemes were started where the first indications residents in the locality had that the houses were to be built was when the contractor arrived to do the work.  That is a mistake.</P>
    <P>There are problems in the area of compensation, in the area of the preservation of trees and woods and so on but now is the time to deal with such problems.</P>
    <P>I welcome also section 7 which extends from two to five years the period within which grants can be made to the Authority under section 14 of the Bill.  This is important.  I welcome in particular the fact that the area has been increased.  I think it has been almost doubled.  I am pleased, too, that half the river is taken into the scheme.  In this connection I appeal on behalf of the Maritime Institute of Ireland that they be accommodated along the river.  Wexford, for example, has a floating local museum which is very successful and would tie in with the overall development of the docks <Col N="2245" /> area.  The Maritime Institute should get moorings along the river, which is now part of the docks area, for historic ships and boats doing research.  Up to now I believe they could go to Alexandra Basin and remain there for a few days. Research, historic and scientific vessels should be accessible in the port of Dublin. This would require a maritime heritage area, perhaps part of the old warehouses I discussed in my contribution before. The Mariners' Church in D˙n Laoghaire is an example.  It has been converted to a museum.  This is a very important aspect. The centre of Dublin should be available for environmental conferences.  The Maritime Institute were just a voluntary body.  They changed their constitution when they became a scientific and educational organisation with broader horizons getting a bigger audience.  They want to move into the schools, the technical colleges and the area of higher education, into the actual educational sphere.</P>
    <P>There is also the potential tourist attraction.  In addition this development in this, an island country, will highlight the marine aspect involved.  Next month there is a round-Europe rally, boats, or racing machines, as we might call them, could come into the Docks area at such times if it was properly developed.  There is great potential in this regard.</P>
    <P>I made a lengthy contribution on the last occasion and I do not think it would be appropriate to go over the same ground again.  I extend a warm welcome to the Bill and wish it success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I would like the Minister's observations on the matter of the adjoining area of the inner city and some general remarks in regard to inner city problems.  I am not trying to be destructive in any way but I hope the Minister or perhaps the Authority will be able to take these problems on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we know there is a growing crisis in the capacity of cities to meet the demands of the most disadvantaged groups.  The scale and concentration of the problem may vary from place to place but they all have one thing in common, they suffer <Col N="2246" /> from a general downward trend and the symptoms are always obvious.  Ironically, adjoining the new development in Sheriff Street there is all the evidence we will ever need.  The concern is whether the Bill will give Sheriff Street and its community a share in any of these spin off benefits.  Will it, for example, help to create a more balanced and self sustaining community?</P>
    <P>I submit that at the end of the day the contrast between rich and poor&mdash;and this is not particularly what the Bill is about but it is an observation which must be made &mdash; will remain as glaring as ever. The chances that people from Sheriff Street or from other deprived areas will move from being a group of poor and unemployed people to being a group who are highly paid, with good jobs is very remote indeed.  I make this point even though the fabric of the Sheriff Street area has improved.  However, I fear there is something built into society where the balance between the rich and poor will stay.  There is nothing new in this observation. Cities have always attracted the poor.  I was born and reared in the north inner city in the tenements where I spent most of my young life.  The poor have always moved into high density accommodation with all its stress and resulting conflict.  What is new is that the economic base of our cities has been eroded.  In the Bill I see some hope of making the problem less acute.  The Bill gives evidence that more needs to be done and the Minister referred to that in his Second Stage speech.  The Bill may stimulate some work in the building area.</P>
    <P>I wish to pursue the problem of economic erosion and jobs.  The Labour Party are concerned that jobs must be an integral part of any plan, and this is a plan. The Bill is welcomed by the Labour Party as a good down payment, but always with the reservation that nothing less than a comprehensive attack on the forces which shape the development of the inner city areas will produce a significant improvement in the lives of the most disadvantaged groups.  The problems of poor education, low incomes, and other <Col N="2247" /> forms of social malaise must be the top priorities every time we talk about the inner city or developments in the inner city.  The inner city must be a top priority not only in any Government approach but in every party manifesto.  All those problems taken together form an interrelated web from which it is almost impossible to escape.</P>
    <P>Lest somebody might feel I have no appreciation of the work being done by Dublin Corporation in the city at present, I would like to point out the value of the good work being done by Dublin Corporation both in the matter of housing and the provision of recreational facilities.  Normally those two things would be material that form part of the elements of that web I referred to.  I emphasise that Dublin Corporation, Cork Corporation, Waterford Corporation etc, cannot out of their own resources do any more than replace the physical fabric of their cities.  The problem of low incomes, bad education and different forms of social malaise are matters for Government and Opposition. They call for a cohesive approach particularly since we claim to cherish all the people equally.  We stand up on occasions and sound justifiably indignant at the poor and the underprivileged not being treated correctly.  We either talk about all the people being cherished equally or we talk about the basic right of equal rights.</P>
    <P>Part of the problem stems from a lack of education and jobs with resulting low incomes and low health standards.  The problems remain for us all to deal with and not for just one particular group. Whenever the question of the inner city comes up or when developments relating to the inner city are on the Order Paper, it is our duty to talk about the conditions obtaining in the inner city.  We talk about the problems of the inner city or working in a cohesive way to deal with them but providing information barely scrapes the surface as the problems go a lot deeper than that.  I do not remember &mdash; and I am not young &mdash; when the situation in the inner city was not as it is today.  Perhaps there was difference in degree and <Col N="2248" /> one of the reasons for that was that the population was much smaller.  I have no other experience of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The usual argument is that we must attract investors and secure the development as a priority and that the results will benefit the community.  I hope this is true and if it is true it poses the question: why is it a fact of life that the poor must wait while the rich get richer?  We are told that if we allow development to go ahead &mdash; a road widening project or an industry to come in even if there is an argument over pollution &mdash; the poor and the working class people will benefit.  The fact is that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.</P>
    <P>The basic problem facing our cities and the people living in them is that they expand faster than the resources and the capacity to make use of available resources is falling.  The number and the range of jobs open to those with limited skills have declined.  At one time we could say that those who moved out to the suburbs were leaving the disadvantaged behind but the effects of the recession, and technology etc. have widened the problem beyond the inner city.  The more disadvantaged are left in the inner city areas.  I will not go over the move to suburbia.</P>
    <P>Where there is an equal access to resources there is reason to suppose that the marketplace values would correspond with social values.  We cannot assume that the profits made from developments or by any one man will spin over or be any great help to any community.  That is not to say that Dublin Corporation are not keeping an eye on the position of attracting employment into the inner city area as a result of this development.  I talk about employment for people with fewer skills and not just high technology. It is likely that the development will be similar to the Wood Quay situation as it developed.  I was not too happy about the Wood Quay development.  I did not lie on the ground or anything like that but as a Dubliner I did not want to see Christ Church being obliterated.  On the occasion of the protests at Wood Quay most of the protesters were from outside <Col N="2249" /> the area.  That was all right because they were entitled to protest and they were very welcome, but the funny aspect was that when that development was completed nobody from the Liberties got a job working in the corporation building and certainly not in the office part of it. The same situation will arise here.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go too hard on the developer.  He is being encouraged and coaxed to come into the area.  He is welcome, if he makes the problems of unemployment less acute.  We cannot blame the developer for the development. Areas run down and they need to be built up again and the developers need to enter into the calculation of rebuilding the city but one wonders whether the local authorities could not do what the developers have done.  Is it because the local authorities lack the driving force?  Is it because there are so many stages in development and so many people with conflicting interests to be reconciled and so many road blocks to be circumvented?  Is this why the local authority cannot do it?  Is it because the developer has the power to command resources that help to create change?  What is the problem?</P>
    <P>I do not want to blame the developer. I want to know about the obstacle race that we set up for ourselves with all its subtleties, centres and controls.  Do we not create the sort of society that we want?  If so, are the community in a position to take over our cities and enable them through the local authorities to flourish and to change?</P>
    <P>The answers to many of those questions cannot be found under the system at the moment.  I am happy about the Bill but I have the reservations I have expressed.  The problems of the inner city may lie in the fact that we have been concentrating a great deal on the symptoms rather than on the underlying economic and other factors that shape the development of the inner city.  Has the condition of the inner city been exacerbated by the way in which Government have intervened?  Have we hurt the inner city areas by some of our deliberations and deeds?  Was it possible for us to <Col N="2250" /> untangle the influences that were militating against the inner city?  We have been up to something for years, and I am not talking about just one Government. Government, Opposition and politicians of all shapes and makes are guilty in regard to the state of inner city.</P>
    <P>The development itself has to be welcomed. As I have said, it is a very good down payment.  It may encourage the building industry, and I agree with the Minister in that it may spark off something there, coupled with other events. The dock area must be dealt with.  I am concerned as to whether the spin off there will go to the very underprivileged areas such as the Sheriff Street complex.</P>
    <P>Another matter of concern is the increasing numbers on the Authority.  I am not worried about the increase in the numbers but I see in the process an erosion of the powers of the Port and Docks Board.  It seems that some of their functions will automatically pass over to the Authority.  This is of concern to the trade union movement.  After all, this development will affect a substantial part of the docks area which will have possibly 2,000 or 3,000 working class people living there.  Therefore, the trade union representation now on the Port and Docks Board will have lost a certain degree of influence.  I ask the Minister to consider taking a nomination from the ICTU in this respect and to place a least one member on the new Authority.</P>

I welcome the Bill which I see as further progress in bringing about urban redevelopment and inner city renewal. This process, of course, was initiated by the Fianna F·il Government of 1982 when they brought forward the Urban Development Area Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill currently under discussion demonstrates very clearly that the Government are firmly committed to bringing about urban renewal, north inner city renewal and national recovery <Col N="2251" /> in general.  Dublin City must now be called an unemployment black spot.  In particular north Dublin has been hit badly by the international recession and the decline in manufacturing industry. Many housing estates in the Dublin area at the moment have an unemployment rate of between 70 per cent and 80 per cent.  Indeed, the inner city too has been affected and is now caught in a spiral of economic decline.  Many forces beyond our control have brought this about. However, the Government's commitment to develop the Custom House Docks site indicates their determination to tackle this employment crisis in the inner city head on, and I welcome that. The development of this site will boost employment and reverse the downward spiral of economic decline.</P>
    <P>The inner city of Dublin, like many other inner city areas throughout the world, has many problems.  Manufacturing industry for various economic reasons now tends to locate in suburban areas and has moved out from the centre city locations.  In addition there is the serious problem of population decline. Whole communities have been relocated in western suburbs.  Indeed, the local authority officially encouraged this for many years.  Dereliction and urban decay now prevail in inner city areas and crime and vandalism are at high levels.  In addition, the arrival of containerisation has led to a decline in docks area.  The development of the Custom House Docks site can be seen as a bold attempt to make use of new technology and new economic conditions to bring about economic revival and inner city renewal in the docks area.</P>
    <P>High technological developments such as the one being proposed for Dublin have been extremely successful in other countries and I have no doubt that the Dublin development will also be a tremendous success.  The primary purpose of this amending Bill is to include the quay side in the area for redevelopment. This is of vital importance if the project is to be a success.  I suggest that the initial legislation was flawed in this <Col N="2252" /> regard in that the major attraction of the area was excluded from the site for development, namely, the River Liffey itself.  The River Liffey has always played an extremely important role in the economic and cultural life of Dublin city.  It would be a serious error if the Custom House Docks Authority were to ignore the potential of the river, and I understand that a number of potential developers have pointed this out to the Authority.  There is a heritage and a culture in rivers which cannot be ignored. Similar dockland developments in other countries have relied heavily on the fact that they were on a river edge to ensure their success.  Such projects have led to the development of a new waterside architecture.  I hope that will be so with the Dublin development also.  Baltimore in the US is a good example of this. The river is an invaluable asset and its communication, recreation and amenity potential must be utilised to the fullest.</P>
    <P>The Bill, however, does not only ensure that the Custom House Quay is included in the area for development.  It also allows the Government to extend the area to the south and east of the existing site.  This is an important step in that, as the Minister has suggested, it demonstrates to any potential developer that the Government are committed to redeveloping the entire docks area and not simply a part of it.  I am sure such a commitment will be welcomed by potential investors.  They know now that they are investing in an area which is targeted for long term economic development.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also allow the Minister to increase the size of the Custom House Docks Development Board.  The Government's recent decision to locate the financial services centre at the Custom House is a great boost for the board.  The establishment of a financial services centre north of the Liffey is a great boost for the north side in general. In recent years much of the new office development has tended to locate in Dublin 4 and Dublin 6 and this has strengthened the north side-south side divide.  However, this decision to locate <Col N="2253" /> on the north side of the Liffey will encourage other office development and this may lead to the economic development of much of the decayed urban areas of the north inner city.  Mountjoy Square is a good example of this.  Without meaning to be disrespectful in any way to the members of the board, it must be accepted that the provisions to extend the board membership are to be welcomed. The decision by the Government to locate the financial services centre at the Custom House Docks site is a good reason for this.</P>
    <P>The Minister might also consider allowing local residents of the area to have a representative on the board to ensure that the local community are not alienated from the project.  Indeed, this was mentioned by a number of Senators in this debate.  The time is now right to extend the membership of the Custom House Docks Authority and I welcome the provision in the Bill which will allow this.</P>
    <P>As I have said already, there is a need to involve the local community in this development if it is to be the success we all want it to be.  It is people who make a city.  It is now generally accepted that people should be encouraged to live in the inner city to ensure that it is a living city.  Dublin Corporation in particular have recognised this after many years and are now providing high standard public housing in the inner city areas.  However, the encouragement of private housing has not been so successful.  I ask the board to consider ways of attracting private housing construction to this site.  That is very important and I ask the Minister to comment on it.</P>
    <P>The achievement of a social mix in housing is vitally important.  In addition I appeal to the board to involve the existing local community in the development and in particular to encourage local employment. This has been mentioned also. It is essential that local employment be encouraged if the project is to be the total success we want it to be.  If this is achieved I am confident that this development will be a tremendous success.  This plan is indeed an ambitious one.  It will bring <Col N="2254" /> back life to a section of the Liffey which up to now has been ignored.</P>
    <P>The River Liffey plays an important part in the heritage and in the whole fabric of our city centre.  Indeed it is fashionable to quote James Joyce when talking about this project.  When writing about Anna Livia he notes that by the time the river meets Dublin Bay it has completely fallen from grace.  It is polluted and ignored.  He personifies the river and has her crying out the following: &ldquo;I am passing out.  O bitter ending!  I'll slip away before they're up.  They'll never see.  Nor know.  Nor miss me.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I wonder.  This development, however, will ensure that life is brought back to this section of the Liffey.  The museums, shops, craftworks, cafes, hotels and offices will ensure that new life is brought to the docks.  It will contribute substantially to renewed growth and recovery.  It will become a place of leisure and a recreational amenity and above all an enjoyable place to work.  Joyce's commentary will no longer be true.</P>

      <P>The special scheme of urban renewal which was introduced by the previous Government under the Urban Renewal Act, 1986, and the Finance Act, 1986, has been in place formally for just one year.  Already it is achieving considerable success in the designated inner city areas of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway.  An impressive array of development projects is either already under construction or at an advanced stage of planning.  The authorities involved report a continuing high level of interest in the development opportunities in these designated areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 27 of the Finance Bill, 1987, makes provision for the designation of areas for urban renewal purposes by order made by the Minister for Finance after consultation with the Minister for the Environment.  Consideration may be given to other provincial centres to which <Col N="2255" /> the scheme might most appropriately be applied.  So far no decision has yet been made in regard to urban areas such as Kilkenny, Dundalk, Wexford, Wicklow and so on.  In his D·il contribution to the debate on the Urban Renewal (Amendment) Bill, 1987, Deputy John Boland, former Minister for the Environment, stated as reported at column 1301 of the Official Report of the D·il for 10 June 1987.</P>
    <P>I am also disappointed that in this Bill the Minister deals only with one aspect of the 1986 Act, that is, the Custom House Dock Development Authority.  I would have thought that he would have taken this opportunity to outline to the House the progress which had been made in encouraging development into each of the designated areas which were set out under the Principal Act &mdash; the County Boroughs of Dublin, Waterford, Cork, Limerick and Galway.</P>
    <P>It is in that context and realising the need for overall national urban renewal as envisaged in the Urban Renewal Act, 1986, that I, as Mayor of Limerick, stated on 5 May 1986:</P>
    <P>The urban renewal momentum has been greatly encouraged by the package of tax incentives for inner city redevelopment and reconstruction announced by the Government on 23rd October, 1985 and applied to Limerick and other cities by John Boland, T.D., the Minister for the Environment, when on 25th March, 1986 he designated a comprehensive and coherent zone of 39 acres which will now qualify for the special programme of tax incentives.</P>
    <P>This package of financial incentives to promote urban renewal and development of substantial areas of our city is an exciting and challenging development.</P>
    <P>In so far as my own city of Limerick is concerned, the Granary, which is situated at the heart of the area, acts as a marvellous flagship and anchor for its total redevelopment.  I would like to <Col N="2256" /> acknowledge that the Minister of State, Deputy Ger Connolly, paid us a courtesy call in Limerick recently and spent the whole day with us.  He was marvellously impressed by the work of redevelopment that is going on in Limerick.  The designated area includes such important city areas in Limerick as Charlotte Quay, Johnsgate, and the marvellous river front area from King John's Castle to Sarsfield House.  I am sure we will have the privilege in Limerick, and indeed in the other urban areas throughout the country, of Deputy Flynn, the Minister for the Environment, paying us similar visits, as he has time to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic objectives of the three year programme set out in the primary legislation are to stimulate investment in new building, reconstruction and development; to provide a major stimulus for the construction industry and to revitalise the inner city areas where so much dereliction and decay has been extensive and pervasive for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In short, the purpose of the 1986 Act, the primary legislation which we should be discussing today, was to bring new life to the run down areas of the core of our cities so that these areas would again become attractive areas for living, working, shopping and leisure amenities.  I would like to assure the Minister and this House that Limerick city, which has been to the forefront in these matters, has responded quickly and whole-heartedly to the Government initiatives on inner <Col N="2257" /> city redevelopment.  Limerick Corporation with the assistance of that marvellous organisation, of which you, a Chathaoirligh, no doubt know a lot, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, have prepared action plans for the development of the area.  We have also prepared a marketing plan for the city.</P>

      <P>I want to make my case on Second Stage and to point out that we in Limerick Corporation see ourselves as a development broker bringing together landowners, developers and potential investors, doing everything we can do to facilitate development and redevelopment proposals.  I would like to point out to the Minister &mdash; I am making proposals now for the improvement of the original Bill &mdash; that Limerick Corporation, possibly uniquely in the country, are fortunate in that through a long process of land purchase, 20 of the 39 <Col N="2258" /> acres of the designated area are in the ownership of Limerick Corporation.  We sought to promote a blend of development uses &mdash; retail, commercial, industrial, leisure, housing and amenity.  The changes made in the Finance Bill are making it impossible for us to carry out the original blend.  After an aggressive marketing programme and with the assistance of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, we have secured private investment interests for the following proposals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put it on the record of the House, and I will be as brief as I can, that at the moment we have a £10 million multi-use complex at Patrick Street, Arthur's Quay, comprising retail amenity, office and multistorey car parking uses ready to go.  I appeal to the Minister to give us the green light so that we can go ahead on this project. Negotiations are continuing with many developers.  We have a £5 million civic centre at Merchant's Quay to accommodate the administrative offices, council chamber, court facilities and a museum.  I am appealing to the Minister to give us the green light for this magnificant civic office complex.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I conclude by suggesting that there are many developers who entered bona fide into contracts, quasi-contracts, regarding developments under the 1986 Act.  These developers are now reluctant to commit themselves to expenditure on projects of the magnitude I have outlined because they fear there will be an overrun on the <Col N="2259" /> deadline of 31 May 1987, and that they will be thus disqualified for eligibility for tax incentives.  I suggest &mdash; and I do so in the context of the overall urban renewal programme &mdash; that the Minister should extend the expiry date for at least one year so that there can be a proper assembly of sites and that there can be subsequent planning, design and financing of projects because this takes a considerable amount of time.  I am pleading that greater flexibility should be afforded to the construction phase of such projects. I suggest, therefore, that another Bill, to include all the urban areas of this city, should be brought forward immediately by the Minister.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and I hope it will draw attention to the beauty not alone of the Liffey but to many other rivers in Ireland as well.  I ask the Minister to insist that the planners take into consideration the wonderful opportunities there are at this stage for making the area suitable for wildlife.  This, in turn, would add considerably to our own enjoyment of the area.  Children would find it very suitable <Col N="2260" /> for projects.  I know teachers are becoming far more conscious of the need for children to study the environment and they have the ideal opportunity at this stage, before the plans actually go into operation, to lay out the area in such a way that animals which already live in the city are actually encouraged to use this particular area in such a way that they can be approached and that teachers can bring the children from the inner city to work out their own particular projects. Rather than having to go to areas way outside the city, they would have wonderful opportunities in this part of the inner city.  If during the summer anyone cares to go to the area where the car ferry comes in he will see a variety of terns nesting there &mdash; birds that winter in Africa and come to summer in Ireland. Many people think they are seagulls but they are actually terns which have travelled thousands of miles to nest in Ireland.  The opportunities are there for the planners to make a wonderful wildlife area in the inner city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I again thank the Minister for bringing the Bill before us and I hope some attention will be paid to it.  We never seem to learn from the mistakes of other countries. We go on making the mistakes they made but now we have an opportunity to plan this right from the word go and make it ideally suitable, not just for the animals but for ourselves, because it is our environment too.  We are all part of the same environment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this development in Dublin. It is critical that the city be looked at, and be looked at very carefully.  I was going to speak on the natural environment, but I have no intention of trying to follow the excellent contribution of Senator de BuitlÈar.  Teachers working, <Col N="2261" /> living and teaching in the area have told me they feel the environment should be made to fit the people, rather than people made to fit the environment.  I believe there must be a balance between people and the environment.  There are people living in the area, people working in the area, people living and working in the area but the fact is that there are no visitors to the area.</P>

Would the Minister consider providing an aquarium in the area which could be developed and which could draw tourists and visitors to learn about the environment?</P>
      <P>I approve of and support the idea of extending the area to be covered by this Bill with one reservation, infringing on the area which until now was governed by the Port and Docks Authority whose influence has been diminished and is now minimal.  Whatever happens in the area the objective of the planner should be to let the city live and breathe again.  The Minister's intention to increase ordinary membership of the board to seven is welcome.

      <P>Thank you for your protection.  The members of the board consist of a hotelier, an engineer, an <Col N="2262" /> accountant and an estate agent but I would ask the Minister to put a few other people on the board also, preferably those who live and work in the area.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated very clearly that he wants to make the area a place fit to work and live in but all the speakers so far have spoken about the amenities.  Do not tell me people who live outside the area have the best understanding of the needs of those living or working there. The Minister will accept that if we set up something in Castlebar we would not need people travelling from Ballina to tell them what to do and <i>vice versa.</i>  The Minister should keep that in mind. Workers and local residents should be represented.  There has been only passing reference to the kind of people and community we are talking about.  Who are they; what way do they live and work? First, 70 per cent are unemployed in that area and that is the most important thing to remember.</P>
      <P>Senator Haughey referred to the need for employment and he is absolutely right.  Of all the areas within the city this one most needs a boost and injection.  In the Sheriff Street area, to which Senator Doyle referred, there are 200 flats but the population is just over 2,000.  That is greater than the population of many small &mdash; indeed some fairly big &mdash; towns.  It is a sizeable area and a great number of people need support and help as many are cramped in the worst kind of housing.</P>
      <P>The reason I mention this &mdash; it refers to the Bill &mdash; is that there have been various recommendations over the years about this area.  Planners have looked at what is happening in Sheriff Street and there has been a common bond between all the plans and recommendations about the Sheriff Street flats &mdash; to demolish them.  One of the first conditions of the development of that area is that those flats should be demolished and replaced by proper inner city housing of the type the corporation are providing, to excellent effect, around the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made a passing reference to a study group of members of his Department, the corporation and of the Authority.  The House has always been <Col N="2263" /> very quick to defend the county and city councillors and I would like to be first to defend them this time.  I resent the fact that those people who were elected to represent me have not been asked for their views on the matter.  This group will be making recommendations to the Minister on this area, which is germane to what we are discussing, but there is no representative of the city council although there are officials from the corporation, the Department of the Environment and nominated people from the Authority.  That is not good enough.  I appeal to the Minister &mdash; and this is something he can do by order &mdash; to also include elected people on the group.  The city councillors deserve to be represented on that body.  The word on the street is that a member of the Government, who shall be nameless, representing the same area, did not know anything about this study group until he heard about it in the Minister's speech in the D·il but I am sure that is not true.  I appeal to the Minister to remember the elected personnel.</P>
    <P>The financial centre which I presume will be a showpiece certainly should not have a ghetto on the far side of the boundary wall.  The estimate is that up to £300 million would flow through this financial centre over the period of five years.  The kind of development I am talking about in terms of putting people in a better environment would cost a very tiny fraction, less than 5 per cent, of that money. The flats should be replaced with innercity housing in a modern development. These people are underprivileged and disadvantaged and many of them have been driven to fight to survive in ways not acceptable to the majority.</P>
    <P>Senator de BuitlÈar mentioned schools.  Teachers in the area asked me to tell the Minister they are concerned about the environment and about where the pupils they teach come from.  They want the area developed to include housing. I know the costs and difficulties involved but I ask the Minister to create an environment which will attract visitors and to have work places which will provide employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2264" /> In terms of representations on the board, traditionally part of this area came under the jurisdiction of the Port and Docks Board and traditionally the Port and Docks Board had representatives from the trade union movement.  The Dublin Council of Trade Unions have always nominated a couple of people to the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  I mention this because good public and industrial relations demand that workers should be involved and should be part of decision making which concerns them. There are good practical reasons for this apart from the philosophical ones which I will not mention.  The practical reasons are that if you involve people in decision making, they are more likely to accept it and to sell it to their fellow workers.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to continue the long tradition of involvement of workers in the Port and Docks Board in the new Authority.  The prospect of an Authority whose membership is comprised of people from outside the area is not really an attractive one, nor do I believe in all honesty that the Minister would find it attractive.  I do not think it is a workable or good idea to have an authority imposed on an area.  Of course one has to import outside expertise &mdash; one does not want to be too incestuous about this kind of activity &mdash; but it is important to get a proper blend.  In the words of the Bill if we are endeavouring to create work areas or amenity areas local input is needed.  There is no gainsaying that fact &mdash; we need people living and working in the area.</P>
    <P>I want to air a certain worry I have about the proposed financial services centre.  It is inter-related to many other things.  In this area of the inner city there is a huge drugs abuse problem.  Much of that is tied in with an international trade and international finance.  One of the recommendations last year of the European Parliament Special Committee on Drugs Abuse was that there should be access to information from financial institutions. Many countries have legislation which allows the crime investigators access to information from the financial world or centres.  Unfortunately we do <Col N="2265" /> not have legislation which would facilitate that kind of activity.</P>
    <P>The horror I foresee is that that proposed financial services centre could turn out to be a sort of world money-laundering area of dirty money.  I am not saying it would happen but it could happen.  If we are to develop this area then we should place conditions on the type of development to be allowed.  For instance, it should be conditional that information would be retained, that information would be available for the tracing of money from accounts, from banks, from country to country and so on if it is to be channelled through here. Surely the last thing the Minister, the Government or anybody else would want is a financial services centre which would in any sense facilitate international racketeering. That could happen because some of the provisions of other legislation are not sufficiently strong in this respect. I would ask the Minister to take that reservation on board.</P>
    <P>I do not say this by way of criticism of the Bill.  That aspect is not covered by the Bill as drafted.  Rather I raise it as a sincerely held anxiety of mine and of many other people.  Certainly we do not want to build or lay the foundations of anything which would tarnish our image in the eyes of the world.  As the Minister said, we want something positive and progressive. Certainly the Bill is worthy of support.  I hope its provisions will not be abused, that the human environment and flora/fauna environment would be able to be part of the proposed plan and that there will be an input on the part of the local people, the workforce.  With that many-faceted approach it can be a success. I wish the Minister well with regard to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of contributing to this debate.  I wholeheartedly welcome the Bill, which is necessary and timely.  It is a tangible demonstration of the Government's tremendous commitment to our securing real economic development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill constitutes just one of the ways in which the Government have <Col N="2266" /> demonstrated their willingness to respond in a flexible, imaginative and, above all, practical manner to the needs of this whole redevelopment project. Within a short space of time the necessary groundwork has been laid for what will be the flagship of the Custom House Docks area, namely, an international financial services centre.  Considerable efforts have been made by the Taoiseach and his Ministers to promote the Custom House Docks project at international level.  The Minister for the Environment, too, has shown great enthusiasm and commitment and has managed, within a short period, to have real progress on the site.  I understand demolition works have already commenced.  The Minister mentioned he is currently considering the draft planning scheme submitted by the Authority.</P>
    <P>I believe this redevelopment effort was first proposed by the Fianna F·il Government in 1982, encompassed in the provisions of the Urban Development Area Bill, which lapsed with the dissolution of D·il …ireann on 4 November 1982.  It is a pity that three-and-a-half valuable years elapsed before the Coalition Government recognised the importance of those proposals, before reviewing them and presenting them to D·il …ireann in the form of the Urban Renewal Bill, 1986.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment, in introducing this Bill so swiftly has clearly demonstrated that no more valuable time will be lost.  I believe he has the will, initiative and determination to ensure that the Custom House Docks project will be brought to a satisfactory conclusion to the benefit of our economy.  It it my belief it will go a long way toward revitalising this area or our capital city.</P>
    <P>The Bill is primarily an enabling measure aimed at developing, on a gradual and phased basis, the lands to the east of the existing site.  This areas is ripe for redevelopment.  I have no doubt it will prove attractive to developers when they see what can be done and the potential of the present site.</P>
    <P>The problems of the inner city are social and economic.  It is my belief that the approach adopted by the Government, namely, promoting worthwhile <Col N="2267" /> and productive investment and development is the only way in which the necessary resources ultimately can be provided to tackle the social problems especially the creation of lasting employment.  I have no doubt that the Custom House Docks project will make a major contribution in terms of job creation and social rehabilitation in the inner city.  The restoration of confidence in the economy and the promotion of economic growth are, and should be, the overriding objectives of the Government.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill will enable the Minister to extend the existing area immediately to include the Liffey quays and part of the River Liffey.  Obviously this is desirable.  I doubt if anyone would quibble with the aim of maximising the impact and the value of the River Liffey to this development project.  I note from reading the Official D·il report of the debates that the Minister was the subject of some adverse criticism <i>vis-a-vis</i> his proposal to increase the membership of the authority.  I believe he has answered such criticism in the best possible way, that is, pointing out the logic, facts and practicalities of the situation obtaining. It was asking a bit much to expect five individuals &mdash; four of whom are part-time and who have other interests and responsibilities beyond the area of responsibility of the Authority &mdash; to have the full range of skills reuired and devote adequate time to ensuring the success of the project.  An increase of three in the number of ordinary members of the Authority, as proposed in the Bill, will still render it a relatively small and tightly-knit body by normal standards.  The Minister has struck the right balance, achieving or ensuring the necessary range of skills while maintaining the benefits to be derived from having a small expert team.</P>
    <P>The urban renewal programme is a major initiative and I welcome the fact that the Minister for Finance has made provisions in the 1987 Finance Bill to extend the package to carefully selected areas throughout the country.  If I may <Col N="2268" /> be a little parochial, very briefly I would like to mention my home town of Drogheda which is a medieval town, has many important historical and national monuments and has excellent tourist potential.  However, in recent years the town has been partially by-passed through the construction of a national primary route which has changed the character of the town in so far as a number of the old streets have disappeared and large derelict areas of the old town are now visible.  It is imperative that these areas be redeveloped if Drogheda is to play a major part in what we are told is the fastest growing industry in Europe namely tourism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking on this Urban Renewal Bill, a little doubt arises in my mind as to why I would have to question the purpose of bringing in the Bill at this stage, just a few months after this Government have come to office and a few months after the Minister has taken up office.  Maybe it has a little to do with section 3 of the Bill which increases from four to seven the number of members; maybe it has to do with a lot of other matters in the Bill as well.  This matter of membership concerned Senator O'Toole very much.  I could hardly let him away with saying that he wants other people on the board.  I happen to be in the same profession as one of the people he mentioned who is already nominated.  I always considered myself as a person outside my profession.  He wants a few councillors recognised and maybe it is time to <Col N="2269" /> recognise some of the local councillors. Perhaps the Minister could look into Senator O'Toole's suggestion in that case.</P>
      <P>The previous Government and the previous Minister, Deputy Boland, introduced a Bill similar to this one and put it through this House.  That was an imaginative Bill designating specific areas of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and later Waterford and Galway after representations from the local people there including people like myself, business people, people involved in the business sector and local authorities.  In our case a 14 acre site was finally included in the designated areas.  The creation of the designated areas will have, and in our own case is having, far reaching effects in bringing back to life areas in our cities which had lain dead for years.  This is as a result of the incentives in the original Bill introduced in 1986.</P>
      <P>We must also compliment the local authorities for their dedication in getting schemes off the ground in the designated areas.  They have taken the initiatives that were required to encourage schemes and have appointed officials to deal with schemes in the various areas.  Some of those schemes are only starting and others are still at planning stage.  The production of a Bill at this stage giving the power greatly to enlarge designated areas has caused some small confusion to potential developers of the present designated areas as to the effect it would have on their plans for the development of the present areas.  That is causing some concern and maybe the Minister in his reply might refer to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might have been better to have waited a little while, to allow the present scheme to continue so that the real advantages could be seen.  The scheme when set up by the previous Government was a pilot scheme to prove by practical application that the generous incentives offered could have the effect of transforming large and badly neglected areas in our cities at no cost to the State.  It was also set up by the previous Government to help the building industry create jobs which it did do and is doing, to help that <Col N="2270" /> industry which apparently has been sadly neglected by the present Government.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the present scheme is a success.  I see the evidence of this in my own home town.  I believe that when the time limit runs out on the present designated areas the scheme should then be extended to cater for other areas in our cities that have been neglected.  Indeed, it should apply to other larger towns where urban renewal is greatly required.  I recommend this to the Minister and I understand that the passing of this Bill will allow the Minister to extend the present designated area and to create new separate areas.  I recommend that the scheme be extended to other neglected areas of our cities and large towns.</P>
    <P>Section 7 allows the extension from two years to five years of the period within which grants can be made to the authority under section 14 of the Urban Renewal Act.  I presume that this applies only to the Custom House Docks site. Senator Kennedy, in his wide ranging contribution, asked if there would be an extension of the present designated areas, even if it was only a year, or may we take it that that section would cover the other designated areas as well?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I can guarantee that I will stay firmly within the Pale, within Dublin, this evening.  There is a certain sense of nostalgia about this Bill, indeed about the whole day here because virtually all the legislation today was prepared and put into effect during the lifetime of the last Government, so we are now seeing coming before us ideas and projects prepared during that time. The Custom House Docks Authority were established by the last Government. That was an imaginative and pragmatic decision clearly thought out, with a definite mandate and with a real sense of urgency surrounding its implementation. In design, in concept and in execution, it owes a great deal to the Minister of State, Fergus O'Brien, and to the then Minister, John Boland.  To listen to the publicity from some of the speakers on the far side here this evening one would be forgiven <Col N="2271" /> for thinking that the whole idea was conceived and reached fruition only after Fianna F·il came to power.  What we have been hearing is yet another bit of that rewriting of history which tends to take place from time to time.</P>
      <P>I want to put firmly on the record the origins of the Customs House Docks Authority and also to bring into focus what was intended by the progenitors of this scheme.  The inner city was to be revitalised in an urgent, imaginative and integrated manner.  The authority to guide and direct its revitalisation were to be a small, expert and independent body, small enough to allow the quick taking in of ideas but with sufficient expertise to ensure that the right decisions were taken.</P>
      <P>This brings me to the present legislation and to its purpose.  I honestly believe it is unnecessary legislation, the real purpose of which is cloaked in a Bill which is far longer than it need be.  Like many others, I am baffled as to why this legislation should be needed so urgently. There are no strong reasons as to why the area now needs to be extended.  The original development was advertised on the basis of the 27 acres and plans to date are based on that area.  I have no objection to these extra areas being included and if the inclusion means that the new areas can benefit from urban renewal, then all to the good.  However it might have been far more sensible to develop ahead on the basis of the already designated area, to establish the success and the viability of that development, establish a certain character and ambiance in the new development and to then take stock of what had happened.  If, then, it was felt that there was the potential for further development the new areas laid out in this Bill could be taken in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That point about the extension of the area is debatable and I certainly will not be dogmatic about it.  There may well be very valid planning reasons, although I have not heard them, for the need for the enlarged area.  I would like to know, however, if the call for this change came <Col N="2272" /> from the Custom House Docks Authority themselves, which I doubt very much, or from the Minister, or from even higher up.  If so, was this an attempt to reshape a piece of Coalition legislation, to put a Fianna F·il imprint on it?  Is this Bill brought in to ensure that even the area of this idea, in fact, is a Fianna F·il area rather than the one fixed upon, voted upon in this House during the lifetime of the last Government?  More to the point, however, and perhaps the real reason behind this unnecessary legislation is the extension by three of the number of members on the Authority as proposed in section 3.</P>
    <P>The last Minister established a highly competent, energetic, determined and non-political Authority.  I ask the question &mdash; and I am not prejudging the answer &mdash; are we now in danger of seeing the Authority politicised?  Will we see three Minister's men or more likely three Taoiseach's men or women added to the Authority so that a centre of gravity loses its objectivity and independence and is weighted in the political direction of the Minister or the Taoiseach?  This is a serious point and the Minister can prove me wrong by appointing three expert and independent members.  I am not all that concerned if the people appointed have political affiliations because I have always fought against the view that involvement in open democratic politics of any party should render one unfit or unfitted for service on a State board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always felt that all parties should try to bring in the very best people in our community.  There is no reason why these people should then be debarred from serving on State agencies. I said before that it is one of the hallmarks of lazy journalism to assume that, because somebody who has a political involvement is appointed to a State board, that person is thereby in some way tainted or unfit.  Some of the best members of State boards are people who make no secret of their political affiliations. It would be a very sad day if <Col N="2273" /> membership of any political party should be seen as debarring a person from serving on a State board.</P>
      <P>I am asking that the people who are appointed by the Minister when this Bill goes through will have a strong sense of independence so far as their performance is concerned.  Only time will tell.  I hope that the three new members will have a strong sense of independence and will have a positive and distinctive contribution to make.  Ultimately that is the only criterion by which the extension of the number of members of the board will be judged.  While I may have doubts about the Minister's bona fides in this regard, I will reserve judgment and I hope he proves me wrong in all of this. In passing on this point, the point raised by Senator O'Toole is perhaps a valid one.  I would have preferred to have seen a smaller and more compact Authority. I would have more faith in the existing idea of the Authority.  If we are going to extend the number perhaps there is room for representation of the type mentioned by Senator O'Toole.</P>
      <P>I would like to turn my attention to one further aspect of this legislation. Increasingly since the advent of the Government this development has been spoken of as the hub of a great new international financial services sector capable of earning billions of pounds for this country in a short space of time.  I hope this is so and that it works.  However I would like to see spelt out, not necessarily by the Minister this evening but by those behind this idea, in greater detail what is involved.  I would like to see the very many difficulties, some of which are being pointed out in financial journalism at present, examined in great detail.  I know Mr. Dermot Desmond, the man who is publicly credited with the idea for this centre.  I respect his past performance. He has an intuition and insight into the workings of the financial market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a little bit worried about the emphasis which is being placed on the financial services sector as being the key element of this development.  I would like to see some of the difficulties involved in setting up such a financial services sector <Col N="2274" /> spelt out.  We have been told a great deal about the potential of this sector.  The Government are right to grasp at this idea and give it their backing.  It would be a disaster for this development if, because of something which was not properly thought through or the possible objections and pitfalls which had not been guarded against, the new Custom House Docks area became a white elephant.  I hope it does not.  I wish it every success and I hope all of the possible pitfalls and dangers will be fully thought through. There is always a danger in hurried legislation on a concept which is put into place very quickly that perhaps it will not have been fully thought through.  That is the risk.  The up side of that may be that it succeeds and succeeds very quickly.  I am simply sounding a note of caution.</P>
    <P>I will sound a second note on that I say that the Custom House Authority were planned originally as a major part of the revitalisation of what should be the most attractive and valuable part of our capital city but which over many decades has become obsolete and a monument to decay and desolation.  We need to build up a living organism, an area with a life of its own 24 hours each day, seven days each week &mdash; a place where people live out full lives; a place where the terns can nest; a place where people interact with each other; a place which has the vitality to attract people in from all parts of the city and at the same time to be a centre of attraction for tourists and a place where the best of Irish produce and manufactures can be put on display.  It has to be a living showcase which demonstrates some of the best aspects of Irish life and a place where people want to live and will give it an air of being lived in.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that there must be plenty of housing.  It must be true to its origins and to the area in which it exists. There must be plenty of housing and attractive mixed housing in this area.  It must not become a place for the yuppies and the swells.  I believe there are some swells in Castlebar but after last Sunday I would have my doubts about any living beings surviving for long in Castlebar. <Col N="2275" /> There are certainly many of them in Deputy O'Toole's organisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the idea of developing the Dublin Port and Docks area.  Much discussion has gone on about the 27 acres.  I am annoyed to think that we are again increasing the membership of another authority from four to seven. Questions have to be asked with regard to the provisions of this legislation and the Minister's commitments.  The Minister said: &ldquo;Instead, the purpose is to expedite the redevelopment of the existing Custom House Docks area by providing potential developers and investors with an assurance that the Government intend to see to it that the entire dockland area in the vicinity of the Custom House Docks is progressively renewed and redeveloped&rdquo;. With regard to the amount of money that private investment will be putting into this area, the impression is that Dublin did not get the same incentives for inner city development and renewal schemes as other cities got.  I am aware of that.  In the services area, particularly the financial institutions which we imagine will be working in this area, could we see the same type of <Col N="2276" /> scheme work here as we saw in the old London docks area.  If we see something of that nature I will not question it.</P>
      <P>There is one area I should like to question. An impression might be given that the Government are prepared to say we would consider developing this area in priority to every other area; in other words, it would get priority over everywhere else.  Will that be the case?  Will more money go into it?  Is that the reason the £10 million was stopped for the other scheme in Dublin that was passed in the previous Government?  In this area the financial institutions are getting the tax benefit of 10 per cent on all corporation taxes.  In other words, if they were not developing or manufacturing they would still pay only 10 per cent on their capital profits.  This happens only in the free zone area in Shannon where only 10 per cent is paid.  However, I am afraid that the rest of the Dublin area could suffer as a result of the tax benefit proposed in this case.</P>
      <P>While passing through Dublin recently my own family remarked on the amount of inner city schemes that are now going on in the building of houses in particular, not apartments or flats.  The inner city schemes which are going on are excellent and long may they continue.  Dublin has improved as a result of these schemes but much still remains to be done.  The capital city is not looking good.  For many years we did not recognise that and we were prepared to extend rather than improve the inner city.  I would like clarification as to whether we can bring about some improvement in this 27 acre site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much discussion has taken place about this site over the past few years and many people throughout the country have asked questions about it.  Great ideas were put forward and bodies and groups were set up.  I wonder if there was a need for all that just to improve this particular area?  Is there need for this Bill, as Senator Manning has said?  We are giving commitments with an assurance that the Government intend to see that the entire dockland area is speedily improved.  Are we saying the people who will set up there will get more incentives in comparison to <Col N="2277" /> other areas?  In other words, are other parts of the country going to suffer as a result?  That is the worry.  Will the Cork area get less money?  Will the Limerick area get less money?  Are the incentive schemes in Cork going to be pushed as well as we would like them to be pushed? Will we see a situation where we might be better off developing in Dublin rather than in Limerick or Cork?</P>

      <P>Will lines be drawn in other cities such as Cork, Waterford and Limerick &mdash; I know the work in Limerick is going on excellently, although I am not from Limerick and the work in Cork is certainly moving in the right direction. This Bill does not provide for an extension to other areas.  Can we say that the incentive given in Dublin for example, the 10 per cent tax will be given in the other cities.  There is no question of that. We have a situation where we will have seven people deciding whether the incentives that are available in no other area of the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Will the Authority have the right to say to people who set up here that they will get certain incentives?  If the Authority do not have that right, I question why they are there.  The Minister says he recognises that the three additional newly appointed members should have the experience of making sure that we sell this place properly. There has been reference to more persons who have direct experience in the financing and carrying out of large scale development proposals.  The Minister says the three extra members would have the experience of that kind.  That is understandable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that this area <Col N="2278" /> could be sold better with the tax incentives available which the other areas do not have.  In other words, will we give the same tax incentives to those setting up financial institutions in the Limerick, Cork and Waterford areas?  It should be the same throughout the whole country. In this connection why centralise?  It would be nice to give certain incentives to international financial institutions to set up in Ireland and I would welcome that.  However, I do not welcome the idea of them being in one particular area, where only 27 acres are designated.  The incentives are excellent.  I am not objecting to them but I would like to see them extended to other areas.  I have no objection to giving incentives to Limerick, Waterford, Castlebar or anywhere else for that matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>All I am saying is that I would like to see the city of Dublin improved.  We want to ensure that the whole of Dublin will gain as a result of the incentives.  Dublin is in a dire state.  I resent the fact that our capital city has deteriorated so much.  For many years, regardless of who was in power, nothing was done to improve it.  We went to Tallaght and built on green fields because it was easy.  At the same time if there are tax incentives I do not see why similar tax incentives cannot be given to other areas.  They are already in other areas. In the Shannon free zone massive work has taken place because of these incentives. I argue that the same incentives should be given to the free port area in Cork.  That is why I question it.  If the manufacturing or service sector in the Cork area got the same tax incentive there could be a massive improvement in the Cork region.  That is why I make no apologies to the Minister for raising this argument.  The Minister says that more moneys may go into the 27 acres concerned than into the rest of Dublin.  That could be very easily to the detriment of Dublin as a whole.  The Senators representing the Dublin area should very seriously question that.</P>

      <P>I will be brief because this matter was debated in the context of the Finance Bill and also because many of us touched on it in relation to the abolition of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission.  We certainly gave vent to our feelings about the dereliction, the decay and the complete disgrace which Dublin has become.  I cannot help <Col N="2280" /> but think that Fianna F·il and the Minister are embarrassed by the abolition of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission and that in an attempt to make good something of that debacle and disappointment, they are extending and expanding in the Dublin city docks area.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of inner city renewal and development.  In Waterford the designated area is a hive of activity.  It is quite apparent that developers, builders and people who are interested in the development and incentive package have seized on the opportunity and are rapidly getting to grips with the development. Already we are beginning to see the kind of revitalisation and improvement to the inner city which I have no doubt will be the case in the Custom House Docks area when building gets under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing concerns me and the Minister touched on this in his speech.  The Minister accepts that there are serious social and environmental problems associated with the Sheriff Street flats complex; indeed there are.  Certainly the public representatives of that area have spoken many times about the various problems attendant on the marginalisation of people, which is part and parcel of the area.  I am concerned that the Custom House Docks site with its financial services centre and sophisticated buildings and development would be totally unrelated to the lives of the people surrounding that area.  On a radio interview I heard Deputy Tony Gregory give vent to his feelings in that matter.  I quite understood what he was talking about when he expressed a view that he wished to see opportunities and jobs and chances for involvement given to the people who live in the area surrounding the Custom House Docks site. That is perfectly reasonable and I hope the Minister has taken this aspect into account in the planning of the area.  In his speech, the Minister placed tremendous emphasis on the financial services centre &mdash; I welcome the announcement in today's news that AIB have applied for a licence to operate in the Custom House docks scheme &mdash; but the Minister says a great deal less about the cultural and <Col N="2281" /> amenity side of the development.  I hope when he is replying at the end of the Second Stage speech that he will perhaps be able to sketch even in a preliminary way what plans, ideas and scope there is for a cultural and amenity centre.  There has been talk in the past of siting museums and galleries and of having a major exhibition centre as part of the Customs House Docks site.  I would like to hear more from him about this.</P>
    <P>I refer briefly to a little problem we have come up against in Waterford in the development of inner city renewal.  This problem may or may not become part of the Custom House Docks excavation work.  We have found, because we are dealing primarily with an inner city area, that we have uncovered and discovered archaeological remains of significance, not of major significance, but we have employed archaeologists to do a painstaking and careful excavation prior to commencing building.  In fact the actual scheme that won out in the end in the design competition was one which incorporated above ground parking so that we could, when we had reached the limits of archaeological exploration, concrete over and not disturb any further what archaeological remains existed.  All of this has eaten into the time limit which is part and parcel of the designated area plan.  I ask the Minister to consider that should this arise either in the Customs House Docks site or in any other inner city area where there is per force excavation prior to commencement of building that he would &mdash; because I am sure he is not a philistine &mdash; allow for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;an extension of the time span in order to permit a careful archaeological investigation to take place before building.  It is something that is bound to happen if you are building in an inner city area where centuries and centuries of people have established habitats and have lived their lives, where there has been building after building and where there will necessarily be reminders <Col N="2282" /> and remains of the centuries of civilisation that existed in those places before.</P>
      <P>I refer also to the increase in the number of ordinary members of the Custom House Docks Development Authority from four to seven.  I can be accused of cynicism but I suppose one is not in politics without at least suffering slightly from that condition which is a healthy condition if kept in moderation. Quite plainly I see that as being a permit to allow the Minister's men to sit on the Custom House Docks Development Authority.</P>

I thank all those who contributed to what was quite a good debate.  It wandered somewhat from the thrust of the legislation but I suppose that was to be expected.  However, I must confine myself to the legislation pure and simple but you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, might forgive me if on a few occasions I have to wander away from the exact text in order to give a reasonable explanation of some of the matters raised by Senators.</P>
      <P>All Senators appreciate how vital it is that the Custom House Docks Development Authority are provided with the correct legal framework to enable the beneficial effects of the redevelopment project to be maximised.  That is the business of the legislation.  The immediate purpose of the Bill is to enable the Minister for the Environment, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to extend the Custom House Docks area by order.  So many people talked about many other things but that is what this legislation is about.  It is the intention of the Minister to extend the docks area southwards into the middle of the River Liffey as soon as this House has passed the legislation and it has been signed by the President, and then it is intended at a later date to extend eastwards from the existing 27 acres if and when it is needed. It is not our intention to extend the remit of the Authority eastwards of the existing 27 acres until redevelopment work on the present site is well underway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of different reasons why the Bill has been introduced and why it should be passed into law as soon as possible.  Firstly, and most important, I am aware of the potential <Col N="2284" /> developers who have visited the site and they have expressed concern about the adverse impact that adjacent areas could have on the development of the site, particularly lands to the east which include under-utilised and rundown docklands.  I am aware of this, having spoken to quite a sizeable number of potential developers who have unanimously expressed the view that they felt it necessary to have the extended area into the middle of the River Liffey and that there should be provision whereby at some future date the area could be extended eastwards of the existing 27 acres.  It was a demand placed upon the Minister by the Authority and they, in turn, had the demand placed upon them by many of those who came to look and developers who expressed an interest before the planning scheme was in effect published at all.</P>
    <P>This Government have always been committed to the re-development of all this parcel of land but it is now appropriate to reflect that commitment in concrete measures.  The provision in the Bill will enable the Authority to allay the anxiety of the potential developers regarding the future of lands adjacent to the site.  The Government's intention is clear in this regard.  It is to secure the redevelopment of all the under-utilised docklands on a systematic and progressive basis commencing with the Custom House Docks site.  With the interest now being shown in the existing 27 acre site and with that site extended into the middle of the Liffey, there is no doubt that the existing derelict docklands east of the site will also be included in developments in the not too distant future.  That must surely be welcomed by everybody.</P>
    <P>The second and more immediate reason the Bill is required now it to enable the extension of the area in a southerly direction to take in the Custom House Quay and out to the centre of the River Liffey.  This was the original boundary proposed by Fianna F·il in 1982, but it was not the one adopted by the previous Coalition Administration who seemed to lose sight of the potential <Col N="2285" /> benefits of the waterside nature of the site.  One of the more important objectives of the redevelopment will be to maximise the river as an integral part of the fabric of the city and to exploit its value for the purposes of communication, recreation and amenity and as a unifying link in the appearance and in the total organisation of the city.  I do not know why the previous Government did not see the value of that, but this Minister has seen it.</P>
    <P>The extension of the site in a southerly direction, as proposed, is essential if the Authority and the developers are to realise this potential.  Maybe I am unfair, but the previous Government did not have the advantage of meeting a number of the developers and those who are interested in making proposals in that regard.  I have; the Authority have, and the demand is there from that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Bearing in mind the two large inner docks which were referred to by Senator Doyle within the boundary of the site, it is obvious that the river and the docks will play a crucial role in the overall development.  I think Senator Doyle recognises that and I support that view.</P>
      <P>The question of the quayside has also been the subject of discussions between the Authority and potential developers and adds therefore, to the urgency of enacting the Bill.  It is essential that we get all Stages with the support of the House as soon as possible so that I can make that order, so that developers in making their proposals, which will be before the Authority by 1 September, will be able to include that waterside that so many have recognised as an integral part of the whole project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third reason is the need to increase <Col N="2286" /> the numbers of the ordinary members of the Authority.  It ought to be apparent at this stage that the redevelopment of the Custom House Docks will be an enormous undertaking by any standards.  We are talking about a huge development incorporating hundreds of millions of pounds.  It is big in every sense, even in the international sense, but for us it must be a unique development indeed.  In terms of size, the cost, the complexity and the timescale that we have placed upon the authority in achieving this result, it will be quite unlike anything this city has ever experienced before.</P>
    <P>The Authority are at present served in a part time capacity by four ordinary members.  We should try to visualise that for just a moment &mdash; four part time members.  In the nature of things they cannot devote all their time to the needs of the Authority.  For that reason alone an increase in the membership is required to expand the expertise available to the Authority and especially to include persons who have experience in the financing and execution of large scale projects.  All those appointed by the Minister for the Environment to serve on that Authority will have that experience and expertise. On top of that the importance which now attaches to the development of an international financial services centre on the site makes it imperative that the Authority should have appropriate expertise available to them.  It is our intention to see to it that those who are appointed subsequent to the passing of this legislation will contribute to a very large degree in furthering the aims of that financial services centre.</P>
    <P>While there is a clear need to increase the membership of the Authority, I believe also that the Authority will be most effective and efficient if their size is kept to the absolute minimum to discharge their obligations.  The Bill, therefore, allows for the appointment of no more than three extraordinary members, the total membership of the Authority within the eight comprising a full time chairman and seven ordinary members.</P>
    <P>I should like to make some reference to some of the points raised by Senators. <Col N="2287" /> Senator Doyle expressed considerable concern about the involvement or otherwise of the Sheriff Street flats which are adjacent to the 27 acre site.  As Senator Doyle knows, these flats were built in the forties and the fifties.  They cover about 13.5 acres adjacent to the 27 acres of the docks site.  To put the record straight, because everybody got this wrong, there are 445 units there which are divided into 18 blocks.  The population of that area at present is 1,208 and not the figure that has been bandied about in other places.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>

      <P>Not all units are occupied. About 365 are occupied and 77 are vacant.  Most of the 77 are badly vandalised and are unfit for occupation.  Statistics have not got much to do with this but it is as well to clear it up once and for all.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole was not listening.  I said 365 units are occupied.  I agree with Senator Doyle that as many of the local residents as possible should be engaged in the development process.  If there are jobs available I would like those people to have the first opportunity of getting them.  Senator Doyle was not very keen about the need to go into the middle of the river.  I hope he will accept that it was because of the demand from the developers who propose submitting their development proposals by 1 September that the need arose in the first instance. <Col N="2288" /> That demand was put on me by the Authority and I responded by having it included in this legislation.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzsimons was concerned that there were no public submissions as to what should be included in the planning scheme.  That is not quite accurate because public advertisements appeared in all national newspapers inviting organisations and individuals to make submissions and we received hosts of them. The final date for receipt of submissions was 8 May.  The Senator spoke generally about the need for careful planning and we all agree with that.</P>
      <P>Senator Harte expressed concern, as did many other Senators, for the people in Sheriff Street.  He hopes they will get an opportunity to share in the benefits.  I sincerely hope we all concur with that. Certainly if any group of people stand a chance of benefiting in the initial stages of the construction, it must be some of the 1,208 people who now live there.  I was a little disappointed with some people who should know better who spoke in a slightly disparaging way about the inner city and the people who live there.  I do not see them in that light. They are quite resourceful.  I am not pessimistic about the chances and the opportunities that this development might provide for them.  Some Senators, and indeed some Deputies as well, have a very poor opinion of their own people and I regret this.  I might not know them as well as some Senators but I have a high opinion of them.  They can get permanent work there and I am not just talking about the three or four years construction period.  If this development is a success as we expect it will, and when we extend the area eastwards of the existing 27 acres, this development might go on for 15 years.  It could be exactly what the people of the inner city, and particularly the people of Sheriff Street, have been waiting half a century for and I would like to think it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Haughey spoke about the difficulties attached to the north inner city of Dublin.  I am aware that in excess of 70 per cent of the population of that area are unemployed at present.  I am pleased <Col N="2289" /> that everybody gave a general welcome to the legislation.  It provided the fundamental opportunity for development which will give jobs to those people.  I would like to think they will get first chance of those jobs.  Senator Haughey said he would like to see private housing encouraged in the area.  The planning scheme as submitted to me has quite a lot to say about the private housing that will be encouraged in the area.  The experience in London, Boston, New York and such places is that private housing has done very well.  We expect hundreds of residential units of accommodation will be included in the planning scheme and that is essential to make this work.  If it is to work beyond 5 o'clock in the evening when offices close, it must have a living, thriving, indigenous population so that it will facilitate not just financial services but also other types of businesses, retail, commercial, cultural, amenity and so on, and that it will attract people other than for purely business reasons.  That is how the scheme has been planned.  It is the intention that the Authority will supervise the development and I am certainly very encouraged by the way they have gone about their business.</P>
    <P>Senator Kennedy spent most of his time talking about Limerick.  I could spend some time talking about the designated area in Limerick, and I am sure it would be to his benefit if I were to give some of the proposals that are intended for that area but I know that you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, would rule me out of order.  Then I would have to go through all the other designated areas around the country as well and therefore I will not do so&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He talked about the extension of the designated areas to other areas.  That does not come under this legislation but it was dealt with at some <Col N="2290" /> length in this year's Finance Bill. Senators need be in no doubt that at a very early date the Minister for Finance, having discussed the matter with the Minister for the Environment, will nominate some areas to be included in the urban renewal package for designated areas because in many of the older towns dereliction is widespread.</P>

    <P>Senator O'Toole was anxious that there would be a good balance between people and environment.  If Senator O'Toole takes a good look at the planning scheme he will recognise that that was taken into account.  I would be disappointed if the Senator thought otherwise because it was flexible enough to accommodate everything.  It was making <Col N="2291" /> suggestions that accommodated the social, the cultural, the residential and the commercial, the overall package, so that this area could live again.  If the Senators have a difficulty with it or if they feel that any aspect of the total package is missing, or has been diluted in any way, before the Minister has to give his full approval, I ask them please to make their position known and I will certainly give it careful consideration.</P>
    <P>I will not go into the question raised by Senator O'Toole &mdash; he used a colloquialism, the laundering of international money.  If he has a problem in that area, it would be best taken up when dealing with financial matters relating to this Bill.  All this Bill does is to extend the area, to increase the numbers on the Authority, increase the powers of acquisition to the Authority, and extend the period of two years to five years by which grants could be made available to the Authority in order to enable them to complete their mandate under the 1986 legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulroy also spoke about the increase in membership and he welcomed it.  I think he got the right feel for the need for the increase in the membership. He understood better than many others that it is necessary to supplement the number and to provide the experience and expertise that is necessary in order that they can now investigate and do a proper analysis of the proposals that will come in, in particular as they deal with financial services applications.</P>
    <P>Senator McCormack questioned a number of things, particularly the purpose of the Bill and I think that may have been answered adequately by this stage. He is not here now, but he particularly wanted to know about extending the period of two years to five years.  This is an enabling measure because the job to be undertaken by the Authority cannot now be concluded in the two years envisaged originally, particularly taking cognisance of the fact that the area is being extended eastwards.  That is the reason for that.</P>
    <P>

      <P>Sorry.  I hoped he might be here for this explanation because it refers to the Urban Development Areas Bill, 1982, a measure introduced by a previous Fianna F·il Administration, to develop the urban centres, and in particular the Dublin inner city.  It was from that that the Urban Renewal Bill, 1986, came into being but unfortunately it took some three and a half years to prepare.  If the idea had been taken up by the Coalition when they came to office at the end of 1982 we might be a lot further down the road today.  I always give credit where credit is due but there is no credit due to the previous Administration in this regard because they just sat on what was a good idea and then ran it through the House before the last election.</P>

      <P>Senator Manning adopted a very pessimistic attitude to the financial services centre.  He seemed to be mixed up &mdash; he was for it and then he was against it.  I take it that on balance his colleagues will impress upon him the need to be for it more often because it is going to be a great success.  I would like to think he understands the reason for the extension because he challenged that section.  He did not really think it was necessary to have the extension.  I cannot impress upon anybody more than I have already done that this demand came about because the developers had indicated <Col N="2293" /> they required that the waterfront be part of the total package, and I readily concurred with them.</P>
      <P>Senator Cregan was particularly concerned about all the money going to Dublin.  That does not apply; it is not relevant to the legislation.  It is the intention that all the money for the development on the docks site will come from private investment, and will not involve any money being put up by the State.</P>
      <P>Senator Bulbulia was right and made a very good point so far as the cultural and amenity aspects of the centre are concerned.  She was the only one who did this and I am pleased she did.  She will be pleased to know that the planning scheme gives a special recognition to the need to have this included in the total package. It is the intention that whichever outstanding buildings need to be preserved will be preserved and that includes the vaults and in particular Stack A, which has a magnificent ceiling of moulded iron trusses.  I am not going to go into details now, but it is well worth preserving.  It is a magnificent example.  It was the great hall used for celebrations following the Crimean War.  There is much history there and it will be preserved by having that stack preserved.</P>
      <P>There are other aspects of the site that are well worth preserving, and they are being incorporated in the overall scheme. From my discussions with developers and people who would be interested in developing the site, they see a great need to preserve what is worth preserving and to enhance what can be restructured or refurbished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at the planning scheme it is intended that there will be an exhibition centre and everything that goes with it. That will give a tremendous dimension to the amenities this city so badly needs to develop its full potential as a tourist and commercial centre.  By and large, the scheme has not yet been approved by the Minister for the Environment but that is coming up in the very near future.  We are on target for the 1 September deadline when interested developers will bring forward their proposals as to how they see the overall development of the site <Col N="2294" /> taking place and also the financial arrangements attached thereto.</P>
    <P>I think it is a great opportunity for the inner city and it is a huge opportunity for the city of Dublin.  It gives back to the inner city the life that has been sucked from it for so many decades.  There are many opportunities in the inner city for the people who live there now.  We spend too much time talking about limitations. Here is a glorious opportunity and it should be taken on board by everybody. Community leaders, and those who have an influence with the people living in the inner city should be impressing upon them that here is their opportunity not just to get involved in the construction end, but to prepare themselves, for the educationists to get involved and to recognise that in three, four or five years time there will be a need for expertise and for an educated population to work there.  The opportunities are being offered and it is up to those with influence and those in charge to take them on board for their own people.  I have no lack of confidence in the people who live there. I have no lack of confidence that this project is going to be a huge success and I am pleased it got a unanimous vote of confidence in this House.</P>

      <P>On Second Stage the Minister mentioned that demands made on the Authority by potential developers required this extra section where the 27 acre site would be extended to take in the road the quay and half the river.  I am curious to know why it is half the river. Does it follow that if a development is <Col N="2295" /> taking place on the far side of the quay they could have the other half of the river?  Why is it necessary to go into half of the river?  Why not just the quayside?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been raised before and when I say there was a demand it was not really on those terms. We recognised that there was a need to include the roadway, the quayside and we then had to decide about going into the river in order to allow the possible development of a marina or other facility. Then the question arose of how far the extension should be into the river.  The question was raised about extending the area to the full width of the Liffey which would not give the Authority rights to carry out any works on the other quay. That would be no advantage to the authority. On the other hand extending the area to the full width of the river could limit the possibilities of redevelopment to property on the other side of the Liffey at some future date, for example, on City Quay or Sir John Rogerson's Quay.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose was to enable the Custom House Docks development to take account of and to have access to some part of the River Liffey to enable them to carry out developments attached to the quayside on the Custom House Dock site and so, for practical purposes, it was decided to go into the middle of the river which will not militate against any other development that might take place in future on the other side.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 25 and 26, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Section 10 (1) of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the addition of the following&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;One of those appointed to the Authority shall be the nominee of the Dublin Council of Trade Unions.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The thrust of the amendments refers to much of what the Minister said in his closing speech on Second Stage.  We are talking about a unit, different interests and people being interested in the amenities and the environment of their area. The people who have the greatest vested interest in the environment, in the living and working conditions and in the development of the area are those who live there.  My proposal, therefore, is that a representative of the workforce and a representative of the local tenants' or residents' association would be part of the board to which I can see no objection. I referred to the four people on the board, a hotelier, an engineer, an accountant and an estate agent and I asked other people should be included.  I was not disparaging those four people &mdash; I do not know them &mdash; and I am not disparaging what they stand for but they were elected to the board for their expertise and I do not object to that but my proposal is much more positive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is inconceivable that we should develop this site without regard to the workers and the inhabitants of the area. I am, therefore, proposing &mdash; with regard for what the Minister said &mdash; a representative of the workers and a representative of the residents' and tenants' association.  In regard to the representation of workers, the person appointed should be a nominee of the <Col N="2297" /> Dublin Council of Trade Unions.  I name that body for the very good reason that much of the authority of the Dublin Port and Docks Board will now be subsumed into this new Authority.  The Dublin Council of Trade Unions have always had two nominees to the Ports and Docks Board and this tradition should be developed and continued.  I, therefore appeal to the Minister to take on board these two amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the two amendments proposed by Senator O'Toole not probably in the terms expressed, but I would like to see a representative from the trade union movement on the board. Senator Harte made that point earlier.  I would also like to see an individual from the community represented on the board. If you want to achieve harmony and success between the people who live nearby and the developers of the 27 acre site it would be a good idea to have a link between them.</P>
      <P>It will be very difficult for those living at Sheriff Street and the developers of the 27 acre site to live side by side.  I have great reservations in that regard and I hope when the area is developed further down the river, in an easterly direction, that local authority houses will be built. Indeed a precedent has already been set by Dublin Corporation in the very fine local authority houses they built on the opposite side of the quay.  The people in Sheriff Street should be rehoused in this manner.  It was said that they should be &ldquo;dispersed&rdquo; but I am totally opposed to that word in this context.  They are part of that community and suitable housing should be provided for them in the community. When the Bill was before the other House I supported the idea of private housing on the 27 acre site, with no local authority housing.  However, in fairness to the people who live in that community there should be provision for local authority housing outside the 27 acre site.  The good will and support of the local community are essential and the potential developers should bear that in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the tone and sentiments of the Minister's concluding remarks.  I live in the north inner city and I was very pleased to hear the acknowledgment paid by the Minister to the vitality of the community living in that area.  He was honest enough to admit that he does not know it very well but I take it from his remarks that he has some acquaintance with it.  I hope very much that he will become fully acquainted with the work in particular of the north city centre community action programme led by persons such as Mick Rafferty and Deputy Tony Gregory.  I, who live in the area, have taken great heart and comfort in the splendid work they have done, with the assistance of State and civic bodies and funding, in establishing precisely the kind of cultural and educational programmes of which the Minister spoke.</P>
      <P>It is particularly welcome that the Minister should have made these remarks, that the people who live in these flats should not be denigrated, and should not all be labelled.  I have had the privilege of visiting some of the people particularly concerned with the drugs problem in this area.  Although some of the flats in Sheriff Street may be run down or even vandalised, there are those who live in that community who have made therein homes of which any of us could be proud. For this reason, if for no other, it is extremely important to note that on this site whose dimensions &mdash; and I am very grateful to the Minister for reminding the House &mdash; are just about exactly half that of the Custom House Docks development site, there is still quite a large number of people living there.  I share the concern that if the financial services centre development goes ahead as positively as I, along with the Minister hope it does, this could cause some ill-feeling in the Sheriff Street area if its residents are not consulted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the Minister is not only somebody who is committed to the development of the city of Dublin, but is also very clearly a democrat.  I hope he will take seriously the suggestion of my colleague, Senator O'Toole, that the people of the area should be involved in <Col N="2299" /> the decision-making with regard to what is their area.  I hope there will not be merely a wholesale decision taken at a level removed from the citizens to demolish their homes and move them on. Unfortunately this has been the record of Dublin Corporation in certain areas in the past when without a great degree of sensitivity to the people who lived in those areas, there were wholesale decisions taken to demolish and to disperse the community.  I believe that whatever its drawbacks the community in that area of the north inner city should be consulted.  I say this particularly because I believe it is possible that the new financial services centre may well succeed.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister and House are aware there was an announcement on the news this evening that the two major banking institutions in this country appear to be giving some degree of support &mdash; as I understand it listening to the news &mdash; and I certainly welcome that.  It is the kind of encouragement I expect the Minister will welcome.  I merely ask that the wishes and human aspirations, to which the Minister was so sensitive in his remarks, should be fully taken into account.  I accept what my colleague, Senator Doyle, said about the excellent development in City Quay.  However, I would remind him and the House that that development really took place because the decent people of City Quay got up themselves and insisted and demanded their right as citizens to be housed in their own area.  I am confident the Minister will respect this excellent spirit of my fellow northsiders.</P>

      <P>I should like to support Senator O'Toole's amendments.  I had intended to make a contribution to the debate but I was unable to get here on time.  I read the Official Report of the D·il debates on the Bill with great interest, because Dublin is everybody's business.  I listened to the Minister with great interest and, like Senator Norris, was impressed by the tone of his whole approach.  It is for that reason that I would ask him to take very seriously the <Col N="2300" /> amendments now being put forward.  This is a very good example of the kind of thing that Seanad …ireann should be doing &mdash; constructive amendments being put forward in a non-contentious spirit, in an non-contentious House.  To use what seems to be a favourite verb of the Minister, I would be very disappointed if these suggestions were not taken on board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice in support of Senator O'Toole's amendments.  The Minister said some very positive and fine things about the people of the Sheriff Street area and those who live contiguous to the Custom House Docks region.  It is important, in order to allay any fears that what the Minister said was mere lip service, that his very fine sentiments should be translated into practical reality.  These amendments put forward by Senator O'Toole allow him to do just that.  The Minister, when speaking, seemed to feel that the residents of the Sheriff Street area would have a role to play, that the construction of the facilities in the Custom House Docks area would go on for a stated number of years and then perhaps be extended for even more years.</P>
      <P>I would like to think that the role and function of people living in the general area would be more than hewers of wood and drawers of water, that they could be part of the decision-making process.  I think it would be a superb idea to invite one of them to take his or her place on the board in question.  While it is not down as an amendment, I hope the Minister will give a commitment that he was no objection to seeing a suitably qualified woman, whether a member of the residents and tenants' association or indeed a nominee of the Dublin Council of Trade Unions, take her place on that board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remit the Minister gave in the course of his Second Stage speech to the sort of person he wishes to see on the board is far too narrow.  He spoke about the need to broaden and strengthen the range of expertise available on the Authority, to include, for example, more persons who have direct experience in the <Col N="2301" /> financing and carrying out of large-scale development proposals.  I understand that but such expertise could be made available to the board by way of consultants. It is not necessary to have people with this expertise on the board.  That kind of expertise can be made available. While the insights, the sensitivity and local involvement can be made part and parcel of the decision-making if amendment No. 2 is accepted, the input from the Dublin Council of Trade Unions can be part of the decision-making if amendment No. 1 is accepted.</P>
    <P>I would welcome a positive response from the Minister in relation to these two amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies, earlier today I drew his attention to what happened in the case of the London Dockside where a similar development to that proposed here took place.  Financial services centres were established, private housing was introduced but the casualty was the local communities.  That is something we do not want to see happen in Dublin.  We should learn from the mistakes made in London.  The one way of guaranteeing success is having the local community play an active part in the development of their area.  For that reason I ask the Minister to accept these two amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">

      <P>Just a couple of minor comments.  Much has been made &mdash; which emanated I think from a newspaper report &mdash; about the situation that arose in London where local people were thrown out of their homes on the development of the docks area there.  I would remind the House that people had not lived in that area for the past 50 years. If one visits that area of dock development in London I hazard a guess one would not find a person who even knew a grandfather or a great grandfather who had lived there.  The latest area in London to be developed is off Tooley Street.  The only building of importance in that area was the Tooley Street Hotel, an area where people hung over the lines at sixpence a night.  It was an area that had <Col N="2302" /> lain derelict for 40 years and the Inner London Council have done an excellent job of redeveloping it.  Across the river from that site the HMS <i>Belfast</i> is berthed right beside Tooley Street.  Across the river you will find a fantastic redevelopment process during which no local resident was thrown out.  I see the situation in the 27 acres dock site as a development of that site.  The residents of Sheriff Street have been brought into this and nobody has contacted those residents to find out what they think about it.</P>

They look forward to the prospect that it offers them and their children.  I am not talking about speaking to local representatives.  I have been talking to people on the ground in that area.  The are delighted.  A number of people seem to think that the people in that area do not have minds of their own, that they are going to be bulldozed by the developments which can take place.  We are talking about the development of a 27 acre site, which will have enormous benefits not only for the people of Sheriff Street but for the people of the whole of the Dublin city area.  I genuinely cannot understand how so many people can bring up inhibitions regarding this development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to go back on a few points.  I have been in Sheriff Street and in several places in that area talking about this Bill.  I have been going down there, not just in the last two weeks but since 1977, since I have been representing that area, as a member of my union, as the Minister will confirm.  I was down there getting schools opened.  I was in with Ministers making cases for children who were thrown out of schools, looking for houses for people and so forth.  I know what happens down there. I was present for three-quarters of this <Col N="2303" /> debate.  I listened to the Minister's concluding remarks.  I do not remember anybody saying that the local community were opposed to this development.  I do not know where this story came from.  It should be struck from the record.  That is the kind of comment which lowers the tone of the debate.  Nobody stood up here today and said that the residents of Sheriff Street or Seville Place were opposed to this development.  Neither were they run down by anybody.  In fact, they got nothing but a very sincere interest in their case.  That is the fact of the matter.  What we are saying here is not in opposition to the Bill.  We are saying that if these people are so good, let them be represented on the Authority who serve their interesy.  I hope that, on the basis of his remark, the Leader of the House will support the amendment.</P>

      <P>I want to say a few words on the principle of effectively placing impediments on the Minister as to who he should or should not appoint to this Authority &mdash; and not just specifically this Minister.  I sit on a few boards where there is effectively a divine right that certain interest groups should be nominated by the Minister.  In fact it is written into a number of Acts that trade union groups and so on should be represented on certain bodies appointed by the Minister. I do not see why any group should have a divine right to be appointed to any board.  If we depend on the bona fides of any Minister we will presume that he will use his good offices in such a way as to ensure that proper representation is applied in his considerations regarding those he places on the board in the first place.  Senator O'Toole has indicated his desire to have the trade union movement represented.  Why not the diocese? Should the bishop, for example, have a divine right to have a nominee on the board?</P>

Why not determine what the entire complement of the board should be by way of amendment? Why confine ourselves to two?  Why not fill the three or seven posts by way of amendments here?  I presume that is the whole purpose of allowing a Minister to nominate an Authority in the first place. I do not see why people should say that the trade union movement should have a divine right to have a nominee on the board.</P>

      <P>I completely accept the bona fides of the Minister.  I was both impressed and moved by the combination of practicality and sensitivity displayed in what he said.  I believe that he will make every effort to carry it into action.  It is appropriate that the local community should be consulted.  If Senator Lanigan is aware of the situation in London, he seems to be only partially aware of it because I also have visited London recently.  I was entertained on the Isle of Dogs which is a section of this very fine development.  Let me tell Senator Lanigan, through the Cathaoirleach, that there was a local community there.  Very little of it is left and I am afraid that there is some resentment.  It is no harm if we in this country can learn from some of the mistakes of our neighbouring island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate was, as my colleague, Professor Murphy, said, quite non-contentious. It was the intention of Senators to be helpful and to provide assistance to the Minister in making various recommendations and amendments.  With regard to what Senator O'Callaghan says, I would quite agree that it would be utterly improper for the Minister's hands to be tied in a particularly offensive way <Col N="2305" /> or that we should decide here what should be the ultimate composition of a board like this.  But there is a principle involved. This principle was made very clear and was accepted by all the major political parties during the Dublin crisis conference, that is, that if you want a major urban area to work, you must have some degree of participation by the local people.  This should be institutionalised. It should be a matter of principle.  I did not take it that the Minister was averse to this suggestion from Senator O'Toole.</P>
    <P>I would like to make one further point with regard to the Minister's optimism about people coming back into this area &mdash; it could happen, as it has in London. Let me make one little warning noise.  If people come back in the kind of manner anticipated, it will be necessary to have a series of institutions for them.  This is not directly a problem of the Minister's but clearly he has a marginal interest in it and I hope he will take it up with his colleague, the Minister for Education.  I am extremely concerned at the plight of educational institutions, particularly second level institutions in the north inner city.  I wonder where will the schools be to educate these people who live in luxury apartments or in the reconditioned Sheriff Street flats or in whatever replaces those flats.  I hope this Government will take very seriously the warnings which have been made over many years by people like myself.  If the city ever recovers as a major centre of population, there simply will not be sufficient educational institutions to cope with the population.  I will not specify the institutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have received your guidance back to the Custom House Docks.  Thanks to your indulgence, I have managed to make my point.  Perhaps I will continue it privately with the Minister for Education.  It is a point on which <Col N="2306" /> I feel strongly and it has, at least, some degree of relevance.</P>

      <P>I am absolutely convinced that it is very important to get the local communities' backing for this project and to consult with them.  I ask the Minister to consult with the Custom House Docks Authority to ensure that the local people do play an active part in this project.  However, I am not convinced that these two amendments are the right amendments.  They are very blunt.  I do not know if these are the two correct organisations to be represented on it.  I do not know whether the two people coming through this selection process will be the right people.  Maybe they will; maybe they will not.  The alternative is to allow the Minister discretion to appoint the best people he thinks fit.  That is a better system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>First, let me say that I do not know how long one has to live in the inner city before one becomes recognised as having the right attitude towards it.  I have been living in the inner city for ten years.  Despite what many people think, I live in a house between the canals at this time, so I have taken some little interest in the inner city.  Let me go a little further and let you all question yourselves. How many of you have taken the trouble to walk on some of the inner city streets in the past week, month, year? This Minister has taken that trouble on a number of occasions, even in the past month.  I take the opportunity to see at first hand what is going on, how the city is being maintained and the proposals that can be made to improve it are always viewed by me at first hand.  The Sheriff Street people are all for this development. Let nobody go away with the idea that they are opposing it.  They have had meetings to consider the plans.  They have been talked to.  There are clergy in that area who are very helpful.  Those who know the area will know of the people who are involved there.  One cannot put a percentage on it, but I understand that a straw poll was taken there in the past <Col N="2307" /> month and in excess of 85 per cent of the people balloted are totally in support of this development.  The Sheriff Street people see it &mdash; and I am loath to say this &mdash; as a means of escape for them from the poverty, unemployment and whatever else they have been suffering from over the past number of years.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to hear from Senator Norris that the major banking institutions have indicated today that they are going to participate in the taking-up of space in the site.  I regard that as a great act of confidence in what the Government are trying to achieve there.  It shows faith in the development and it is a direct indication that not alone are the international institutions concerning themselves with it but our institutions are now beginning to see that this project will work, develop and create growth, prosperity and jobs for our people.  That is what it is all about. I cannot say to Senator Bulbulia that there will be a lady on the board.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I cannot say that there will be and I am not saying there will not be. The names have not been worked out yet.  I have only given the broad outlines of the type of people and the expertise they will be required to have before I would consider them eligible for appointment to the board.  Apart from that, Senator Bulbulia knows that I am not &mdash; I will not get into it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer to the London development because Senator Doyle and others might have got the wrong idea about this.  I have taken the opportunity to go over to London because I am a great believer that you cannot give an overview of anything of such a wide dimension as this development without seeing the examples that are there on the ground.  I have spoken to the people involved on the ground and walked the development.  I was pleased <Col N="2308" /> with the development that has taken place at St. Katherine's Dock.  There is an amount of residential accommodation on the dock which is occupied by the original occupants of the area at very small rents.  Some people are paying less than £12 per week for their accommodation while certain types of apartments within 30 yards of the area are fetching up to £250,000.  There is a perfect blend and balance.  Perhaps that is what Senator O'Toole was talking about.  Residential accommodation is working in that location.  It was not worked quite as well on other docks but I understand that in other developments that are going to take place further down the Thames River public housing is now regarded as an essential part of the overall development so that the existing population can be accommodated.  It has worked well in some of the areas and I expect that to make our development live residential accommodation would want to be incorporated in it.</P>
      <P>We might be running a little ahead of ourselves in so far as what we are talking about is the 27 acres.  You must understand that the Sheriff Street complex is outside of that area.  I stated in my Second Stage contribution that it is not envisaged to extend the area eastwards of the existing 27 acres as permitted under the legislation until such time as we see how the existing 27 acres development goes on.  It is only when the need is generated for the extension eastwards that that will be accommodated by an order of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Principal Act imposes very specific duties on the Authority and specifies what the functions of the Authority are to be.  It states, <i>inter alia</i>, that the Authority have to acquire and hold and manage land in the area, prepare a scheme or schemes for the development, redevelopment or renewal of the area, develop, redevelop, renew and secure the development, redevelopment and renewal of any land in the area, the disposal of land, the provision of infrastructure and related matters and other items which are incorporated in section 9 of the Urban <Col N="2309" /> Renewal Act, 1986.  That is what we are concerned about.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Act sets out the functions of the Authority in great detail.  All appointments to the Authority must be able to contribute to the achievement of those functions.  Appointees of bodies or groups such as those named in the amendments naturally tend to represent the interests of their own particular groups. The Government's concern first and foremost is to get the area developed.  That is why the Authority are there and why I wish to extend the number of members to enable them to carry out more speedily and more efficiently their functions as laid down in section 9 of the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>It is not clear to me that the appointment of individuals on the nomination of a particular interest group is the way to go about securing that rapid development to a very high standard.  Regretfully the amendment that has been put down introduces a slightly divisive note into what the function of the Authority is and the people who would be considered suitable as members.  I had hoped that we would have a kind of cohesiveness and that we would collectively have agreed not to pursue this matter in this way.  Because of the unanimity that exists in the welcome for the legislation I would have liked if we could have maintained that unity in so far as the membership of the authority is concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not want the Senator to be seen to be putting me into the position of having to reject the amendment so that he or anybody else could say I rejected the interests of trade unionists or the interests of the residents of a particular area.  I do not want to be cast in that light following my rejection of this amendment. I am not rejecting the amendment for that reason, it is the opposite.  I am concerned about the successful redevelopment of the Custom House Docks. That will be to the benefit of the trade unionists and the residents in that area. It will create jobs and upgrade the area and the people best qualified to do that should be the only ones considered for membership of the board.  I am not ruling <Col N="2310" /> out any person &mdash; and I am certainly not ruling out a female as a nominee &mdash; simply because he or she belongs to a particular body.  That is not envisaged at all.</P>
    <P>Neither would I appoint someone simply because he or she belonged to a particular group of people or to a particular organisation.  We will have to understand that the Authority are not a representative body and were never intended as such.  It is just a body with a particular job to do, an onerous job to do, something unique, something different, something that has not happened here before and something that requires a particular experience and a particular discipline. Not everybody has it.  I want it to be a small team of people with those special qualities that will allow the project and the development to go ahead. For that reason I am asking the House to reject the amendments, and for that reason only.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened very carefully to the Minister when he referred to the functions of the authority.  I watched carefully where he was reading through the functions under section 9 of the Principal Act and I knew my argument had won and that I had hit home properly when I noticed where he stopped.  With less than complete information he went down through the five sections or functions; he went down through one, two, three and four and read the first three lines of number five down to &ldquo;to provide infrastructure.&rdquo;  I will read the rest of it and my argument will be made on it.</P>
      <P>... and to carry out such works of amenity development or environmental improvement as, in the opinion of the Authority, may be required to encourage people to work, shop or reside in that Area or otherwise to use the facilities provided in that Area.</P>
      <P>If the Authority are to decide how and where they should work, live and enjoy recreation in the area, the people should be represented.  The argument makes itself on that basis.  I will not go any further with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2311" /> On the basis of the interest groups, I say to Senator O'Callaghan, he participated in a debate here during the week where he supported the setting up of F¡S which has a much higher proportion of people designated by authorities.  I did not expect the Minister to accept the amendment but I expected him to give some commitment as to the interests being represented.  I will withdraw my amendment without putting it to a vote. I say that to give the Minister a chance to say he will take these interest groups into consideration and have them represented in the Authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be less than fair to the Senator if I told him I was going to appoint somebody from either of the two groups that are part of the Senator's amendment.  I am not going to do that for the reasons I have stated.  I am sorry that the Senator takes exception to the way I dealt with the part of section 9 of the original Act.  It was not intended.  I think he will agree, if he has the section in front of him, I only skimmed through it and gave the first line of all the section. It was not intended to mislead.  It includes many other thing as well and many other powers as is mentioned further on in the section.  I would expect the members of the Authority to work towards exactly what we have been talking about, to encourage people to work, play, shop and to reside there.  That is what it is all about.  That is what this planning scheme was about.  I recommend that Senators get their hands on a copy of the planning scheme and see how faithfully the planners, the architects and the people who compiled it have lived up to that mandate. It is well incorporated in the planning scheme.  Senators need have no fears: what is expressed there will be part and parcel of the mandate of the new members who will be appointed.</P>

      <Col N="2312" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested to hear what the Minister said in relation to the functions of the Authority under section 9 of the Urban Renewal Act, 1986.  The Minister who set up the Authority must have taken cognisance of the requirements of the Authority.  Certainly the people who were appointed could fulfil their obligations under section 9.  I regret that some doubt has been cast on the people who have been appointed.  The four people appointed including the fulltime chairman have done an excellent job in bringing out the planning document. They play a very important part in the community life of our city.  They have commercial, industrial and property experience.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he wanted to keep the Authority small but in his Second Stage speech today he indicated that for the Authority to be efficient more members were necessary.  I cannot see the value of that.  It is also most unusual for an incoming Government to change the size of an Authority established by an outgoing Government.  We did not all come down the river in a bubble.  We know he may want to appoint some of his own nominees to the Authority; whether they are political nominees is another matter.  The Minister was asked in the D·il about the appointments and said the House could rest assured that anyone appointed to the board while he was in charge of the Department of the Environment would be suitably qualified and would be able to give full value to the board on which they serve.  Deputy Garret FitzGerald commented on what the Minister said.  He said it was a curious and carefully worded statement.  I might say it was a very cleverly worded statement. I oppose this section.</P>

The people who have served on the Authority to date have given of their very best.  I am putting it on the record for everybody's benefit.  They are dedicated people and they, collectively and individually, are not resisting the increased membership.  I will go not further than that.  I will leave it at that.</P>

In accordance with Standing Order 82, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purport of the amendments made by the D·il and this is looked upon as the report of the D·il amendments to the Seanad.  The only matter, therefore, that may be discussed is the amendments made by the D·il.</P>

      <P>Is c˙is ·thais dom freastal ar an Seanad um thr·thnÛna.</P>
      <P>It is with a sense of satisfaction that I am able to report to this House that D·il …ireann passed the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill, 1986, on 24 June 1987 with the small number of amendments, eight in all, which you have before you.  It is a tribute to the thoroughness with which this Bill was debated in this House that the D·il was able to dispose of it in two sittings.  While, inevitably, voices were raised on the one hand to suggest that certain measures in this Bill did not go far enough, and, on the other hand, others felt that it went too far in some respects, there was in general overwhelming support for this Bill.</P>
      <P>Turning now to the actual amendments made by the D·il, it will be noted that the first three amendments simply reflect changes in ministerial functions introduced by the present Government following the establishment of the Department of the Marine and the assignment of certain functions, formerly discharged by the Minister for Communications, to the Minister for the Marine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fourth amendment made by the D·il replaces the former section 15 passed by this House with a new section 15.  The new section does two things which the former section did not do.  First it gives the National Museum a right not only to inspect, examine or photograph an archaeological find which has been reported but additionally, to take possession of it for a period of up to six weeks after which it must then be returned to the person who had possession of it. <Col N="2315" /> There are many archaeological objects that cannot be properly examined other than by allowing the experts to be able to examine them over a sufficient period. The second thing which the new section does is to oblige the Garda SÌoch·na to pass on any reports of finds received by them to the National Museum without undue delay.  The remaining four amendments which are in fact new sections give the Bill some extra legal &ldquo;teeth&rdquo; which on reflection it was found to lack.</P>
    <P>The fifth amendment relating to the withholding of information arises from the fact that the powers of the Garda SÌoch·na in regard to offences connected with archaeological objects are inadequate in present day circumstances.  This new section will allow the Garda in cases of suspected offences involving archaeological objects to demand relevant information and makes it an offence to withhold such information.  But there are safeguards.  A garda must have grounds for suspicion.  He must state what the penalty for non-compliance with his request is, and any information received cannot be used in connection with an offence prosecuted under any other legal provisions.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 6, the Garda authorities pointed out that to enforce the provisions of the Bill successfully, they should be empowered to demand names and addresses of suspected offenders and, where such persons fail or refuse to give their names and addresses or give false or fictitious names or addresses, that the Garda be empowered to arrest the offenders.  Apart from section 3 (6) of the Bill and section 23 (1) of the Principal Act, as amended, there is no specific power to demand names and addresses under the sections that create offences, that is sections 2 (5), 3 (7) and 18 (2).  This amendment remedies this defect.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 arises from a joint request from the National Museum and the National Monuments Advisory Council that powers to search for and seize archaeological objects illicitly excavated, or unreported when found, or in <Col N="2316" /> course of being exported without licence, should be given to the Garda SÌoch·na and customs officers.  It was found on examination that the customs officers already have the necessary powers.  The present amendment confers on the Garda SÌoch·na the necessary powers to cope with such cases.  The procedure is made subject to the obtaining of a warrant from the District Court, a step which will ensure that searches and seizures of evidence are conducted with due regard to the rights of the individual.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 is consequential on the previous three amendments.  This new subsection in section 20 of the Bill as passed by the Seanad, now section 23 (2) of the Bill, provides for fines of up to £1,000 or three months' imprisonment, or both, in cases of: (a) withholding information; (b) failure to give name and address; or (c) obstruction of gardaÌ as provided for in the three sections already referred to.</P>
    <P>I must also mention a mistake in section 16 of the Bill as printed which will be corrected in the final printing.  In line 11 of page 17, the figure 1 in brackets should of course be the figure 2 in brackets.</P>
    <P>Members of this House will be aware from the newspapers of the growing urgency for adequate legislation in the areas of our built heritage and our archaeological heritage.  Even those sites which have escaped attention down the centuries and the millennia by reason of being under water are now under threat.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention in particular the wrecks of Armada vessels at Streedagh, County Sligo.  A group of English divers reported finding three such wrecks in 1985 and they raised three brass cannon from one of the vessels which has been tentatively identified as the <i>Juliana.</i> These cannon were handed over to the Receiver of Wrecks and they are now in the Office of Public Works, National Monuments Depot at Dromahair, County Leitrim.</P>
    <P>In view of the importance of this find and of the need to preserve it until it can be investigated under the guidance of <Col N="2317" /> professional archaeologists, the Commissioners of Public Works placed a preservation order on the site in accordance with the provisions of the National Monuments Act, 1930.  Discussions took place with the divers in the hope of reaching a mutually satisfactory agreement but before these discussions were completed the divers decided to challenge the preservation order in the High Court.  This case was heard last week and the preservation order was quashed.  However, the State still claims ownership of the wreck.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before us includes, for the first time, specific provisions to deal with underwater archaeology.  Section 3 provides that where the Commissioners of Public Works are satisfied that an area of the seabed of the territorial waters of the State may prove to be the site of a wreck of historical, archaeological or artistic importance, they may make an underwater heritage order.  Such an order will make it an offence for anyone to tamper with any part of the wreck or to dive on the wreck for the purpose of exploring or salvaging the wreck without a licence from the commissioners.  The maximum penalty for an offence of this nature is a fine of £50,000 or imprisonment for 12 months or both fine and imprisonment.  This provision will rectify the deficiency which has been found in the existing legislation.</P>
    <P>Underwater archaeology is a relatively new branch of the science and it is vital that we protect our important under water sites from exploration.  It would be irresponsible to allow salvage to take place until the requisite archaeological expertise is available and until adequate conservation facilities have been provided.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude by recommending all the amendments which have been listed to the House.  I believe that these amendments, which strengthen the Bill, are in accord with the general views expressed in the debate in both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House have no difficulty in supporting, <Col N="2318" /> indeed we welcome, the amendments reported back here from the D·il.  We believe they will strengthen a good Bill which began its life in this House.</P>
      <P>There are two points I would like to make about the amendments brought back by the Minister.  I believe there was a time when a National Monuments Bill could be expected to remain in existence unchanged virtually for as long as the monuments it set out to protect.  That is no longer the case, largely because of the growth in both underwater and over-water technology in the finding out of wrecks and treasures.  Therefore, I urge the Minister and his Department that this legislation and its effectiveness should be kept constantly under review to ensure that if there are further improvements in technology which make treasures of whatever sort, underland or undersea, more vulnerable, as far as possible the State should update its own capacity to deal with the people concerned.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the Minister in referring to the sections mentioned fines of £1,000 for withholding information and £50,000 and 12 months' imprisonment for those involved in more serious offences.  Again, because of the decline in the value of money in a certain length of time, these fines may not prove to be adequate. Therefore, I ask the Minister to keep these two sections of the amendments he has brought back under constant review. However, we welcome the strengthened Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Professor Eogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the speedy passage of the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill, 1987, through the D·il and the prompt manner in which it has been taken before this House.  I congratulate the Minister further on the commitment he has shown already to the preservation and maintenance of our national monuments.  I wish him all the best and I hope he will find this part of his responsibility both rewarding and fulfilling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome these amendments, as they give a certain strength in an area which needed some strengthening.  The two sections I am particularly interested in <Col N="2319" /> and am glad to see strengthened are sections 15 and 20.  The important point about the amendment of section 15 is that it enables the National Museum and various other authorities to build up a much fuller record of the find, whatever it may be.  It is also important that if these finds are reported to the Garda, and only to the Garda, this information is then passed on to the National Museum.  I am glad this is included in the amended section.  There is no point in fulfilling the law and reporting the finding of an object at a Garda station, wherever it may be, if that information then just sits tight in a file and does not move on to where it should move, in other words, to the National Museum where a proper documentary record on the object can be built up.</P>
    <P>One section of the amendment to section 20 is somewhat similar.  It is likewise important and gives greater teeth to the Bill.  The part of this amendment that is to some extent complementary to section 15 again involves the information aspect about the artefact.  It is vitally important that full information should be available.  If this information is being withheld or kept back, the object itself will not have the same importance, certainly not the same scientific value as it would have if we had all the documentation on it.  Therefore, I am pleased that this section concerning this whole problem of withholding information is inserted.  We must have information not only about the type of the object, but precisely where it was found, when it was found and the circumstances of discovery.</P>
    <P>That leads on to the next part of that section.  It is vital and important to have inserted this amended section which gives powers of search and seizure to the Garda which already exist for the custom officers.  Unfortunately, over the past number of years new rather sinister elements have emerged with regard to the destruction of our archaeological inheritance.  It was bad enough to have bulldozers operating on archaeological sites, to have metal detector operators <Col N="2320" /> digging into them and to have people plundering the underwater archaeology but as part of this whole destructive element what seems to be a whole sales network is now being established.  It is impossible to get information about it. There seems to be a great deal of secrecy about it.  One hears about enormous sums of money being offered for objects. There was an article in the papers recently about some object that was discovered and sums as high as £2 million have been bandied around which seems extraordinary.</P>
    <P>It appears that an organised network is coming into existence which, as I said, has an even more sinister element.  As far as one can judge a sort of a Mafia is now emerging.  Quite a lot of very important objects may be lying around in sheds, may be sitting on somebody's mantelpiece or may be hidden away in bank vaults.  We do not know where they are but if this is the case there is one thing we can be certain about and that is they are not being kept in the proper environmental condition in which these important objects should be kept.  Furthermore, it has been reported, at least in archaeological gossip, that the people who are involved in these dealings are involved from the money point of view only, and as a result, important objects are being destroyed because they have not got the same monetary value.  This is an exceedingly serious problem.  It means that only the glamorous objects will be recovered because they have a sale value. The very important everyday objects, knives, tools and ordinary brooches, very important works of craftsmanship in their own right, can be neglected and destroyed because they have not got the hundreds of thousands pounds worth of value of some of the other objects.</P>
    <P>In view of the way things have been developing, especially recently, it is vital that the Garda should have the power of search and seizure.  By giving them that power it may not totally eliminate these Mafia-type operations that are going on but at least it may help to restrict them and I hope, before too long, eliminate them altogether.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2321" /> I welcome the amendments, as I welcome the Bill and I trust that the provisions of the Bill will be hastily implemented.  There is no point in giving powers of search and seizure to the Garda, or in giving certain powers to the Commissioners of Public Works or to the Director or the authorities of the National Museum if they are not going to be implemented.  I trust the Minister will ensure that the provisions of this Bill are speedily implemented in a businesslike manner and not left sitting high on shelves or hidden away in files.  A businesslike implementation of these provisions must be got underway as quickly as possible and if this requires some further resources I hope they will be provided.  The destroyers of our archaeological inheritance seem to be able to acquire the resources to carry out their plunder and destruction.  I trust the State will likewise show the initiative, but of a different sort and the right sort, in looking after our archaeological inheritance.</P>

You will forgive me, a Chathaoirligh, if I raise something which has already been aired and decided but I was not present when the Bill was originally discussed in the House through a regrettable oversight of my electors which has been since happily rectified.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 15 places a new obligation on our citizens.  The Bill is strengthened by this section, and rightly so, as Professor Eogan has said but it could put the ordinary citizen into an awkward situation through no ill-will of his own.  To be fair and despite all the sensational reports of the destruction of much of our heritage &mdash; many of them are justified &mdash; it is also <Col N="2322" /> true that a surprising number of ordinary citizens &mdash; farmers for example &mdash; are very conscientious in reporting archaeological finds.  At least that has been the experience of the Archaeological Department of University College, Cork. When we talk about the pirates and those who loot our archaeological material we must remember that many of our citizens have a sense of responsibility.</P>
    <P>My question to the Minister is whether citizens will be informed of the additional obligation on them.  How will the ordinary citizen know that he has an obligation to report a find to the Garda?  How is he going to know that what he has found is an archaeological object?  It seems this calls for some kind of publicity campaign.  I see no reason why we should not undertake some kind of campaign to bring to the attention of our people the importance of our archaeological heritage and, at the same time, remind them that the legislation now has very effective teeth.  I am concerned about how this information is going to be transmitted to our citizens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome these amendments.  As one who had a particular interest in the Bill when it was debated previously I think the amendments strengthen it.  The fact that there are so few amendments is a tribute to the way the Bill was discussed when it came before the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I would like to join with Senator Eogan in his remarks.  While I very much regret the approach being taken to our treasures I am sure that Senator Eogan will agree with me that in the past few years there has been a great awareness by many people of our archaeological heritage and this is to be welcomed.  There is a limit to what legislation can do.  I welcome in section 15 the involvement of the Director of the National Museum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Murphy said, a problem arises when a find is not reported within four days and the individual is in some dilemma because a serious offence has been committed which warrants a heavy fine and a period in prison.  There might be a tendency when an object is found <Col N="2323" /> and not reported on time &mdash; four days can pass fairly fast &mdash; that it would not be recorded.  I hope that this will not be a problem, but it could be and I hope the Minister would look into the matter to see if there is some means of dealing with the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words about this Bill.  It got a most excellent debate in the Seanad when it was initiated here.  The first three or four amendments are technical, changing the name of the Minister with responsibility.  I come from the constituency where there is still a controversy about the finding of the Derrynaflan Chalice.  I hope this legislation will help to redress the problems that have arisen from this and other finds.</P>
      <P>There is an acceptance by all sides of the House that all these treasures found on land or under the seas belong to the State, and we want to treat them as treasure trove, as the property of the State.  Any assistance the Minister might need by way of legislation in achieving that ideal he will get from all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>The new section 15, which has been referred to by Senator Murphy and Senator Fitzsimons, is fairly strongly worded.  It applies to people who deliberately and knowingly withhold information about treasure trove either from the Garda SÌoch·na or the Director of the National Museum.  We would expect such a find to be reported without delay. There will be people prosecuted under this section who found something but who are unaware of its national significance or importance.  Section 15 reads:</P>
      <P>Section 23 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the substitution of the following subsections for subsection (1):</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(1) A person who finds an archaeological object shall, within 4 days after the finding, make a report of it to a member of the Garda SÌoch·na on duty in the district in which the object was found or the Director of <Col N="2324" /> the National Museum or a servant or agent of his and shall when making the report state his own name and address, the nature or character of the said object and the time and the place at which and the circumstances in which it was found, and shall also, and whether he has or has not made such report as aforesaid, and irrespective of the person to whom he has made the report (if any), give to any member of the Garda SÌoch·na or the said Director or a servant or agent of his on request any information within his knowledge in relation to the object of the finding thereof and shall permit &mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  any member of the Garda SÌoch·na or the said Director or servant or agent of his to inspect, examine or photograph the object, and...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another subsection gives the Garda SÌoch·na power to remove the object, after taking a photograph of it, and after six weeks, yet another subsection requires the director to hand it back.</P>
    <P>The Minister obviously got legal advice in discussions with various interested agencies, that this is the correct way to deal with the matter, but I would have thought that if an object of significance had been discovered people would be required to give notice of it, and to surrender it to the nation, which is the purpose of this amendment.  All of us would welcome that.  Under what circumstances should it be returned to the finder?  This begs the question why there was any reluctance on the part of the finder to either report or surrender it.  Is it because &mdash; and this has been contended in court &mdash; the State in its wisdom is mean in the way it treats people who find valuable objects, either accidentally or deliberately? Because of the strides being made in technology objects which it was thought had been lost forever, can now be recorded.  If this practice continues, and from what we read it is still going on, the State will have to address the problem of compensation so that people will have the incentive to surrender the objects <Col N="2325" /> found as quickly as possible.  Naturally there would be a certain amount of honour and glory in doing so.  At the moment there does not seem to be an incentive to do that because the State has acted in a very mean way with the finders. This was so in the case of the person in my constituency.  Everybody who followed that court case was amazed at the findings of the court.  There seemed to be no doubt in anybody's mind that these objects were the property of the State and nobody dreamt there would be any other obligation but to hand them over.  We should address this problem and I hope the Minister will look at the area of compensation or reward.  This might overcome some of the problems that have arisen as a result of these magnificent finds which have been made over the past number of years. These finds are magnificent as those of us who have been privileged to see them on display in Dublin and in Cahir Castle, where the Derrynaflan Chalice was later exhibited, can attest.  The magnificance of these objects cannot be overstated and that puts a tremendous responsibility on all of us to ensure that the public are given an incentive by way of reward to surrender the objects, and not deliberately hold on to them.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about people who might unknowingly find something and are unaware that it is treasure and might keep it a little longer than four days. Perhaps the Minister will say why a period of four days was recommended. As Senator Manning said, these heavy fines might be a disincentive to hold on to such finds.  These are some of the largest fines I have seen documented in legislation, and appropriately so.  Other experts in this field have indicated the importance of treasure trove.  I am concerned that there be a bit of give and take in these matters.  If there was more give by the State, there might be less take by the State, because finders would give voluntarily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">

      <P>Like the other Senators, I welcome the Bill.  The day when foreigners can come in and by stealth, and bribery in some cases, remove our <Col N="2326" /> archaeological heritage is now over.  Anybody who has a consciousness about history and the identity of this country as a separate culture will welcome the Bill.  I am sure it will come as a surprise to learn that our customs officers already have the legal power to search for and seize artefacts of worth illicitly excavated. Indeed, that came as a surprise to me and, I see from the Minister's speech that it was also a surprise to his Department. How many such artefacts have passed out of this country, through perhaps lack of knowledge by those at our ports as to the value of these objects?  People employed at airports and seaports should keep their eyes open for any such objects that they believe are being transported illegally out of the State.  It is the duty of all our citizens to protect our national treasures. In this context I would also like to take up the theme of Senator Eogan and hope that where artefacts are discovered any doubt as to their value should be immediately clarified with those who have the expertise.</P>
      <P>The suggestion also by Senator Hogan that items of national treasure are hidden leads me to take up the plea from local interests in my own area &mdash; I know there are echoes in many other areas &mdash; to the National Museum to locally funded treasures to remain within the locality.  I understood that much of our archaeological heritage is locked up out of sight of our citizens and visitors alike, mainly as a result of lack of proper space at the National Museum and at national level. There are local heritage centres willing and able to house at least some of these national treasures and they should be supported in that context.  We, in my own town of Drumshanbo, are awaiting with bated breath the results of the international fund as to whether they will finance an interpretive inheritance centre in our area and I hope at the end of the month we will have good news.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In another context I am pleased that the brass cannon recovered from the wreck of the Spanish Armada ship, the <i>Juliana</i>, is now with the office of Public Works in Leitrim.  I hope that the case arising out of the discovery and excavation of the <Col N="2327" /><i>Juliana</i> by a group of foreign divers will be resolved in the State's interest.  I wonder if there is any other country in the developed world who would allow such activities to go unchallenged.</P>
    <P>While I am not sure about the retrospective effects of the Bill before the House, this fear was expressed recently by a representative of the group operating at Streedagh.  Perhaps the Minister might clarify if the Bill or its elements affecting illegal excavations are retrospective because it would stop the type of activity going on off our shores with increasing regularity.  I hope this superb find at Streedagh will ultimately be put at the disposal of the State.  There should be an attempt to refloat the <i>Juliana</i> if at all possible or at least to rebuild parts of it and an Armada exhibition centre could be located at Streedagh or in the Sligo area, in much the same way as the wreck of the English <i>Mary Rose</i> is now attracting hundreds of thousands of people to Portsmouth.  Naturally, like all the speakers in the House who are concerned about the protection of our national treasure I wholeheartedly welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay the passage of this Bill as it got a reasonable airing in this House most of the necessary points were made.  One of the problems with which we have been confronted over the past number of years is when the major auction houses, particularly from Great Britain, take the artefacts from the big houses or establishments such as the old colleges and monasteries which are being broken up.  Items which may not seem to be of major value are often sold and exported and there is not enough control over this type of operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 talks about illicitly excavating materials.  When I was building an extension to my own house we found artefacts of historical value because the house was built on the site of an old church, the commemoration plaque of which we found and mounted on the wall surrounding my house.  I am not too sure whether it was illicitly excavated but luckily the bulldozer or shovel <Col N="2328" /> did not break the plaque.  However, these items are of historical value and they could very easily have been lost.</P>
    <P>Recently in Kilkenny a painting came up for sale at a major auction.  Sothebys of London decided that the auction value of this painting was about £25,000.  It eventually made £200,000 in London and is now in Australia at a valuation of about £750,000.  That painting may not have been of any particular value in terms of an Irish archaeological or historical point of view but, nevertheless, the item went out of Ireland and it is of major historical value in the art world.  If something is found in one of the old Irish houses at present and comes up for auction it may have been in that house for a number of years.  If this item is of major archaeological or historical value can it be prevented from leaving the country? Excavations may not have been illicit but objects should not be removed from the jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>On the question of the Sligo finds recently in Streedagh, I was listening to a gentleman on the radio this morning suggesting that the case taken against the Government on this item was a preventive one to ensure that they would have some control over where the items would go if this Bill went through and that there might be a retrospective element in it.  He said that even if the object found was treasure trove he would be entitled to 80 per cent and that the State would be entitled to 20 per cent.  I do not think anybody should be allowed to bargain with the Government regarding Irish treasures.  Irish legislation should dictate what, if anything, he should get from the find.  Licences should be issued to anybody working in the Irish Sea.  If you go fishing in the Irish Sea you must have a licence and you cannot fish in certain waters for certain fish at certain times of the year.  Why should people just because they have diving gear, be allowed into the Irish Sea, to take up treasure belonging to this country and decide that they are willing to negotiate with the State on its valuation?</P>

      <P>I sincerely <Col N="2329" /> thank the various Senators who made a contribution to the final Stages of this Bill.  It is indicative of the interest in this House and the contribution made by the House to the Bill initially that so many people are prepared at this hour of night, in the middle of summer to make their observations and to ask questions on the Final Stages of a very important Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning expressed the view that the legislation should be kept under constant review.  In my introductory speech in the D·il on the Bill, I made it quite clear that I viewed this amending Bill as simply a temporary measure.  I hope that before long when the case at present before the Supreme Court has been decided I will be in a position to come back to this House and to the D·il with more comprehensive legislation.  It is my feeling, that of my Department and of the Taoiseach and the Government that this Bill is of great importance as indeed is the whole area of our national monuments, archaeology and heritage. However, bearing in mind modern technology, pressures, options and considerations, we must keep a very close watch on everything to do with archaeology, heritage and monuments.  We would hope to update legislation in this respect in the not too distant future.</P>
      <P>I listened with great interest to what Senator George Eogan had to say.  I sincerely thank him for his kind words.  I was very pleased that he welcomed the Bill.  As he has stated, the amendment will strengthen its provisions.  I am delighted to have been in the House for Senator Eogan's contribution.  Indeed his narration to this House was an acknowledgment by the Taoiseach of the great contribution he has made to archaeology in this country.  I wish him well here.  I know that he will make a great contribution along with his fellow nominees as well as that fine body of members who have been elected to this Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I entirely agree with Senator John Murphy's suggestion that there is a need to bring the provisions of the National Monuments legislation to the notice of the public at large.  Many monuments are <Col N="2330" /> in very remote parts of the country and I fully accept that, without the support of the public, it will not be possible to protect these monuments.  I propose to ask the officials in my Department to prepare a publicity programme so that the provisions of this Bill can be explained to the public so that they can fully understand the importance of our heritage and archaeology and the consequences of violating either.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris raised the question of the State claiming ownership of archaeological objects.  Until the Derrynaflan case is out of the way we will not know precisely what are the rights of the State. We cannot therefore amend the law to make appropriate provision to allow the State to claim such objects, subject perhaps to the payment of compensation. Senator Ferris also raised the question of the four day notice.  As far back as 1930 the D·il decided that a 14 day period for reporting finds was necessary.  However, with the speed of communication, the way technology has advanced since the National Monuments Act, 1930 was enacted we are much more conscious now of the deterioration which can take place in the case of artefacts which remain untreated for a long or even short period of time.  In order to overcome that difficulty we have proposed this four day time limit.  The four day time limit is a reflection of the speed of communication, the changes therein and the effects of modern life on untreated excavated artefacts. I want to assure the House that our people, or anybody finding artefacts or such objects who find themselves innocently outside the time limit need have no fears of difficulties with the law.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney raise the Streedagh situation.  I do not want to make much comment on that situation, pending the passage of this Bill.  On its enactment my Department will be taking appropriate measures and action to ensure that we protect all our archaeological sites and heritage be they over water, under water, on land or wherever.  Usually law cannot be retrospective, whatever about its provisions being retroactive.  We will just have to await the passage of this Bill when <Col N="2331" /> we will take the appropriate measures to protect archaeological finds in Streedagh and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Senator Eogan also asked that we deal with the provisions of the Bill in a businesslike fashion, that they be implemented quickly.  I want to assure the House that, as soon as this Bill is passed and becomes law we will proceed in speed and haste &mdash; in a positive programmed manner &mdash; to implement all of its provisions to protect our heritage and archaeological sites and to ensure that those artefacts representative of our past are preserved for future generations and for the State.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the House, Senator Lanigan, raised the point of important objects coming up for sale at auction houses and at various public sales, often being sold for small amounts of money &mdash; somebody picking them up and reselling them beyond our shores in Britain, the Continent or elsewhere.  I am not too sure what can be done about this.  I think the National Museum has some part to play. The law was strengthened somewhat in this regard over the last few years.  It is not something with which the provisions of this Bill can deal.  It is something in which I personally &mdash; both by way of my former profession and present task &mdash; would have a major interest.  It is something that I will be taking up with my Department, making suggestions either to them or to other relevant Departments in order to ensure that we can devise or draft some legislation to protect what is the rightful property of our country and State.</P>
    <P>I want to thank sincerely all Senators who contributed.  I want to thank Senator Fitzsimons also, a man who has a great regard for our heritage and culture.  I want to pay a tribute to Seanad …ireann for the detailed, dedicated and positive manner in which they dealt with this Bill initially.  It has rendered my task, as the Minister dealing with it, much easier and indeed also that of my officials.  The fact that the Bill was initiated in the Seanad, that we have come back here again in the midst of summer to conclude its debate <Col N="2332" /> in the Seanad is a tribute to Seanad …ireann, to its functions, its membership. I compliment the Seanad and its members on their dedication to their duties and on the great contribution they have made to this important Bill which I commend to the House.</P>

      <P>On the motion for the adjournment I have notice from Senator Jack Daly that he proposes to raise the following matter: the need for the Government to reverse their decision to abolish Bord Scann·n na h…ireann, the Irish Film Board, in the interests of the Irish film industry. Senator Daly has given me notice that he wishes to share his time with Senator David Norris.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Most film makers in Ireland are very distressed at the very abrupt decision to wind up the Irish Film Board, which has been enormously beneficial generally to the State over its five years of existence.  During that time not a single independent Irish film was made without some, if not a large part of assistance, being given by the board.  Despite the fact that it was a very small organisation with a very limited budget and a very small number of staff it proved to be one of the most cost-effective Government agencies in the whole State.  It seems particularly foolish, even in times of economic cutbacks, to abolish an organisation which used their resources so productively and creatively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2333" /> The function of the Irish Film Board was to encourage the making of Irish films, by way of providing help at two vital stages in film production.  There is no evidence that any substitute body or existing body could assume those duties. The Irish Film Board gave pre-production development money to people trying to initiate the making of films.  This ensured that money was available in small quantities but, nonetheless, in a vital way provided encouragement and the financing of scriptwriting so that people who had projects to develop could find the funding to get film scripts written.  On the basis of those film scripts they could look for large sums actually to make the film. All that encouragement in those small but very intelligently applied grants and loans which were made for the writing of film scripts led to the initiating of a large number of film-making projects.</P>
    <P>Over the past five years many film makers were the beneficiaries.  Certainly, two films made by Ciaran Hickey would not have been made without initial funding from the film board.  When film production was completed, the board were able to provide assistance in the marketing of those films, in their promotion abroad and in introducing them to audiences so that in the past five years through film festivals and through other presentations of Irish films, Ireland acquired a reputation which it never had before as a successful film producing country.  That that image which was hard won has been so successful can be vouched for by the fact that in travelling abroad the reputation of the Irish Film Board, of its chief executive and of its marketing executive are among the highest of any film producing country. They have done this on a limited budget but nonetheless with an application to promoting films which meant that Ireland, which has up to now never been known as a film producing country, has been recognised as being a successful film producing country.</P>
    <P>Two worrying things have happened as a result of the winding up of the board. <Col N="2334" /> Having done away with the pre-production funding and post-production assistance, it makes it an awful lot harder to get a film initiated and promoted. Unless there is a great deal of publicity money available, which there seldom is, our film production will continue to be rather small budget productions.  To do away with the Government agency which was giving the maximum assistance was a very foolish and a very disruptive thing to do.</P>
    <P>The other worrying aspect is that we have in this Government agency an Irish organisation that makes decisions as to what films can be initiated and what steps can be developed here.  What I fear now is that if we have to look abroad more and more for money the choice of what films should be made in Ireland will be made by people in London or New York. There is a danger of giving to outsiders the right and authority to decide what films we make about our own country and that is not a good thing.</P>
    <P>The other consequence is that a Government organisation of this kind which has given one of the best images of Ireland abroad has now been done away with.  Internationally, where most people keep abreast of other people's productive activities, the nature of the product is that it should be shown worldwide. Consequently, we would have an image abroad of a country which started a film industry but which industry has now been administered a rather wounding blow.</P>
    <P>A friend of mine has just returned from the United States where there has been a European Communities festival organised through the American Government's Federal American Film Industry with showings in both Washington and Chicago.  He heard tributes to the efficiency and ability of the Irish Film Board from many officials in the American film industry who over the past five years have come to learn what we can make in terms of films, what our output is and how efficiently we promote it.  That image which we built in the past five years has been done away with and it was a very foolish and destructive thing to do.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2335" /> I would like to pay tribute to the Irish Film Board as my colleague, Senator Bulbulia, did when speaking on the Finance Bill.  It is important to place on the record of the House our thanks and appreciation to the chairman, the board members and the chief executive who have done so much to further the cause of the Irish film industry.  Since the Irish Film Board was set up in 1981, ten Irish-funded feature films have been made here and two, &ldquo;The Courier&rdquo; which is being shot in Dublin and &ldquo;The Reefer&rdquo; which is being shot in the west, are currently in the course of production.  They received grants totaling £300,000 from the Irish Film Board and their producers raised another £1.5 million, largely, I have learned, from British sources.</P>
    <P>I would also like to mention among the first big successes Neil Jordan's &ldquo;Angel&rdquo; which was made in 1982.  Neil Jordan has since become a director who commands worldwide respect.  The question must be asked, how many other Jordans are out there dependent on help, support and practical props, such as given to film makers by the Irish Film Board?  Many of us will have seen &ldquo;The Country Girls&rdquo; directed by Desmond Davis, &ldquo;Anne Devlin&rdquo; directed by Pat Murphy, &ldquo;The Outcasts&rdquo; directed by Robert Wynne-Simmons, &ldquo;Pigs&rdquo; by Cathal Black, &ldquo;The End of the World&rdquo; by Bill Miskelly and a rather well known one, &ldquo;Eat the Peach&rdquo; by Peter Ormrod.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss if I did not mention that in 1936 the first film made in this country was &ldquo;The Dawn&rdquo; and that was made in Killarney by a man who died recently, Tom Cooper.  It was made with the aid of voluntary actors and actresses. Nobody received a penny.  It had props that were made up by the man who projected the films, Tim O'Sullivan, who fortunately is still alive and there are still people in Killarney who took part in the film.</P>
    <P>It was a great example of what voluntary effort can do when that could be made in those times.  It is a pity that has disappeared in Irish life because the first thing most people now ask before they <Col N="2336" /> do anything is, &ldquo;What is in it for me?&rdquo; I would like to pay tribute to all those people involved.  &ldquo;The Dawn&rdquo; was shown in the United States and it got huge box offices throughout this country.  It was shown in the UK a number of times.  The film, I am glad to say, is still available and I hope it will be shown again because it showed what happened in Ireland in the troubled times.  I do not think anybody, even with the most sophisticated equipment, could surpass what was done by that Killarney man and those Killarney people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to congratulate Senator Daly on isolating what is a small but extremely important aspect of our life, something which involves both our cultural life and our economic life.  I would also like to thank him for his courtesy and generosity in allowing me to share his time this evening.</P>
      <P>Senator Daly made reference to Ciar·n Hickey, an extremely distinguished film maker of whom this country can be justly proud.  I also have spoken to Mr. Hickey and I am well aware of the fact now that there is a considerable disadvantage built into certain provisions of recent Acts which abolish Bord Scann·n na h…ireann.  I say this because I initially welcomed the tax provisions entered into by the Minister with regard to the film industry.  It was only after discussion with Mr. Hickey and others who are, after all, at the cutting edge of the film industry that I realised these were in the opinions of the leaders of the film industry virtually useless provisions for the reason so ably outlined by Senator Daly.  You have a central provision granting tax incentives but these are absolutely useless.  This is not my opinion; it is the opinion of a responsible, informed body of experts inside the film industry, the very people whom the Minister is intending to help. They are useless without the two props referred to so well by Senator Daly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You must have some form of incentive for pre-production research and scripting. That prop has been knocked away. You must also have an agency with some degree of marketing capacity.  That prop <Col N="2337" /> has been knocked away.  These things together unquestionably render useless the provisions the Minister intends making in terms of the Finance Bill.  I say this because having spoken to a number of my friends who are film directors who have just returned from America I can tell this House that they are most disappointed and disillusioned because they have recently done an extremely good job in the United States in collecting awards and prizes and they had arranged a coast to coast exhibition of Irish films in which they required the assistance of Bord Scann·n na h…ireann.  They come back to Ireland delighted with themselves and they find that this agency has been wilfully destroyed.  The American connections have had to be informed that this projected showing of part of our Irish heritage has had to be abandoned.  This is a great tragedy.  I do not believe it is malicious and I urge the Minister to think again.  Although we are in a period of financial stringency I would urge no Minister of this Government to take action that could not be financially as well as culturally justified.  I have no doubt whatever that our film industry is an extremely valuable one.  It can produce money and jobs in addition to being a most valuable and important resource in cultural terms because it concerns the creation of our own image abroad.  It is very important that I echo what Senator Daly had to say here &mdash; that it is essental that we control the creation of our own national image in this country.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to what is with hindsight an ironic but still very important article which appeared in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 19 June, 1987, shortly before the announcement of the abolition of Bord Scann·n na h…ireann was made. A whole page is devoted in the most hopeful terms to the development of the Irish film industry.  The first paragraph says:</P>
    <P>Irish films are set for the big time.  And in the last five years independent film makers here have been earning a growing reputation for our fledgling film industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2338" /> It has been a gradual build-up.  Since the Irish Film Board was created in 1981, ten feature films have been made here and 25 shorter films and documentaries.</P>
    <P>This was before anybody suspected that the film board were going to be abolished. It is an unsolicited tribute to the value this country received from the Irish Film Board.</P>
    <P>Another paragraph from this article says: &ldquo;The crucial difference now is that the whole impetus for film making is coming from within Ireland from dynamic local talent.&rdquo;  As Senator Daly said, the result of this decision of the Government is to remove that decision making process from Ireland.  It surprises me very much that a party who compliments themselves so frequently and so fulsomely on being the Republican party should be content that the control of our image abroad should pass from this country to the financial centres of London and New York.  The point is made in the article that the film board were able to provide the kick start with backing which allowed for funding during development and provided the money for Irish film makers to travel in order to drum up backing elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention in, I hope, a non-contentious way to a letter which I have no doubt the Taoiseach has received and has given some careful attention to.  This letter which appeared in <i>The Irish Press</i> of 3 July 1987, is an open one to An Taoiseach, Deputy Charles Haughey, on the demise of the Irish Film Board.  It is addressed from Fergus Tighe of Cirius Films who, as the Minister I am sure is aware, has made a very fine film about the national sport of hurling called &ldquo;The Clash of the Ash&rdquo;.  Mr. Tighe details how he worked in circumstances of great difficulty, on £30 a week dole money, until eventually he received some small encouragement from Bord Scann·n na …ireann.  This was sufficient to encourage and motivate him to provide a completed script for &ldquo;The Clash of the Ash&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This was only achieved because the <Col N="2339" /> crew worked for nothing, the equipment was mostly borrowed and I went into debt of £700, but I would have been nowhere without the Film Board's support.  The short demo took a long time to complete because I had to scrounge around for equipment so long, but it was finished eventually and submitted to the Art's Council.  They made a positive decision based on the Film Board financed demo and things were finally looking up or so I thought.</P>
    <P>So he thought, and so he thought again, when he received praise and plaudits for this excellent film.  Then tragically for a man like that with an investment of talent and emotional energy in the film board, the whole support of the State was effectively kicked away.  I do not think this was international and I urge the Minister to think again because whatever about re-establishing the film board if the Government really care about the film industry these two essential props must be reinstated.  Nobody really minds the name of the personnel.  It is the function, and the function must be brought back if we are serious about a local film industry.</P>
    <P>I worked in some small way with the film industry and believe absolutely that we have the capacity to produce films that will be of interest around the world. I would like to end with some of the questions asked by Mr. Tighe and I hope the Government will consider these questions and provide suitable answers to them.  He welcomes of course, as I welcomed, naively it appears, the provisions of the Finance Bill.  It is a very good idea but he also believes, as I do, that they need these extra props.  He says:</P>
    <P>How are we to avail of these incentives when the money to even write the script&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>the split infinitive in this case is Mr. Tighe's and not mine,</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;is now gone, along with the Film Board?  Where are young film makers coming into the industry going to raise the 40% of the budget needed to avail of the tax incentives if they survive the penury of the writing stage?  Where are <Col N="2340" /> we going to sell the films we do manage to produce and promote the idea of an Irish film without the Film Board's presence in the market place at international festivals?</P>
    <P>The moneys involved were very small and they brought us rewards in financial terms, rewards, in terms of our image abroad.  I strongly support Senator Daly's able advocacy of a measure that is not prodigal or profligate, but which can lead only to the nourishment and encouragement of a very significant but fledgling industry in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary) Sean Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Daly and Senator Norris for their contributions and the opportunity they have given me to clear up some misconceptions as to what the abolition of the Irish Film Board really means.  I cannot accept Senator Daly's full analysis and, as I explain this, he will feel somewhat at ease.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity this debate gives me to rectify several major misapprehensions about the winding-down of Bord Scann·n na h…ireann, the Irish Film Board.  I would like to say quite categorically that any existing commitments that have been made by the board will be fulfilled and honoured.  The chairman and the board have taken a much more positive view than what I have heard here tonight and, indeed, what many public commentators have said.  Within the past two weeks the board members have advised the Department of the Taoiseach, the parent Department of An Bord Scann·n na h…ireann, that they &ldquo;wholeheartedly welcome the important initiative taken by the Government in the matter of film finance that will result hopefully in the securing of financial investment from the Irish private sector&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That will probably take care of a number of the points raised by Senator Daly and Senator Norris.  There is a belief that because of the abolition of the film board the making of films and the initiation of the production of films will be taken from the hands of Irish people. <Col N="2341" /> The views expressed by the board should at least go some way towards easing the minds of Senator Norris and Senator Daly in that regard.  While the board expressed some regret at the decision to wind down Bord Scann·n na h…ireann the whole tenor of correspondence from the board has been positive and forward looking as to the appropriate role for the State in seeking to develop the Irish film industry.  That role is to enable the development of scripts to the point where they can become the basis for a production and that takes care of one of the major planks and arguments that have been used both by Senator Daly and Senator Norris.  I can reassure young film makers that they will still be able to get any available assistance.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I would like to point out that the Arts Council promote activities relating to film script development.  The Council have expended close on £1 million in the period 1981-87 in film-related projects.  It will be facilitated and encouraged to continue that work.</P>
    <P>It has been alleged repeatedly in the media in the past two weeks that the decision to wind down the activities of Bord Scann·n na h…ireann was taken in a casual way, without any serious investigation of the implications of the potential consequences of that action.  This is simply not true and persons involved in the activities of Bord Scann·n na h…ireann know it is not true.  As long ago as 30 October 1984 when ministerial responsibility for the board lay with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the then Minister wrote to the chairman of the board requesting that they carry out a fundamental review of their effectiveness in achieving the objectives which led to the legislation establishing the board.  It is clear from the official files that, in asking for that review, the former Minister for Industry and Commerce was seeking an evaluation of the role and effectiveness of the board in the period from its inception.  In fact, the submission from the board, which was received two and a half months after the Minister's request was issued, was a review only in the sense of being a retrospective survey <Col N="2342" /> of their activities since their inception in August 1981.  In short, the report prepared on behalf of the board simply failed to address their problems or identify their opportunities.</P>
    <P>The level of public debate on this issue has not been helped by some extravagant claims as to the alleged commercial success of the various film projects funded by Bord Scann·n na h…ireann.  The accuracy of these reports is very suspect.  The board were specifically asked after the submission of their review to the Department of Industry and Commerce early in 1985 to indicate the employment content of their projects and their prospective profitability in terms of their investment. They then had an opportunity to give a reasoned reply but failed to do so. Instead, they contented themselves with saying, and I quote:</P>
    <P>One of the first policy guidelines adopted by the Board was that a project should give considerable employment, particularly in the creative grades,</P>
    <P>They continued:</P>
    <P>The evaluation of the success of the film is so subjective that it is difficult to apply a universal formula.  Success may be financial, cultural or social and if success is measured purely in financial terms, it is apparent that the reward is insufficient on the majority of projects as evidenced by the lack of investors prepared to speculate funds.</P>
    <P>That is where section 35 of the Finance Act should be of tremendous benefit to the film industry.</P>
    <P>The House can draw its own conclusions as to why the board failed to quantify their achievements when asked to do so.  As long ago as 10 March 1982 the board's chairman indicated that Bord Scann·n na h…ireann did not see themselves as being in the handout business. Speaking at a public function, he then acknowledged, in the context of stating that he did not know any good feature films which were not made on a commercial basis, that the Government would not allow the board to throw away <Col N="2343" /> public moneys on loss making ventures. The fact is that only £67,400 has so far been repaid to the board of the approximate £2 million advanced as loans, not grants, and that the board have a policy of writing off each year 50 per cent of the token value of their loans.  That is the fact, not, unfortunately, as Senator Daly suggested, that the board was very cost effective.  To be serious and realistic, we must take cognisance of the fact that the film industry must be put on a commercial basis.  While I accept what Senator Daly and Senator Norris say I feel that the investment incentives offered under section 35 of this year's Finance Act provide for the first time a suitable framework for substantial commercial investment by the private sector in Irish film production, with what we hope will be a consequent boost to employment in all sectors of the film industry.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly also stated that no other body are able to take up the role of the Film Board.  However, could I just state that the Arts Act, 1973, gave power to the Arts Council to promote the film industry?  The council have done this expending, as I said, approximately £1 million over the last five to six years on film related projects.  Section 35 of the Finance Act permits corporations &mdash; that is the important thing &mdash; to invest up to £100,000 each year in an Irish film production company or companies.  That is another important point.  Previously, only individuals received tax relief for such investment, that is the important difference.</P>
    <P>I will make just one final point.  Reports <Col N="2344" /> in the media greatly exaggerate the effect of the winding down of the operations of Bord Scann·n na h…ireann.  The points brought forward in much of those arguments have been selective and lacking in overall perspective.  I will give a simple example.  The entire capital budget for Bord Scann·n na h…ireann in 1987 is £520,000, a small sum, as Senator Daly quite rightly said.  Two weeks ago, RTE held a seminar for Irish freelance film and TV producers and offered them an opportunity to produce £1.8 million worth of programming in the coming year.  There has been very little media comment on that fact.  The combination of that offer by RTE, the new taxation framework for investment in Irish film production, the ongoing work of the Arts Council in relation to film-related projects including, I repeat, script development give grounds for every confidence in the future of the Irish film industry.</P>
    <P>I hope that I have been able to some extent to ease the fears expressed by Senator Daly and Senator Norris.  The points they raised will be conveyed to the Department of the Taoiseach who have responsibility for this industry.  Like them, I congratulate the very many film producers who have given the Irish film industry a new eminence in the world of films but unlike them, I am confident that this new provision will help them to go on and will help the film industry to grow.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 15 July 1987.</P>
