      <P>I have notice from Senator Paschal Mooney that, on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to clarify the position in relation to the British Nationality Act, 1981, in view of the widespread concern expressed by Irish citizens resident in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator John Connor of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to provide funds immediately for the extension and refurbishment of Williamstown National School, County Galway.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Patrick Kennedy of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The abolition of An Foras Forbartha.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Paul Bradford of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to clarify the position regarding the application by many groups of farmers in the North Cork <Col N="1884" /> area to join the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>
    <P>I will take Senator Connor's matter on the Adjournment.  The other Senators can re-apply.  We will take Senator Connor's motion from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m., or earlier if the business, as arranged, is concluded.</P>
    <P>Before we go on to the Order of Business &mdash; it is not usually done but then I do not do usual things &mdash; I would like to express sympathy to the Leader of the House on a recent bereavement.</P>

      <P>Thank you for the expression of sympathy on the death of my mother.  It is proposed to take Business in the following order: Items Nos. 1, 5, 2 and No. 3 if we have time.  Item No. 6 will be taken from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, on the Order of Business, I am glad that you have called it the Order of Business, because there is virtually no business here at all.  I want to raise a general question at this stage.  We have no legislation this week.  We had none last week.  The Order Paper is flimsy today.  This session began with a promise of substantial legislation. At present there are three major Bills, the Companies (No. 2) Bill, the Insurance Bill, the Report Stage of the Video Recordings Bill, all of which we are now awaiting in this House.  The probability is that we will be asked to rush these Bills through at the end of this session in a totally unsatisfactory way.  I want to object in the strongest manner possible to the absence of business in this House this week and last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to raise a further question, that is on the Extradition (Amendment) Bill. As I understand it, the intention of the Government is to rush this Bill through immediately after it passes in the Dáil.  I want to say in the strongest possible terms that such a procedure is totally unacceptable to us.  If ever there was a Bill which needs to be carefully reflected upon, and if ever this House had a role <Col N="1885" /> in giving its full forensic attention to a Bill, this is it.  There is no reason whatsoever that this Bill should not be taken until next week.  I can promise the full co-operation of my group, if it is taken next week.  Otherwise it is trampling on this House.  It is totally unnecessary. There is no urgency.  I want to put on record the objection of my group to this Bill being rushed through at the end of this week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>May I join with Senator Manning in his expression of concern, first of all, about today's Order Paper and the lack of any substantive business. Whereas I realise this might not always be the fault of the Leader of the House, he should communicate our views to the Government that as a result of a commitment given here, this House is prepared to work long and tedious hours to do a good job on legislation, which we do not have in front of us.</P>
      <P>I would like to follow up on the comments made about the Extradition Bill. We cannot presume what will happen in another place but if the other House disposes of it, I hope it is not the intention of the Leader of the House to sit over the weekend to deal with it.  I agree with Senator Manning that it is appropriate that Members of this House should have an opportunity over the weekend to consider in detail what has happened in the other House, the various sections and how they were dealt with, and amendments that will be put forward and argued.  It is a highly complex Bill and one of considerable importance.  All of us in this House want to do justice to it. We are prepared to sit long hours next week.  We are entitled, as a House, to have the advantage of the weekend to consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my voice to what has already been said, particularly about the need to look at length, in depth and with breadth at what is applied by the Extradition Bill and, all the more so, because of the need to educate <Col N="1886" /> the English Prime Minister on what is involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senator Manning said about the Order of Business of this House.  It seems to me that it is very lop-sided.  We started very well at the beginning of this session with a lot of very important legislation.  I do not understand how we can come back today with no legislation before the House.  I further do not understand how the Companies (No. 2) Bill, for instance, of which we discussed the first 50 sections and of which we discussed the Second Stage in May and June, has suddenly got caught somewhere in the system.  Perhaps the Leader of the House could tell us why the Companies (No. 2) Bill has not come before the House.  Are we waiting for Government amendments, or have the Government not made up their mind?</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to say something about the Extradition (Amendment) Bill.  It would be fair to the House if the Leader of the House told us exactly what his intentions are about this very important Bill.  It would be absurd if we got this on Friday and Saturday and had to actually rush through it just for the convenience of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>On the issue of when we debate the Extradition Bill, I understand there is a question of taking it on Friday and, possibly, Monday.  I would like to protest at the possibility of sitting on Monday.  Many of us who are Members of this House are also members of local authorities.  Local authorities are currently involved in lengthy debates on their estimates.  These meetings are of crucial importance to the very survival and continuance of local authorities.  In my view, it is a thoroughly inappropriate day to take the Committee Stage of legislation which has been controversial and which, in my view, is figleaf legislation to cover up the embarrassment of some members of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I first of all, with your indulgence, refer to something that happened last week?  I am sure most Members of the House will join with me in this.  Last Wednesday was Lá na Gaeilge in this House.  The Cathaoirleach and all the Members of this House made considerable efforts to make use of the Irish language.  It was quite clear from the newspaper reports on the debate in this House the following day that anyone who spoke Irish on that occasion was guaranteed not to be reported.  May I simply invite the newspapers people who write editorials about our hypocrisy about the Irish language to have a look into their own hearts for once and figure out who it is who gives lip service to the Irish language?  We make the effort; they do not report it.  Let them not at least in the future give us lectures about who is in earnest and who is not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I share the views of a considerable number of Members of this House. Fianna Fáil have already given away the principle of extradition.  Mock and false urgency will not get away from the fact that what we are now amending is an Act that is in force since 1965.  This House is entitled to consider that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do what you told me to do and in the order in which you told me to do it.  I will make my point and then I will sit down.  My point is that I do not see any need for this House to debate the Extradition (Amendment) Bill hurriedly.  I invite Members opposite to explain to a simple citizen like me why there is an urgency about it.  Do they intend to extradite all the people that they have hassled and harrassed over the last&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to share Senator Bulbulia's concern that we should suddenly be expected to sit on, perhaps, this Friday and next Monday.  I would like if the Leader of the House would give an indication today whether it is intended to sit extra days this week and next week.  There is, of course, the principal obligation on Members of this House towards their duty as Senators, but like Senator Bulbulia, I have other obligations and in order to be here I have concentrated my teaching on Mondays and Fridays, so I have a particular problem. In courtesy to Senators some degree of advance notice, as far as possible, should be given of this kind of arrangement so that we can make alternative arrangements ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like also to echo the sentiments of other Senators with regard to the question of discussing the Extradition (Amendment) Bill in a hurry.  It is a most <Col N="1889" /> important piece of legislation.  It is something that requires study.  I would like if the Leader of the House would comment on when he intends &mdash; if he intends taking it as he gave an undertaking to do &mdash; to take Item No. 14, which is the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1987, on the order for the Second Stage of which he did give an undertaking to Senator O'Toole and myself that he would discuss it at an early moment.  I would remind the Leader of the House that Senator O'Toole and myself withdrew an earlier motion on the understanding that time would be given for the debate on this Bill about which I will resist the temptation to make a speech.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the sentiments expressed by Senator Ryan regarding last week.  Before I go on, I would like to place on record that I congratulate you, each Member of the Seanad here last week, all the ushers and all the people throughout the House, who made a genuine effort to use the Irish language.  It is not that anyone is pushing the Irish language down anybody's throat.  It was just an expression on that day.  I was very disappointed on reading the papers the next day that there was hardly a mention of it.  It was more of a laugh by the papers than anything else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa aontú leis an méid a dúirt an Seanadóir Ryan agus Seanadóir Fitzgerald anseo, I would like to concur with almost everything. Regarding the reports on the Irish language, there was a small report on the Sunday Irish paper, &ldquo;Anois&rdquo;.  They carried a substantial part of Senator Fitzgerald's speech here in that paper.  But <Col N="1890" /> what I refer to again is easpa córas aistriucháin sa Teach seo.  We should have an instant translation.  It is a time of financial constraints but I am sure that out of the National Lottery money can be available because the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what you are saying, Senator, but that is something on which we decided in recent weeks that it should be dealt with by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. I have held a meeting since but there is one tomorrow and I will take responsibility for raising it there again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NicholasOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that the Taoiseach, as Minister for the Gaeltacht, has made substantial amounts of money available to the Irish language. Encouragement should be given for its use in this House as well and it would be a shame if the translation was not forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to concur with what other Senators have said.  It is particularly important that the comments about Lá na Gaeilge should come from Senator Ryan in his criticism of the printed media as he is perhaps one of the people &mdash; and I mean this as a compliment &mdash; who benefits most from his contribution in this House.  The papers might listen.  Lest that there might be a feeling abroad that the media in general did not acknowledge Lá na Gaeilge in the House, it is only fair that I should pay tribute to RTE's coverage of the sittings of this House specifically on that day and, on their coverage generally of the Seanad proceeding.  Particularly when the other House is not sitting they devote all of their air time to this House.  I know &mdash; and I am sure Senators would agree with me &mdash; that this is widely listened to throughout the country.  I think that should be acknowledged.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I call the Leader of the House, I do not thank RTE at all, Senator Mooney, because it was the Seanad who brought broadcasting into the two Houses of Parliament.  There <Col N="1891" /> was a battle royal there in earlier days, too.  The Leader of the House, to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just putting on the record why it is all happening, Senator Mooney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús aontú leis na Seanadóirí san méid a dúirt siad i dtaobh úsáid na Gaeilge san Teach seo an tseachtain seo caite.  Last week no Senator was in any way using the Irish language for any purpose other than to help the spread of the language.  I do not think it was used in a cynical way.  I would hate to think anybody would see the Irish language as a bone of contention.</P>
      <P>It has to be said that the reporters in this House did not report the Seanad last week to a large degree.  Whether or not it was reported in Irish or English is a little irrelevant.  The comments about cynicism came from the other House.  Of course that does not surprise us.  Having said that, we have to compliment the press people who come here week after week and whose input or output is cut out deliberately by the <i>Irish Press</i> group, I have to say again.  I see the representative from the <i>Irish Independent</i> is here day after day.  <i>The Cork Examiner</i> give this House good coverage.  <i>The Irish Times</i> give us good coverage.  RTE give us good coverage, but I am afraid what we said i dtaobh na Gaeilge can be said equally about coverage of this House in both the Irish and English languages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid that Senator Bulbulia, perhaps inadvertently, might drag the House down in the sense that she said that, unfortunately as a member of a local authority, she has to attend important meetings of local authorities about the estimates.  Senators are elected to serve in the Seanad.  There should be no conflict of interest as between service to this House and service to local authorities.  I am a member of two local authorities.  I cannot attend my local authority meetings when I have Seanad duties.  Because of that, I miss a certain number.  I do not <Col N="1892" /> mind missing them because I am committed to this House.</P>
    <P>The compliments to the Garda and the Army can be made the basis for discussion on another day.  A suggestion has been made that there is an attempt on this side of the House to rush through the Extradition (Amendment) Bill.  I did not mention the Extradition (Amendment) Bill on the Order of Business.  I cannot see how anybody could construe from that that we are attempting to rush through anything.  Perhaps people consider in their own minds that we intend to rush something through.  There is no intention in the wide, earthly world that any piece of legislation will be rushed through.  I apologised in this House on the one occasion when we did not give an opportunity for a delay between Second Stage and the further Stages of a particular Bill.  I said it would not happen again.  It is the intention that, if the Bill goes through the Dáil on Thursday, we should sit on Friday, which will give the Minister the opportunity to address the House about the Bill.  It will also give certain Senators the opportunity on Second Stage to discuss it.  There is no intention that it will be rushed through. I have no intention at this stage of saying when we will sit except to say we will sit on Friday.  We will get the Minister's Second Stage speech and it can be responded to but other than that I will say no more.  However, I can guarantee there is no intention to rush through the Bill.</P>
    <P>Item No. 14, unfortunately, has been overtaken by time.  The European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism Act, 1986, went through on 1 December. Nobody in this House, in the light of what has happened with the bombing of the KAL plane, could suggest that the Suppression of Terrorism Bill should not go through.  The Extradition (Amendment) Bill that is going through the Dáil is a separate matter, which will be dealt with at as much length as this House needs.</P>
    <P>There has been a suggestion that we are dealing with no legislation this week. Can I suggest to the Senators who are complaining that Bills have gone through <Col N="1893" /> this House faster over the past number of weeks than has ever happened before? I am not going to say whose fault it is, but it is not the fault of the Members on this side of the House.</P>

      <P>We have offered the time.  If people do not take up the time I am not going to bear responsibility for that.  The Bill dealing with video recordings will be before the House next week. Regarding the Companies Bill, I think that there are a number of Members on the other side of the House who are continuing to get representations about it and there are Members on this side who are getting representations.  It is a very important piece of legislation.  The Government are not going to rush that Bill through before every aspect of company law in this country is tightened up. That is the reason it is not before us.  We can have the Insurance Bill within the next fortnight.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Robb that we need to look at the Extradition Bill in light of the intrusion of the British Prime Minister into this debate.  Unfortunately, every time she does come into any debate about Irish politics she puts her foot in it, and she will continue to do so.  I have dealt with Senator Ryan's mock and false urgency.  I wish to assure Senator Norris that there is no hurry.  There is no wish on our side to have any business rushed through the House.</P>
      <P>As far as today's business is concerned, we have been asked on numerous occasions for the report on small businesses. I agree that the depth of business today is not as I would like it to be but I can guarantee Senators will have enough work to keep them going from now until Christmas and it will be a legislation in depth.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, in relation to the comments made by the Leader of the House, I would like to make it clear I did not need any lecture from the Leader of the House as to my parliamentary duties and responsibilities. There is very strong talk we will be meeting on Monday and my objection was that we are not being given due notice that this, in fact, is so.  It poses difficulty for people like me, and indeed Senator Norris.  He may not have to deal with the situation of membership of two institutions but nevertheless he has arrangements. People have arrangements.  It is reasonable to request information as to whether we are meeting on Monday.  I would like the Leader of the House to be specific in his reply to that.</P>

It is not an order because I do not have to do it today, but I am giving an indication that we will sit.  As for Senator Bulbulia and her problems&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Restrictive Practices (Confirmation of Order) Bill, 1987: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to confirm the Restrictive Practices <Col N="1897" /> (Groceries) Order, 1987, which I made on 25 May 1987.  This is a short two section Bill.  One section is the Title and the other section confirms the order.</P>
      <P>In July 1986, the Restrictive Practices Commission were requested to carry out a special review of the operation of the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1981, in the light of developments since that order was made with particular reference to the issue of below cost selling and the general question of relationships between manufacturers &mdash; suppliers and retailers &mdash; wholesalers in the retail grocery trade.  The review was carried out in the second half of 1986 and the Restrictive Practices Commission report was presented to me and published early in 1987.  The report concluded that problems such as below cost selling, &ldquo;hellomoney&rdquo; and suppliers' terms and conditions had led to such an interference with fair trading that more radical measures than ever before were needed to rectify the situation.</P>
      <P>The commission, therefore, recommended a number of changes to the 1981 groceries order including the introduction of a ban on below cost selling, the inclusion of intoxicating liquor and &ldquo;generic&rdquo; grocery goods in the terms of the order and the prohibition of the payment or receipt of what has become known as &ldquo;hello-money&rdquo;.  They also made certain suggestions in relation to the treatment of supplementary terms and conditions of supply negotiated between suppliers and retailers.  Having studied the report I decided that the commission were correct in their conclusions and on 25 May 1987 I signed the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subject of below cost selling and its effects on the grocery trade has been a controversial topic in the trade for some time.  In recommending a ban on below cost selling the commission found that there has been a rapid growth in own brand or generic products, on which below cost selling was being concentrated, and this increase had altered the power relationship between sellers and buyers.  The commission found that some suppliers were actually paying <Col N="1898" /> allowances to the multiples on condition that their products would not be sold below cost.</P>
    <P>The commission also expressed the view that below cost selling by the multiples distorts the consumer's concept of prices and this in turn puts pressure on independent retailers who, because they are not in a position to compete, can appear to be overcharging.  I do not believe that below cost selling is beneficial to the consumer.  Most shoppers do their main weekly shopping in one supermarket and, while some goods may be very cheap, this saving is offset by increases in the prices of other less publicised products.</P>
    <P>This sort of price manipulation is not concerned in any way with the long term interest of consumers but with gaining increased market share which I believe to be detrimental to the consumer's welfare in this instance.  I agree completely with the commission's findings and their conclusion that the existing constraint of a ban on below cost advertising has not been sufficient and that only a total ban on below cost selling will do away with this unfair practice.</P>
    <P>I also accept the commission's findings that the exclusion of intoxicating liquor from the scope of the 1981 groceries order has meant that drink has been used as a loss leader by some multiples, with consequent adverse affects, particularly around Christmas, on the drinks trade generally.  I have, therefore, included intoxicating liquor under the terms of the order.</P>
    <P>In so far as &ldquo;hello-money&rdquo; is concerned, I believe that this practice is about gaining additional market share rather than providing additional benefits for the consumer.  This practice can act as a disincentive to manufacturers particularly in the case of small firms new to the market. The fact that &ldquo;hello-money&rdquo; exists seems to me to provide clear evidence of abuse by large companies or retail groups, of their dominant position in the market place.  I am accordingly banning both the payment and receipt of any money or allowance for the purpose of making shelf space or additional shelf space available <Col N="1899" /> for the sale of grocery goods.</P>
    <P>The commission state in their report that they are satisfied that suppliers are continuing to discriminate unfairly between their customers.  The 1981 groceries order requires suppliers to have published terms and conditions of supply and to sell their products on those terms. However, what has happened over the years is that discounts and allowances, which were not on the price list, were being given to major customers.  While this practice is prohibited under the order, the commission feel that, before they make any further recommendations in this area, they need more information in relation to the various types of supplementary terms being offered by suppliers.</P>
    <P>Consequently they propose to review the situation regarding supplementary terms 12 months from the commencement of the Act and in the meantime they made a recommendation, which I have included in the order, that retailers with more than five grocery outlets &mdash; and wholesalers when requested by the Examiner of Restrictive Practices &mdash; must forward to the examiner each month, details of supplementary terms negotiated with suppliers during the previous month.  This will allow the examiner to detect possible breaches of the order and also provide the information for the commission's review in 12 months.  Once this order has the force of law it is my intention to ensure that the provisions in relation to the publishing of terms and conditions by suppliers and the sale of their products in line with those terms, are strictly complied with.</P>
    <P>The grocery trade has an important role in our economy.  We are talking about a business where total spending is about £2.6 billion a year and which accounts for over 26 per cent of average weekly household expenditure.  The intense competition which exists in this area might be expected to work for the good of the economy as a whole but we all know that this fierce competition has <Col N="1900" /> led to problems over the years.  The balance between the multiples and the independent grocers has always been delicate and it has become apparent in recent years that the balance has swung too far in favour of the multiples.  The over concentration of buying power in very few hands has obvious dangers for manufacturers, for the trade generally and at the end of the day for the ordinary consumer.</P>
    <P>While I would not normally favour intervention in the market-place, I believe that the new provisions in this groceries order will go a long way to redressing that balance, particularly in the area of negotiations between manufacturers and multiples and in the area of competition between multiples and independent grocers.</P>
    <P>I hope that these new provisions will bring an element of transparency into the trade and that the competition between multiples and independents will, in the future, be seen to be fairer than it is now. I am also convinced that by cutting out below cost selling, consumers will be able to get a more realistic view of the real difference in price between the two types of outlets, than they now have.  I also hope that the provisions of this order, particularly the ban on below cost selling, will help to eliminate the more extreme fluctuations in price which we have witnessed in the trade in recent years.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the Seanad is the confirming Bill which is necessary to give force of law to the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987, which I signed on 25 May 1987.  I can assure the Seanad that it is my intention to see that the terms of the order will be actively enforced and I also intend to review the operation of the order after it has been in operation for one year.  I ask the Seanad to support this Bill to confirm the order and thus allow it to come into effect as quickly as possible especially before the grocery buying for Christmas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no basic objection to the Bill but I would like to deal with two main points.  I do not want to deal with the multiples and the small <Col N="1901" /> grocery business as the Minister has dealt with that but I do want to deal with any business in the vicinity of the Border.  I come from an area which is only ten miles from the Border.  Leitrim County Council, of which I am a member, spent most of last week trying to strike a rate. In Leitrim there are only 715 commercial ratepayers and most of them live within a radius of about 20 miles of the Border. During the estimates debate a lot of points were made.  There has been a large increase in the rates on commercial property. In my two years as a member of the county council there has been a decrease in the number of ratepayers in the county from 815 to 715.  This kind of expense on small business is having a detrimental effect.  To lose 100 ratepayers from such a small number is very significant.</P>
      <P>The number of people who go across the Border to shop, especially at this time of the year &mdash; I see them going through my town regularly &mdash; is having a detrimental effect on the retail business of the area, I am quite sure the Minister is aware of this.  I understand that the Minister has sought a study into the alleged divergence in prices between the UK, Northern Ireland and the Republic and I would like to ask him to publish this report as quickly as possible.  It would show a lot of people where there are divergences and it may go a long way in trying to alleviate an already quite serious problem.</P>
      <P>We are the best country in the world for making laws and having legislation. The Restrictive Practices Bill is an example of this.  I would like the Minister to try to allocate staff to the proper implementation and policing of these laws.  Laws are enacted and after some time they just get caught up in legislation and due to lack of funding and everything else, some of the laws are forgotten about and not properly implemented.  In this context this could have very serious consequences and I would ask the Minister to ensure that this legislation is policed properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speaker I would like to compliment the Minister <Col N="1902" /> on introducing this important Bill.  As we all know, the reality is that there has been great concern in the industry in regard to the problem of below cost selling and the payment of &ldquo;hello-money&rdquo;.  This is dealt with exclusively in the Bill and it also touches, as the Minister has pointed out, the area of intoxicating liquor and generic grocery goods.  The Bill also touches on the question of extended credit and other pressure on suppliers by the large supermarkets. As far as below cost selling is concerned I would welcome a total ban because I have seen what has happened in the past.  It is necessary for the future to preserve the livelihoods of small traders. We are told there are 7,000 retail family grocers left in the country.  The balance have been bombarded out of business because of below cost selling and &ldquo;hellomoney&rdquo; practices.</P>
      <P>The Joint Committee on Small Businesses indicated that approximately 770 firms went out of business in the last three years.  Of course this has resulted in huge job losses in the industry.  I am wondering, even at this late hour, if it is too late.  Hopefully, it is not, but certainly it would be my opinion that this Bill should have been introduced many years ago. The question is: do we want to give the complete Irish grocery trade to what really would be two multinationals?  At the moment they have well in excess of 50 per cent of this trade.  If we want to do that, then give them the &ldquo;hello-money&rdquo; and below cost factors but that will certainly put an end to the other smaller trades I have referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the question of whether the customers were not getting value.  Multiples are suggesting that the housewife and the consumer are getting value, that they are saving pounds on grocery bills and so on.  I agree with the Minister.  This is in some way a myth. The actual position is that if below cost selling, &ldquo;hello-money&rdquo; and the other evils of the trade are banned the consumer will obtain more items at the proper cost rather than a few items in what is known as the loss leader situation.  The housewife/consumer is not getting the value she thinks she is under the present <Col N="1903" /> system.  She will save admittedly on the undercost items but will be hit on other items, it might be meat today, fruit tomorrow.  This is the secret of the survival of the large multinationals.  This is how they have helped to put so many small family grocers out of business.  All over the country the small retail grocery trade got smaller year by the year.  In fact, towns like Athlone and Longford have lost small family groceries because every year there is a noticeable diminution in that trade.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the multiples have become so powerful that they can, in fact, totally dictate their own terms of purchase.  They can totally dictate their own credit facilities and they can dictate their own &ldquo;hello-money&rdquo; deals.  Therefore, it is easy for them to sell as they do.  Often they have three, four or many more months of credit.  The knowledge that this credit can run into hundreds of millions of pounds and that they can have this money for their own use can prove disastrous for the unfortunate manufacturer or the unfortunate supplier.  Suppliers must then, because they are committed to the companies, toe the line in whatever way is dictated to them; otherwise their products could be removed from the shelves.</P>
    <P>I believe there has been an element of ruthless behaviour on the part of the multinationals.  I have been told by manufacturers and suppliers of true cases of taking &mdash; not of their own choice &mdash; small percentages of profit of maybe 4 per cent, 5 per cent or 6 per cent and perhaps being told two months later that there is a price change and their profit margins will be reduced.  The unfortunate supplier/ manufacturer having, as it were, put all his eggs into the one basket has very few options left and he must play ball with the person who is taking his goods.  This, of course, has led to a great degree of insecurity on the part of manufacturers and suppliers.  If they want to stay in business &mdash; and obviously they want to stay in business &mdash; they must toe the line.  If they do not play ball they are <Col N="1904" /> told by the multinationals: &ldquo;We are delisting your product&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As I have said, it is a question of credit: there is no question about it but that they are keeping prices down by using the housewife's money which they use on a daily basis.  They have huge turnovers, huge credit facilities, so they use this money wisely in the investment market with success, obviously.  They make large profits and give some items at reduced rates to the detriment of other retailers in the town or area.</P>
    <P>The question of &ldquo;hello-money&rdquo; is obviously one of concern too.  I believe it is a despicable practice.  If a product is good enough to be put on a shelf there should be no need for expensive financial gimmicks on the part of the manufacturer and supplier.  I know there are heavy penalties within the Bill for breaches in regard to &ldquo;hello-money&rdquo; and below cost selling.  While I might have some doubts about these devices being implemented in another guise, I would like to think this would not happen and that the penalties will be sufficient deterrent to prevent it forever.</P>
    <P>There was a Bill here some time ago, dealing with building societies and a question was raised by the Minister and by many speakers about the lucrative insurance commissions they were getting. It is part and parcel of the Bill that they should not be able to get involved in this area of activity but it is going on in full spate.  If the building societies in that context are making lots of money they will fight all the way to keep that operation going.  Similarly with the &ldquo;hello-money&rdquo; and the below cost selling the multinationals will be endeavouring as hard as they can to keep them in existence. The situation has to be watched and if there is any breach of the law the full rigours of the legislation should be applied.</P>
    <P>It is certain that when you give in excess of £500 million of the national grocery cake as is the case at the moment to two of the multinationals, it can have dire consequences right across the board for the trade.  The &ldquo;hello-money&rdquo; and <Col N="1905" /> below cost selling were in part responsible for the H. Williams collapse.  They were a major contributor to the collapse of that company because of what I would call the despicable mid-summer madness that was carried on by the multinationals at that time.</P>
    <P>They are still endeavouring to get huge buying power.  Quinnsworth, for example, have four of the H. Williams stores and they are continuing and will continue to have increased slices of the grocery cake.  Hopefully, this Bill will limit in some way that aspiration.  A monopoly by the multinationals or a monopoly generally is wrong.  They have the power of price.  The knock-on effect has been enormous and it will continue to be disastrous if it is not banned which it will be as a result of this legislation.  I am not saying that the multinationals and their operations are all wrong.  I am not saying they have not got a role to play in the marketplace.  Fair competition must be a key component of any trade.  That certainly is not there at the moment.</P>
    <P>Confidence, too, is gone on the part of many of the small retail and distributing sectors.  We have the effects of the recession; we have high taxation rates; we have the casual traders who are part of the black economy.  Many businesses have gone and more will close.  Those are also reasons companies have gone out of business.  The &ldquo;hello-money&rdquo; and below cost selling have dealt the deadliest blow of all.  This monopoly that I referred to has been achieved.  It cannot be of benefit to the Irish consumer and to the Irish economy generally.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of the Bill which will help to stabilise the retail food trade.  It will help to protect the 40,000 jobs in the food and drink manufacturing industry, and in the food retailing and wholesaling area about 35,000 jobs.  It will give a boost in confidence to the retail grocery trade &mdash; what is left of it.  I have expressed doubt as to whether Maurice Pratt could continue to have the very confident and broad smile that he has now at key times on television advertising time, if he were asked to run a small retail outlet in any provincial town in Ireland <Col N="1906" /> and compete against the &ldquo;hello-money&rdquo; and the below cost practices of his present peers.  I think there would be a change of smile somehow.  From my point of view, it goes without saying that I congratulate the Minister on bringing this Bill forward. I support fully the broad principles of the Bill and I hope and feel it will be very successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to welcome the Bill, not because I have any love or hate for the multinationals or for the supermarket chains, but for the very good reason that it is a piece of good consumer protection legislation.  The only thing missing &mdash; and it could not be included in this type of Bill &mdash; is the extension of consumer information about which probably a little more could be done.  I get a little bit mixed up at times &mdash; I suppose a lot of people who know me would say: &ldquo;Sure we know that, Jack.&rdquo;  Sometimes you wonder whether competition is the best way to achieve efficiency, whether it actually stands up in the light of situations like this.  Admittedly, the competition is not good, but it is competition and this is what society encourages.  Because of the lack of controls, if you like, abuses grow up in these areas.  It is nice to know a Minister can come in with this legislation. When it is introduced in the spirit of consumer protection I do not think there should be any quibbling about it.</P>
      <P>One thing that worries me, not just about the grocery trade &mdash; one sees in the Official Dáil Report that people were talking about Easter eggs, and Hal-lowe'en, etc &mdash; is that we are inclined to overlook the fact that a lot of these supermarkets have very large clothing outlets and some are actually attached to the premises.  Not only are you being attracted in on the basis of buying some so-called cheap product &mdash; in fact you are paying for it in another way &mdash; but you are also, if you are weak enough, being dragged into a situation where you finally finish up buying a pair of socks, a coat or something else.  It does not begin and end there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another worry I have arises as a result of our membership of the EC, you <Col N="1907" /> wonder where you begin to bring in restrictions curbing restrictive practices and where you start thinking about the question of import control.  Being a member of the EC you cannot bring in import control.  You can only do that by having a very strong Buy Irish campaign; but you would not actually be saying you could not import.  You can have all the protection you like in this area and it is good to have it, but on the other hand, if you have clothing coming in from Hong Kong and other areas and you have no control over that, the multinationals who have these vast outlets are getting the advantage of that also.  I know this legislation is not strictly related to that but it is something that has to be thought about.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that there must be a limit to what you can say cannot happen.  There was quibbling in the Dáil about whether things that happened should not have happened.  You cannot stop that.  There is also advertising.  I do not think there is anything you can do about it in the sense that you might have the restrictive practices legislation but it will not stop the Maurice Pratts of this world finding some other way of attracting you into the shop.  Nevertheless, it is good legislation.  Without going too far into it, it is worthy of commendation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a brief contribution to this Bill and to say that I welcome it.  Below cost selling is not a good practice.  The use of loss leaders to generate increased sales is not to the advantage of the consumer.  In actual fact, over a wide range of items in the food basket the consumer is paying much more for his commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill will also bring a degree of stabilisation to a £2.5 billion to £3 billion food industry.  It will also help to protect the 40,000 jobs in the food and drink and manufacturing industries and 35,000 jobs in food retailing and wholesaling.  It will mean that consumers will obtain more items at cost rather than just a few products at a loss leader level.  I am sure the 7,000 independent family grocers who are trying to bring up families by running <Col N="1908" /> small grocery businesses will welcome this legislation and it will give them some added protection in the running of those businesses.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Small Businesses, retail and distribution, found strongly in favour of the ban on below cost selling in their report of September 1984.  The OECD report <i>Buying Power 1981</i> warns of the power of dominant buyers and states:</P>
    <P>Therefore, if a law which deals with buying power by directly controlling certain forms of price discrimination is desired it should concentrate on those forms of price discrimination which systematically favour large buyers or threaten to eliminate from the market firms which would otherwise be competitive.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking the Bill will be welcomed and it will give some protection to the 40,000 people employed in this industry.  I welcome the Bill and give it my full support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators who contributed to this debate for the welcome they gave this legislation.  I refer first to the points raised by Senator Gerry Reynolds who, as we all know, comes from the Border region, as I do myself even if I am not as close to it as he is.  We are all very well aware of the distortion of trade that has taken place over a number of years between North and South.  To answer his query on the survey that has been carried out in relation to prices north and south of the Border, I want to tell him and the Seanad that it is with the printers at the moment and it will be published as soon as I receive it. I think it will help to focus on what the real state of play is.</P>

    <P>Surveys have been done in the past by RTE I think on two occasions but one must always be careful when doing a survey to compare like with like.  I know that one of the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; surveys was carried out comparing a small cash-and-carry in north-east Donegal with a <Col N="1909" /> large cash-and-carry in Belfast.  That certainly was not comparing like with like. It was on a selected number of items.  It is certainly true to say that some items were well out of line and immediately after seeing the programme I asked the Examiner of Restrictive Practices, to have the various items investigated.  At least some of the prices have come back into line since.  That is not to say that everything is cheaper there than it is here.</P>
    <P>The survey we have carried out covers about 100 items which gives a fair and balanced view right across the baord. There is a differential between North and South for various overhead reasons such as that running a business down here entails higher energy costs, perhaps higher rates, insurance charge and so on.  When one allows for that, major differentials that seem to exist simply do not exist.  They may exist on certain items but it is like below cost selling down here. You can get it on a limited number of items.  Really to take advantage of below cost selling down here the housewife would have to take the few items that are loss leaders in a particular multiple or supermarket and go on to the next one and take them there also.  She would find at the end of the day that she was no better off if she counted the time, petrol and so on that she would waste in the process.</P>
    <P>It is generally understood by the consumer that that aspect of below cost selling and loss leaders simply is not for the benefit of consumers.  They may think it is on a certain number of items but, if they check that out right across the baord, they find that it does pay at the end of the day.  It is all about increasing market share.  As I said at the outset, it is not a pleasant duty for any Minister to have to interfere in the marketplace but when abuses such as this go on to the extent that they distort trade, when the small grocer is not given a reasonable chance to exist, consumer legislation comes into play.  I will not hesitate to interfere again if the situation arises to the extent that it has arisen in this case.</P>
    <P>In relation to the points raised by Senator Jack Harte &mdash; and I gather he <Col N="1910" /> welcomes the Bill as indeed all Senators have done &mdash; imports from the Far-East are a different proposition.  There is a considerable amount of imports into this country that one would like to see substituted, almost £1.2 billion, on a close examination of the import list from the figures published by CSO.  One can see considerable opportunities there.  The Irish Goods Council, are very good at matching opportunities and products that are imported here to small suppliers and they give these suppliers the opportunity of import substituting certain items. There is a world of stuff being imported here which could be import substituted. It is my intention to bring the Irish Goods Council and the linkage programme together to try to capture some of the opportunities that exist.</P>
    <P>I am glad all Senators have welcomed this Bill.  It has been around for some time.  It is a very short Bill.  It is a two section Bill, one section being the Title. The other is confirmation of the Order which was signed on 25 May.  It has been welcomed by RGDATA, the CII and everybody else as a bid to restore a fair balance to the trade and produce some transparency for the benefit of the consumer. It will be reviewed in 12 months time and let us hope that everybody looks at it and abides by the spirit of the legislation.</P>
    <P>In so far as the multiple groups are concerned, I hope they will accept the changes I propose as an attempt to establish a fairer structure in the trade and will heed the warning not to abuse the unquestionably stong position which they now enjoy in the market place.  In particular, I hope they will not attempt to circumvent the spirit of the new Order by seeking to develop new unfair practices which may not be specifically prohibited by the terms of this legislation.  This would only force me to come again to introduce further legislation on this subject. It is hardly in anybody's interest to have a tightly controlled and regulated sector with legislative provisions governing every single transaction in the marketplace. That is not what I desire and nobody else desires it, but we have to <Col N="1911" /> ensure that malpractices as they develop are stamped out.</P>
    <P>Finally, I warn manufacturers and suppliers that they must not, for their part, regard this legislation as any sort of crutch or protection against inefficient work practices or poorly developed products. It is my belief and, indeed, my experience that if a supplier's product is good enough, if the price if right, if the presentation is good and he delivers on time, he will have no difficulty in winning orders.  The way forward must lie in cooperation as far as possible with the retailers rather than confrontation all around.  So, at the end of the day, it is quality and reliability that matter.  It is these factors, rather than any legislative and administrative measures which I could take, that will ultimately determine whether or not manufactures survive in the competitive environment of the grocery trade today.</P>

      <P>The opening phrase of the Seanad <Col N="1913" /> amendment commences with the words: &ldquo;The making of an object of any description which is in three dimensions...&rdquo;  In contrast, the amendment moved by the Minister in the Dáil opens with the phrase &ldquo;The act of reproducing an object of any description which is in three dimensions ...&rdquo; I should say that it was the Attorney General who advised on the revised wording which is more legally and technically correct.  The advice was that the expression &ldquo;reproducing ...&rdquo; was the correct one to use in circumstances where a third party makes functional objects by copying an object originally made by the copyright owner.  This is the only significant change in the wording of the Minister's amendment and no change in substance from Seanad amendment No. 1 is involved.  I should also say that subparagraph (b) of the Minister's amendment contains slightly different wording from the corresponding subparagraph of the Seanad amendment.  Again there is absolutely no difference in substance, but the revised wording was prepared by the Attorney General on the basis that legally and technically it more correctly expresses the objective to be achieved.  I hope this will satisfy anybody who might be worried about it because what we are talking about is reproducing rather than the making of an object.  Our legal opinion, as advised by the Attorney General, is that reproducing is the more appropriate term.  That is the only amendment we have made to the Seanad amendment.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1914" /> That Seanad Éireann takes note of the Sixth Report of the Joint Committee on Small Businesses &mdash; The Development and Management of Small Business Co-operatives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackDaly" hpid="Mr. J. Daly Mr. J. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Joint Committee on Small Businesses published this report in July of last year.  It might seem a curious topic for such a committee to investigate. After all, co-operatives are certainly not part of the small business mainstream in Ireland today.  Why did we choose this topic?  As a committee we were conscious always of our responsibility to address business issues relevant to increasing overall employment, whether by way of removing unnecessary restraints or by exploring new prospects.  There was a feeling among us that the small business co-operatives were an issue worth addressing in the employment context. We were aware, as stated on page 32 of our report, that the numbers employed in EC small business co-operatives nearly doubled from 290,000 to 540,000 and the number of co-operatives from 6,500 to 13,900 during the period 1978 to 1983.</P>
      <P>Co-operative growth in Europe has been very much a response to high and endemic unemployment throughout the EC.  If something positive was happening in other EC countries in regard to this type of co-operative, why could it not happen here?  In other sectors, particularly agricultural co-operatives and credit unions, Ireland has quite a successful co-operative movement.  Why should we not have the same in the small business sector, both manufacturing and services?  In our report we set out to answer these questions.  We looked at the major issues we saw as relevant to the development of small business co-operatives. Our recommendations provide the framework for positive development in this area, provided these recommendations are strictly acted upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the report we examined the issues affecting small business development <Col N="1915" /> under the following headings.  On page 19 of the report we state:</P>
    <P>The most striking fact about the legal framework for co-operatives in Ireland is that there is no legal definition of a co-operative although the Credit Union Act, 1966, uses the expression &ldquo;co-operative societies&rdquo; to describe credit unions.</P>
    <P>In practice co-operatives are legally incorporated under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts 1893-1978, which are administered by the Registrar of Friendly Societies, for whom the Minister for Industry and Commerce has statutory responsibility.  The main piece of legislation is still the 1893 Act.</P>
    <P>Any type of business may be registered under these Acts.  On registration, a society becomes a body corporate with limited liability which conveys the power to enter into contracts and to obtain and give security for credit.</P>
    <P>We believe also that the co-operative movement, particularly in agriculture, is already of such significance within the economy as to justify specific co-operative legislation.  Within the legislation there should be specific provisions for industrial services.  Since the foundation of the State successive Governments have given commitments to bring in a new co-operative Bill to give a proper legal definition of a co-operative together with a proper legal framework.  Successive Governments have done nothing to implement that commitment.</P>
    <P>As a Senator from County Kerry, which has one of the largest co-operatives in the country, I find it incredible that co-operatives are incorporated under antiquated legislation, not really designed for co-operative purposes.  It is up to the Minister to produce some action on this front.  Finding finance for co-operatives is not an easy matter.  If you remember that many co-operatives arise out of factory closures, you can understand how difficult it can be.  Facilities are available from State agencies but, if the essence of a co-operative is self help, the State <Col N="1916" /> should not be relied upon for everything. Now, more than ever there is a severe limit to what the State can afford.  There is an onus on those organisations, whether co-operative bodies or trade unions, who advocate co-operatives to ensure that more funds and properly structured funds are available to provide adequate shares and long term loan capital for viable co-operative propositions.</P>
    <P>On the whole question of management development for co-operatives, we are unambiguous in the strength of our conviction that this area is critical as we said on pages 25 and 26 of the report:</P>
    <P>In all of our sectoral reports we highlighted the critical importance of good management to the success of any small firm.  We said in our report on manufacturing industry &ldquo;all research and business success and business failure reaches a universal conclusion that effective management is the key ingredient of success and weak or inadequate management is the primary cause of failure&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Although management weaknesses are a feature of Irish small firms generally the problem in small co-operative is relatively greater.</P>
    <P>The basis on which many of these co-operatives are established, either as a community response to unemployment or as an employee response to a factory closure, means there is usually little or no management expertise within the initial co-operative grouping.  Although there may be production management skills within a workers co-operative venture, the general body of management skills must either be built within the co-operatives of brought in.</P>
    <P>These other skills include financial management and marketing, which are fundamental to the successful operation of a modern business.</P>
    <P>Any external support for co-operatives, including grants, must have management development as a central objective.  Indeed management development for co-operatives is as much a key issue as finance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1917" /> They are firm words but they are the absolute truth.  Our recommendations are designed to ensure that any State support for co-operatives gives absolute priority to effective management development.  To do otherwise would be to throw good money after bad.  In our reports we described the three principal non State bodies concerned with the development of small business co-operatives; (1) ICOS, which assists with the development of small co-operatives but is primarily focused on the larger agricultural co-operatives; (2) the Co-operative Development Society, that is CDS, which was established 30 years ago, to foster and support small industrial and service co-operatives but which has no full time staff or other necessary facilities; (3) the ICTU which, although not a representative body, advocates the development of a network of worker co-operatives.</P>
    <P>There is need for a representative body for small business co-operatives and as we say on page 52 of the report:</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on the various bodies to come together and devise a suitable structure.  The maximum cooperation between those groups that most advocate support for co-operatives should be automatically assumed.</P>
    <P>The report was a bit critical of State agencies and their perception that they were offering a single service, a perception not always shared by their clients.  We came to the conclusion that there was an element of confusion among the public with regard to State support services for co-operatives.</P>
    <P>We said, and I quote from pages 53 and 54 of the report:</P>
    <P>We feel that the State support for small business co-operatives needs a single focal point, particularly at the start-up stage.  The principal focus for project assessment should be the prospect of viability.  Considerations such as the age of the participants, whether it is being started in a community context <Col N="1918" /> or by unemployed workers or as a &ldquo;phoenix&rdquo; situation, should be secondary.</P>
    <P>We feel that there is a need for a Co-operative Development Centre within or allied to the State structure which could provide a feasibility study and central information service to prospective co-operative groups.</P>
    <P>Moverover, we would see this Centre as the central processing and grant approval unit, on an agency basis, for all start-up or stage one business co-operative projects, and as the co-ordinating unit for the State agency aftercare.</P>
    <P>We feel that the Irish Productivity Centre with its broad representation of Employers and Unions, and its consultancy and business development services, including worker participation, should be responsible for this unit.</P>
    <P>We believe that this type of setting for the provision of State support in a co-ordinated way to start-up business co-operatives would lead to a new emphasis on project and management appraisal and development.</P>
    <P>The Government response to the issue is on page 36 of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which was published in October this year.  I am extremely sceptical with regard to this programme; many of its targets are unattainable pie in the sky. However, the commitment to request FÁS to consider urgent proposals for a co-operative development council is welcome and I look forward to positive results.</P>
    <P>Whether a business is a co-operative or any other sort of business, the cold hard fact at the end of the day is that cash coming in must exceed cash going out of the business.  In other words, you cannot keep taking money out of the bank without putting anything in.  I know a bit about that, as a small businessman.  I am in business and can testify to the truth of that statement.  I am a little concerned that some of those who advocate co-operative development are influenced more by woolly idealism than by the hard realities <Col N="1919" /> of daily business.  If all those involved with co-operatives approach the subject in a practical and businesslike way, we will have a useful addition to the economy.</P>
    <P>Finally, I appeal to the Minister for the second time.  I appealed to the Leader of the House and I was promised that a committee on small business would be set up.  When the Government set up about six committees I questioned Senator Lanigan and he promised that this committee would follow on the others.  The Joint Committee on Small Businesses has doubtedly proved to be the best of all the committees, because it issued more reports than all the other committees combined.  I would like to see that committee re-established.  I know the Minister has other things on his plate at present but I ask him to take note of it and do what he can in his own good time to help to re-establish this committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to compliment the joint committee on their comprehensive report on the Development and Management of Small Business Co-operatives.  Ireland has a long established co-operative movement.  We have a highly developed system of agricultural co-operatives which are now, in fact, big business.  In the industrial and services sector, however, as the Minister has pointed out in his opening statement, co-ops are not nearly as well developed, and they are viewed as a minor form of organisation compared with the public sector or with the more popular capitalist forms of organisation in the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given our very serious unemployment problem and the urgent need to create more jobs, all forms of job creating activity must be examined and, as necessary, promoted.  In this context, various types of co-operatives are indeed deserving of attention.  The Minister in his opening speech, which was both stimulating and comprehensive, refers to the recent growth of small business co-ops.  I think it is very interesting to note that there are <Col N="1920" /> some 60 trading co-operatives employing almost 600 people at this time.</P>
    <P>The high level of unemployment to which I have already referred is acting as a stimulus to some unemployed people to find a means of getting a job in their own localities.  This springs from a desire for self help as opposed to relying on dole or other forms of State support and it is certainly to be welcomed.  It is also worthy of note that a similar response from the unemployed is evident in European and other countries.  The State has a role in supporting these initiatives.  It is important, however, that State help should not supplant self help.  For too long in this country there has been over reliance on the State and its various agencies for financial assistance and a whole range of other supports.  Co-operatives can be helped and, indeed, should be helped in certain respects, for example by State supported specialised advice and training.</P>
    <P>I welcome, therefore, the decision of the IDA to appoint an officer with overall responsibility for the development and promotion of co-operatives.  The competition for international mobile investment is extremely keen and, one might add, in short supply for some time past. We need, therefore &mdash; and I am glad to see the IDA have a role in this &mdash; to focus more sharply and more urgently on the creation of jobs from indigenous sources. The development of co-operatives locally based and staffed normally by local people provides an excellent example of what we need to achieve in present circumstances. Not alone that, but the creation of jobs through co-operatives enhances the prospects of making local communities more viable both socially and economically.</P>
    <P>It is only right and proper that in the interests of developing strong co-operatives, the IDA will set certain conditions for grant-aided enterprises.  That leads me, of course to the management of co-operatives. The conditions laid down by the IDA for grant-aid will relate to matters like professional and experienced management of the co-ops, in-company <Col N="1921" /> training and the appointment of experienced local directors to co-operative management committees.  This focus through the IDA officer will lead to a better understanding of the knowledge and skills required for the running of a co-op along business lines.  The quality of management, as Senator Daly has pointed out, is critical to all forms of organisation.</P>
    <P>In the case of co-ops it is particularly important that executive management who run the business on a day-to-day basis should conduct their duties separate from the democratic policy making structure. In other words, the executive management must be allowed to carry out the running of the business within broad policy, but without unnecessary obstruction by the co-op members.  Education and training can contribute to an appreciation and understanding of this requirement. For co-operatives to succeed, well trained managers must be available with the freedom to carry out their managerial functions.</P>
    <P>In the course of this brief contribution, I want to focus for a little while on worker co-operatives.  This type of co-operative holds out considerable promise.  We already have examples, as the Minister pointed out, of such co-operatives in furniture, clothing, footwear and pottery and in the services sector in, for example, videos and catering.  Trade unions are committed to the co-operative concept. Indeed, they are now taking a closer look at worker co-operatives as a means of responding to their declining membership. A few statistics will help to illustrate the pressure on trade unions at the present time.  These statistics are drawn from a research project on trade union membership which is under way in my own Department at UCD.</P>
    <P>In 1980, for example, some 55 per cent of the workforce were trade union members.  By 1985 this percentage had dropped to 46 per cent.  This 9 per cent drop in membership between 1980 and 1985, which amounts to a loss of 51,000 members, is clearly a source of ongoing concern to the trade union movement. The decline in membership is due to a <Col N="1922" /> variety of factors including, unemployment, new technology, the decline in traditional trade union industrial strongholds, the move to temporary employees and contracting out arrangements.  Like many other countries there has been a move in this country from industrial employment to service industries, where units are smaller and there is no substantial trade union tradition.</P>
    <P>In fact, not only in Ireland but in many other countries there is a deindustrialisation taking place in terms of the numbers actually employed in industry. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions published a report on worker co-operatives in November 1985.  Another very interesting response to declining trade union membership and unemployment was made, as the joint committee point out in their report, by the Federated Workers' Union of Ireland.  From January 1986 this union levied 10p per week on each member for a three year period &ldquo;to make available to the union a fund to assist the objectives of the union with particular regard to building a link to its unemployed members&rdquo;.  The levy is projected to raise £750,000 over three years and the fund will make grants, provide loans and take shares in the enterprises it supports.</P>
    <P>Worker co-operatives are an interesting concept and hold out considerable potential.  Often a worker co-operative is formed after the failure of an enterprise in which the members formerly worked as employees.  These former employees become shareholders under the co-operative arrangement but again, as the Minister has underlined, they have difficulty in appreciating that they are both workers and shareholders in the co-operative and they are not in the former boss-subordinate or &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; situation.  This adjustment in attitude can obviously be helped by continuing educational programmes for all involved.</P>
    <P>The prospects for a conflict-free work situation are enhanced in the case of worker co-ops.  Since the workers are also the owners, the progress and success of the worker co-operatives is of immediate relevance to those involved.  They are key <Col N="1923" /> stakeholders and this should provide the necessary incentive for success.  The example of the Dublin Milk Producers who formed a co-operative into Premier Dairies represents an interesting example of self-regulation.  They imposed a sanction, a 28 per cent price cut, on members who supplied milk that was not up to the required standard.  This had the effect of drastically reducing the bacterial level in the milk, making it cleaner.  Co-operatives can exercise a type of authority over their members to reach higher standards than perhaps is possible in the normal form of industrial organisation.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that the promotion and establishment of strong co-operatives which will not need successive injections of State aid is highly desirable. I would point out that such co-operatives need not be large in order to meet the criteria the Minister has in mind.  In Germany, for example, small co-operatives act as suppliers to larger co-operatives. Such an arrangement is probably feasible in Ireland, and indeed I might refer to a parallel in the industrial sector here in this country, a number of former employees of multinational subsidiaries in Ireland have now set up their own indigenous companies and act as suppliers to the larger multinational subsidiaries which were formerly their employers.  This linkage between the smaller unit and the larger unit is probably feasible in the co-op context as well.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude this brief contribution by making a point that affects all small businesses, including small co-operatives. The plethora of forms and the volume of official paperwork which afflict small businesses, who are trying to employ people, constitute a serious disincentive. Could I make a plea to the Minister to use his good offices to reduce and simplify the volume of paperwork that is swamping small businesses?  This debate is primarily concerned with means of promoting job creation through small co-operatives. The Minister could help and I hope he will contribute to a process to achieve this objective by reducing red <Col N="1924" /> tape where at all possible thereby releasing valuable time to people engaged in small business generally, so that they can get on with their important central work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyMulroy" hpid="Mr. Mulroy Mr. Mulroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy indeed to have an opportunity to express some views on this report.  As a businessman involved in running a small business, I recognise the great importance and the great contribution of such a study on small businesses.  It will help in no small way in the management and the running of small businesses.  In the first instance, I congratulate the committee on their work.  To say it is timely and badly needed is an understatement.  Any effort which can be made by any group in these difficult times for our country is important.</P>
      <P>Indeed, if one reads the opening pages of the sixth report in which is recorded the brief under which the joint committee worked, one, could say here is a perscription for examination and activity of many matters applying not just to the small business co-operatives, but to many wider and more important aspects of the need for the better economic development and management of our country. The committee's brief talks about the financing of small businesses, the provision of finance for innovation, research and development, export financing and many other things.  They are relevant, of course, not only to small businesses, as I have said, but to a far wider sphere of economic activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In former times and, indeed, not so long ago, one heard frequently that, with one or two exceptions, the co-operative movement was not successful in Ireland. The exceptions relate to the agricultural industry where for many generations there has been a very effective co-operative movement in the milk sector. However, more recent developments as set out in this report show that housing co-operatives and other co-operatives, given the need and the will, have a possibility for development as successful co-operative enterprises.  As the Minister <Col N="1925" /> said, this is recognised in the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> In paragraph 33 of the programme the Government state:</P>
    <P>The Government will, therefore, request FÁS to consider urgently proposals for the establishment of a Co-operative Development Council.  The Minister for Labour is, at present, considering plans for a pilot operation that would help emerging co-operative businesses with specialised advice in advance of the establishment of FÁS.</P>
    <P>That, I think, is very satisfactory because it recognises that at present, with low economic activity in many sectors and very high unemployment, all possible avenues to improve our economic situation must be explored and action taken where there are reasonable possibilities of success.</P>
    <P>As with all business enterprises, whether they be private or co-operative, success and failure will depend on a number of basic things.  There must first of all be a prospect of success in the business venture that is being undertaken. There must be a sufficiency of resources available to the company to enable it to get over the initial period while the business is being built up and before profits begin to flow back.  There must, above all, be a commitment to making the business a success.  Finally, in the whole management and worker approach to the business there must be a realisation that only the best will do and that failure to attain these necessary requirements will result only in the failure of the business.  I do not wish to sound offputting; I do not wish to sound pessimistic. I simply want to emphasise that a hard business sense is as necessary in a co-operative as it is in private business.</P>
    <P>In making these points I am simply repeating, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, what has been said in the sixth report with which we are dealing.  The report puts the position very favourably when it states that:</P>
    <P>It can be said, on the basis of evidence <Col N="1926" /> from some European countries, that properly funded and well managed small co-operatives can be an important extra dimension in both job and wealth creation.</P>
    <P>This is very encouraging, and further on in the report there are accounts of very successful co-operatives in other European countries.  The co-operative venture at Mondragon in Spain was the most outstanding example we have had in recent times of co-operative success.  I am not suggesting that success of this kind can be easily achieved.  I would not like to fall into the trap of picking one highly successful operation and asking why this cannot be repeated whenever the need arises.  I refer to this successful venture because, while great achievements are not always possible, at least they show what can be done given the right circumstances and, above all, the right attitude of mind on the part of the people involved.</P>
    <P>I started by referring to page 7 of the report where mention was made of the evidence of successful co-operatives in Europe but it is also necessary to move on to page 8 where there is a very firm statement by the committee and I quote:</P>
    <P>We remain to be convinced, in the absence of data with regard to track record or failure rate, that co-operatives can generally be as successful as private small firms.</P>
    <P>This is a firm statement.  It could, perhaps, be criticised for being a statement which to some extent makes a judgment in advance of all the evidence being produced. I can quite understand the statement because we have had unfortunately, too much evidence of firms, some co-operatives and some not, in the co-operative sector which for one reason or another have not been successful. That is not to say, however, that given the proper attitude and the proper circumstances and, above all, a realistic approach a co-operative cannot be a success. If a co-operative founded on a realistic assessment of the business situation, <Col N="1927" /> and provided there is sound management and acceptance by all members of the co-operative from the manager down to the most junior worker, understands what membership of a co-operative means, then success is possible.</P>
    <P>I stress from manager down to the most junior worker because one of the great problems we have had in Irish industry over many years is the &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; situation.  I do not wish to start a debate here as to why industrial disputes have been so prominent in this country as they have been over many years.  I am not proposing to lay the blame at the door of anybody but I believe many people would agree with me that these disputes, for whatever reason, have done far more damage than good to everybody concerned. At least within a co-operative business structure and given the right attitude of mind by everybody involved the &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; situation should not arise. This in itself is not a recipe for success overall.  At least such an attitude would remove what has been for many people in industry, employers and workers alike, a continuous deterrent to progress in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The report deals with export experience. Senator Hillery stated that one of the greatest problems facing the success of small businesses is all the unnecessary paperwork that the small businessman has to cope with.  The future role of the small business co-operative will be very important in the continued creation of new jobs in the industrial sector.  Since 1980 the numbers directly employed in the manufacturing industry have declined.  Job losses have outpaced new job creation.  This raises fundamental questions about the overall effectiveness of our industrial policy.  However, the review of industrial performance published recently by the Department of Industry and Commerce indicates that, while all other sized categories of firms lost more than 40,000 jobs in that period, the small industrial sector, defined by the IDA as employing up to 50 people, was the only one to show a net increase even though it was marginal.  What is most <Col N="1928" /> significant, however, is that the entire increase is attributable to those firms with fewer than 20 employees.  That report has identified the potential strength in the industrial sector and is one on which we must build.</P>
    <P>While these results have to be welcomed we must get much more in terms of output and employment growth from this sector.  That report indicates that the growth is confined mainly to new businesses starting up.  The worrying feature is that the new firms created are not continuing to grow.  This points to the need for a partial redirection of State assistance away from the start-up phase to providing help of a more directly operational nature.</P>
    <P>The operational constraints often arise for Irish industry simply because of the size of the domestic market.  This means that expansion minded firms have got to export at a much earlier stage than similar firms in larger economies.  Given the high overheads of moving into markets such as distribution, market research, advertising and the establishment of a sales team abroad, this can accentuate the need for finance at a time when it is most scarce.</P>
    <P>CTT marketing schemes and programmes were designed to address this problem but the indications are that the response of indigenous companies to these initiatives has been unsuccessful.  I would like to speak briefly on my own experience as regards marketing.  I believe that the co-operative movement is not active enough in marketing its products abroad.  CTT are providing a very important service by the way of travel grants and helping to arrange necessary visas to visit foreign countries.  In my own case we could not have penetrated the Middle East market, an area where we have been very successful, without support from CTT and other State bodies. This support should be continued in particular in the co-operative area.</P>
    <P>Marketing abroad is difficult but it can be achieved.  For example, the working week in the Middle East countries is a six day week from from Saturday to Thursday; rest day, the Moslem holy day, is <Col N="1929" /> Friday.  With careful planning the company executive can get a full day's work at home on a Friday, fly out from Dublin on a Friday evening, arrive early on a Saturday morning and start marketing straightaway because that is the beginning of the week in the Middle East markets. It is possible, if you plan your trip to coincide with a bank holiday weekend in Ireland, to depart from Dublin on a Friday evening and return the following Thursday week and achieve nine full days marketing at the expense or loss of four working days at home.  There are problems in the Middle East.  The climate is an alien climate with temperatures ranging up to 52 degrees centigrade and the relative humidity is between 35 and 95 per cent.</P>
    <P>There are advantages in trading with these countries in so far as all business is done on a credit basis.  If you fill in all the necessary documentation, which is very onerous, you can negotiate the matter of credit within 21 working days which can give the company a very good cash flow. More support should be given to small co-operatives starting up to exploit these lucrative markets.  In a small industry, whether it is in the agricultural or industrial sector, the co-operatives must be given support and new technology because many companies go to these distant markets simply because they are not competitive enough to sell in the more accessible UK and European markets. They go to far distant places because people are interested.  We must give our small industries technology and the most modern machinery to enable them to manufacture a high quality, competitive priced product which will sell on the more accessible European market which has been opened up by the ratification of the Single European Act.  It is a market in excess of 320 million people and the possibilities in these areas are enormous.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report.  It is a very useful basis for further discussion.  It is most useful in the light of the Government's decision to promote the establishment of workers' co-operatives.  I wish all the efforts to set up such co-operatives well, but I would like to stress the hard facts <Col N="1930" /> of business life whether privately owned or a co-operative.  Idealism and the will to do good are great things and they have been responsible for many great developments in this country and elsewhere in the past.  However, by themselves they are not good enough.  While they must be there for real progress we must never forget that there is no substitute for good management and commitment to work.  You will not last very long in the business world unless you have identified your market and then supplied it with good quality articles, the supply of which you can guarantee whenever they are needed and at a price which will return to you the cost of your raw material, wages and the necessary provision for replacement of plant and equipment.</P>
    <P>I studied the report and the very helpful statement by the Minister of State with responsibility for Trade and Marketing, at the end of his speech where he said:</P>
    <P>It is in all our interests that the co-operative movement should develop as a genuine third force in employment maintenance and creation.</P>
    <P>The Minister put his finger on the problem when he went on to say:</P>
    <P>The fulfilment of this objective demands the promotion and establishment of strong, viable co-operatives which will not need successive injections of State aid.</P>
    <P>Any business whether private or co-operative which is in need of successive injections of State aid is, in my view, a waste of taxpayers' money and also a threat to the viability of competing firms which, without State aid, are endeavouring to survive in difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to congratulate all of the people involved in compiling this report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions. This is not a Government matter so it is not necessary that I respond <Col N="1931" /> to it but I should like to comment briefly on a number of the points made because Senators will expect that.</P>
      <P>In regard to the report I refer Senators to my opening address which covered the general Government reaction to it.  I will ensure that the Government are fully aware of all of the points made by Senators today.  There are a few things I want to say in the few minutes available to me on some of the points which have been made.  I appreciate the sense of realism which most Senators showed. That realism is very well expressed on pages 8 and 9 of the report.  I will quote from page 8:</P>
      <P>The formation of a co-operative can often be a well intentioned but poorly defined response to a local unemployment situation.  The lack of clear objectives, an understanding of the skills of the level of commitment required and the necessary organisational skills, often result in no tangible achievements and may in the end actually add to frustration within a community.</P>
      <P>It goes on to say:</P>
      <P>The justification must be that a proposed co-operative has a good prospect of success by being fully capable of remunerating the main factors of production, particularly capital and labour.</P>
      <P>There is a sentence here which I heartily endorse.  It says:</P>
      <P>There is a danger that the main motivation behind a decision to establish a co-operative may be one of idealism or of a simplistic notion of pure democracy within the workplace.  A business formed on this basis will almost inevitably fail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice the same trends going through the contributions of all the Senators.  It is a trend I should highlight.  If a business is a bad business, whether it is run by a co-operative, a limited company, a sole trader or a multinational it still remains a bad business.  The important thing I <Col N="1932" /> should like to underline is that it is the fundamentals of the business that are important as to whether that business has a chance of succeeding, not so much the corporate structure.  If corporate structures alone made successful businesses we would have a very easy solution to our unemployment problem which would be to simply change the corporate structures. In talking about co-operatives it is important that we consider questions such as: Is there a business there?  Is there a market there?  Is there a product?  If the co-op happens to be the best way to organise that, then so be it, but there are other forms of organisation which one can look at.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly suggested that credit unions should be asked to get involved in the financing of small businesses.  I appreciate that suggestion but I would be slow to ask the credit union movement to extend itself into being financers of business for all sorts of reasons which I think the Senator would agree with if he reflected on it.  I am prepared to ask the Credit Union Advisory Committee, which was set up specifically to advise me in relation to credit unions, to examine this suggestion to see whether there is anything they could do or if there is any role they could follow on that.  We must be careful about pushing credit unions into financing businesses because that is not their role at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>I was asked also about the Joint Committee on Small Businesses.  All I can say on that at the moment is that I will certainly ensure that the Government are aware of Senators' demands and requests in that regard.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Mulroy when he says that co-ops must be businesslike.  I think I made that point earlier.  A co-op has to be run as a professional business, or it is not there at all.  Senator Hillery talked quite rightly about the plethora of papers involved in small companies.  The Minister, Deputy Reynolds, has discussed this matter already with the small business associations and we are very concerned about it.  I had occasion last week to launch a new export document <Col N="1933" /> called the SAD &mdash; the Single Administrative Document &mdash; which is an attempt to replace a number of export documents with one single document.  In my work with the internal market council of the ECI notice increasingly that all of the export and import documentation is constantly being reduced.  That is a step in the right direction.  Once that is launched it will make the lives of exporters much easier as a lot of the documentation is in the small business area.  I know the Senator is also thinking about the taxation and statistics areas. We are very conscious of that and we will try to make some progress on it.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to the need for planning and the need for better marketing.  I have always maintained, and I repeat again, that if you do not have a market you do not have a business. In the Office of Trade and Marketing we have been establishing trading houses. There is a private sector service company and provided it buys Irish manufactured goods and exports them, it will avail of the 10 per cent tax rate and also the business expansion scheme.  I hope this will be a major boost to small companies in that they will be able to sell to a trading house as a first step towards exporting.  I hope to have these trading houses up and running in the new year.  We have run into some EC difficulties with them but I hope we can resolve those very quickly.</P>
    <P>A second scheme which I would recommend to small businesses is the scheme which I have agreed with the marketing institute whereby the directors of large companies will make themselves personally available to work with small companies and help those small companies over their business problems generally and not just with their marketing problems.  I am glad to say that the marketing institute have told me they have already had 30 or 40 inquiries.  They are beginning to make those marriages between directors in large companies and directors in small companies so that they can learn from each other.  That scheme is working well.</P>
    <P>Senators will also be aware that we have now told the State organisation, <Col N="1934" /> CTT, to operate increasingly on a payment by results basis.  That means they will share in the success or the failure of individual companies.  That will greatly increase the determination of both the company and CTT to earn some export revenue because by doing so they will earn some funds.</P>
    <P>In general, I thank Senators for their very fine contributions.  Some Senators mentioned the question of costs.  One area in which I have been trying to get costs down is in the area of insurance because I know this is a major cost to small businesses.  Senators will be aware that the Government have announced their intention to bring in a courts Bill which will abolish juries, in certain cases, and will help to reduce insurance costs. Senators will also be aware that, in regard to the legal costs involved in insurance cases, which lead to high claims, there are discussions going on with the Bar Council and the Government and it is hoped in a very short time to reduce the element of legal involvement in insurance cases.  I am very hopeful of a satisfactory outcome in that area.  Also, in the safety area a number of moves are being made to reduce insurance costs.  All in all I expect insurance costs to stabilise next year, and indeed, to be pushed downwards. That is one major cost factor to industry, to small business and to small co-operatives and it will be a great help if this happens.</P>
    <P>Senators will also be aware that the Minister for Energy has been trying to push energy costs down for small companies and, indeed, for all companies. The Minister for Transport has been endeavouring to get access costs to and from this island reduced so that the key costs to small businesses &mdash; be they energy, transport, insurance or, indeed, interest rates which we know are being reduced &mdash; are kept down and pushed down continually and small business can be competitive.  I am hopeful that the trading house scheme, when introduced, will ensure that small businesses can get into the exporting business at a very early stage without having to go through the years of preparation which they have had <Col N="1935" /> to do up to now.</P>
    <P>A piece of advice I would like to offer to small businesses is that the bulk of small businesses &mdash; this is true for co-operatives also &mdash; tend to be over-geared. Most of them start out in life with perhaps an IDA grant, but certainly with a loan from a bank, probably some of the mother-in-law's money, probably the house is mortgaged, but in general they start out owing a lot of money.  A company does not really have a chance when it starts in that way and good ideas are stillborn because the amount of capital available to get that company from phase one to phase two is totally under-estimated. This perhaps, has something to do with our history in that we seem to regard ownership of businesses as being absolutely important and essential.  That is not a philosophy that other nations worry about.</P>
    <P>In the United States, for example, the average entrepreneur starting up a business will write a business plan and look for 90 per cent or 95 per cent of the money.  He or she will settle for 5 per cent or 10 per cent.  They will raise the equity to invest in the idea.  If you cannot get the equity you must ask if it was a good idea in the first place.  While people might say it is a good idea they are obviously not prepared to put their money into it which is the final test.  My strong advice to Irish businesses is not to worry about the ownership of companies but please do worry about how they are capitalised and how much equity can be put into them.</P>
    <P>One of our most successful companies, which is often put forward as the jewel in the crown is Guinness Peat Aviation. I am aware it is public information and it has been published many times &mdash; that the founder of that company who is generally regarded as the owner owns, I think, about 8 per cent of the company. That in no way diminishes the authority that the founder or the &ldquo;would be owner&rdquo; has over the company.  They have used the other 92 per cent to fund and run the company.  Most of the companies that collapse do so in the end when the debt, <Col N="1936" /> the PAYE, and so on, runs up and they run out of cash.  Owners and entrepreneurs can maintain control of their companies by individual contracts, by service contracts and by all sorts of other legal devices.  Therefore, my strongest advice to start-up companies and, indeed, to co-ops is not to get over geared in the early days, not to get into heavy borrowing, but to go out and raise some equity.  If they cannot raise the equity then they must consider whether it was such a good business idea in the first place.  I know that is cold and is calculating but it is absolutely true.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Irish Goods Council have told me that of the £9 billion worth of goods which we imported last year £1 billion could be immediately manufactured in this country.  That is a £1 billion market that we do not have to go abroad to find.  It is here on our doorsteps because large companies are importing their supplies.  I should like to say again to Irish industry that there is a £1 billion market here that is immediately manufacturable and if you can put the package together the Irish Goods Council want to talk to you.  Of the £9 billion we import, £1 billion is immediately substitutable. They are basically the inputs of the major companies.</P>
    <P>I welcome this report in a sense of realism.  A good business idea has to have a market, capital and the determination of some person behind it to make it succeed.  There are about 600 people employed in these trading co-operatives that we are talking about here.  Quite frankly, I only see scope for major growth provided the fundamentals of every business are applied to it.  If it is just an idealistic approach to solving a particular problem, then I would not be overenthusiastic about it in itself.  If it is based on solid business principles, I see no reason why it cannot become, as I said at the outset, a third force.</P>
    <P>I thank the committee for producing this report.  I thank the House for their comments.  I hope the response which <Col N="1937" /> I have made to the debate is of some assistance to Senators.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Title>Developments in European Communities: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of developments in the European Communities since January, 1986.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator W. Ryan)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to congratulate the Tánaiste on his very full and interesting report on the last occasion on which we discussed this matter.  Secondly, I want to refer very briefly to something that is really peripheral to the report, or certainly out of the mainstream of the report, as such.  I refer to a European drugs exhibition which was a &ldquo;first&rdquo; for Dublin and billed as such.  It was organised by the Vice-President of the European Parliament Committee of Inquiry, Mrs. Eileen Lemass, MEP, and was held in Dublin in the Exhibition Hall in the Bank of Ireland, Baggot Street, from 3 to 13 November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The leaflet which was circulated in relation to this exhibition is very comprehensive. It sets out the problem in relation to drugs and, indeed, in relation to the AIDS problem as well.  It specified what we could do and what the exhibition hoped to achieve.  In relation to drug abuse and the facts, it gave very startling information.  It said that within the Community 1,500,000 people &mdash; mostly young people &mdash; use heroin.  A far greater number take soft drugs.  The use of the no less dangerous cocaine which has already taken hold on the other side of the Atlantic is becoming more widespread. Addicts driven by the need to obtain the money to buy drugs &mdash; around £1,500 a month &mdash; commit half the crimes reported in the 12 member states.  The drugs problem is now worldwide.  The criminal activities which cover the whole <Col N="1938" /> production and distribution cycle bring in an income of $300 billion all over the world.</P>
    <P>The reason I am referring to this is that, unfortunately, I believe this exhibition was not the success that it could have been and, in my view, that it should have been.  I understand that the literature was circulated to schools.  The exhibition did not get the kind of coverage in the national press that one would expect. There was one general article and a picture in one of the daily papers.  I believe that the difficulty about getting coverage was in relation to the unfortunate incident of the kidnapping of Mr. O'Grady. It is a pity that such an important exhibition should, to some extent, be a failure.</P>
    <P>I would hope that this exhibition could be taken up in other parts of the country and, possibly, even in this capital city. It was very important.  At present it is something we can relate to very much. Indeed, I myself was not personally aware of this exhibition until after the event.  I am sure many other people are in the same position.  I appeal to those who can reorganise it to do so.  Perhaps the Tánaiste would investigate whether it would be possible to have this important exhibition re-run.</P>
    <P>I also want to thank members of the European Parliament.  They do a very good job.  I want to pay a particular compliment to my very good friend.  Mr. Jim Fitzsimons, MEP, who is on the Energy Research and Technology Committee. He is also a substitute on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection Committee.  There is a lot of activity in this area and a substantial amount of money as well.  The research has helped Irish universities, the IIRS and the National Board for Science and Technology.  The overall provision was 6,480 million ECUs.  The framework programme which was agreed in 1983 for the 1984-87 period had an expected commitment of £27.9 million for Ireland, which was a very considerable amount.</P>
    <P>While we are debating this matter in the House it is very difficult to decide what exactly to refer to because there <Col N="1939" /> are so many publications and so much literature.  One could go on for a very long time.  Clearly, there is no point in wasting time in a general coverage of that kind.  We will have to pick and choose the areas that more or less appeal to us. This is one that particularly appeals to me.  Like many other Members of the House, I have been asked to make representations with regard to research and with regard to different programmes.  I have been unsuccessful.  It is not difficult to help in that area, but I think that there is a great necessity for more finance.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, an island country, we could do more research on wave power, wind power and solar energy.  Those are the three areas on which we could spend more money.  All of us in this House have been approached at different periods about these three areas.  We know that there is quite a considerable amount of research going on into wave power.  As I say, being an island surrounded by seas and by an ocean, there must be great scope in this area.  With regard to wind power I recall that during the last World War wind chargers were quite common around the countryside.  As a matter of fact, in my own area one used at that period was taken out of use only a few short years ago.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, harnessing of wind power, by and large, has not been a successful development.  With the expertise available for research and with the experience we have had over a long period of years, it should be possible to achieve worthwhile results in this area if sufficient funds area available.  Solar energy has the same problem.  Some short few years ago it was possible to buy equipment in Dublin to heat single houses through solar energy.  It seemed a rather cheap option but it never became popular. At present I do not think it is possible to go into any builders' providers or any store in Dublin and buy equipment of that kind.  That is unfortunate.  It is one that particularly affects this country. More research could be done.  Consequently, even though we have spent over that four year period the equivalent of <Col N="1940" /> almost £30 million specifically in relation to those areas, perhaps more funds could be forthcoming.  We know, of course, that the UK held out against that programme for five years, but it was finally agreed.</P>
    <P>In relation to the EC there has been a tendency consistently over a long period of years in the media and by commentators to refer to Ireland as having the begging bowl syndrome or the béal bocht.  That is something with which I disagree.  I saw yesterday in <i>The Irish Times</i> that the Taoiseach is making arrangements to ensure that we benefit in the areas where help is necessary.  I agree with this. Mr. John Hume, in the report to which Senator Hogan referred at some length and from which I will quote one short paragraph, refers to the point I am trying to make, that Ireland could have made greater strides.  It states:</P>
    <P>The European Parliament regrets that, in the fourteen years since the accession of Ireland to the EC the Community has not done more to promote the necessary transformations in the economy of Ireland, one of its smallest and least prosperous members in whose economy and national budget Community receipts have some influence; notes that disparities in prosperity between Ireland and more prosperous regions of the Community have widened rather than narrowed, and considers that this reveals starkly that the Community's structural policies have not attained their objectives; believes that this failure results from insufficient finance and shortcomings in the operation of the Community's structural funds, aggravated by inadequate co-operation and exchange of information between Member States regarding strategies for economic recovery and development.</P>
    <P>Money spent in Ireland to develop this country, to develop our road network for example, not alone will benefit the people of this country but will also benefit the EC by reason of the fact that transportation will be assisted and, consequently, costs will be reduced.  There is a <Col N="1941" /> duty on anyone who is in a position to make representations for more funds for this country to do so and to see that we benefit to the extent that we should.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act was mentioned as a very important development during the period under consideration.  I hope that this will be a benefit as it was supposed to be and that we will achieve the results that we expected before this was passed.  One of the first great developments in the period under consideration was the accession of Spain and Portugal to the EC.  This added, as Members have already stated, an additional 50 million people to the market opened for this country.  From a Community report for January 1986 I would like to quote a very short paragraph to make a point which I think is of some importance.  It is as follows:</P>
    <P>Please remember that what is called the European Economic Community is basically a supra-national infrastructure designed to facilitate and encourage trade between the member states themselves and between the European Community as a whole and all other third countries in the world. Therefore, the use Ireland makes of Community expansion is, at the end of the day, a matter for the Irish entrepreneur whether he &mdash; or she &mdash; is in industry, agri-business or services.  It is in his &mdash; or her &mdash; hands to take this new opportunity to further promote Ireland's economic growth with a resultant opportunity to increase employment in this country.</P>
    <P>I wonder if we have availed of the additional market to the extent that we could and should.  That paragraph sets the problem in perspective.  There are many small firms and small businesses who, perhaps, would not be in a position to avail to the extent possible of that additional market of 50 million people. In a debate of this kind on a motion it is difficult, or maybe pointless, to make a plea.  In so far as it is of any worth, I appeal to the Tánaiste to be very conscious <Col N="1942" /> of the difficulties of the small &mdash; and I mean the very small &mdash; firms.</P>
    <P>Some of the literature we have received on developments in the EC speaks of the new poor and the new faces of poverty.  This is an important dimension. It is set out fairly clearly in the European File 4/87 February 1987.  It is not necessary for me to go into it in detail, but it differentiates between the traditional poverty which affects many of the under-developed European areas &mdash; an under class composed mostly of unskilled workers, emigrants and people in vulnerable categories &mdash; and the new poor.  Their poverty is born out of the recession and the economic and social changes whereby people have lost their employment.  This caused sudden alterations in the standard of living they were used to.  We have those two areas.  I am not too sure in what way the EC on the ground, in a tangible way, helps those people.</P>
    <P>We have heard about direct aid to farmers which is contemplated in the CAP programme.  This is something we would all welcome.  Food stockpiling created many problems of cost.  There were many complaints about the stockpiling.  I am not too sure how exactly the direct aid will work.  It seems that at this point in time the EC may not be too clear on the way it will work.  Appeals were made before in this House with regard to areas where it would be possible to help farmers in a direct way, for example, lands that might be considered to be in need of reclamation.  It has been pointed out many times that there are places and countries in the world where fortunes are spent to create conditions which are suitable for wildlife, flora and fauna, shooting and fishing.  It seems that in the general context of land requirements it would be possible to have surveys carried out in that whole area in relation to wildlife. Farmers might be compensated for that type of land as if they reclaimed it to harvest crops.  This is an area that could be looked at.  It would affect many people in the country.</P>
    <P>The report by Mr. John Hume was referred to at some length by Senator <Col N="1943" /> Hogan.  I will not refer to it in any detail except to say that it is my understanding that an integrated approach is required for the whole country based on the nine regions which are intended for development. This is set out very clearly in the report.  An integrated approach is the only approach.  At the same time, I have heard complaints by members of local authorities that they would like to be in a position to go to the EC independently to have their specific proposals funded.  I do not know how this would relate to this problem.  Local authorities would be in a better position to do so if they got greater autonomy and powers.  The problem at present is that they must go to the Government, make their case and take their place in the queue.  In the long run this is the proper approach.  There are members who feel strongly that they have schemes which, because of the present arrangements, do not get the priority which they deserve.</P>
    <P>There is a marked improvement in relations between the Soviet bloc and the EC.  This is very promising.  Delegations have already been named.  I hope more success will be achieved in this area.</P>
    <P>With regard to radioactive levels in food, a survey was conducted after the Chernobyl accident which has now ceased.  France and England had very high levels of radioactivity and the other ten countries of the EC had relatively low levels.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is comprehensively covered in the documentation which we have received.  The position is becoming progressively worse.  This is an area where there is a commitment but, unfortunately, the success we hoped for has not been forthcoming.  We can only hope that in the immediate future some improvement will become evident.</P>
    <P>The cross-Border situation was referred to also by Senator Hogan.  He mentioned the assistance in third level education.  This has helped many of our young people.  Hopefully, in the years to come it will assist many more.  From every point of view, it is a welcome <Col N="1944" /> development.  I hope we will achieve greater success in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes the very large lists of foreign made goods available in this country at competitive prices and re-emphasises the need to buy Irish to protect jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that there have been many <Col N="1945" /> campaigns to encourage the buying of Irish goods.  I am surprised that they have not been more successful.  Millions of pounds of imported goods are brought into the country annually, many of them of superior quality and most of them at very competitive prices.  The goods imported sometimes come from countries where less than a full and honest wage is paid.</P>
    <P>It is from that background that Irish manufacturers have to start to develop and compete.  As public representatives we have a major role to play.  We must never stop highlighting the importance of buying Irish in order to support industries at home and to provide jobs.</P>
    <P>I have examined areas where we are not competitive, where industry has not developed to the stage where it can compete with bigger companies based in England and elsewhere &mdash; confectionery, biscuits, chocolates, cosmetics, soaps, detergents, washing powders, polishes, flavourings, additives, colourings and a massive range of goods, where the industrial base is not developed enough and the market uptake within our country is not sufficient to allow the manufacturer a market base.  However, there are many areas where we can compete.  It is in these areas that we will have to work hardest.</P>
    <P>Clothing is as cheap in Ireland as anywhere in Europe and is of a very high standard.  The VAT is 10 per cent here on clothing and in the Six Counties and in Britain is a 15 per cent tax.  We should have a 5 per cent advantage here.  We have a good sound base in the whole of the garment industry that can compete with any country in the world except in countries where there is slave labour.  I believe we have to be on our guard and we have to highlight the practice of dumping into this country and relabelling and marketing under a name that gives an Irish flavour or a national ring to it.</P>
    <P>I was in Brussels recently and had time to look at the price of clothing in the shops there.  I was amazed to see socks selling at £10 and ties at £20 to £50, shirts up to £100 and suits up to £500 or £600, yet there is no outcry in that city about prices.  I honestly believe that for clothing, <Col N="1946" /> Ireland is as cheap as any country in Europe and whether you are wearing a Donegal tweed suit, a shirt made in one of our many factories in Donegal, or a lady's outfit from Nenagh Models in Castlefin in Donegal, you are wearing the best at a competitive price.</P>
    <P>We have got to say that loud and clear because there are people who never stop ramming down our throats the good value they are getting in Liverpool, Newry and Belfast.  Even yesterday on one of our chat shows, RTE were able to provide a reported interview about those who went on a shopping expedition to Swansea to highlight the value and advantages of travelling outside Ireland to spend their money.  I am happy to see that my colleague, Senator McGowan, has written to RTE in this regard.  He has taken them up on this point and has outlined many areas where we compete very favourably.</P>
    <P>I ask RTE who do they think is paying for their existence and whether they are damaging our economy by highlighting these people and asking them to go abroad.  It is an unfair advantage that the people selling goods in Swansea have free advertising on our national media and we do not get any free advertising on Northern Ireland radio or on BBC.  I have the feeling that the Irish Goods Council, manufacturers and business people here are often too complacent and they are not doing enough.  It is time they got off their collective bottoms and developed a more aggressive marketing plan for Irish manufactured goods.</P>
    <P>Everybody is talking about the food industry and what we should be doing to stop millions of pounds of unnecessary imports coming into the country.  I totally agree, but they have been talking for too long and very little positive action has been taken.  So far, we are relatively pollution free and we have a good environment here, ideal for the production of good clean healthy food.  Our creameries and our dairy products are well developed.  Meat and meat products are now being developed and I have no doubt that this will be a major advance and a major advantage to the country.</P>
    <P>A major area that we have to develop, <Col N="1947" /> in my opinion, is the fishing industry.  We saw the arrival today of a new processing boat.  It is unfortunate that this boat, together with the other boats in Killy-begs, will be tied up from now until the end of January because we have such small fish quotas.  I hope that our renegotiations in that area will lead us to getting better quotas.  I can see, off our shores, foreign fleets fishing huge quotas. The British have a quota greater than they can fish while we are left now with an industry languishing until next January. We have got to get our act together or we will soon have nobody working here in this industry.</P>
    <P>Tillage, too, is still a very low priority in Ireland.  Every conference, discussion and debate about agriculture lays the total emphasis on milk, dairy heads, calves, pigs, sheep, etc., but little attention is paid to tillage.  I attended a conference on agriculture recently and I observed that seven speakers out of 11 concentrated on milk and milk products. About two years ago we had serious flooding and consequential crop damage. The Minister for Agriculture of the day visited many farms and holdings but, unfortunately, was not in a position to give any direct assistance to the tillage farmers.</P>
    <P>Every scheme of assistance that has been introduced in this country for the past 20 years was based on headage payments, milk subsidies, calf and suckling schemes, sheep headage payments &mdash; anything but assessment for tillage. Nobody in this country involved in agriculture has considered the number of small farmers who have made a living down the years in tillage.  On the contrary, even the lime subsidy has been withdrawn, and the EC were paying 50 per cent of that grant.</P>
    <P>It surprises me that successive Ministers for Agriculture do not realise the vast number of people who have been driven onto the dole and driven off small farms who were dependent totally on tillage. If we do not have a tillage support policy very soon, we will have the total land population on the dole and a future <Col N="1948" /> generation of young people will be hard to force back onto the land again.</P>
    <P>There is considerable scope for replacing some inputs in developing our export trade.  It is claimed by the main buyers of fruit and vegetables that the Irish growers cannot supply the volume and quality they require on a consistent basis.  This is largely due to the fragmentation of the industry and the failure of the growers to form marketing groups.  Irish producers have, in general, failed to appreciate the changing trends of modern markets.</P>
    <P>Consumer requirements have developed to the stage where only top quality produce finds profitable sale.  The emphasis is now on the appearance of produce such as free from blemish, good size, packaging and other visually important features.  Emphasis is often placed on these more than on such features as taste and texture.  The major retail outlets have been highly conscious of the consumers' demands.  Supermarket chains compete with each other on the basis of the high quality of their fruit and vegetable departments.  To maintain high standards in this area, they find it more convenient in many cases to use imported produce which they can secure in the quality and quantities they require.  Often the cost of the produce is not a serious consideration in their purchases.</P>
    <P>It is vital that Irish growers should supply the quality required by the consumer and the volume required by the retailer.  This can only be achieved through co-ordinating marketing, with growers coming together in groups to supply the quality and volume required. The larger the group, the greater will be their marketing power and the ability to employ market specialists.  Any move in the direction of groups, no matter how small, will be welcome instead of the present unsatisfactory individualistic approach.</P>
    <P>The demand for high quality and variety of fruits and vegetables all the year around requires new technology in growing, harvesting, storage and marketing. The new variety capable of giving a high percentage of top grade uniform product <Col N="1949" /> must be used in place of the older varieties, and new techniques to extend the growing season, reduce disease and increase yields, must be adopted.</P>
    <P>There are many areas where we can replace imports.  We look at, for example, glasshouse fruit crops. Approximately £3½ million worth of tomato imports could be replaced if an extra 5,000 tonnes of tomatoes were produced in the early and late season.  This represents the output of 50 to 100 acres of greenhouse production.  Exports to the Six Counties and Scotland valued at £1 million could be achieved by an efficient industry.</P>
    <P>Another crop, cucumbers, valued at £200,000 and peppers valued at £500,000 could be grown from a further 15 acres of greenhouses.  Mushrooms are another area.  This export oriented industry is an example of what can be done.  A combination of good research advice and entrepreneurial skills has resulted in this unique Irish industry competing successfully on international markets.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of what I want to say is that it is necessary for us in this House to emphasise time and time again the importance of buying Irish.  If we do not then, very soon, we will be relying totally on imported goods.  We have to consider that when we are buying an item in a shop, irrespective of what it is, if it is a brand name, a labelled name, whether it be perfume, an Italian suit, or whatever, we may be buying something nice, or what we consider to be beautiful, but we are also buying away a job here in Ireland.  If we could divert some of the public money spent on exporting goods, we could perhaps increase our production and our employment figures.  If we do not, we will very soon drive people away from the country.</P>
    <P>Everybody has a part to play.  I do not believe we will cure all our ills in the Seanad this evening but we can demonstrate an awareness of what is happening. Hopefully we will encourage a few more people to move in the same direction and to think when they go to shop whether the article they are about to buy is manufactured by Irish hands or <Col N="1950" /> is a foreign import.  If it is a foreign import it simply is doing away with jobs in this country.  If it is Irish-made we have a chance to succeed and to survive.  That is the only way forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion and reserve my right to speak later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a particularly brief intervention in this debate because, frankly, while this is a motion with which no person in this country could disagree, it might be more appropriate if it were taken during Government time when all parties could, in effect, endorse these sentiments. However having said that, the motion is before us this evening.  I will speak very briefly.</P>
      <P>First of all, I do not think anybody can disagree with the sentiments behind this motion or with the purpose it sets out to achieve.  All of us have been scandalised in recent times by the lists published of goods which did not have to be imported to this country, which people, exercising the smallest amount of caution or the smallest amount of concern could have substituted with Irish-made goods, where any sort of thought on the part of the people purchasing would have made them realise that by purchasing Irish goods they were contributing to the safeguarding of jobs in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps we do not do enough in our schools at all levels first, second and third, especially in the early days, to drive home cause and effect, to show to our young people that whatever it is they are buying, be it sweets, toys or anything, by buying Irish they are contributing in a very practical way to the safeguarding of jobs and welfare in the country especially in a very beleagured time.  It is so basic that it hardly needs to be spelt out again this evening in one of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Nonetheless, if the message goes out that the Seanad endorses this proposal, it is a further reminder and an addition to the efforts of Córas Tráchtála, the Confederation of Irish Industry, the Irish Goods Council, the Buy Irish Campaign <Col N="1951" /> and all the various bodies and Chambers of Commerce around the country who are trying to get home this message that is particularly relevant in such a difficult time.</P>
    <P>It is very clear from past experience that appeals to patriotism and to nationalist self-interest will go only part of the way.  In many ways the most fundamental explanation for this is the most obvious one that, again in hard-pressed times, price will be the factor which will decide what the purchaser will buy.  The price will decide between the various goods on offer and I do not think any of us can blame people in hard-pressed times for allowing price to be the main factor.</P>
    <P>When we are appealing to Irish people to buy Irish, not just this Christmas, but to make it a consistent policy of theirs throughout the entire year, we must be very conscious of a number of other fairly obvious factors.  All of the points I am going to make probably are obvious and do not need to be dwelt on for too long.</P>
    <P>Obviously price is the key factor.  If we are not price competitive then our goods have no place being in the shops trying to seek support.  The second obvious factor is quality.  There are many disturbing stories told about quality control in many Irish factories, goods coming on to the market which are substandard, shoddy workmanship and the absence of any consumer consciousness on the part of manufacturers.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that in recent times we have improved a great deal.  While an earlier speaker was critical of the free publicity given on programmes like the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Hour&rdquo; to bargains available in Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales or Liverpool or wherever, it has to be said also that programmes like the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Hour&rdquo;, &ldquo;Day by Day&rdquo; and some of our newspapers have contributed greatly to an increase in consumer awareness so that consumers are more aware of their rights and one outgrowth of this has been a much better educated public. People simply will not accept second best, shoddy goods.  They will not accept from manufacturers anything other than <Col N="1952" /> courtesy and attention to detail, followup and so forth.</P>
    <P>All of us have many bad experiences of going out to buy Irish where the goods simply were not of the necessary quality. We cannot ask Irish people to put the emphasis on buying Irish if the goods are not of the proper quality nor should we afford Irish manufacturers the protection of this trade barrier to enable them to continue in ways which are mediocre, to produce goods which are second rate. Obviously, unless quality is consistent, unless companies pay attention to quality control, unless, companies have a strong sense of consumer awareness we can not even begin to compete for people's attention and for their money.</P>
    <P>In the same way the question of quality is essential in areas of agriculture.  The last speaker mentioned some of the possible areas in agricultural products where we can and should score.  As a country we have not always been the best at maintaining high standards of hygiene, we have not always been the best at ensuring that our vegetables are properly cleaned when they come on to the market, that they are properly graded, that they are of sufficient quality.</P>
    <P>Frequently, unfortunately, we can see from imported vegetables how well graded and cleaner they are, how consistent they are in quality.  There has in the past &mdash; I believe the attitude is changing &mdash; too often been a feeling among Irish producers of vegetables and of some foodstuffs that the home market is all right, anything will do for the home market and they can afford to take it for granted.  Unless this keen edge of competitiveness and a consciousness and awareness of standards becomes part and parcel of our productive area then we will not command the attention or the support of Irish people.</P>
    <P>The same thing is true of marketing. One of the areas which we neglected until very recently was the whole question of marketing.  Often, for factories, it was simple enough to produce what they thought was a good item.  Frequently it was a good item but they paid no attention whatsoever to the type of market it <Col N="1953" /> might be suitable for, who were the people who would buy it, were there people out there with an interest in the type of goods, were there people out there with the capacity to buy it, would a cheaper or a more expensive version of the same thing have been more appropriate? In recent times we have become much more conscious of the value of strategic marketing, of the value of matching goods to specific markets.  That is the second factor which needs to be looked at very carefully.</P>
    <P>The third area is the question of design. Many purchases take place after a very quick visual contact.  People see something, they like the look of it, if they are to decide between three or four of the same type of items, appearance will frequently be the deciding factor.  Up to about 20 years ago this country was probably visually illiterate.  We had no sense of design, we paid no attention to it, we did not think it was important.  We manufactured goods, we thought they were of good quality but we had no sense of the impact of design.  I believe there has been a revolution in that respect over the last 20 years.  With the work of the Kilkenny Design Centre based in the early stages on imported experts from Scandinavia especially, based on the experience and the work of Kilkenny, and indeed the work of the various design schools around the country.  We now have a population of extremely talented young designers who are bursting to put their talents at the disposal of Irish manufacturers. I hope that companies will take this lesson on board, that we now have good designers and we should use their talents to the full if we are to make an impact on the home and export markets.</P>
    <P>Those are the few observations I would like to make about this Motion.  It is a Motion which obviously will command the support of all parties in the House.  I hope it is noticed outside.  I hope it is one further step in the process of educating our people to appreciate the importance of supporting Irish goods and also in bringing home to manufacturers and to shopkeepers that they too have an enormous <Col N="1954" /> obligation, first of all, to display Irish goods to the best possible advantage and secondly to ensure that only Irish goods which are right in price, right in design and right in quality are offered, because bad goods can get Irish manufacturers a very bad name indeed.  One bad experience can turn people off a product for life so that the emphasis has to be constantly on consistency and on quality.</P>
    <P>We have made good strides in recent years in this regard but the figure mentioned by the Minister of State in an earlier debate today of £1 billion worth of goods imported at the present time which could very easily be substituted by Irish-made goods is an appalling indication of how far we still have to go.  It also offers us a great challenge because if the energies and attentions of our people, our manufacturers and our consumers are properly focussed an attack on this figure could represent enormous progress in providing the jobs and the degree of prosperity which we all desire.</P>
    <P>We live in an era of free competition, we are a member of the European Community that gives us access to one of the biggest markets in the world and also opens us up to competition from some of the most sophisticated and developed countries in the world.  We do not have the luxury today of building a barrier around this country, as we were able to do in the 1930s and the 1940s.  There is no one there to protect us.  There is very little we can do to protect ourselves but I believe that at this stage in our history we have the capacity to go out there and offer as good as is offered in any country in the world.  If we do that, the Irish people will not be found wanting in their response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words on this Motion.  We all hear of this question of lip service being paid to Irish goods and what we must do to create more jobs in the country.  I often think our media plays a very important part in demeaning Irish industries and demeaning <Col N="1955" /> Irish products and indeed in undermining the sense of national confidence that is required.  I notice that irrespective of the efforts of the Irish Goods Council and all the other agencies to advertise Irish goods and the quality of Irish goods, our media especially television are doing untold harm in this regard.  We have two TV channels and what we are not doing is utilising these in the best interest of our country.  I have not seen in recent years television cameras going into some of the factories in Ireland and showing the manufacturing process, showing the quality of our goods, showing the staff that is employed there, and I feel that is needed.  It would be putting our television channels to proper use if we could get that done.  Unfortunately, we have lost our sense of national confidence and we have developed an inferiority complex about Irish goods.  This is the barrier to the purchase of Irish goods, this inbuilt resistance, the idea that develops that they could not be as good as foreign products.</P>
      <P>I see in Britain today a great sense of patriotism about British products.  I heard today on the radio about the Chairman of the Society of Motor Traders in Britain saying that a new confidence has come to Britain about British cars.  The sale of British cars in Britain now far exceeds the sale of foreign cars for the first time. They promoted this and they talked about &ldquo;Britain, be British&rdquo;.  This is where they have scored tremendously and they have had a great effect on the whole economy.  There is a new sense of pride about British goods.  I would like to see a similar sense of pride here.</P>
      <P>That is what we need.  The quality is there; the price is there.  The price is good and quality is good.  We need a sense of pride about buying Irish goods.  Unless we develop this I do not think we will succeed in having Irish goods receive their proper share of the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I lived in America for four years and I was astounded at the sense of pride in the local community about the factories there.  I was buying something and they said: &ldquo;No, you cannot; you must buy <Col N="1956" /> the product that is manufactured in our area&rdquo;.  I would like to see that kind of pride developed here in every community. Let our cameras go in and see the factories that are manufacturing, see how it is done.  In that way we will come to realise our potential.  I do not think advertisements in national newspapers will achieve the effect of television programmes about jobs and about what that means.  That message has to be got across to the people.  I notice British multiples in Ireland selling exclusively British products. This is something we should look at, and tell people that they are buying British products exclusively.  This is not in the interest of our country.  We do not mind British multiples coming here and selling goods but they should be asked to supply a very high proportion of Irish goods in their retail outlets here.</P>
    <P>That is the important aspect of the Irish goods problem, overcoming this barrier that I see there.  Our clothes are good, the products are good all round; I see nothing wrong with them.  I went yesterday to have a look.  I found that Irish products are every bit as good as, if not superior to, the foreign products.  It is up to us and especially to the media to promote Irish goods.  This would be a new form of patriotism which we need to develop, a patriotism that realises that jobs, people's livelihoods are at stake. The Irish goods are there if we really want to help solve our employment problem. The quality is there.  I would have no hesitation in saying that.  I would ask our media to play a greater role in promoting Irish goods.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a recent experience with regard to Irish goods.  I purchased a pair of shoes and the selling price was £45.  They were a pair of shoes that looked very well and, as you know down the country, we bargain a little bit and I got them reduced somewhat.  But the first day I wore them, there was a shower of rain and they soaked the rain as if they were made of blotting paper.  I went back to the shop where I purchased them and I complained to the man who sold them to me.  He said, &ldquo;Yes, they let <Col N="1957" /> in the rain all right.  They are made for comfort, not to keep out the rain&rdquo;.  If he had told me that when I purchased them it certainly would have influenced my choice of shoes because at the same time I could buy a very good pair of imported shoes at one-third of that cost.</P>
      <P>I was interested when Senator Manning mentioned design and the improvements we have made.  Yes, of course, we have to an extent, from the aesthetic point of view, from the point of view of the appearance of the articles we have made good progress but design also takes into consideration the function of the item.  I would say that in this case here we have a situation where someone fell down on design; design-wise, it was a failure.  That is unfortunate because it gives a bad name to Irish products.  What Members have said is basically true.  We have nothing to be ashamed of.  We have made great strides and, indeed, there are areas where we have made exceptional strides, for example, with regard to the Kilkenny Design Workshop.  Perhaps we should have more establishments of that kind.</P>
      <P>I am quite well aware that from the point of view of patriotism and concern for our own people we should purchase Irish-made goods but I have the greatest sympathy with the less-well-off family, the mother, for example, with a family of young children and limited finance.  I can very well understand a woman in that situation not being to concerned whether the shoes, the clothes she buys or other items she buys are Irish-manufactured or not.  There is a problem here and, as has already been stated, it is a free market now; it is a pity in a sense that we could not make provision by way of grants to reduce the cost.  That would be money well spent but we are in a situation where we cannot do that.  That is unfortunate, but I do sympathise with people in that situation.</P>

    <P>The position with regard to potatoes has been mentioned.  It is very difficult to understand in a country that has been famous for its potatoes for many centuries why we should have such a high import rate.  The figures have been given <Col N="1958" /> already: really the situation is that with the soil we have in this country, the climate, the facilities, the expertise, the history of growing potatoes, we should be an exporting nation.  The opposite is the case.  The same applies as regards vegetables. It is difficult to understand, again given the climate we have, that we cannot produce enough vegetables for our own use.  I have known instances &mdash; I have related them before in this House &mdash; where people made an attempt to grow vegetables and they were unsuccessful.</P>
    <P>I knew one market gardener who had an acre of ground and found it cheaper to come up to Dublin and buy his vegetables and take them down and sell them than to grow them himself.  Of course all over the country we have untilled gardens and it would seem a good case could be made in some way to encourage people by way of providing seeds or incentives of some kind to till their gardens but in the main they are neglected.  I knew of one farmer who grew 15 acres of beans; the season was bad and he could not sell the beans when they were harvested.  I related in this House a case where a farmer grew cabbages; he took two loads of the best cabbages that could be grown into the Dublin market but he failed to get a sale for them.  He dumped them on the way home.  I knew one person in Navan many years ago who constructed a very big glasshouse; he grew tomatoes and grew them very successfully but when he had the tomatoes he failed to get sale for them because they came in at a time when all the Irish tomatoes, apparently, were ripe and ready for sale and he could not sell them.</P>
    <P>We have the same position, I believe, as regards sugar.  If the Irish people purchased the sugar manufactured in this country we would not have the situation where factories would be threatened with closure.  Another situation I have mentioned many times is in relation to a very scenic area between Nobber and Drumconrath in County Meath an area known as Ballyhoe, where damsons grow wild in the fields and gardens and along the sides of the road.  It is an area that could be promoted as a major tourist area &mdash;<Col N="1959" /> beautiful scenery, a beautiful lake, marvellous fishing &mdash; and yet the damsons by and large are wasted.  One would expect in that situation we would have a jam factory, so that we would be able to provide damsons for jam-making, thus paying the people on whose land they grew but that is not the position.</P>
    <P>Fish is another item that is a problem. Again, it is difficult to understand in an island that we actually import fish when we should be supplying fish to the world. Indeed, on a smaller scale, with regard to the fish in our rivers and lakes, we have a growing problem.  I recall in my own area as a young boy small rivers that had trout and salmon and during the spawning season those rivers were poached.  It was criminal to tolerate that situation where we had the great potential of those rivers and streams being, taken away selfishly by people for their own use.  We still have that happening and it will be very difficult to eliminate it.  In addition, we have the problem of pollution.</P>
    <P>I also see problems in relation to activities in our towns where we have stalls set up in a market environment, often it seems to me by people who are not natives of this country.  I do not object to that, but those people do not pay rent or rates.  They pay a nominal charge for the right to set up and sell their wares and we see clothes sold at a price that is lower than shops in those towns can afford.  We see carpets sold in Navan where we have quality carpets manufactured in a factory that gives good employment.  Those cheap carpets are sold on the fairgreen in Navan and, of course, the factory cannot compete with those prices.</P>
    <P>In reading some of the recommendations and suggestions by the various Ministers &mdash; and I would like to refer to them in a moment &mdash; I was intrigued to note in one of them that it was suggested the Government and State agencies could play a bigger role by purchasing from smaller firms.  I have no doubt this is so but my experience over the years is that small business firms are very reluctant to deal with State agencies because <Col N="1960" /> State agencies are, by and large, &ldquo;a bad pay&rdquo;.  I have known quite a few businesses that will not supply to State agencies because they could not get paid on time when the money was due: when they looked for payment they were told to send in copy invoices.  That is not good enough.  It is something that has to be faced.  When firms and small businesses supply goods they should be paid promptly. It is important that they are paid promptly and if this is done it will help in a big measure to ensure that Irish-made goods are competitive and that firms are able to stay in business.</P>
    <P>Dumping has been referred to and dumping is a big problem.  I know that there are regulations and laws dealing with that problem but I brought the matter up on one occasion here where Gypsum Industries, a firm who employ a big workforce, had a major difficulty through the import of cheap products from Spain.  I brought this matter up in this House but I did not get the hearing I would have liked.  The problem continued. I am not sure how it has developed since then but it was a real problem and a problem that Gypsum Industries felt could close them down eventually.  Thankfully, they are still in business.</P>
    <P>There are ways of dealing with most of those problems.  The situation with regard to Northern Ireland has been referred to.  It was one of the problems we saw at first-hand when we were canvassing in the last election where people could get petrol in Northern Ireland at practically half the price it was sold at in the Republic.  We saw the situation where all the filling stations along the Border were closed up and had become derelict. Thankfully, this has been reversed.  It was the same with regard to other commodities. Tribute should be paid to the Government that they have dealt adequately and efficiently with that problem.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of concern that small businesses and small groceries have in many cases gone.  In their own way they played a major social role.  People who owned them worked hard.  They were <Col N="1961" /> there all the time serving the customers. I remember an elderly man in my own locality who was regarded as a very wise man and he said to me: &ldquo;He who by the plough must live himself must either lead or drive&rdquo;.  I think this is most important. When one is in business, one must be there, one must work hard, must be seen to be there because when people come in they want to deal with you.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the problems regarding energy and where research in wave energy, wind energy and solar energy, would in itself bring about a situation where we would be dealing with appliances which could be made here and where employment could be given here. In relation to this debate it is no harm to mention that finances are available from the EC with regard to research in this area.  We should be trying to make greater use of what is available in this respect.</P>
    <P>Managerial skills are very important for small businesses.  While I do not feel that we have lacked managerial skills over the years I do feel that perhaps in the context of family businesses and in the social set-up where people know one another intimately, it was not easy to make difficult decisions.  In other words, where there were financial problems the local grocery tried to help out and it may have been difficult to get payment in the finish.  Nowadays that kind of relationship is gone and people are inclined to take legal advice with regard to getting payments which are due to them.  Of course, in this way they lose friends but the business must be kept going.  This is one of the things we must remember with regard to managerial skills.  Making decisions of that kind is difficult but important.  The EC has special concern for small businesses and we will be dealing with that report in the near future.</P>
    <P>Overall, by buying Irish goods we are contributing to employment and that is a problem area at present.  A week or so ago we had a circular from the Minister for Industry and Commerce regarding the export boom.  It is a very brief circular and I will refer to the first two paragraphs of it because they are very telling.  In the <Col N="1962" /> first paragraph the Minister with responsibility for trade and marketing, Deputy Brennan, said that in the 29 shopping days to Christmas we will import £2.7 million worth of gift-type products per day.  This was not per week but per day.  He continued: &ldquo;If during those few weeks £1 in £5 of this were switched to Irish gift products it would support upwards of 1,000 Irish jobs and earn the country some £16 million.&rdquo;  The Minister went on to say that looking at the range of goods which will be on most of our shopping lists this Christmas it was a challenge to us all to note the high level of foreign gift purchases in 1986.  And he listed a few of them, as follows: &ldquo;In men's and boys' wear we imported £63 million worth of goods.  In ladies' outer wear we import £131 million worth of goods.  In shirts we imported £15 million worth.  In greeting cards we imported £7.5 million worth.  In toys we imported £42 million worth.  In ornamental jewellery we imported £10 million worth.  In handbags we imported £5 million worth.  This represents a total import bill of about £270 million of which roughly £80 million was spent over the Christmas shopping period.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have no time to develop that further but clearly in the light of what I said I think it indicates the importance of purchasing on every possible occasion Irish-made goods in preference to imported goods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to the House for being late.  I was sitting in my office. I did not expect the debate to end so quickly, as it was scheduled to last until <Col N="1963" /> about 8 o'clock.  I also beg your indulgence for the fact that I am suffering from a cold, if not a flu, so my contribution may be interspersed with bouts of coughing and other throat clearing exercises but I imagine, Sir, that you will bear with me and that the Official Reporters will bear with me also.</P>
      <P>The present school in Williamstown was built and opened in 1943.  At the time of opening it consisted of a boys' school and there was also a school for girls.  In the early sixties the numbers increased in both schools and the catering or lunch rooms in both the schools had to be turned into classrooms.  By 1963 there were four teachers in Williamstown, two in each school.  In 1967 another school in the parish of Leitra was amalgamated with Williamstown.  At that time some repairs were carried out to the building and a new water supply, electric lighting and a new central heating system were installed.  In 1974 the two schools in Williamstown and the manager, under very persistent pressure from the Department of Education, agreed to the amalgamation of all the schools in the parish of Williamstown, namely, Farm School, Poilredmond School and Williamstown boys' and girls' schools.  The amalgamation was accepted on the condition that the Department would shortly afterwards sanction the provision of a general purpose room, improved toilet facilities and other small ancillary services on the site.  There was an absolute guarantee given at that time by the Department's inspector who supervised the amalgamation that these minimal requirements would be sanctioned.  The management, teachers, parents and pupils agreed to the amalgamation, based on the urgings and guarantees of the Department.  They honoured their end of the bargain fully.  Once the amalgamation was in place the Department quickly welshed on their promise and today 13 years later the promise remains broken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now there are 215 pupils on the school roll and they are packed into a building that was meant to accommodate 150 children at most.  They are crowded into four <Col N="1964" /> under-sized and sub-standard classrooms of the early forties vintage and two other classrooms that were originally tea rooms for the pupils.  They have toilet and cloakroom facilities for 150 children and a small staff room which holds three people, even though there are six teachers on the staff.  Three years ago the manager of the school started to campaign in earnest to get something done about the appalling overcrowding and the general deteriorating condition of the school.  The then Minister for Education, Deputy Hussey, recognised the plight of everyone involved and to her great credit she sanctioned the following improvements: first, the existing six sub-standard classrooms in the old main building were to be re-ordered to create four up-to-date and up to standard rooms; second, a new extension would be constructed consisting of two new classrooms, a general purposes room, new, adequate toilet and cloakroom facilities, a staff room and a small library-cum-medical room.</P>
    <P>The various stages of planning were submitted and sanctioned very speedily by the Minister, Deputy Hussey and later by Deputy Cooney.  In February of this year the project was released to tender. The contractors' tenders were submitted to the Department's building section on 19 March and the contractor was chosen but never appointed because, by the month of May, all proposals for school building and improvement were put into deep freeze by the new Minister.  We want these proposals taken out of the deep freeze because this is a most deserving emergency case.  It is one of the most grossly over-crowded schools in the country with pupils and teachers living a kind of sardines in a tin existence.  The Minister will agree with me that this is the least conducive atmosphere for good teaching and good learning.</P>
    <P>The condition of the existing structure is not the worst in the country &mdash; I spoke about Frenchpark here six weeks ago &mdash; but the structure in Williamstown is deteriorating.  The Minister has been made aware of the broken promise of 1974.  Do not add another despicable chapter to that, with another broken <Col N="1965" /> promise.  I ask the Minister not to trot out the usual blah blah about shortage of money and the number of school projects released to tender by the Coalition.  I repeat this case is an emergency and we do not want half or quarter measures in response, similar to the response we got to Frenchpark where the grant allocation was cut by almost two-thirds.  There is no credibility in telling us there is no money to deal with an emergency like Williamstown.</P>
    <P>In the past week we have seen a seven room school sanctioned in Calry, County Sligo.  I wish in no way to decry or take away from the sanction for Calry school. I have no doubt it is a fully deserving case and I wish them continued luck.  But, I remain with a sneaking suspicion that their luck in being sanctioned having gone to tender last September has something to do with the fact that Calry is bang in the centre of the constituency of the Minister for Finance.  It is only about four miles from his home.  My appeal to the Minister on behalf of Williamstown, as it was on behalf of Frenchpark six weeks ago, is not based on politics or political proximity to someone with power over the public purse.  It is based instead on the need of disadvantaged children in a disadvantaged school.  I expect the Minister's response to be based on the over-riding criteria of need, aside from political consequences or non-consequences.</P>
    <P>I have one final point.  Under the regulations that predate Circular 20/87 this school is entitled to another teacher commencing on 1 January.  The numbers are there to justify the appointment of an additional teacher, and have been there for the stipulated length of time.  In view of the fact that we now understand that this nefarious little circular is being withdrawn, would the Minister confirm for me tonight in order that I can communicate with the manager and his board that they can go ahead and appoint the additional teacher with effect from the term commencing after Christmas?  Our appeal stands and we hope we will have a positive response from the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's records show that the authorities of Williamstown national school, County Galway, applied in 1982 for a grant towards the cost of upgrading and extending the accommodation of their building. The school currently has six teachers, including the principal, and classes are accommodated in six classrooms of traditional construction.  My understanding is that the school is well maintained but that the small size of the classrooms gives rise to a problem of overcrowding.  The proposal which has been submitted and which my Department are prepared in principle to grant-aid is the conversion of the present six classrooms into four by altering the internal walls, and the provision of two permanent classrooms, together with a general purposes area and the usual ancillary areas for a school of this size.</P>
      <P>The invitation of tenders for the project by the school authorities, as the Senator rightly pointed out, was authorised in January or February last by my predecessor in office.  Tenders were, in fact, invited and the recommendation of the school's professional consultants thereon have been submitted for my Department's consultation.  Because, however, of the pressure on the limited capital available to my Department for the national school buildings programme, I am not in a position at this stage to authorise further movement on the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not had an opportunity at this stage to consult with the school authorities as to whether there are any interim measures which can be taken to alleviate pressure on the existing accommodation at the school.  I hesitate in this context to go into detail as to the options which may be available in the circumstances. I understand that the chairman of the school's board of management has been making inquiries as to the prospects of movement on this project but, so far, because of the present difficult financial climate, my Department have been unable to hazard a timescale for the completion <Col N="1967" /> of the tender action and contract formalities.</P>
    <P>However, in the light of the case put by the Senator, I propose to make arrangements for a senior official from the primary buildings branch of my Department to make contact with the manager of the school with a view to discussing the school's difficulties and establishing whether, with the limited finances that are available some relief <Col N="1968" /> could be afforded to the school.</P>
    <P>With regard to the last point made by the Senator, Circular 20/87 has not been withdrawn but guidelines have been authorised by the Minister under which we will examine the situation with regard to the appointment the Senator has mentioned, with a view to sorting out the problem that has arisen.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 7.45 p.m. until 11.30 a.m. on Friday, 4 December 1987.</P>
