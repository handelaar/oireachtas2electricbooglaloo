      <P>I have notice from Senator John Connor that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to provide the necessary funds immediately to construct a new primary school at Frenchpark, County Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Nuala Fennell of the following matters:</P>
      <P>The severe underfunding of the Council for the Status of Women which represents 250,000 women and 55 affiliated organisations. The need for the Minister for Health to reverse his decision to abolish the Health Education Bureau as the independent service it provided cannot be carried out within a Government Department.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Katharine Bulbulia of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to restore funding to the County and City Infirmary, Waterford, in order to ensure that the people of that area <Col N="116" /> have an adequate surgical and medical service.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Connor, Fennell and Bulbulia as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Connor's motion and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m., or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.  Senators Fennell and Bulbulia may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>For the information of the House I wish to announce that, in accordance with Standing Order No. 14, I have nominated Senators Brian Mullooly, Martin J. O'Toole, Joe Doyle and Jack Harte to be members of the panel who may act as temporary chairmen in the Seanad.  Lest there be any confusion in this regard among the Independent Senators, there is space for another name which will be added.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, while I am happy with the business ordered for today, my group are unhappy on the general question of the ordering of Government business at present.  We had the recess when virtually no Bills appeared but in the past few days they have been appearing like confetti.  Many of these Bills are detailed and technical and we are told that they have to be taken fairly urgently.  The speed at which we are being asked to take some of these Bills is unfair to Senators in all groups. They should not be rushed through and we should have got many of these Bills <Col N="117" /> earlier.  I certainly do not blame the Government Whip who goes out of his way to be helpful and courteous to us all on these matters.  The overall approach is haphazard.  It is indicative of the arrogance of Government Departments who seem to think they can spend a very long time on the Bills and we should take them at two or three days notice.</P>
      <P>I am particularly unhappy with the Insurance Bill which I believe we will be asked to take on Second Stage tomorrow. This has only appeared in the past few days and it is a very technical Bill.  I urge the Leader of the House to get a full list of proposed Government legislation during this session so that Senators of all parties will have an opportunity to do the proper consultation and research on these Bills rather than being rushed into them as we are at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I just mention apropos of what Senator Manning said that the Insurance Bill has not been circulated. Could we find out why?  I had a number of people on to me yesterday when the news of the Bill came out and they actually went down to the Government Publications Office and were told the Bill would not be available for a number of days.  During the last session the Minister for Industry and Commerce said it was a pity that more people in interest groups did not make representations in time.  I suggest it does not enable them to make informed submissions on legislation if the Bill is not available in the Government Publications Office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I hold the brief as spokesman on Industry and Commerce and I have not yet received a copy of the Insurance Bill.  If we have to discuss the Bill tomorrow that amount of notice is very unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>As somebody who is a spokesperson on all the different issues, as all Independent Senators are, we also have difficulty in finding time to read through the raft of material which is approaching us at the moment.  We have <Col N="118" /> always been prepared to address the problem of legislation.  We find it somewhat illogical that before the summer recess, for instance, the Adoption Bill and the Companies Bill were taken through Second Stage.  We understand the Bills and the amendments are available. It is difficult to comprehend why we are not dealing with the Committee Stages of these Bills.  They seem to be cast aside and we are having a great deal of new legislation pushed on us which is all very well if we have time to get through it.  It is putting us under a lot of pressure to read through it and to understand it.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to indicate why the Committee Stages of the Companies Bill and the Adoption Bill are not being ordered at present?  When can we expect to deal with those Bills?  When does he intend to take item No. 28 on the Order Paper &mdash; that Seanad Éireann should consider the setting up of a foreign policy committee.  Members on all sides of the House have indicated that the Seanad could be of help and support in working out a national foreign policy on different countries, different places and different areas.  When can we expect to be dealing with that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader when is it proposed to bring in the Local Radio Bill?  It is long overdue and I have brought it up in this House in the past two or three years.  Something should be done about it straight away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that Senator Cassidy has resurrected his favourite subject. I had to deal with it once in his absence &mdash; during a change of Government &mdash; but I am delighted that he is continuing with it now, which is a breath of fresh air.  I agree with Senator O'Toole about the foreign policy committee.  I got a commitment from the Leader of the House last week that he was addressing this area with the Government.  I know from experience that it is important, if this House is to be used efficiently and with the co-operation of all its Members as much notice as possible should be <Col N="119" /> given to Members of pending legislation. Something that is coming should be circulated at least a week in advance so that we can address it properly.  I know the Leader of the House agrees with that philosophy.  There are difficulties with Government Departments in getting Bills out in time for us to deal with them properly and not be subject to criticism from literally every quarter about the role and the function of this House.</P>
      <P>To set my mind at rest about the Insurance Bill which the Whip has notified me will be taken tomorrow morning, is this the same Insurance Bill that was prepared and published by the previous Government?  If it is, it makes everybody's task a little easier.  At least we have seen their Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, mar dhuine as an nGaeltacht agus mar dhuine a dhéanann iarracht labhairt sa Ghaeilge beagnach i gcónaí anseo, agus ó tháinig mé sa Seanad labhras as Gaeilge go hiomlán ach amháin b'fhéidir ar feadh dhá líne.  I mo thuairimse ceapaim go mba cheart go mbeadh aistriúchán nó córas aistriúcháin anseo ó Ghaeilge go Béarla agus ó Bhéarla go Gaeilge. As a native Irish speaker I feel slightly discriminated against because there is no instant translation here from Irish to English or English to Irish.  It seems that they have this facility in the Dáil.  I suggest to the Cathaoirleach that this facility should be made available in the Seanad. Since I came here I have spoken on three or four occasions.  I spoke entirely in the Irish language apart from two lines.  At that time I referred to Senator Ryan who made, as I thought at the time, a certain allegation against councillors.  I felt obliged to reply to the Senator in English so that the other Members of the Seanad could understand what I was saying.  My feeling is that, as a Member of this House from the Gaeltacht of Connemara, I am being discriminated against when I have to speak in the English language.  I would <Col N="120" /> ask your good offices to have a look at this and try to rectify the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly will do all I can.  I understand there is a Joint Committee on the Irish Language.  Certainly it could be referred to them and it could also be referred to the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges. I will do all I can.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, mar Chathaoirleach ón chomhchoiste sin ba mhaith liom aontú le Nioclás Ó Conchúir mar gheall air seo.</P>
      <P>It is essential to get instant translation in the Seanad.  This comhchoiste you referred to is there to try to find ways and means of fostering and using the language more in the Seanad and in the Dáil.  There is discrimination possibly on both sides in the Seanad.  If I continued to speak in the Irish language a number of people would not understand what I was saying.  If I disagree with somebody's point of view and say so in the Irish language, they do not understand that I am disagreeing with them.  The facilities which are in the Dáil should be available here.  I will be pushing very hard as chairman of Comhchoiste don Ghaeilge for this facility.</P>

      <P>As the House will be aware I and three of my Fine Gael colleagues share two offices at 89 Merrion Street. There was a break-in to these offices over the week-end.  Serious damage was caused to some property and some items were stolen.  I understand that before we took up residence in these offices the Superintendent of the House asked the Garda Síochána for a report on the security aspects of the buildings.  That report was prepared by the Garda Síochána and submitted to the Office of Public Works some weeks ago.  I ask the Cathaoirleach to use her good offices to see that the recommendations made in that report are carried out.</P>

      <P>Does the Leader of the House intend to make a response to yet <Col N="121" /> another outrageous attack on this institution in recent days?  In that context will he also give the House an indication of the deliberations following the setting up of a sub-committee to look into the reform of this House subsequent to the debate which took place in the House prior to the summer recess?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition referred to the Government Party being unfair, haphazard and arrogant in their timing of business before the House. I am not too sure exactly what he is talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, the arrogance is not attributed to the Leader of the House or to any Member of this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The inference is that there is arrogance in certain places, that there is a haphazard method of ordering business in this House, an unfair advantage being taken by the Government Members of the House of the Opposition Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order again, I do not know what the hearing of the Senator was today.  I said very specifically that we all suffered under the same disadvantage &mdash; Senators on both sides of the House &mdash; from the rush of legislation at very short notice.  I went out of my way to say that the Chief Whip of the Government was courteous and helpful in every way to us that it was not his fault or that of the Leader of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Leader of the Opposition is withdrawing his remarks about business&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On another point of order, most certainly I am not withdrawing <Col N="122" /> the remarks I made but I would suggest that the Leader of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not tolerate a chat show between the Leader of the House and the Leader of the Opposition across the floor of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The business ordered today is not haphazard or unfair and the timing is not unfair to anybody.  I did order items Nos. 1, 2 and 3 which are Orders for Second Stage.  I did not give any indication as to when the Second Stage of each of those Bills would be taken but I am giving an indication to the House that they will be taken in the very near future.</P>
      <P>If anybody is under any illusions about the Insurance Bill, 1987, I should say that it is a Bill introduced by the previous Government.  Every Member of this House was circulated with a copy but there are a few amendments that the Minister will be introducing.  The Air Navigation and Transport Bill is a new Bill.  Nobody could suggest that that is a Bill that we should not take in the short term.  I do not think there is any Member of this House who did not know that there was a Video Recordings Bill being introduced in this House.  Anybody reading the papers, listening to the media or to constituents over the past 12 months would know that that is an important Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did indicate last week that the Customs and Excise (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill would be taken this week.  That offered at least a week for anybody interested to have a look at that Bill.  Item No. 5 on the Order Paper is a motion about which everybody knows.  In the interests of fairness, I did say that we would be taking the Insurance Bill, 1987, as a matter of urgency.  It is intended that we continue with that tomorrow.  Somebody mentioned the Adoption (No. 2) Bill and the Companies (No. 2) Bill.  We are in the course of Committee Stage on both those Bills and we will continue our discussion of them <Col N="123" /> in the very near future.  Those Bills were referred to by Senator J. O'Toole.  We commenced consideration of both those Bills a long time ago.  It is not new legislation for this House.</P>
      <P>With regard to item No. 28 &mdash; the question of an Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Policy &mdash; there will be time given to the Independent group of Senators for a motion to be taken very shortly.  If they want to have that down as their motion the House will so agree. There is no hassle whatsoever about that. I am just telling the Independent group how to deal with their business.</P>
      <P>Senator Reynolds's complaint about not receiving copies of Bills is a serious matter.  It is disgraceful if copies of Bills are not available to Members and he shall have to take up that matter with the appropriate people.  I am indeed surprised because if and when any Member seeks a copy of a Bill it should be available to him or her.  It is not the fault of the Government.  The fault lies elsewhere and I shall have to take up that matter immediately.</P>
      <P>Senator Cassidy raised the matter of local radio.  This is a matter of importance. It is a matter of public interest, of legality, of organising so as to ensure that anyone broadcasting on airways is doing so legally.  The Government will be bringing in a Bill &mdash; I do not think it should be called a local radio Bill &mdash; in the very near future.</P>
      <P>Senator Ferris raised the same question as was raised by Senator O'Toole on item No. 28.  All I can say is that if the motion is brought forward there can be a full discussion on it.  I suggest that Senator Ferris and Senator O'Toole get together and maybe put down a joint motion in this regard and drop one of their own motions which might not be as important to them as this one.  It does seem to be one that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Dúirt an Seanadóir Ó Conchúir go mba cheart go mbeadh gléas aistriúcháin anseo.  Ba cheart go mbeadh.  Má tá sé sa Dáil ba cheart go mbeadh sé anseo.  It is extremely important that if there is somebody who finds it easier to understand Irish than English he should not be discriminated against in this Chamber.</P>
      <P>Níl mórán Gaeilge á labhairt sa Seanad ach má tá Seanadóirí ann nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge go dlúth acu, ba cheart go mbeadh gléas aistriúcháin ann.  We should have a translation service in this House if it is available in the other House.  The facility should be here anyway because the Irish language is as important as or more important than the English language.</P>
      <P>The question of the break in at the offices at 89 Merrion Street will have to be taken up with the security people.  It is important that Members of the House, if they have offices outside the House, should have the same degree of security as we have inside the House, but there are some people who have offices in the House who think that the security within the House is too rigid.</P>

It is illustrated by the fact that a Bill to be taken tomorrow has not been received by many Members of this group in the House.

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will be aware that the previous <Col N="127" /> Government circulated the text of their Customs and Excise (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1987, immediately prior to the dissolution of the Dáil on 20 January last.  The Government have given careful consideration to their predecessors' legislative proposals in that Bill and have decided that they are necessary and should be proceeded with.  The text of the Bill now before the House for a Second Reading is identical to that circulated by the previous Government. I wish to give notice, however, that I am considering some amendments which will be moved by me on Committee Stage. These will not affect the main thrust of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is twofold: (i) to give additional powers to officers of Customs and Excise which will enable them to play a more effective role in the fight against drug smuggling, and (ii) to make a number of other amendments to existing Customs and Excise legislation. I consider it a matter of great importance that the powers here proposed for customs officers in relation to drug smuggling be enacted into law.  Senators will not need to be reminded of the grave threat posed to the well-being of the community through the misuse of drugs such as heroin and cocaine.  Despite the record of successes of the Garda Síochána and the Customs service in combating drug distribution and misuse, these drugs continue to be available and this is a matter for the gravest concern.  I believe that the necessary legislation should be put in place to enable preventive agencies to work with the utmost effectiveness to combat this evil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general effect of what is perhaps the key section in the Bill, section 2, is to confer on officers of Customs and Excise powers similar to those already conferred on the Garda Síochána by the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984. These powers are to detain and to search, without warrant, if reasonable cause for suspicion exists, persons, vehicles, vessels or aircraft for the purposes of detecting drug smuggling.  The exercise of those powers by Customs and Excise officers at <Col N="128" /> or in the vicinity of points of entry to, and exit from, the State including the Border with Northern Ireland will be permitted by section 2 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>This provision is in accordance with the recommendations of the Second Report of the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism published in July 1984.  During the debate on the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1984, several calls were made for a strengthening of the powers of customs officers to ensure that they have the authority to combat the illegal importation of drugs.  In their second report, the select committee point out that &ldquo;the smuggling of illegal drugs into the country has become a major cause of concern for society generally&rdquo;.  They go on to say:</P>
    <P>The country's first line of defence to the problem, namely the barriers at point of entry, must be geared to tackle the sources and prevent these commodities reaching the streets.  Such action, assuming it were to be successful, would reduce the demands for expensive follow-up activity as well as reducing the unquantifiable social cost of drug addiction to a young person.</P>
    <P>Every member of the Customs and Excise service engaged in the examination of passengers and of goods at points of entry to the State must be regarded as forming part of a first line of defence against the illegal importation of drugs.  When that first line of defence is breached, subsequent action within the State is primarily a matter for the Garda Síochána, with the Customs and Excise service providing any co-operation and assistance required.  The Bill now before the House will considerably strengthen the all-important first line of defence.</P>
    <P>I might point out to the House that the select committee's recommendation that a drugs unit be established within the customs service was implemented in 1985.  Five officers are now employed full time in such a unit on drugs-related work. It is worth noting also that every member of the Customs and Excise service engaged in the examination of passengers <Col N="129" /> and goods at entry points to the State is given special training in relation specifically to drug smuggling, and a number of staff have been sent abroad for further training.  The most up-to-date drug identification equipment is provided to customs officers and this equipment is being further augmented.</P>
    <P>Steady progress has been made by customs officers in the detection of drug smuggling.  There were 47 seizures of heroin, cocaine and cannabis in its various forms by customs officers in 1986. These drugs had a street value of £42,000. Up to the end of June this year there have been 24 seizures by customs officers of drugs valued at £12,000.  Section 3 of the Bill will give added powers of search to Customs and Excise officers.  Taken together, sections 2 and 3 of the Bill will, the Government have no doubt, increase the effectiveness of the customs service in making detections but, while the checks envisaged will form an important part of our first line of defence, great reliance must continue to be placed on information provided by the Garda and from agencies including customs services in other countries about the movement of drug traffickers.  Given the high value of even small quantities of drugs such as heroin and the ease with which they can be concealed the task is not an easy one. I am hopeful that the measures now proposed will help in the task of stemming such supplies at point of import.</P>
    <P>The other provisions in the Bill not arising from the recommendations of the select committee in relation to drug smuggling chiefly provide for some strengthening of the law in relation to smuggling generally.</P>
    <P>I wish to take this opportunity to say to the House that the Government are deeply perturbed at the apparent scale of commercial smuggling of certain goods such as drink, oil products and electrical goods.  Smuggling damages local retailers, wholesalers and manufacturers and robs the Exchequer of vitally important revenues.  The receivers of such goods obtain their &ldquo;bargains&rdquo; at the cost, first, of their neighbours' livelihoods and, secondly of the ability of the Exchequer <Col N="130" /> to maintain essential public services at an optimum level.  I know that legitimate traders are seriously perturbed at the existence of such traffic and the unfair position they find themselves in when trying to compete with smuggled commodities. There should be no doubt in anyone's mind as to the detrimental effects of participating in such black economy transactions.  They are not helping the community, the economy or ultimately themselves by so doing. Smugglers are encouraged by those who are prepared to accept a quick return by availing of under-the-counter services. The entire fabric of our business and social structure is affected by it.  There must be no dissembling in recognising smuggling for what it is; there can be no pretence that it is morally or socially acceptable or somehow justified by high taxation levels.  No such argument is acceptable.  The Government do not intend to allow the community to continue to suffer from these abuses.  The Bill contains a number of provisions which aim to strengthen the hand of the authorities in dealing with smuggling.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains clarification of the Customs and Excise status of goods won from the Irish-designated areas of the Continental Shelf, and it provides for excise control measures in relation to oil found on-shore or in areas of the Continental Shelf over which the State exercises sovereign jurisdiction and for the application of Customs and Excise controls to goods conveyed by pipeline.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Bill increases a number of penalties in relation to breaches of Customs and Excise law.  I will invite Senators to consider whether the level of penalties proposed is adequate.  My own belief is that they are not.  I am giving further consideration to this question and I intend to move amendments in Committee which will increase some of the proposed penalties still further.</P>
    <P>I turn now to outline in sequence the provisions of the Bill.  A number of provisions are relatively self-explanatory and I will do little more in such cases than repeat the Explanatory Memorandum which accompanies the Bill.  Section 1 <Col N="131" /> contains definitions and provides for standard interpretation clauses.  Section 2 gives officers of Customs and Excise powers to detain and to search, without warrant, persons, vehicles, etc., for the purposes of detecting drug smuggling. The section provides that these powers may be exercised in the vicinity of a port, airport, or the land frontier.  I have already explained the rationale behind this section.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the issue to, and execution by, an officer of Customs and Excise of a search warrant authorising him to search premises or land for controlled drugs which were illegally imported or are intended to be illegally exported, or for documents relating to such drugs.  The section also empowers the officer who executes the search warrant to arrest any person found in the place being searched and to search that person.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the acceptance as evidence, in proceedings under the Customs Acts in drugs smuggling cases, of certificates giving the results of tests or analyses carried out in the State Laboratory.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for the issue of a search warrant to an officer of Customs and Excise to search premises or places where books or documents relating to smuggling transactions are suspected of being kept or concealed.  It also provides for the seizure of any such documents, as well as any smuggled goods which may be found in the course of a search.  Under existing law, there is no provision for the issue of a search warrant to an officer of Customs and Excise authorising him to search for documents <i>per se.</i>  Such documents can be vital in the successful prosecution of a case against a smuggler.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that, where goods liable to seizure or detention by customs are found in a vehicle or other conveyance shall be deemed to have been made use of in the conveyance of the goods and thus liable to seizure or detention along with them.  The purpose of this section is to remedy a possible weakness <Col N="132" /> in the existing law governing the forfeiture of vehicles used to convey uncustomed, prohibited or restricted goods.</P>
    <P>Section 7 makes provision for the detention by an officer of Customs and Excise of goods suspected of having been smuggled or of being irregularly exported.  The period of detention, which may not exceed one month, is to enable investigations to be carried out to determine whether the goods in such cases should be seized.  Legal problems can arise in the case of premature seizure of goods which this section will surmount by providing for a period of detention of suspect goods.</P>
    <P>Section 8 remedies a possible technical weakness in one of the existing provisions relating to the liability to forfeiture of smuggled goods by providing generally that such goods shall be liable to forfeiture, regardless of whether they have been unshipped or unladen.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with the onus of proof in certain proceedings relating to exported goods or goods seized under the customs Acts.  Under existing law, where proceedings are taken by the State under the customs Acts in respect of goods suspected of having been illegally imported, the onus of proving that the goods were lawfully imported rests on the defendant. Section 9 provides for a similar onus in relation to goods suspected of having been illegally exported or of being intended for illegal exportation.  The section also provides that where civil actions are brought against the Revenue Commissioners, etc., in relation to goods seized under the customs Acts, the onus of proving where the good originated, or whether the goods were lawfully imported or were lawfully exported or otherwise lawfully dealt with for exportation, is on the person bringing the proceedings.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that goods won from the Irish-designated areas of the Continental Shelf and brought directly ashore shall be deemed for Customs and Excise purposes to have been grown, produced or manufactured in the State and not to have been imported.  Section 11 <Col N="133" /> provides for the application of excise controls to (a) oil found in the State and (b) oil found in the Irish designated areas of the Continental Shelf and deemed under the previous section to have been produced in the State.</P>
    <P>Section 12 empowers the Minister for Finance to make regulations governing the importation or exportation of goods over the Border with Northern Ireland. The section also provides that the existing land frontier regulations shall have effect as if they had been made under this section, and increases the maximum penalty for contravention of or failure to comply with the regulations from £100 to £500.  The purpose of the section is to remove any possible doubt about the validity of the existing regulations.</P>
    <P>Section 13 empowers the Minister for Finance to apply the provisions of the Customs and Excise Acts to pipelines and goods conveyed in pipelines.  In effect this will enable the normal Customs and Excise controls, that is, the requirements to make customs entry, which govern goods transported by ship, aircraft and road vehicle, to be applied to goods conveyed by pipeline.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides for a general penalty of £1,000 for offences relating to illicit distillation under the Illicit Distillation (Ireland) Act, 1831 and provides that a district justice may mitigate the penalty for these offences to not less than one half of the full penalty.  The most common offences committed against the 1831 Act relate to possession of equipment or materials used in illicit distillation and making, possessing, conveying or selling illicit spirits, which currently attract penalties of £200.  A district justice is currently empowered to mitigate these penalties to not less than £6.</P>
    <P>Section 15 increases from £100 to £1,000 the maximum penalty which may be imposed for an offence under section 12 of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1881.  The offences referred to in that section include assault or obstruction of Customs and Excise officers and rescue of seized goods.</P>
    <P>Section 16 amends section 31 of the <Col N="134" /> Finance Act, 1929, so as to confer on an officer of Customs and Excise authority, in cases of suspected fraud, to detain documents relating to goods the importation or exportation of which is prohibited or restricted.  That section already authorises the detention of documents in cases of suspected fraud relating solely to customs or excise duties.  This provision brings documents relating to goods which are prohibited or restricted within the scope of section 31.  Section 16 also increases, from £50 to £500, the penalty for resisting an officer in the performance of his duty under section 31 of the Finance Act, 1929.</P>
    <P>Section 17 increases, from £100 to £500, the maximum penalty which may be imposed for contravention of regulations made by the Minister for Finance governing the application of Customs and Excise law and controls to Shannon customs-free airport.</P>
    <P>Section 18 increases, from £100 to £500, the maximum penalty which may be imposed for contravention of regulations made by the Minister for Finance governing the application of Customs and Excise law and controls to imports and exports by air.  As I have already indicated I will propose higher penalties at a later stage in the case of sections 11, 12, 13, 16, 17 and 18.</P>
    <P>Section 19 amends section 29 of the Finance Act, 1971, so as to ensure that prohibited or restricted goods are subject to the same controls as dutiable goods when they are being imported or being taken out of the State by travellers in their baggage and to strengthen the powers of officers of Customs and Excise in relation to control of travellers.  The proposed amendment to the 1971 Act is necessary in order to provide a clear legal obligation on incoming travellers to declare to customs prohibited or restricted goods in the same way that it is mandatory for travellers to declare dutiable goods in excess of the permitted limits and to impose an obligation on travellers leaving the State to answer any questions put to them by a Customs and Excise officer and to produce their bagidit <Col N="135" /> gage for examination.</P>
    <P>Section 20 provides for the short title of the Bill and for its construction with the customs Acts and the excise statutes. In introducing this Bill I want to pay tribute to our customs service.  They have a difficult, frequently unpopular and sometimes dangerous job to do.  Most of us have contact with them only when we are entering or leaving the country.  We should remember that, in addition to doing an essential regulatory job, they are our first line of defence against smugglers who have the capacity to destroy the economy and to create considerable social distress.  The smuggler of today is often a very sophisticated operator and we must keep pace with developments in giving our customs officers adequate powers of inspection and detention. Because of its very nature, we cannot quantify the scale of smuggling.  All the indications are, however, that it is on a large scale and that it does have a significant and damaging effect on the economy. We have particularly difficult problems on the Border with Northern Ireland.  Significant price differentials between North and South provide a strong incentive for smuggling.  The very length of the Border and the nature of the terrain are to the advantage of the smuggler and detection is difficult.  The smuggler will thrive as long as he can escape detection and find a ready and profitable market for his goods.</P>
    <P>The lasting solution to this problem is equalisation of prices.  We hope, in the context of harmonisation within the European Communities, that we are on course for this.  In the short term, however, we cannot make enough progress for financial reasons so we will have to live with price differentials for some time yet.  In order to limit the loss to the economy, a 48-hour restriction on travellers' allowances was introduced in this year's budget.  We no longer accept as a genuine traveller a person whose sole purpose in travelling is to benefit from duty-free allowances.  The price incentive for the smuggler will, therefore, remain. Life, however, is becoming more difficult <Col N="136" /> for him.  For obvious reasons I cannot go into details but he can expect more tough and uncompromising opposition for the future.</P>
    <P>We can look ahead to big changes in the customs service.  The future development of the European Community will have a big impact.  The internal market envisages an opening up of borders between the member states and the role of the customs officer will change with this.  Big increases in numbers travelling and more sophisticated ways and means of importing illegally will create new problems and the customs service and the legal provisions underpinning this service must keep fully up to date with developments.</P>
    <P>The Government are of the view that the measures set out in this Bill will be of significant assistance to the work of the Customs and Excise service particularly in the area of drug smuggling.  I, therefore, commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoachimLoughrey" hpid="Mr. Loughrey Mr. Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the introduction of the Customs and Excise (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, 1987, to the Seanad.  It is No. 2 of 1987 because of the introduction or initiation by the previous Government immediately prior to going out of office, of, as the Minister has said rightly, an identical Bill.  Very broadly speaking, I disagree almost in total with the generalities and, indeed, the specifics of the Bill.  I have a number of reservations regarding it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes to give similar powers to the Customs and Excise officers as have been given to the Garda Síochána.  I have some reservations about that inasmuch as I come from a Border county, though that is not the total reason for those reservations.  I wonder how, some of the powers that it has been proposed to give to Customs and Excise officers will affect what might be described as normal life along the Border, that it is part of the normal lifestyle of some people to cross the Border two, three or four times a day.  It depends on which side of the Border they live, their employment and so on.  People may <Col N="137" /> have to cross the Border on a number of occasions every day.  It is difficult to envisage the type of changes there will be in the lifestyles of those people.</P>
    <P>While the Bill was initiated by this side of the House when in Government and reintroduced by the Minister we all have some reservations about some of the powers that are being bestowed.  In a correspondence which I recently had my attention was drawn to a programme recently done about the abuse of drugs in the city of Belfast.  It horrified me to learn that it is believed that the vast bulk of drugs being used in Belfast city are coming from the South.  If they are crossing the Border to the North where are they coming in in the South?  It would seem illogical to suggest that they are coming across the frontier if they are going back across the frontier.  That would suggest they must be coming in through some of our ports and airports. It would be much easier for Customs and Excise officers to deal with the problem at ports or airports, in that goods or people are coming through gates or doors or whatever the case might be, as opposed to coming across the Border which consists of hills, bogs, roads or lanes.</P>
    <P>The drugs problem is vast.  The Minister in his speech talked about the smuggling across the Border of such things as drink but he did not mention drink as a drug and the abuse of the said drug which, in turn, leads to the abuse of the drugs with which this legislation is proposing to deal.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister. I did the same.  I congratulate him more heartily than normally because he was one of the worst smokers I have ever seen, with the possible exception of the present leader of the Fine Gael Party. Those are the lighter moments of a very serious problem.  These things are related.  I can remember distinctly the first inhalation of a cigarette I smoked in the toilet of a school in Glenbar in 1959. I remember the fellow who was with me, and I met him yesterday.  I can remember my first drink in a bar in Batchelor's Walk in 1966.  I must confess that I did not get as far as the 21 years but I went very close to it.  I can remember more distinctly giving up cigarettes, a mere three years ago, and giving up drink three years ago and, frankly, it was somewhat of a struggle. Perhaps we treat too lightly these minor drugs or socially acceptable drugs. I am delighted the Minister has taken his step with regards to cigarettes because it is by example that we teach.  As a former teacher I had the audacity at times to smoke cigarettes in front of my class, giving terribly bad example while, at the same time, asking them not to smoke. The only merit I saw in that argument was that I coughed so much that they could realise that all was not well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Bill, I would have preferred the smuggling of commercial goods and the smuggling of drugs to have been treated separately in different Bills. There are ties; but those of us who are aware of the abuses of drugs, the socially and not socially acceptable ones, realise the damage that is being done to the fabric of some parts of our society. Coming from a rural society, I do not meet this problem at first-hand, other than when I come to Dublin I cannot park my car on the streets without fear of it being broken into.  I suspect that that problem is somewhat related to drugs. The Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism in its second report dealing with drugs talks about this problem quite a lot.  The Minister has <Col N="139" /> already quoted from paragraph 2.1, where it says:</P>
    <P>The smuggling of illegal drugs into the country has become a major cause of concern.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 2.2 says:</P>
    <P>The Medico-Social Research Board undertook a survey of the mis-use of drugs in one Inner city area of Dublin in 1982-83.  That study confirmed what many persons close to the problem had been saying for a couple of years, namely, that there is a serious problem of drug abuse in certain areas and that it is particularly prevalent in the 15-24 age group.  This study found that the prevalence of heroin abuse in that age group was 10% but in those aged 15-19 it was 12%, and among females aged 15-19 it was 13%.  These figures were in some respects a great deal worse than the equivalent 1970 figures for New York's black ghettoes.</P>
    <P>When I was in Dublin from 1965-67 as a trainee teacher in St. Patrick's there were people there preaching about drugs. There were people trying to highlight the fact that drugs were creeping into society. Nobody listened because nobody really believed that this very serious problem would ever come to this nice country of ours and to this nice city of ours.  If drugs had been available during my student days, in-as-much-as I sampled cigarettes, and I eventually sampled drink and went on to consume quite an amount of it, I probably would have, sampled drugs and, therefore, left myself at risk of becoming a drug addict.  I do not know that, and I probably never will know now.</P>
    <P>I am going to make another confession. During my time getting off drink &mdash; I was not the heaviest drinker in the world but I drank more than was useful for me &mdash; I consumed a drug called solpadeine that is freely available across the counter. Many buy that drug for a simple headache. I did that and I found that I got the headache more often and I consumed the drug more often.  That went on for one or two years until I realised that either I had a physical or a mental addiction to <Col N="140" /> this drug called solpadeine.  It is still freely available across the counter as are many similar drugs.  I decided to ask some questions about it and I was told by a doctor friend that the said solpadeine would be, in drug terms, a soluable codeine and a relative of heroin.  I said to her, &ldquo;Are you saying that there is a possibility that having gone off the jar I am now a junkie?&rdquo;  She said &ldquo;yes, you could be to some degree&rdquo;.  What we could be looking at as well as the smuggling of drugs and the abuse of drugs is the abuse of what we call medical drugs that are available in many households.  We have become a nation of drug users.  We sneeze and we head for a drug.  We cough and we head for a drug.  We have a headache and we head for a drug.  There is this general thing that we go for a drug that cures an ailment.  We hand out £2, £1.50 or £3 for something for a 'flu that we think is coming on.  If the pharmacists in a lot of cases were honest enough they would tell us there is nothing at all in them or virtually nothing at all in them.  In the odd case there is danger, and my solpadeine is one of those dangers.  The report goes on to say:</P>
    <P>While the smuggling of drugs is, in itself, a criminal offence, the abuse of drugs has unfortunately led to a considerable amount of other crime in the community.  This arises where addicts resort to crime in order to obtain the finances necessary to feed their habit. The Committee are convinced that this drug-related crime has been a big contributing factor in the rise in the level of recorded offences over the past few years.  The Garda Commissioner's Report on Crime for 1983 shows a total of about 102,300 indictable offences as compared with 64,000 in 1979 giving an overall increase of 59%.  The Committee was informed that it costs anything between £100 and £300 for an addict to feed his habit for one day.</P>
    <P>These drug addicts cannot stop taking this drug which costs £100 to £300 per day.  They cannot possibly earn that type of money, even on Seanad or other expenses.  Where can they get it?  The <Col N="141" /> only place they can get that type of money, unless they are in big business, is through crime.  Crime leads to further crime, and the godfathers of the drug scene live on the misery of these people. Petty criminals, the fellow who steals my car or tears the radio out of it, or takes the wheels from it, is probably off flogging them, not just for the sake of getting a few pounds but for the sake of getting a few pounds to buy more drugs to feed the addiction.  That money is gone the next day and they have to start all over again.  The problem is a major one.  The report continues:</P>
    <P>Considerable emphasis has been placed, of late, on the action to be taken and the provision of powers for the Gardaí once a crime has been committed.</P>
    <P>Given that even a small quantity of any &ldquo;hard&rdquo; drug which gets through Customs will be &ldquo;cut&rdquo; or &ldquo;spilt&rdquo;, the odds on pushers being apprehended with any quantity of drugs is greatly reduced.  A major portion of the drugs which have passed the Customs barrier are likely to find their way onto the streets.  It would be more satisfactory if the larger quantities were caught at point of entry and the whole supply from any one importation cut off before reaching the addicts and/or potential users.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already said, and he is probably quoting from this report:</P>
    <P>This country's first line of defence to the problem, namely, the barriers at the point of entry, must be geared to tackle the sources and prevent these commodities reaching the streets.  Such action, assuming that it were to be successful, would reduce the demands for expensive follow-up activity, as well as reducing the unquantifiable social cost of drug-addiction in a young person.</P>
    <P>The present trend among drugs smugglers &mdash;</P>
    <P>and among other law breakers, with regard to the Northern problem &mdash;<Col N="142" />&mdash; is toward concealment on or in the body.  These persons are referred to as &ldquo;swallowers&rdquo; or &ldquo;stuffers&rdquo; and have created, and continue to create, serious problems for the Customs and Excise service.  The question of the extent and legality of search of such persons' bodies requires the fullest examination and the establishment of guidelines for the officers involved. Similarly, the duration of such search &mdash; presumably until the suspected concealed substance is discovered or passed through the body &mdash; requires clarification.  The Committee was advised that it can take from five to seven days for such concealed substances to pass through the body.</P>
    <P>In one recorded case it took 15 days.</P>
    <P>The Customs service operates, in so far as their role in drug-smuggling is concerned, under the provisions of the Customs Consolidation Act 1876 and the Dangerous Drugs Act 1934 which restrict the importation of certain controlled drugs.  Customs Officers are concerned with detecting offences involving the movement of such drugs across the customs frontier...</P>
    <P>The report goes on to outline the various types of Customs Officers we have and their general role.  To be more specific about the customs procedures for dealing with drug smuggling:</P>
    <P>This matter was discussed with the representatives of both the Customs Union and the Revenue Commissioners. The Committee understand that, at present, when a Customs Officer seizes a quantity of dangerous drugs from an arriving passenger/crew member, it is the practice to contact the Garda Drugs Squad.  The time lapse between detection of the drugs and the arrival of the Garda Drugs Squad, which can sometimes be substantial, means that there is, in effect, a type of &ldquo;limbo&rdquo; period during which the offender, as far as Customs and Excise are concerned, is technically at least, free to continue his/her journey.  The Customs Union representatives contend <Col N="143" /> that quite apart from the often embarrassing situations which can arise during such periods, it is very wasteful of the valuable time of both the Garda Drugs Squad and their members to have this duplication built into the system.</P>
    <P>While Officers of Customs and Excise have statutory powers of arrest under the Customs (Consolidation) Act, 1876, there is an administrative prohibition by the Revenue Commissioners on the exercise of this power.  It appears that this prohibition was introduced because of the low level of penalties prescribed in the 1876 Act. It is preferable to await the arrival of the Gardaí and have proceedings, if any, taken under the Mis-Use of Drugs Act, 1977.  The Committee consider this to be a major problem and one which should be remedied immediately.</P>
    <P>Officers of Customs and Excise are responsible for efforts to combat drug smuggling at the point of import only (or its immediate vicinity) while the illicit supply or use of drugs in all other areas of the country is a matter for the Gardaí.  There is a very close working relationship between the Gardaí and the Customs Officers and this spirit of co-operation must be continued and every effort and opportunity should be made or utilised to build on this solid basis.</P>
    <P>The Committee consider that immediate steps should be taken to enable Officers of Customs and Excise to play a more effective part in the fight against the supply of illegal drugs.</P>
    <P>The Committee recommend&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  The provisions of Sections 23, 26, 27 (1) and (3), 28 and 29 of the Mis-Use of Drugs Act, 1977 should be extended to Officers of Customs and Excise.  [Section 6 below].</P>
    <P>2.  A small Customs Drugs Unit should be established within the Customs service.</P>
    <P>I gather from the Minister that this has already been done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="144" /> Once the provisions of the Mis-Use of Drugs Act, 1977 are extended to Officers of Customs and Excise, they should be free to immediately arrest and charge a person found to be smuggling drugs at a point of entry to the country.  It will be necessary to ensure continued close co-operation and liaison with the Garda Drugs Squad as, in certain cases, it may be considered more appropriate not to detain and arrest a suspected smuggler so as to give the Gardaí the opportunity to catch other persons involved in the supply of drugs.</P>
    <P>Section 186 of the Customs (Consolidation) Act, 1876 provides that penalties for smuggling will relate to the value of the smuggled goods.  There is an obvious problem in relation to the valuation of drugs which may need urgent expert examination and consideration. This problem would be overcome if the provisions of the 1977 Act were applied to Officers of Customs and Excise.</P>
    <P>The above recommendations should be incorporated in the Mis-Use of Drugs Bill, 1984, which is at present before the House and which provides an ideal opportunity for tackling this problem without any delay.</P>
    <P>In general terms, the Bill is giving to Customs and Excise officers powers that have already been given to the Garda in 1977.  The Minister has indicated that he proposes to increase some of the penalties outlined under the Bill as initiated by the previous Government.  While I support the Bill there are a few questions which I would like to put.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (1) states:</P>
    <P>An Officer of Customs and Excise who with reasonable cause suspects that a person at or in the vicinity of any port or airport or the Land Frontier is in possession of a controlled drug which&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  was imported, or</P>
    <P>(b)  is being, or is intended to be, exported&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="145" /> contrary to any prohibition or restriction on the importation or exportation thereof (as the case may be) may without warrant&mdash;</P>
    <P>do certain things.  We will deal with the certain things he or she can do in a minute.  But how does one determine when a Customs and Excise officer has reasonable cause? The word &ldquo;suspects&rdquo; can be interpreted very broadly.  I may suspect many things but when will my suspicion relate to the provisions of the Bill?  Another phrase, &ldquo;a person at or in the vicinity of ...&rdquo;, is very broad.  For example, could I, who lives 35 miles from the Border, be considered to be living in the vicinity of the Border?  What distance from the Border will constitute &ldquo;the vicinity&rdquo;?  Will it be 100 yards, two miles or 35 miles or in a small country like ours is it the entire island which, possibly, it should be?  I do not know how it will be possible to satisfy the courts in regard to &ldquo;reasonable cause&rdquo;?  What will constitute &ldquo;suspicion&rdquo;? Will a person crossing the Border with a bulge in his pocket be suspected?  Will a customs officer be obliged to divulge the reason he has for suspecting an individual?  Will he be obliged to say: &ldquo;I have information from an agent that he is carrying drugs&rdquo;?  We should clear up those difficulties. Section 2 states that a customs officer may:</P>
    <P>(i)  search the person and, if he considers it necessary for that purpose, detain the person for such time as is reasonably necessary for carrying out the search.</P>
    <P>What is meant by &ldquo;reasonably necessary&rdquo;? Will it be five days, seven days or 15 days?  Will a customs officer have the power to detain an individual until a substance has passed through the body which may take five or seven days?  The section goes on to state:</P>
    <P>(ii)  search any vehicle, vessel or aircraft in which he suspects that a controlled drug may be found (and any substance, article or other thing on or in the vehicle, vessel or aircraft) and <Col N="146" /> for the purpose of carrying out the search may, if he thinks fit, require the person for the time being in control of the vehicle, vessel or aircraft to bring it to a stop and when stopped to refrain from moving it, or if the vehicle, vessel or aircraft is already stationary, to refrain from moving it, and</P>
    <P>(iii)  examine (by opening or otherwise) and seize and detain anything found in the course of a search under this section which appears to him to be something which might be required as evidence in proceedings for an offence under the Customs Acts or under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984.</P>
    <P>(2) (a) Where an officer of Customs and Excise decides to search a person under this section, he may require the person to accompany him to a Customs Office or to such other place as may be specified by the officer for the purpose of being so searched at that Office or other place.</P>
    <P>I hope I will be satisfied with the Minister's explanation in regard to those provisions.</P>
    <P>I have a high regard for the Customs and Excise officers, and the Garda, who are leading the fight against drug trafficking but there is always the possibility of abuse.  We must ensure that no damage is done to innocent individuals or their property while, at the same time, we must pursue those who are dealing in drugs. We must not encroach on the civil rights of individuals, and that can be difficult. How much power should we give to certain officials to protect us from ourselves and when will those powers amount to an infringement on civil rights?  If a customs officer spots an individual he does not like crossing the Border from Lifford to Strabane &mdash; this will rarely happen but once would be enough &mdash; can he detain that individual on the basis that he suspects he is carrying drugs?  Can that individual be held on that basis for six or seven days?  Can we guard against that happening?</P>
    <P>I am not qualified to comment on all the provisions in the Bill but I can see problems arising.  Can a person be stopped <Col N="147" /> and detained where there is no suspicion of drug importation but where there is a suspicion of the illegal importation of commercial goods?  Can a person be detained and searched to establish if he or she is carrying goods other than drugs?  Can a customs official who has detained an individual on suspicion of importing drugs prosecute that individual for the illegal importation of commercial goods?</P>
    <P>I accept that damage is being done to certain businesses, and the economy, arising out of the importation of goods, particularly electrical items and spirits, but there is another type of &ldquo;smuggler&rdquo; involved, the person who nips across the Border to purchase petrol, a bottle of whiskey or some household goods.  It may be against our economy, and may hurt local shopkeepers but it is a common practice.  It has always been Fianna Fáil policy to work to eliminate the Border but the Minister for Finance in introducing the 48-hour restriction has helped trading on our side of the Border and has substantiated a Border that was disappearing. Hopefully, the Border will disappear not through the actions of Paisleys, Robinsons, Humes, Haugheys, FitzGeralds or others but through the development of the European Community. When the economic border disappears the other Border will go. However, through the 48-hour restriction the Minister has secured the Border.</P>
    <P>We must differentiate between the &ldquo;smuggler&rdquo;, the person who brings a few items across the Border and may now be open to prosecution, and the professional smuggler who takes across goods from which he expects to make profit and the drug smuggler.  The worst individual is the drug smuggler but I would write off the person who brings across a few items because it is human nature to buy items that are cheaper on the other side of the Border.</P>
    <P>I would like to have had two Bills, one dealing with what you might call commercial smuggling and the other dealing with drug smuggling.  If, according to section 2 of the Bill, a person is stopped <Col N="148" /> because a customs officer has reasonable cause to suspect that that person in the vicinity of the land frontier is in possession of a controlled drug, if he is detained for that purpose and it is found that he does not have the said drug, can that person then be prosecuted for carrying other items, for what we might call commercial smuggling?  If so, does that come under another section or under section 2?  Is it specifically written elsewhere in the Bill that I have not yet had the chance to read?</P>
    <P>To broaden the debate I, and our side of the House, support the Bill.  It was initiated by this side of the House and the Minister has acted wisely to avoid any friction that might arise in leaving it precisely as it was, even though he proposes to introduce some amendments on increasing fines, etc.  It is obvious that parts of our society have suffered tremendously from drugs.  The figures quoted by the Minister startled me because of how small they were.</P>
    <P>It was stated that steady progress had been made by customs officers on the detection of drugs and that there were 47 seizures of heroin, cocaine and cannabis in its various forms by customs officers in 1986, with a street value of £42,000.  I am amazed that that figure is so small.  One half decent haul would give £42,000 worth of drugs.  During this half year, the 24 seizures total £12,000; double that for the whole year and you have £24,000. Either we are getting to grips with the problem, which I hope we are, or as I suspect, our detection rate is not quite that good because from some reports I have read of debates in other places, one would not see £10 worth of one of those drugs on one's thumbnail, the quantities that have major value being so small.</P>
    <P>Lest anybody should think I am being critical of Customs and Excise officers or of the Garda Síochána, I will put on record, as the Minister has done already, my total support for them in this and all other efforts to prevent crime of all kinds and smuggling of all kinds.  However, there is always the odd apple that can rot the barrel.  Is is possible that these <Col N="149" /> powers, if given, can be abused?  Somebody who wrote to me said that the amount of money involved in drugs is so large that some customs officers, or members of the Garda Síochána, or Members of this House, or anyone else for that matter, could be financially in the pocket of some of these drug smugglers. At the level of drug smuggling in this country and the level of money to be made that is not just possible; it is quite likely that there are such persons in existence.</P>
    <P>I hope the legislation would not interefere with the general life style, and I doubt that it will, but there is always danger for a person residing along the Border, or in the vicinity of the Border. I seek clarification of those definitions of &ldquo;vicinity&rdquo;, &ldquo;suspicion&rdquo; and &ldquo;reasonable cause&rdquo;.  With those exceptions, I wholeheartedly support the Minister and the Government on the introduction of this Bill.  There is no opposition to it from this side.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleague from the Border county, I welcome the provisions of this Bill.  I was interested to learn that he lives 35 miles from the Border.  I live 20 miles from it.  I do not know whether it has any particular significance, but perhaps it shows that the Members of the House who in a sense will be living with the consequences of a Bill of this nature are those physically living in the area where many of its provisions will be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from welcoming the overall thrust of it and having listened to Senator Loughrey detailing the recommendations of the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism, there are a couple of points I should like to make. Like Senator Loughrey, while I welcome the provisions, I sometimes feel that whenever we are talking about an increase in legislation we are in some way diminishing civil rights.  After all, the vast majority of the population, people travelling between this country and other countries, are law abiding.  Laws and provisions of this nature are for the minority. It seems that whenever we talk about <Col N="150" /> debating new legislation which in a sense is restrictive, we are further eroding our rights as citizens.  As the common good must be served, obviously it is an indication of the times in which we live that such laws have to be framed and acted on.</P>
    <P>It has been a source of criticism for some years past, particularly since the drug culture became evident, that the powers which exist for Customs and Excise officers have been limited in their scope.  In that context where a suspected drug smuggler comes into this country and is apprehended, from what I can gather the gardaí would have to be called before the Customs and Excise officer could initiate any action.  These officers did not have the powers to detain which up to now the gardaí have had and, in that respect, the section which deals with that aspect of it is very welcome.  In his outline of the various aspects of the Bill, the Minister made the point very forcibly that the whole thrust of the Bill is contained in the sections relating to extra powers for the Customs and Excise officers.</P>
    <P>I was rather interested to note that he said steady progress has been made by customs officers in the detection of drug smuggling and he then went on to mention 47 seizures of heroin, cocaine and cannabis in its various forms by customs officers in 1986, that these drugs had a street value of £42,000 and that, up to the end of June of this year, there were 24 seizures by customs officers of drugs valued at £12,000.  When you correlate that with the statement from Senator Loughrey earlier &mdash; and I have no reason to doubt it &mdash; that it costs between £100 and £300 for a drug addict to have a daily fix, perhaps the figures for seizures should be put in their proper context.  Those 47 seizures realising a street value of £42,000 mean that on average each seizure was worth no more than perhaps £800 to £900 and in the period up to June 24 seizures realising £12,000 at street value are no more than an average of £600.</P>
    <P>These are really paltry figures when one considers the worldwide valuation put on illicit drug smuggling.  Perhaps it <Col N="151" /> is a further indication of the very serious difficulties that have been facing customs officers up to now in trying to detect drug smuggling on the larger and more sophisticated scale.  It really is sophisticated drug smugglers we are talking about here.</P>
    <P>I would be inclined to think, although there are no details given behind those figures, that the seizures to date as listed by the Minister come from small time petty criminals, perhaps from drug addicts who have been unable to obtain drugs in this country or who, alternatively, may not be citizens of this country at all but who are carrying drugs for their own use.  It is most unlikely, based on those figures, that anybody would run the gauntlet of bringing in such small amounts of drugs, to import them illegally in order to try to release them for sale on the streets.  Considering that the average works out at between £600 and £800, based on the Custom and Excise seizure figures, and that, as Senator Loughrey said, the daily fix for an addict costs between £100 and £300, those figures tell their own story as to the reasons this legislation is needed. Section 3 of the Bill gives added powers of search to Customs and Excise officers. As I said earlier, taken together sections 2 and 3 will, as the Minister pointed out, increase the effectiveness of the Customs and Excise service in making detections and, while the checks envisaged will form an important part of our first line of defence, great reliance must continue to be placed on information provided by the Garda.  This would seem to suggest that while the legislation as proposed will go some way towards reducing illicit drug smuggling, the Government feel greater reliance will still be placed on the method of detection, on the Garda generally and on other agencies such as the customs agencies in other countries in regard to the movement of drug traffickers.  Therefore, we should not be over enthusiastic about the provisions in the Bill.  Judging from the comments made by the Minister, this legislation will not result <Col N="152" /> immediately in very large and significant detections of illicit drugs entering the country but at least it is a good start. I should now like to move on to another aspect of the Minister's speech, that is, in regard to the land frontier and the illicit smuggling of drink, oil products and electrical goods.  The Minister went on, quite rightly, to point out that smuggling damages local retailers, wholesalers and manufacturers and robs the Exchequer of vitally important revenue.  Coming as I do from a Border county, as I said earlier, and within quick driving distance of the Border I am re-echoing the fears and the criticisms of traders along the Border from Donegal in the west through Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and into Louth that, despite the best efforts of the Government, particularly their provision in the budget this year of the 48 hour rule, there is still largescale and significant smuggling of goods, particularly those goods as outlined by the Minister, into this State.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody has all the answers to this problem.  Indeed, the Minister made the point that the lasting solution to the problem is the equalisation of prices and that the Republic of Ireland has a particularly difficult problem on the Border with the Six Counties. I usually prefer to refer to that portion of our country as the Six Counties rather than giving it the status of a state by calling it Northern Ireland. The Minister went on to say that significant price differentials between the North and the South provide a strong incentive for smuggling.  Comments have been made over the past six months since the implementation of the 48 hour rule by retailers in the north east portion, particularly around Newry where the vast majority of Southern shoppers have traditionally gone for their bargains, and by retailers living along the border in this part of the country.  These comments would seem to suggest that, while the illicit importation of goods into the State by people from Cork and Kerry who travel to the North in coaches seems to have been significantly reduced, and perhaps been stopped altogether, individuals <Col N="153" /> are still getting through the net.  I think all of us would accept whether or not we are involved in business, that the biggest turnover in the type of goods we are talking about, electrical goods, oil products and drink, at consumer level takes place in the last quarter of any given year and more specifically in the month of December leading up to Christmas. We have been told there are staffing problems and that as a result of the economic situation the Customs and Excise service is fully stretched along the Border.  As those of us who live along the Border know, the land frontier is practically unsupervisable.  Indeed, not even the British Army with all their resources can seal off the land frontier from the northern side.  Therefore, it is reasonable for me to suggest that a country such as ours with its limited financial resources would be similarly unable to seal off the Border.  Therefore, this is not a criticism, implied or otherwise, of the customs officers; it is just a fact of life. Accepting that there is a very genuine difficulty in totally stopping the flow into and out of the State, may I make a suggestion to the Minister of State that she should discuss with her colleagues, specifically the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Justice, the possibility of stepping up both Army and Garda patrols along the main routes to the north east over the Christmas period?  I believe there is nothing that will deter people who are thinking of going north more than the presence on the main arteries out of this State to the north east of Army and Garda patrols.</P>
    <P>I accept that there is an over-stretching of resources in the Custom and Excise service and similarly in both the Garda and the Army, but if we as a Government are to live up to our responsibilities to the traders who live along the Border areas from Louth to Donegal who are being savaged &mdash; that is the only word one can think of; and after all they are citizens of this country who pay taxes and have a vote &mdash; patrols should be stepped up particularly around the Christmas period, say from December 1 onwards. If it were to be widely publicised in both <Col N="154" /> the national and local media that these patrols would be extremely active during the three to four week period leading up to Christmas, I have no doubt that there would be a severe reduction in the number of people who would contemplate going north as individuals &mdash; this is what the cross-Border traders have been talking about &mdash; to places such as Newry to buy drink, electrical goods and other products because of the price differential. These patrols would have a very genuine effect and without labouring the point, I hope the Minister will take that on board and do something of that nature taking into account the financial restrictions.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Loughrey, I am also searching for the other relevant portions of the legislation as they would apply to the area in which I live and for those which will infringe on rights.  Section 9 deals with the onus of proof in certain proceedings relating to exported goods or goods seized under the Customs Acts. It goes on to state that in respect of goods suspected of having been illegally imported, the onus of proving that the goods were lawfully imported rests on the defendant.  It further provides for a similar onus in relation to goods suspected of having been illegally exported or of being intended for illegal exportation.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the comments of Senator Manning are yet another indication of the reasons for legislation.  If the goods in question were smuggled out, perhaps we need more than new laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was dealing with section 9 of the Bill in which the onus in relation to goods suspected of having been illegally exported and imported rests with the defendant and I was gong to say the onus of proving where the goods originated <Col N="156" /> or whether they were lawfully imported, exported or otherwise lawfully dealt with for exportation, is on the person bringing the proceedings.  This has been a bone of contention with me, and I know with many other people, not just as it relates to Customs and Excise but to the Revenue Commissioners and the area of finance gathering in this country.  I accept the motives behind the premise, that if somebody is in breach of the law, particularly in revenue matters, it should not be up to the Revenue Commissioners or the Customs and Excise officials to have to prove the case, it should be up to the individual to disprove what the Revenue Commissioners and the Customs and Excise officials accuse them of.  While I do not expect that anything I say will change it one iota, it seems to be somewhat draconian and unfair to the vast majority of people.</P>
    <P>Of course the revenue gathering agencies need to be protected in situations where people can exploit the law or where they are in breach of the law.  In those situations the revenue gathering agencies should not have to use their limited resources, time and effort not only to accuse somebody of doing something but prove the accusation.  I can understand the motives behind it but in this particular area, for example, where we are talking about somebody who would take proceedings against the Customs and Excise.  I believe very few citizens of this State would take an action against either the Revenue Commissioners or Customs and Excise officials unless they felt they had been hard done by and that the accusations which were levelled at them were basically untrue.  It is very unfair that not only would somebody have to go through all of the processes of law to get into a court but when he would have the representatives of the Customs and Excise or the Revenue Commissioners sitting back smugly or otherwise, saying nothing or doing nothing.  The judge would then say to the individual concerned &ldquo;The Revenue Commissioners have to say nothing, the Customs and Excise officials have to say nothing, you are the person <Col N="157" /> that brought the proceedings so now you prove or disprove, as the case may be, their accusation.&rdquo;  I do not know where the middle ground is but it has been a bone of contention for a long time and I welcome the opportunity of at least articulating a point of view in that area.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech &mdash; and I have not noticed this to the same extent in the Bill &mdash; said that section 16 increases from £50 to £500 the penalty for resisting an officer in the performance of &ldquo;his&rdquo; duty.  There are, of course, very worthy female members of the customs and excise and I hope that is not an indication of the male chauvinism in the Department of Finance showing its ugly head.  I am sure it is not but it has cropped up.  It is a natural error.  I do not want to give the impression that I am suddenly becoming a sponsor of the feminist movement but I think that we should talk about male and female.  Senator O'Toole and the Minister made comments but I missed both of them and perhaps it is just as well that I did.</P>

    <P>The Minister said also that the changes in the future development of the European Community will have a big impact.  In the overall context of those remarks, I want to again make a plea to the Government. I know they are trying to do what they can and I recognise that the decision of the Minister for Finance and of the <Col N="158" /> Government generally to institute the 48-hour rule was with the very highest of motives.  It most certainly has made a difference to the day trippers from the southern part of the country going north. It has cut that out and eliminated it but the problem has not gone away: there are businesses closing in Border counties weekly and there are people whose livelihoods are at risk.  At present we have the problem of emigration and we do not want to add to it.  I am not suggesting any specific solutions to it.  I know I am only one of many people who has brought up this subject but I feel I would be failing in my duty as a public representative from a Border county if I did not once again highlight the extreme economic distress many traders in the Border counties are currently experiencing.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the EC have a role to play in this.  The Minister touched on this in his speech.  As a member state of the European Community we are expected to enforce and improve our customs and excise service, to improve our detection rates and enforce a new law that will come into being as the Community harmonises and as we strengthen external frontiers.  As a country with an external frontier in Europe, I believe there is an obligation on the European Community to finance any provisions which result in improving our customs and excise service. I have no doubt that the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State for European Affairs will keep that very much to the forefront of their negotiations at European level.  Like my colleagues on all sides of the House, I believe this legislation has been long overdue and I welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the legislation and I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, to the House.  This is my first opportunity during this session of the House, to welcome the Minister.  I commend the Government for having continued to look at the extension of the duties and functions of Customs and Excise officers, as was the intention of the previous Government. <Col N="159" /> A colleague of mine, a previous Minister for Health, in his day redefined some of the functions of officers of the Customs and Excise in that he extended their role not just to commercial smuggling of goods but also to the whole area of the importation of drugs and forbidden substances in which, unfortunately, this country is now in the throes as well as every other civilised country in the world.</P>
      <P>We are subjected to this trauma that is brought about by drug trafficking, drug trading, illegitimate importation of drugs and illicit street trading in drugs.  It is obvious from the figures provided by the Minister today that, in spite of an improvement in the detection rate by the Customs and Excise officers in the drugs area as opposed to other substances, we certainly have not tackled the whole question of the illegal importation of drugs.  It is obvious from the statistics available elsewhere &mdash; in the known treatment centres in Dublin &mdash; that the amount of drugs available on the streets of our country towns and cities is an indication of the level of that problem.  It is also obvious from those figures that we have not been able to tackle it at the point of importation by air or any other form of transportation that brings people, goods and illicit goods into our country. Any legislation that attempts to tidy up this area must be welcomed by all, of us.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has promised to increase the penalties on Committee Stage because, if the penalties are not severe enough, there will be no incentive for people not to import dangerous substances like illicit drugs, heroin, cocaine and so on.  The extended powers given to Customs and Excise officers improves the whole thrust of the Bill.  This has been dealt with by our two colleagues who live close to the Border.  They are rightly concerned about the implications of Border crossings which affect ordinary commercial goods more than drugs. Nobody can be sure what area is exempt from drug trafficking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that we are giving Customs and Excise officers the right of detention and arrest based on the normal grounds of <Col N="160" /> suspicion and searching will they be subjected to the same rules that now apply to members of the Garda Síochána?  This arose following the Garda Complaints Bill which was enacted by both Houses of the Oireachtas and was obligatory legislation before the new Criminal Justice Bill was enacted.  That Bill gives the public the right to object to unfair treatment by members of the Garda Síochána. Will the Customs and Excise officers who will now have new powers of arrest conferred, also be subjected to the same critical analysis by the public?  This extended power could be dangerous. They could be subjected to extremes of assault and abuse by people who, for obvious reasons, will be under tremendous pressure if they are suddenly faced with arrest. Is it contemplated that these officers will be armed in the course of their duty at that level?  If not, members of the Garda Síochána will be at a tremendous disadvantage.</P>
    <P>In the course of last week's debate on the extension of the law relating to drunken driving and other offences on our roads, published statistics were referred to which indicated that there was a drop in the numbers of cases being brought before the courts and being reported by members of the Garda Síochána. The Garda are now extremely careful about doing anything in the course of their duty that would allow them to be subjected to critical investigation, public inquiry and a possible loss of their job in an area in which in the past they had a certain amount of discretion.  I am not suggesting for a moment that at times that discretion was not abused which gave rise to the necessity for legislation to protect people from being unfairly treated by members of our security forces.  If we are giving new powers to the Customs and Excise officers &mdash; the power of arrest and searching &mdash; they would be subjected to the same critical analysis as members of the Garda Síochána.  Otherwise the two sections of our security forces will have different sets of rules and regulations. The statistics which indicate a reduction of activity by the Garda in some areas are a result of legislation we <Col N="161" /> all felt was a good thing.  The public we are dealing with now are sophisticated. They know their rights quickly and better than anybody else.  They know their rights in court and get away on technicalities.</P>
    <P>This is my only source of concern about the legislation.  I welcome the fact that we are trying seriously to attack the problem of illicit importation of drugs and substances into this country.  If we do not tackle it, we will finish up in the same situation as other countries in the western world which have suffered from the awful scourge of drug pushers and importers, and people making colossal amounts of money at the expense of unfortunate people who have become addicted to some of these substances.  Anything that a Government can do to try to stifle the source of supply must be welcomed.</P>
    <P>There were some excellent contributions from other Senators.  We welcome the total conversion of Senator Loughrey, which he outlined here, from all his addictions in the past &mdash; drink, smoking and all sorts of other problems he had, and conquered thankfully.  He obviously missed one of the most desirable pastimes of the Senator who supplied all of us with beautiful coloured photographs.  I am glad he excluded that particular weakness from his conversion. Long may his desires last in that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, at the point of entry. &ldquo;Vicinity&rdquo; has not been defined.  Previous contributors live in the vicinity of the Border.  I am living in the vicinity of harbours at Waterford and Cork and the airports at Cork and Shannon.  Some of these could be considered to be in the vicinity of Tipperary.  I presume if customs officers had reason to believe somebody was involved in importing any substance illegally, particularly drugs, they would have the ability to follow them, or they could be arrested by a Customs and Excise officer.  Under the extended powers of arrest in this Bill, if somebody is arrested by a customs officer will they be subjected to the same criteria as laid down under the Garda Complaints Bill?  If not, there could be an abuse by the public because of the limitations on some of our security forces.</P>
      <P>Generally the thrust of the Bill is right. There is a need to tighten up that area and to leave no doubt whatsoever as to the powers being conferred on the frontline people in regard to dealing with the obvious law breakers.  It is appropriate that we legislate to afford those frontline people the full backing of the rigours of the law.  We must be careful though that in so doing we ensure that they be subject to the same regulations as those obtaining to people in other areas of our Defence Forces, particularly the Garda, and who also have the right of arrest.  The volume of complaints lodged against members of the Garda Síochána is an indication of people's awareness of their rights.  People are not slow to lodge formal complaints and render life as difficult as possible for those on whom we confer powers in the interest of the preservation of the common good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill in principle.  I hope that on Committee State we will be able <Col N="163" /> to discuss the promised amendments from the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa chomh maith fáilte a chur roimh an mBille seo.  Tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh sé an-difríocht don obair atá romhainn inniu.</P>
      <P>I wholeheartedly welcome this Bill whose provisions aim to give powers to Customs and Excise officers to tackle the drugs problem, particularly in relation to drug smuggling.  Its provisions also seek to effect a number of amendments to existing legislation.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward the Bill at this time.</P>
      <P>That we need legislation at all levels to combat the horrific problem of drug abuse &mdash; one of the main scourges of modern times &mdash; is unquestionable.  Anything that can be done to help stem trafficking in drugs is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>The society in which we live is always changing.  Events conspire to make change necessary.  To sit still and lose touch with reality is to become obsolete and of little use.  The need for change within the operations of Customs and Excise is necessary if the officials are to adequately carry out the functions with which they are entrusted.  We must be prepared at all times to consider new options, new ways of doing things.  We must provide our Customs and Excise officers with every means and support to carry out their duties with the maximum possible success.</P>
      <P>If we look at the change that has taken place in the past 25 years or so in relation to the growth in crime statistics we find that, whereas in 1965 there were 16,737 crimes reported, by 1983 this figure had grown to a massive 102,387.  Those are statistics from the <i>Garda Review</i>, September, 1987.  I do not have a figure for the number of those crimes related to drug abuse or which were in some way connected therewith.  I should imagine a sizeable proportion of those crimes are drug related in one way or another.</P>
      <P>Our efforts and attitudes must focus more on prevention rather than investigation after the event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="164" /> The Second Report of the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism recognised the huge problem created by the misuse of drugs and the close relationship between illicit drugs and crime.  That the smuggling of illegal drugs into the country is of major concern is unquestionable.  When the law relating to the stocking of drugs in chemists' shops and so on was tightened up drugs dealers placed more emphasis on the illegal importation of these drugs.  It is necessary that every avenue of abuse be sealed off and that the customs officials play a frontline role in this respect.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said in his introductory remarks, the barriers at point of entry must be geared to tackle the sources and prevent those drugs reaching the streets. If trafficking in illegal drugs can be curtailed, the horrific suffering, misery and hopelessness of drug addicts and the enormous problems of families dealing with the problem at first hand can be allievated and controlled.</P>
    <P>That criminals should not profit from crime goes with saying.  This is particularly so in relation to drug trafficking. There is no penalty sufficiently severe to deal with people who live and grow rich on human misery.  The current selling price of heroin in Pakistan is around £3,000 per kilo while the street price in Dublin is about £300 per gram or £3,00,000 per kilo.  My source of information is the Sixth Report of the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism.  These figures more than adequately demonstrate the huge profits such evil persons can reap.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris said earlier that he was concerned about difficulties in relation to apprehension and so on when one bore in mind the powers given customs officials.  He instanced difficulties in relation to the Garda.  In relation to drug trafficking and illicit importation of drugs nobody would seriously question whatever approach might be adopted to ensure that such illicit importation of drugs is prevented and/or controlled.  I would support any measure, however strong or difficult to implement &mdash; to <Col N="165" /> ensure that this tragic and horrific difficulty we encounter at present is overcome.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that generally those caught in possession of illegal drugs are very seldom the brains behind such operations and that the Godfathers can comfortably afford to lose some consignments. The more of these imports we can detect the more difficult it will be for those people to make huge profits.  We must be vigilant always because inevitably one finds that when one avenue is closed attempts are made to open another.</P>
    <P>International co-operation is of paramount importance in the whole area of drug smuggling.  Every available resource internationally should be used to improve the level of co-operation on an international basis.  I know the Minister and the Government regard this as a very high priority.</P>
    <P>I welcome the other provisions of the Bill in relation to smuggling generally. Commercial smuggling in certain goods, such as drink, oil products and electrical goods as mentioned by the Minister has very serious consequences in terms of its effect on retailers and commercial outlets in addition to constituting a loss of revenue to the Exchequer.  The public at large seem to have a somewhat benevolent attitude toward this type of operation. If we think seriously of these consequences then, in the interests of our economy and people we must welcome any effort to stamp out this type of abuse. It must be heart breaking and demoralising for business people &mdash; who legitimately try to earn a living and employ people &mdash; to hear of and observe others who can undersell them by as much as 50 per cent, and more in some cases, and who pay no dues to anybody.</P>
    <P>Like the Minister I want to pay tribute to the customs officials who have a very difficult job.  They are often depicted as people with no heart who should be avoided like the plague.  Their work is of the utmost importance.  There is an onus and responsibility on us to give them the utmost support and every means available <Col N="166" /> to carry ou their difficult job effectively.</P>
    <P>The Bill has my whole-hearted support. I cannot over-emphasise &mdash; as somebody who deals with young people on a regular basis &mdash; the dreadful consequences of drug trafficking.  Inevitably it is those people most vunerable who are the people who are attacked in relation to the use of drugs and so on.  Young people want to be as good as their peers, to be part of the crowd.  Sometimes they find themselves in situations in which they do not feel part of the crowd if they do not participate in certain activities at any given time.  There is a type of unfortunate social type of trendiness in trying different things, having a go at this and that. Unfortunately included in those activities is drug taking.</P>
    <P>Everyone recognises that people start off on these soft drugs and they think it is not of much consequence.  You have these people who will say that particular types of soft drugs are not addictive.  To me that is an absolute and utter nonsense. What happens with the soft drugs is that the kick goes out of it after a very short period of time and people want to get something stronger to get a better kick out of it.  Before they know where they are they are addicted to strong drugs such as heroin and other drugs.  Anything that can be done to stem the flow of drugs into this country is to be welcomed.  I give the Bill my wholehearted support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the difficulties about discussing a Bill like this which purports to deal with the problem of drug abuse and misuse is that to speak against it is almost like speaking in favour of sin. For that reason I would like to say that I have had a long involvement in the area of drugs abuse and misuse.  I am surprised at some of the approaches being taken in this Bill.  I intend to look at it from a number of different angles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first and most important point which has to be put forward to anybody involved in the drugs scene is that the drugs problem will never be cured by the most efficient customs service in the world.  It has never purported to set out <Col N="167" /> to do that and it never will do that.  The other thing I say at the beginning, just to establish my position as regards the representative of the Department of Finance, is that I do not have confidence in the Department of Finance's trust in the customs service.  I think they have always seen it as something to guard the Revenue, that the area of customs itself was something like agency work which was not part of their remit.  They may well be right because I have often felt that that part of the customs service should be dealt with in another Department.  It has suffered and suffered badly for that reason over the years.</P>
    <P>I believe what my colleague, Senator McKenna, has said about the huge profits to be made in drugs importation, drugs abuse and trafficking and selling of drugs. Certainly the figures are quite right.  The latest figures from the Council of Europe indicate that the cocaine being bought or sold in the Andes or in South America is selling on the streets of Europe or New York for sometimes like 600 times the factor.  There are huge amounts of money involved.  I stress that point because there is so much money involved in it that traffickers can afford to buy aeroplanes. They fill them with cocaine, get a pilot to take that aeroplane through or across any border and land it in the rough somewhere. They abandon perfectly good jet aircraft of the most modern type, take the cargo from it and work out enough profit to make that kind of activity profitable.  That is one of the reasons why no customs force will cure drug abuse or drug misuse.</P>
    <P>I take issue with one other point. People refer to soft drugs.  There are no soft drugs.  There is no such thing as a soft drug.  We do that in order, in a sense, to anaesthetise ourselves from our own involvement and the fact that we might be smokers or drinkers.  I certainly would be prepared to say that I drink too much. We have a society where drugs have the cure for everything.  From childbirth to death drugs are used all the way &mdash; whether it be to make childbirth a less painful activity &mdash; to curing infants at a <Col N="168" /> very young age.  We are rearing a generation who see a cure in drugs for every problem.  We are rearing a generation who see the whole access to and the whole social life revolving around drug use: I am talking about tobacco and alcohol particularly.  We are trying to say to young people that at the end of the day drugs are bad.  The are not stupid.  They see cures for drugs coming out of bottles, they see people going out drinking, smoking and enjoying themselves.  In that context you cannot fool young people by saying that drugs are bad.  The reason I have stressed this point &mdash; and it is slightly pushing what is covered in the Bill but it does refer to it and the Minister referred to it &mdash; is that the only way drugs abuse or misuse can ever be cured or at least brought down to manageable levels is by having proper and effective prevention educational strategies.  That is not going to be.  The demise of the Health Education Bureau &mdash; I am not going to dwell on it &mdash; is very sad indeed.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the National Drugs Abuse Co-ordinating Committee &mdash; that is the Minister for Health's committee.  I am also a member of a number of European and national committees on the whole area of drugs abuse and misuse. Drug abuse and misuse will not be dealt with by this Bill and anybody who thinks it can be is fooling themselves.  That is by way of starters.  It does attempt to meet and deal with certain problems.  I want also to speak from the point of view of the customs officials.</P>
    <P>As was quite rightly said by the previous speaker, Senator McKenna, they are very often cast in the worst possible light.  They are workers like many of the rest of us.  They are organised workers who are concerned and care about the jobs they are doing.  They are frustrated by the ineffectiveness of their work because of Government cutbacks and the fact that they are not supported where they feel they should be supported.  They are people who are prepared to use and get involved in the most modern techniques of drugs detection if they get the equipment, the training and the resources.  They are not getting those <Col N="169" /> things.  It is important that that should be stated and made quite clear.  I am prepared to go into detail on those issues should the Minister or anybody not take my word for it because I can certainly give chapter and verse on all of them.</P>
    <P>One of the big problems that has always made the customs officer's work very difficult in the area of importation of drugs has been what is referred to as the meeters and greeters.  In other words, if somebody comes off a plane or into a port, carrying some contraband material and meets somebody at the entry point and passes the contraband material over to them the customs officer does not have, under existing legislation, the authority to search, detain, arrest that other person.  The customs officer's authority only extended to the traveller.  Therefore, it was quite proper that the Government would seek to approach this problem.  They have approached it by the wording in the Bill, &ldquo;that an officer of Customs and Excise who with reasonable cause suspects that a person at or in the vicinity of any port or airport or the land frontier... &mdash; in other words, the person does not have to be a traveller, the person being at or in the vicinity of any port or airport.</P>
    <P>I would like to say to the drafters of this Bill that I am involved in a number of organisations where we look at rules quite regularly.  If somebody at an AGM of the most minor club of which I am a member put forward that as a serious rule that could be applied and implemented I would say they were nuts.  I was reared in a house where my father always said the worst kind of Government is a Government that introduces legislation which is unimplementable.  I want to know what &ldquo;at&rdquo; or &ldquo;near&rdquo; an airport or airstrip means.  For your information, there are roughly 56 airstrips in Ireland. There is no part of this country which is not &ldquo;at&rdquo; or &ldquo;near&rdquo; the vicinity of an airport, never mind ports.  I know that because I had reason to make a list of them quite recently.  It means nothing.</P>
    <P>I also want to make another point.  I can understand the feelings of people when they look at the problems caused <Col N="170" /> by drug traffickers, drug dealers, and so on, that no power is too much to give to the Garda or customs officers in this area. I have to say immediately I disagree with that totally.  I disagree with that as somebody who understands the background, who knows customs officers and who was reared by a Garda.  I think there should be checks and balances on everybody. I want to point out to people that the Member of the Oireachtas who has spoken longest and most vehemently and has taken as strong a stand as anybody on the question of drugs abuse has himself been stopped, searched and held on at least three occasions under the 1977 Act.  I think that is disgraceful.  I am pointing that out to say that it can be abused.  That does not mean it will be abused.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there should be rights of detention.  I believe there should be rights of arrest and search but it should be approached in a much more professional manner than the fire brigade action we are looking at in this Bill.  I accept the problems and I think they should be approached.  They should be approached on the basis that our whole legal system has been structured, that it would be better than 99 guilty people went free than that one innocent person finished up behind bars.  That is the whole basis of the legal system which we work.  I would like that to be kept in mind by people who draft Bills.</P>
    <P>To give you an idea of how easy it is for a customs officer to get this thing wrong on a charge sheet &mdash; I am sure it will come as a surprise to many people but it is something I have been hearing from customs officers for years now.  At present for a customs officer to charge a person he has to refer on the charge sheet to whichever is the appropriate section of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, section 2 of the Customs Act, 1956, the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, and the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1984, which sought to amend the 1977 Act.  Now we are bringing in another Bill, the 1987 Bill.  I am sure it will be news to the Minister that there are judges in this town who have thrown out the complicated charges <Col N="171" /> that have been brought before them by customs officers because they could not understand them.  They have thrown them out and asked for a charge to be brought under the 1977 Act.  We do not want a Customs and Excise (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  We want one statutory instrument to deal with customs. It is time we dealt with this matter properly.  It has been dealt with across the water.  I am not saying we should follow whatever is done there, but something should be done about the matter. Basically we are talking about the 1876 Act which was a Westminster Act.</P>
    <P>As I said, the judges dealing with these matters have been totally and utterly confused. The customs officers very often do not have enough power in these matters and therefore they have to bring in the Garda.  Up to now if somebody met a traveller at the airport and got illegal items from them the gardaí had to be called in before any action could be taken.  This meant delays and it also meant that people could escape from the airport.  This Bill quite rightly addresses that problem.</P>
    <P>When reading the Second Report of the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism I noticed that they asked if the powers of the Garda under the 1977 Act can be extended to include customs officers.  I would like a comprehensive reply to that question. Under a statutory instrument can the Minister decide to give that authority to customs officers?  Customs officers are completely and utterly frustrated because they do not have the power to deal properly with the matter.</P>
    <P>Contrary to popular belief the majority of drugs which are brought into this country come in tiny quantities in the bodies of travellers.  These people are referred to as swallowers or stuffers.  The names are self-explanatory but to put it in very polite terms they either swallow drugs which are usually kept in condoms or they stuff drugs in condoms into the body orifices.  It is in this way that most of the drugs are being brought into Ireland at present.  A person could be carrying, <Col N="172" /> inside his or her body, a condom full of heroin, which would be a fairly large amount.  The Bill states that the customs officer, &ldquo;with reasonable suspicion&rdquo; can detain a person.  The customs officer could get a phone call from the customs people in Manchester to say a person is on a plane who they have reason to believe is carrying drugs.  Under the present legislation the customs officer can try to hold the person but cannot do much about the matter.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill we propose to give the customs officer, without warrant, the right to search the person and, if he or she considers it necessary for that purpose, to detain the person for such time as is reasonably necessary to carry out the search.  That part of the Bill has caused me much concern.  It gives limited power without responsibility.  It does not state that there should be a check or a control. I discussed this matter with Customs and Excise officers who are frightened by what is proposed in this Bill.  They wonder what they are supposed to be doing, where they will detain the people, how they will detain them, on what grounds will they detain them, what is acceptable suspicion and how will they continue to do the job.  I ask the Minister to address that point.  I welcome the fact that the Bill addresses this matter.  Rather than being negative about this matter I made inquiries about what happens in other countries with the same problem. As I said earlier, I was involved in a number of international committees on the misuse of drugs.</P>
    <P>I intend to propose amendments to the Bill at a later stage.  I will be proposing that any legislation which gives powers to detain &mdash; I am not objecting to the right to detain; I am saying it must be controlled so that the rights of the citizen and the public are perfectly balanced and the tension which exists between the rigorous application of the law and the rights of the citizen leads to proper, progressive developments in this area &mdash; must specify what facilities there will be for detention. Where is the person to be detained?  It might seem unimportant to many people here but I can guarantee that the smart <Col N="173" /> lawyers will kick this out the door if proper detention facilities are not made available to enable the customs officers to carry out their job properly.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris asked who is responsible for detention.  This point will be raised time and time again in court and these cases will be lost on technicalities if this Bill goes through as it stands.  Somebody must be responsible for detention.  A custodial officer responsible for the statutory rights of the detained person should be appointed to ensure that the person is given his rights and is subjected to an acceptable level of questioning and tension. This custodial officer should be answerable to the courts.  The crude powers proposed in the Bill are unacceptable.</P>
    <P>There are powers of detention in Britain also.  The reason I am concerned about this matter is that, if I have this information, the people in the Department who drafted the Bill must also have it.  Obviously they decided to adopt this method of approach rather than that adopted in other countries and I want to know the reason for that.  This method contained in section 2 of the Bill is unacceptable and dangerous and, as far as the courts are concerned, it will be ineffective at the end of the day.  In Britain detention is allowed for up to 36 hours with the proviso that there is a six hourly review. In other words, every six hours the detention of a person is reviewed and a further six hours detention approved by somebody at the level of assistant principal officer or higher.  This is the type of strategy I would like to see included in this Bill, not that people can walk free.  I have seen the frustration of people in the inner city of Dublin watching known criminals walking away when everyone in the community knew they are guilty.  I am not prepared to tolerate that.  I want to protect the rights of the ordinary citizen and I think there is a way of doing so.</P>
    <P>I also wish to raise a point about reasonable suspicion.  What is reasonable suspicion?  If you believe somebody you have stopped at the airport is carrying a condom full of cocaine or heroin inside his body and you wait six hours but when <Col N="174" /> the person goes to the toilet there is still no sign of any drugs, what is reasonable suspicion in that case?  At what stage do you say: &ldquo;I am no longer reasonably suspicious&rdquo;?  There could be no end to it. You could be reasonably suspicious that a person was constipated for six months. The drafting of the Bill in this regard is not acceptable.  I demand that the rights of the individual be considered.  The way you might have reasonable suspicion is by taking on board the fact that there have been major technological advances in drug detection.  If you are going to detain somebody you need other powers also.  A known fact, which I must assume is known also to the draftspeople of this Bill in the Department, is that X-ray has been used regularly to identify packages inside the body cavities of people.  I stand to be corrected but, as far as I can see, under this legislation nobody has the right to X-ray somebody who is being detained.  Why?</P>
    <P>In the same way as under the drunken driving legislation a panel of doctors are available to the Garda, a panel of doctors who would examine detained persons should be available to the customs service. At the moment in terms of examination customs officers will strip somebody, and that is as far as they will go.  We have not discussed strip searching and maybe we should do so.  In terms of human dignity and the customs officers' sense of what they are capable of doing and where their powers extent to, they feel that they cannot go beyond stripping somebody naked and just visual examination. I know this is somewhat crude but this is how it operates so we had better know how it goes on.</P>
    <P>A medical examination could be included in this so that a person could be examined by a doctor; for instance, his body cavities or whatever could be examined to see whether he is carrying something. That should be included in the Bill. Similarly, there should be a doctor who would take X-rays and read them.  If a doctor reads an X-ray and says, &ldquo;There is obviously something inside there&rdquo;, surely that is reasonable suspicion on which to hold that person for six hours and another <Col N="175" /> six hours until we establish what that thing is.</P>
    <P>Not only in X-ray but also in urine testing incredible advances have been made in the last couple of years in indicating even the minutest traces of substances inside the body.  I want this Bill to cover that.  In other words, I do not want us to go through the charade of passing this legislation to find out this time next year that the most effective way of detecting illicit substances is through X-ray or urine testing and that unfortunately we do not have the powers to require people to subject themselves to X-ray or to give urine samples.  I say to the Minister that that is reasonable. Despite the lay-out of the Seanad, I am not speaking as a member of the Opposition. I am speaking as an Independent person here, giving my involvement in this, what I have learned and what I happen to know about it in those areas, and I hope my points will be taken on board because it will be a travesty if this Bill goes through as it stands at the moment.  I do not know whether I should refer to some of these tests that are available. It is not necessary to become too technical but I know that the Department are aware of the existence of these extra urine tests because discussions have taken place in the Department on these tests and methods.</P>
    <P>I could go on at some length on this area, but I am putting the Minister on notice that I will be putting forward amendments to this Bill and I want to put as positively as possible that the proposals I will be putting forward will, I believe, strengthen the Bill.  If these matters are not to be taken on board I ask the Minister to let me know when replying why that is so.  I was heartened to hear the Minister say at the outset that he intended to bring in some changes to the Bill, obviously on Committee Stage.  I am prepared to give whatever information I have in this area to any official of the Department of Finance.  I ask the Minister to take on board three things in particular, that the powers that gardaí have be extended to customs officers, <Col N="176" /> that the checks and balances I have mentioned be brought into this and that we frame legislation that will be able to cope with the advances and developments in detection technology.  Finally, I ask that we be conscious always of the citizen's rights as an individual which is part of our bounden duty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  The drug smuggling aspect of the Bill has seemed to cause most concern to people who have spoken, but other aspects of this Bill are very welcome and should be addressed also. There is no doubt that there is a need to strengthen the customs officers' role in fighting the major problem of drug smuggling. Again, conflict comes in here as to where the Customs and Excise officers seem to be doing their job and where they seem to be stopping the free flow of people at borders.  At times we all get into arguments as to how best we should stop the flow of drugs but very few of us passing through airports or seaports do not criticise the fact that we might be delayed at times because the customs officers who are doing their job delay us and maybe go through our luggage, our cars or whatever.  Therefore, there must be a balance as between what is necessary to prevent the importation of drugs and cognisance of the fact that people who are not smuggling feel that they are being put under unnecessary pressure if they have to open even a suitcase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a number of years when passing through airports and seaports there were times when one would love to see a customs officer come to open one's bags just to show that that officer was doing his job.  Sometimes when walking through airports one can feel that people are just standing around and unless you are of a particular colour or are carrying a Pacmac you will not be stopped.  Unfortunately, that is often the case.  If you are young and seem to have little in terms of material wealth, when passing through an airport you will be stopped.  If you pass through an airport and look reasonably well and relaxed you can walk through.  Therefore, there is dichotomy <Col N="177" /> in what the customs officers should be doing and the problem that sometimes it appears that people get through customs too freely.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole has mentioned the fact that the body can be used in various ways for the very sophisticated business of drug smuggling.  The drug smuggling that takes place in that way is limited in terms of the amount of drugs that can be smuggled but it can be exceptionally dangerous to the &ldquo;mules&rdquo;, as they are called, who are carrying the drugs, and mules they are because they get themselves into every sort of problem and they gain little out of it.  The people who are really into drug smuggling in a big way are in big business and are involved in multi-nation organisations.</P>
    <P>Anything that can be done to combat this major drug smuggling must be done, and I feel that nobody in this country would criticise an extension of powers of Customs and Excise where there is reasonable doubt or cause.  I am not sure what Senator O'Toole meant when he questioned &ldquo;in the vicinity of&rdquo;; and he mentioned that there are 25 or 30 places in Ireland which are airports and so on. If this Bill goes through, the Customs and Excise officers will be able to take anybody into custody.  &ldquo;In the vicinity of&rdquo; need not necessarily mean ten miles.  It might mean 20 miles, it might mean 50 miles but if there is a suspicion I hope it means that a person can be taken into custody at any place outside that area. Because of the sophistication of drug smuggling, we need the most up-to-date equipment at airports or at points of entry.  I do not think we have that.  I hope that as a result of this Bill the Customs and Excise people will be able to have supplied to them the best of equipment.</P>
    <P>The best way of checking for certain drugs is to have sniffer dogs.  I have never seen a sniffer dog at an airport or a seaport in Ireland.  I have never seen any sophisticated equipment to check for drugs coming in through any airport or seaport in Ireland.  I am not too sure whether this Bill will provide for the sophisticated equipment that is necessary. <Col N="178" /> A sniffer dog is not terribly sophisticated, although apparently it takes a lot of training for a dog to become knowledgeable about the different items that are in a person's clothing.</P>
    <P>Monitoring for drugs at seaports and airports has to be improved and monitoring at land crossings has to be improved.  The ordinary citizen is going to have to realise that if he goes across the Border he is going to be checked. If drugs are imported they had to be exported from another country which means that it is up to security or the Customs and Excise officers of any country to check people going into airports as well as coming out.  Better checks should be made at our airports and our seaports in case drugs are brought into this country and then brought out again.  There has been a suspicion that Ireland has been used as a staging post for the importation of drugs into Britain and from Britain to various other places.  It is suggested that a lot of the drugs are being brought in by land or sea transport.</P>
    <P>We have to get our legislation up-to-date. I do not want the Government to stop the Customs and Excise people if they say they need special equipment to help them in the drugs area.  There should be no great problem with that, but I do not like giving extra powers to Customs and Excise officers, to Revenue Commissioners or to anybody like that.  The powers should rest with the Government and the Garda.</P>
    <P>The Customs and Excise officer is the person who can make an initial arrest but then the offender should be handed over immediately to the civil authority, the Garda, and the law should take its course. I do not agree with the extension of powers to anybody other than the Garda. If the Customs and Excise are to be given extra rights, these rights should be in coordination with an extension in rights to the Garda.  In the past drugs have been imported into Ireland and because of lack of evidence and for various reasons, it would appear to many that people who were involved in the importation of enormous <Col N="179" /> amounts of drugs got away scotfree. Maybe powers of detention to detain people who are acting suspiciously might be considered.</P>
    <P>Five officers are now employed fulltime in the drugs unit.  Five people is not enough.  The people involved in the drugs division in the Garda would not consider they have enough people involved.  Anybody who has had a child killed because of drug addiction or living in desperate circumstances because of drug addiction would not consider that five people is enough to have trained within the customs service.  More people should be involved in that area and more people should be involved in the Garda Drug Squad.  The Garda Drug Squad and the Customs Drug Squad work extremely hard with very small numbers.  It is virtually impossible for them, even with the training they have, to prevent the major drug smuggling that is going on.  The Bill extends powers.  I would hope it will also mean an increase in effectiveness, enabling customs officers to have more of the modern procedures which should be available for the detection of smuggling.</P>
    <P>Much damage is being done to businesses because of the illegal importation of goods and this has been addressed in the Bill.  This aspect is also very important. One reads daily of the illegal importation of white goods, electrical goods and motor goods.  This illegal importation is going on on an enormous scale.  In the south of Ireland up to £10,000 worth of illegally imported drink has been taken by the Customs and Excise people.  Increasingly people are being brought to court for illegally importing white goods.  There has been a huge number of convictions or attempted convictions for importing electrical goods.  On a radio programme this morning they detailed where in the Glen of the Downs last weekend there were up to 50 caravans selling television sets and electrical goods.  I saw them on the Naas Road about a fortnight before.  We have trading Acts which would stop somebody from selling.  If somebody in Kilkenny <Col N="180" /> wants to trade on the side of the street he has to abide by the by-laws of Kilkenny and can only trade from 9 o'clock in the morning until 5.30 in a designated trading area, and anybody who trades outside that area is outside the law.  I have no doubt but that in County Wicklow there is a designated trading area because I know a court case was taken about two years ago against somebody who was selling fish in the street but fish is exempted from occasional trading as are home produced vegetables if they are sold by the farmer who produces them.  I cannot understand why the Garda or the customs officers or the county council in Wicklow did not take steps to ensure that all the goods of every trader in the Glen of the Downs last weekend were taken from them, these people were illegally trading. They were illegally and dangerously parked.  There was a similar situation on the Naas Road.  We had the same sort of problem about five years ago and now these traders are back again.  It does not make any difference whether they are selling material which is not suitable for the Irish system of television.  The fact is that under the Occasional Trading Act they should be eliminated from the roadside.</P>
    <P>If there are places in Ireland in which the Occasional Trading Act has not come into force yet I am not aware of them.  If these people are trading illegally they should be eliminated.  I do not mean that they should be eliminated by some sort of radar but they should be sent back to wherever they bought their Mercedes, their Volvos or their big caravans.  As much as 90 per cent of these vehicles are not taxed and we can assume that 90 per cent of the goods were illegally brought in.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for traders in the wine, spirits and beer business to make a living at present.  They have to compete against huge importations of illicit sprits from the North of Ireland in particular.  Their business has decreased considerably.  It is about time that the Customs and Excise officers were given power, as this Bill attempts to do, to get rid of this enormous problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="181" /> In the motor business the importation of spare parts has virtually eliminated the distribution of motor vehicle spare parts within a 50 mile radius of the Border.</P>
    <P>There is no point in saying that smuggling is not going on on a large scale.  It is.  We hope that as a result of this Bill, apart from additional powers, there will be additional staff.  This is not a matter of providing additional staff and getting no return.  The return would be enormous as has been the case since the Government initiated the 48 hour stay rule in regard to the importation of goods purchased outside the State.  There were queues on the Border before that rule was brought in and it was quite obvious that people were just going over the Border to avail of the differential between VAT rates.  In a lot of cases they were coming back with very bad bargains but they had a good day out and would never admit they got very bad bargains.</P>
    <P>That initiative on the part of the Government was of enormous value right across the Border areas from Donegal to Leitrim and Cavan and into County Louth.  This Bill should provide the Customs and Excise people with sufficient teeth to eliminate a lot of the other problems in the smuggling area.  There is enormous smuggling in the white goods trade and in the electrical field.  We will never know the extent of it.</P>
    <P>Again, the Bill contains clarification of Customs and Excise status of goods from Irish designated areas of the Continental Shelf.  I sincerely hope that there will be a huge amount of goods won from the Irish designated area of the Continental Shelf.  We have not seen very much from the Continental Shelf yet except a lot of people making a lot of money by buying shares in places where they thought that oil might be found.  It has not been found yet and I hope that somebody does find it and that we gain from it.</P>
    <P>So far as penalties in relation to breaches of Customs and Excise laws are concerned, if somebody is making a fortune out of smuggling, a £500 or £1,000 fine does not make any difference.  It is much better to put him away, to eliminate him from the scene where he cannot <Col N="182" /> smuggle rather than fining him £1,000.  If he is earning £1,000 a night on smuggling a £1,000 fine is not going to stop him; the confiscation of his truck is not going to stop him; the confiscation of his goods is not going to stop him, because he has paid so little and his profit is so big.  It is about time that we forgot about fining these people and put them into some place where they cannot do the job.</P>
    <P>The Bill is one which I hope will get rid of a lot of the black economy transactions and eliminate a lot of problems at our Borders.  I hope that apart from giving the Customs and Excise officers extra powers, they will also get the extra facilities that are needed to do their job.  I would suggest that in terms of penalties, to somebody in the smuggling business a fine of £1,000 is not going to deter him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been here since the start of the debate on the Second Stage of this Bill and indeed it has been a most interesting debate.  The Minister in his introductory speech showed a very open-minded approach and I am interested that he is going to put down amendments himself at a later stage, particularly ones in the area of tightening up the penalties.  That is an area in which I would wish to see some improvements in this Bill and I look forward to seeing his amendments in due course.</P>
      <P>Senator J. O'Toole made a most challenging speech during the course of which he talked about proper preventive educational approaches being the only cure in the area of drug abuse.  He is right in the sense that in the long term that is the only way in which the menace of drug abuse can be dealt with but in the short term and more immediately it is certainly my contention that this Bill is a very important and significant measure in placing restraints and curbs in the front line of defence against the horrible menace of drug importation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>References have been made about checks and balances and that is an area that interests me, which I hope to come to as I make my contribution to the Second Stage of this Bill.  Acknowledgement has been paid to the fact that this Bill was <Col N="183" /> circulated by the previous Government on 20 January last just before they left office.  Indeed, the Bill before us is identical. Everybody who has spoken in the course of the debate is agreed on the horror of drug addiction and drug abuse. It was interesting to hear Senators Loughrey and Mooney comment in particular on smuggling, and the seriousness of it in the Border areas or, indeed, on the frontier as it is referred to in this Bill. Obviously one shares their concern for trade and traders in that area who suffer serious disadvantages as a consequence of the prevalence of smuggling and smuggled goods and the depredations of people who pay no dues or taxes and seem to ride roughshod over the various legal measures already in place.  One hopes that this legislation will be a further curb on the illegal activities.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made in the course of contributions to soft and hard drugs.  I tend to agree with Senator O'Toole who said that really this is just a convenient epithet in dealing with drugs and that there really is no such thing because what we are talking about is a drug culture. We are talking about addictive and dependent personalities who become prey to the easy availability of drugs. Anything that can be done to ward off this evil and danger is to be welcomed. The Bill certainly is such a measure.  The measures in it are in line with those which confer additional powers on the Garda under the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1984.</P>
    <P>In doing some research for my contribution to this debate I found it interesting that the principal Act, the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, was first presented to the Dáil in 1973, came into operation in 1979 and had its main work done by an all-party committee in 1976.  After a lot of hard work by all sides in the House that legislation was agreed.  The legislation before us is, by an large, the fruits of an all-party approach.  A task force was set up on drugs and drug addiction. The Second Report of the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism had as its main objective consideration of the role of officers of <Col N="184" /> Customs and Excise in controlling the supply of illegal drugs.  Careful reading of this report certainly vindicates all the hard work and the energy that the members of the committee put into their deliberations because so much of what they recommended is contained in the Bill.  Those people who have a jaundiced attitude towards committees of the House and who really, in my view, fail to understand the important and significant work they do, must surely be gratified when they see the actual effect of the work of a committee incorporated into legislation.  I compliment the members of that committee on their work.</P>
    <P>It is sad to note, indeed, that some five members of the committee were not re-elected either to the Dáil or Seanad.  Certainly, the suggestions in their contributions are enshrined in legislation and that should in some way help them to cope with what I am sure was a disappointment in not being re-elected. Their very presence in this House was meaningful and purposeful.</P>
    <P>The Bill comes in a similar spirit to the preceding Bill and it is extremely important legislation.  What it really does is to seek to safeguard our society from the very real and growing menace of drugs.  The Bill faces facts and realities. Although I am very much of a liberal cast of mind, and I understand the apprehensions and criticisms of the Bill which emanated from Senator O'Toole, nevertheless the menace is so great and the threat is so real that I would not wish to see the Bill watered down in any way.  I would like full explanations and a fleshing out by way of further clarification of some of the measures in the Bill but, certainly, any suggestion that the Bill should be watered down is to me unacceptable.  The amendments which I gather the Minister has in mind will strengthen and tighten the Bill by increasing penalties.  Although I have not seen them I believe they will meet with my approval.</P>
    <P>As legislators the bottom line of our duty, and our area of responsibility, is to protect young innocent and vulnerable people and to safeguard society in general. I am happy that is what this Bill <Col N="185" /> intends to do.  We must do all in our power legislatively to wipe out the growing and ever-present menace of drug abuse.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a major step towards combating the increased drug abuse problem and every concerned and aware person must welcome it for this reason.  It is necessary to crack down hard, swiftly and effectively at the front line, at the point of importation of these drugs.  That must be done in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the men and women of the customs service.  They have an essential regulatory role.  It is not, I should imagine, a particularly pleasant task.  It is necessary to be ever vigilant, watchful, careful and to act in an assertive competent fashion when intervention is required.  Theirs is a tough and difficult task.  It is one where I feel the areas of checks and balances in giving increased powers are important and must be right because there is a certain area which is open to abuse and many Senators in their contributions have referred to it.  Reasonable suspicion are the grounds upon which detention can be pursued by customs officers.  I was interested to hear Senator Lanigan refer to persons of a particular colour or appearance being, perhaps, targeted or viewed with suspicion or prejudice by customs officers. There is a feeling abroad that this, in fact, is the case.  Senator O'Toole referred to a Member of the Oireachtas who had been detained on three occasions.  While I do not exactly know who that person is I should imagine that that person may have been bearded, may have been carrying a rucksack, had sandals and may have looked slightly off-beat and bohemian and if my identikit picture helps anybody in ascertaining who that person is I would be interested to talk to them afterwards. That danger exists and is real.  It is something we should be aware of.  Middle-aged mothers looking entirely respectable and conventional and the picture of the establishment could walk through a customs check laden with cocaine, heroin, cannabis or any other substance but they do not immediately excite suspicion. <Col N="186" /> That is something to be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to remember civil rights, and, indeed, the statutory rights of citizens as was referred to by Senator Mooney in the course of his contribution. Powers to strip search would appear to be part and parcel of the Bill.  Certainly, I would like to have details as to who is going to conduct these searches.  Internal examinations of orifices, such as have been referred to by Senator O'Toole, must, in my view, be medically supervised and conducted.  There should be some indication that members of the public who have been apprehended or detained should have some redress where they are manifestly proved to be innocent and where there were no reasonable grounds for suspicion for detaining them. The public must not be embarrassed or abused by reason of the provisions in this Bill.</P>
    <P>As somebody who lives in a portal city, the fourth largest city in the country with a major port, I am concerned about the possibility of the importation of quantities of drugs in containers.  Research into this Bill has indicated to me that there is very sophisticated technical equipment available to assist in establishing whether or not containers contain drugs.  These are items called X-ray aerospace centres.  I gather they cost £10 million each and that four of these would be required if we were to conduct reasonable surveillance at our ports.  I certainly imagine, resources being so scarce at present, that it would be unlikely that that type of investment in preventive measures would be made by the Government. The Revenue Commissioners have indicated that at least four of these would be required if we are effectively to examine container traffic coming into the country.  At the end of the day the onus is on importers to ensure that their containers are not being used to import drugs.  In the absence of more sophisticated equipment, this is the only way in which we can approach that containerisation problem.</P>
    <P>I should like more information in the course of the Minister's reply on Second <Col N="187" /> Stage about the training and resources which would be made available for customs officials.  It seems that in giving increased powers there must be an input by way of training given, in order to ensure that these powers are understood very clearly, that their limits are quite clearly known to the customs officials and that their implementation will be a smooth, an intelligent and an effective one in the greatest interests of all whom this legislation seeks to protect.</P>
    <P>In recent times the whole pattern of drug abuse has changed considerably, both in terms of its magnitude and in terms of the nature of the problem.  The level of drug abuse has increased dramatically. Surveys conducted by the Medical Social Research Board indicate frightening increases.  This Bill is part of a measure of response to the growing incidence of the problem.  It is part of a co-ordinated plan to combat it.</P>
    <P>The general provision of the Bill is based on informed opinion and perceived need.  It deserves the wholehearted support of the House, which I am sure will be forthcoming.  The growing level of drug abuse has brought about an increased public awareness of the problem.  The whole area of drug smuggling is a high finance area and it is being glamourised in the media.  One has only to think of television programmes like Miami Vice to understand the level of perceived glamour attached to drug trafficking which is being fed daily to gullible people who watch that programme in particular, and other similar programmes.  There is an aura of high living and high finance attached to the area.  It is very important that our legislation gives the lie to that kind of approach which is being promulgated courtesy of radio and, in particular, television and films.</P>
    <P>Drug abuse is a scourge.  It leaves in its wake a trail of damage, destruction and, indeed, death.  It has become an appalling problem in Dublin.  Therefore, it is very important that we should cut drugs off at the front line, at the points of import. The prevalence of heroin addiction in north central Dublin is widely known <Col N="188" /> and, indeed, is being combated energetically by citizens in that area, by the gardaí and other authorities.  One statistic I came across was that 12 per cent of people between the ages of 15 and 19 years in that area were a prey to heroin addiction.  There was a horrifying figure for females which was worse than the equivalent figure some five years ago in the black ghettos of New York.  These frightening statistics serve to remind us of our responsibilities, because Dublin is a fairly severely drug-scarred city.</P>
    <P>These drugs, in the main, do not grow here.  People have been known to grow cannabis in their back gardens, but heroin has been imported through our ports and airports.  The cities attached to our ports and areas around our airports are likely centres for the growth of drug abuse if the sort of remedial action proposed in the Bill does not get the support it deserves.  I will reserve further discussion on this for Committee Stage, when I hope we can receive from the Minister answers to questions such as: what does the vicinity of a port, airport or land frontier mean?  Is it the immediate vicinity?  Is it within a five mile radius?  It is necessary that Senators should have that very clearly explained.  Questions about the education, equipment and training of customs officers in the exercise of these new powers are ones that I should like to hear answered by the Minister on Committee Stage.  The presence of medical personnel in the searching of people I would like to have confirmed and clarification on the increase in penalties which will be part and parcel of this legislation.  These are the points I look forward to discussing further on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivianOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cathaoirleach will be relieved to hear that I will not have as much to say as some of the previous speakers because much of what I should like to have said has already been said. It is becoming abundantly clear as the debate develops that this Bill is a response to the need to give more powers to officers in the Customs and Excise service, primarily in two areas of drug <Col N="189" /> control and in the control of the importation of illicit contraband in the shape of white goods, motor car equipment, drink and so on.  I shall confine my remarks to these two areas.</P>
      <P>I should like to subscribe to what has been said about the absolute necessity to provide additional facilities for our customs officials in their efforts to combat the present huge upsurge of drug importation. We should not delude ourselves that we are having even a minute effect on this war at present because there is no doubt, from recent surveys of two of our large schools in Dublin, neither of which is in the inner city, that the bulk of the students had dabbled at some stage or other in drugs.  Drugs are freely available as a consequence of being imported in large quantities.</P>
      <P>One disconcerting document I find in front of me here today is the explanatory memorandum in which, under the heading of &ldquo;Financial Implications&rdquo;, the Minister makes it quite clear that it is not intended to recruit any additional staff.  I tend to subscribe almost exclusively to the point of view of the Government that we should not be recruiting people in practically any area of the public service but, if there are to be exceptions, I respectfully suggest to the Minister that this is an obvious area of exception.  If we are serious about this problem, this is one area to which we have to address ourselves first.  If we are giving additional powers to Customs and Excise officers, we must also provide them with additional personnel.  That is essential to any kind of success this measure will have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The financial ramifications of that staff increase would easily be redressed within a year.  Considering the value of drug seizures and the success of Customs and Excise officers in recent times in the seizure of drink in Counties Kerry, Limerick and parts of Galway I have no doubt that with the provision of extra personnel and equipment this seizure rate will increase quite substantially.  In my own county we have 700 miles of coastline and only 30 or 40 customs officers.  Considering that amount of coastline how can anyone <Col N="190" /> reasonably expect them to patrol it? Unfortunately, when we debate the activities of Customs and Excise officers we think only of Dublin and Cork Airports and forget the fact, which was referred to by Senator O'Toole, that there are 56 landing strips in this country any of which can be used at any time, especially considering the sophistication of the night flying equipment which is in use at present.  How can we reasonably expect the staff of the Customs and Excise service who are stretched to the absolute limit at present to be more effective as a result of this legislation if extra personnel are not provided?  It just cannot be done and I suggest to the Minister that, for this Bill to be effective in any shape or form, we must talk about increased personnel and equipment even if it means the redeployment of staff.</P>
    <P>I ask people to be mindful of the fact that the impact of the importation of illegal goods into this country from Northern Ireland is not exclusive to the Border counties.  Of all the Members in this House, I live the furthest away from the Border and I know of a large number of traders who are badly affected by the activities of illegal street traders.  Any Member of this House who is also a member of a local authority will be aware that this matter has been raised <i>ad nauseam</i> at council meetings.  Despite the fact that there is in place a 1980 or 1981 Bill, anyone who walks the streets of any rural town will find these people trading, with absolute impunity, in illegally imported goods.  We should not console ourselves that they are goods of an inferior quality because quite often they are of a superior quality to anything which is available in this country.  Therefore, let us not delude ourselves because there is a substantial amount of this type of trading going on.  In towns such as Listowel and Tralee, which are hundreds of miles from the Border, there have been huge seizures of illegally imported drink.  This drink was exported from Dublin and recrossed the Border a couple of days later.  That gives an idea of the extent of the problem.  We should not delude ourselves that this problem can be <Col N="191" /> tackled by the existing personnel who work along the Border or in any of the other countries.  If this legislation is to be successful, extra personnel will have to be provided.  If they are not, this will amount to nothing more than a superfluous exercise.</P>
    <P>I listened with great interest to what Senator O'Toole had to say.  The Minister will have to reassure us that the additional powers will not infringe on civil liberties and this matter will have to be sussed out a little bit more satisfactorily than what has been done to date.  I have no objection to the provision of these additional powers for our customs officials but, in the discharge of their duties, they will also have to be subjected to supervision. Strip searching is a very emotive subject in this country and we are very forthcoming when we speak about strip searching in another part of this country. Therefore, let us be mindful of the fact that, if we are providing officers of the State with that right, they should also be subject to some supervision.  These are matters on which I should like greater assurances from the Minister.  As I said at the outset, I subscribe to the provision of additional powers for our customs officers but we should also put in place the many checks and balances to which many Members of this House referred this afternoon.  I am not entirely satisfied that that type of additional control is outlined in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other items I should like to touch on.  I am surprised that we are making an assault on one of the few remaining cottage industries in rural Ireland, the unfortunate distiller of poitín.  He seems to be getting the jaundiced eye of the Minister.  We should contrast his activities with those of our friends who smuggle hundreds and hundreds of cases of Powers whiskey across the Border.  Having said that, and at the expense of sounding facetious, we did tend to be a little bit flippant in the past about the sales of poitín, wrenballs and all other things which are associated with rural Ireland which many people here <Col N="192" /> might not necessarily understand.  Unfortunately, there is an additional dimension to this debate nowadays because of the large numbers of unemployed young people in our towns and villages who, if they decide to have a party or go for a drink, cannot afford to go by the legitimate route of going to a cash and carry or an off-licence to buy drink and who may have access to this type of illicit liquor.  We have seen reports in the newspapers, even as late as last Sunday, of Intermediate Certificate parties organised by young people between the ages of 12 and 14 years, many of whom were later found in a drunken condition.  If there are sizeable supplies of poitín readily available in rural towns it will add a new dimension to this problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined an increase in the fine of £1,000 and I would like him to tell us if there will be an increase in the fine for those found selling poitín.  In this legislation, we are going after the producer. If a publican was found to be selling poitín, which was quite often the case, it used to have very serious implications for his licence.  If we go after the producer we should also go after the wholesaler and this problem should be pursued in many of the counties in the west with great vehemence.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I welcome the thrust of the Bill.  It is a timely and overdue Bill. It is a vote of confidence in the activities of our Customs and Excise officials who face a very difficult task.  As I outlined at the outset, I am ill-disposed to an increase in the number of personnel in the public sector.  Today we have been talking about the necessity to make some impact on the illegal importation of drugs and, if this Bill is to be effective, we must provide extra personnel and equipment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which the House is now debating.  I had the privilege of being a member of the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism, who recommended in their report on the role of the officers of the Customs and Excise service in controlling the illegal supply of drugs that additional powers should be given to them in order <Col N="193" /> to enable them to tackle the problem of drug smuggling.  I would like to thank a number of Senators who made very kind remarks about that Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased to note that the previous Government and the present Government took into account the work of the committee in relation to the matter before the House and also another report of the committee in relation to video recordings which will come before the House very shortly.  The great advantage of the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism and other such committees is that when they were established by the previous Government they gave every backbencher an opportunity to examine serious problems in our society and to make recommendations. One of the recommendations in the report of that committee has been acted upon and is now incorporated in this legislation.  I sincerely hope that the Government will re-establish that committee as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the committee drew up their report in 1984, the Misuse of Drugs Bill, as it was known then, was before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The committee felt that their recommendations should have been incorporated in that Bill so as to provide an ideal opportunity for tackling the problem without delay. The committee were of the view that Customs and Excise officers were the first in line to tackle the supply of drugs.  They had no function once the drugs had passed beyond the immediate point of importation; it was then a matter for the Garda.  The committee felt that Customs and Excise officers should have similar powers to those of the Garda so as to give them a realistic chance of dealing with the problem of drug smuggling. During the course of committee meetings I came to know terms that were new to me &mdash; greeters and meeters, swallowers and stuffers.  After a short time it was obvious that people who come into a country by aircraft or boat can in a very professional way pass on to someone who <Col N="194" /> meets or greets them the illicit drugs they carry.</P>

    <Title>National Primary and Secondary Roads: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Senator McGowan on Wednesday, 30 September 1987.</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann expresses the need to enforce the law to control all traffic using our National Primary Roads and National Secondary Roads to ensure that (a) all vehicles are roadworthy, (b) vehicles are not overloaded, (c) drivers observe the statutory speed limits and parking by-laws.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete the words &ldquo;National Primary Roads and National Secondary Roads&ldquo; and substitute &ldquo;roads&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator J. O'Toole.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackDaly" hpid="Mr. J. Daly Mr. J. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator McGowan for bringing this motion before the House.  It interests me particularly from the point of view of vehicles that are not roadworthy.  Ireland is one of a minority of member states of the EC which do not have a compulsory car testing scheme.  Such a scheme is probably more essential in Ireland than in other member states because of the manner in which the national stock of used cars is aging rapidly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1982 one third of cars in use on our roads were five years or older.  Today that proportion is at least a half, an extraordinary increase in just five years.  In 1982 there were just 237,000 cars that were over five years old whereas today there are at least another 100,000 such cars.  A new phenomenon is compounding this problem.  With the removal of the previous restrictions on the importation of used cars and with so many of our citizens being unable to afford a new car because of excessive Government <Col N="195" /> taxes &mdash; I mean all Governments because they have all looked on the car industry as a soft option, though that has proved to be counter productive &mdash; there has been a striking increase in the number of used vehicles imported into this country. In the first eight months of this year 7,600 such vehicles were imported.  These included tractors, vans, trucks and cars. The frightening statistic is that 64 per cent of those vehicles were older than five years and 44 per cent were older than seven years.  We all know, and I sure the Minister will agree, that whiskey and fiddles are about the only two things that improve with age.</P>
    <P>There is a real fear that the Republic will become the dumping ground for cars and commercial vehicles which have failed the MOT test in Great Britain. Many of these imports come through Northern Ireland where the authorities themselves have expressed concern at the number of unsafe vehicles which are coming on the Northern Ireland market from the UK.</P>
    <P>Vehicle defects have been shown to be a contributory factor in one in 12 motor accidents.  A Garda exercise in 1986 of checking vehicles over four days identified 261 vehicle defects.  If we really believe in road safety we cannot allow the national stock of used cars to age rapidly without introducing some measures to ensure that the vehicles are in a safe condition before they are used on the public roads.  Sooner or later the Government will be compelled by the Commission of the European Communities to introduce a compulsory test for cars and light commercial vehicles.  I would like to see the Government take some initiative at this stage rather than wait until they have no choice.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the very large number of vehicles which require checking it should be possible to devise a scheme which would be self financing and which, apart from achieving its primary objective of improving the safety standards of cars and light commercial vehicles, would also give a much needed boost to employment in the motor trade.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="196" /> In 1984, 384 commercial vehicles were imported.  In 1985, the corresponding figure was 979.  In 1986 it was 1,439.  For the first eight months of 1987, the figure was 1,189, an increase of almost 50 per cent on the corresponding figure of 789 for the same period last year.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to a few points Senator McGowan made.  The main thrust of what he said was correct. However, there are a few matters I would like to correct.  Senator McGowan said:</P>
    <P>It should be a very serious offence for someone to use a vehicle over a very long period without a speedometer and without having the vehicle registered.  It should also be a very serious offence to then sell that same vehicle as an unregistered vehicle or as a new vehicle to somebody who does not have technical knowledge.  Somebody will buy the vehicle as a new vehicle with no mileage on it when in fact it may already have covered 50,000 miles over a two to three year period. That is one aspect of vehicle and traffic law which has to be looked at.</P>
    <P>I point out to Senator McGowan that when you buy a new or unregistered vehicle you get a certificate of origin. That certificate of origin shows the date on which the car was manufactured.  Anybody receiving that document &mdash; which is necessary to tax a vehicle &mdash; would know straight away if a vehicle was three years old.  Then the question arises &mdash; a natural one for anyone without any technical knowledge &mdash; why is that vehicle three years old?  If they know anything at all about cars they will know that cars do not improve with mileage either.  I would point out to Senator McGowan that the law exists subject to enforcement.  Senator McGowan continued to say:</P>
    <P>It should be a criminal offence to buy a vehicle that had been involved in a crash or written off by an insurance company and then to reinstate and sell that vehicle without the new owner realising that the vehicle had, in fact, been written off on some previous <Col N="197" /> occasion.  That is a very serious problem and one that not only endangers the life of the motorist but also the lives of others.  It is a problem which needs to be looked at, it should be a matter of serious concern.</P>
    <P>If you look at any newspaper you will see crashed vehicles for sale.</P>
    <P>Insurance companies when dealing with cars that have been damaged severely are in the habit of writing them off.  They tend not to want the hassle of having such cars repaired and, when repaired, the owners saying they are not satisfied with them.  For instance if a car's pre-accident value was estimated at £10,000 and they contended the post-accident value was £6,000, they would write it off at £4,000, sell the vehicle for its salvage value which makes matters easier for them.  As Senator McGowan rightly said the next purchaser of that car should know that it had been involved in a crash and its extent.  I might point out that there are two types of vehicle crashes.  There is the one which occasions superficial body damage, bearing in mind that the body is one of the most expensive parts of a car. For convenience that would be written of by the insurance company involved.  But if the chassis and transmission are sound structurally that affords the insurance company an easy way out.</P>
    <P>I am sure it would satisfy Senator McGowan, or anybody else buying any such car if the insurance companies &mdash; and they are well equipped now with computers and so on and it should not create any difficulty &mdash; had the registration books stamped to the effect that the car was a write-off.  Then the relevant insurance companies can get in touch with each other about whether they should offer a person cover.  The reason I say that is that the vehicle could be put back on the road if its body was repaired in a proper body shop.  The Minister of State has full knowledge of this.  He worked in a body shop for a number of years and served his time with Gibsons on the Quay in Cork, a company with which I worked in another area when they were manufacturing copper roofs.  I <Col N="198" /> was working on the relevant churches.  I might say he was a very good panel beater.  Perhaps he will pass on the skill to his sons.  He will appreciate that if the vehicle is properly repaired &mdash; even if it had suffered structural damage &mdash; and is lined up on the car bench, that car could be inspected by the insurance companies' assessors.  They all have their own or employ assessors.  They could have their assessor, who will be a engineer, to examine that car.  They need not insure it unless they are satisfied with his report. The Minister will know also that the same car could be repaired by some fellow operating in a back lane who would not have a car bench, who would pull it with a chain and a block to straighten it out. The car might not then be in line.  It might very well constitute a potential danger to its drivers and so on.  If such a car was examined by an assessor he would know straight away that there had been a black economy job done on it and would not pass it for roadworthiness.  I am glad the Minister is present because he knows more about this than I do. Then Senator McGowan had to say:</P>
    <P>All secondhand vehicles imported into this country, and here I am mainly talking about commercial vehicles, should have to undergo a mechanical test before they are allowed onto the road.  My information is reasonably accurate.  I can say here without any fear of contradiction that I can go abroad, buy a commercial vehicle, import it and then go to the local tax office to get a licence for a period of one month.  I can put on the road a vehicle that has come off a scrap heap or failed an MOT test in England without the need for any log and without any restriction.  I think that is totally wrong.  All too often the vehicle is bought cheaply and it is not roadworthy in the first instance because it has failed the MOT test in England or it would have cost too much money to put it through the test, therefore it was put up for auction.</P>
    <P>He is perfectly right in that comment. That is something that should be examined <Col N="199" /> because in that way the law is only being brought into disrepute.  We should either scrap the law or have it enforced.</P>
    <P>I would need another day on this subject but I suppose I cannot have that.  I shall conclude by thanking Senators Fallon, Ferris and O'Toole who took part in this debate.  I am putting my faith in the Minister.  I know the matter will be in good hands.</P>

      <P>Ní mór dom i dtosach báire a rá gur cúis áthais dom a bheith anseo chun cur leis an tairiscint seo.  Mar a dúirt An Seanadóir Ó'Dálaigh tá roinnt taithí agam ar cursaí atá luaite aige.</P>
      <P>In welcoming the opportunity to contribute to this debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, I am prompted to remind Members that, of course, the subject matter under discussion is aligned with the activities of my Department in that we are responsible for the legislation in association with the Department of the Environment. Then it is the responsibility of the Department of Justice to ensure that it is enforced.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Daly for having said that I would know something about the technicalities of the activities he discussed. All I would add is that we repaired them and he sold them.  But he could be sure in the knowledge that, when they were repaired by us, there was no need for anybody to inspect them because our work was of the highest standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall endeavour in my contribution to deal with the main issues referred to in the motion and, in addition, to refer to a number of points raised by Members during the course of the debate.  The responsibility of the Minister for Justice in this matter relates mainly to Garda enforcement of the relevant provisions of the Road Traffic and Road Transport Acts.  Senators will be aware that responsibility for road traffic legislation is a matter for my colleague the Minister for the Environment who was present <Col N="200" /> during the debate last week.  In this regard the House will be pleased to know that the Minister for the Environment is at present carrying out a thorough review of that legislation.  He has asked me to say that he also welcomes this debate and the opportunity it presents to hear the views of Senators as part of his assessment of the adequacy or otherwise of the existing legislation.  A comprehensive legislative and regulatory framework is a prerequisite for effective Garda enforcement. In this regard, Senators will be interested to know that there is close co-operation between the Garda Síochána, the Department of Justice and the Department of the Environment in relation to road traffic matters.</P>
    <P>In relation to Garda enforcement, I want to assure the House that the general enforcement of this legislation is, in my view, very satisfactory.  The statistics, which I will quote at a later stage, indicate, that there is a very high level of enforcement of these laws, and this has been acknowledged by a number of Senators in the course of this debate.  The Minister for Justice has consulted with the Garda authorities who are the principal enforcement agency in this regard and they have assured him that the enforcement of road traffic legislation is, of course, regarded by them as a matter of the highest priority and receives as much attention as possible having regard to the very many other demands on Garda resources, particularly those of a security nature.  There is at present in each Garda division throughout the State a traffic corps unit whose specific responsibility is enforcement of the traffic and parking laws on all public roads, including the national primary roads and national secondary roads.  In addition to the special responsibility entrusted to this unit, the enforcement of the law in matters such as roadworthiness of vehicles, overloading of vehicles, speed limits, parking by-laws and drink-driving is also the responsibility of all uniformed members of the Garda Síochána.  The measure of the commitment of the Garda to road traffic enforcement is evidenced by the fact that prosecutions of highway <Col N="201" /> code offences account for over 90 per cent of all non-indictable offences prosecuted. The Commissioner's report on crime for 1986 records that over half a million offences under the Road Traffic, Road Transport and Road Acts were prosecuted in that year.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the specific aspects of the road traffic laws to which this motion is directed, starting with items (a) and (b)  of the motion, which relate to roadworthiness of vehicles, and maximum vehicle weights.  The minimum safety requirements for motor vehicles are laid down in the Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles Regulations and the Lighting of Vehicles Regulations made by the Minister for the Environment under the Road Traffic Acts. These regulations as we are all well aware are kept under regular review and are updated to take account of technical developments and safety innovations. There are substantial penalties for driving a dangerously defective vehicle.  The convicted offender is liable to a maximum fine of £350 and/or a prison term not exceeding three months.  For a second or subsequent offence within a period of three years, an offender faces an automatic disqualification from driving for a minimum period of six months.  I note the particular concern shown in this House about the roadworthiness of heavy goods vehicles.  Dangerously defective goods vehicles are a lethal menace to other road users due to their size and their weight. The roadworthiness of buses which carry large numbers of passengers is also a matter of concern and a very high standard of roadworthiness is essential in the interest of public safety.  The primary responsibility for regularly checking the safety of heavy goods vehicles and buses and ensuring that all necessary maintenance and repairs are carried out naturally rests with the owners and the operators.  In this context the Minister for the Environment has informed me that since 1983 a compulsory scheme of annual roadworthiness testing applies to heavy goods vehicles, buses and ambulances <Col N="202" /> in accordance with the requirements of an EC directive.  In 1986 for example about 44,000 heavy goods vehicles, buses and ambulances were tested, principally by private garages appointed by the local authorities to carry out the prescribed tests.  The overall pass rate was 88 per cent &mdash; not a very reassuring rate when one considers what is at stake, and this even included 54 per cent of vehicles which passed only after defects that were detected during an initial test had been rectified.  Vehicles which fail in this system of testing must be either retested or taken off the road. It is an offence to use a vehicle unless it is covered by a current certificate of roadworthiness.  The maximum penalty is £500 and/or a prison term not exceeding six months.  Taxis are inspected annually by Garda Síochána Public Service Vehicle Inspectors.  I believe that rigid enforcement of these vehicles testing and inspection arrangements provides an effective means of identifying and remedying defective vehicles and ensuring that they are kept off our roads.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators expressed concern about the possibility of defective used heavy goods vehicles being imported and licensed for up to one year, without being roadworthiness tested.  I am pleased to inform the House that the European Communities (Vehicle Testing) (Amendment) Regulations, 1986, effectively deals with this potential problem. Imported used heavy goods vehicles and buses are now temporarily registered and licensed for a period of one month &mdash; solely to allow the vehicles to be roadworthiness tested in this country.  During this one-month period the vehicles cannot legally carry goods or passengers for reward.  The temporary licence or tax disc is clearly over-printed with the letter &ldquo;R&rdquo; so as to be readily identifiable to the gardaí.  The temporary registration book for the vehicles is clearly marked to indicate that it has been issued pending roadworthiness testing.</P>
    <P>The case for enforcing maximum vehicle weights is, I believe, unanswerable. The overloaded goods vehicle is a danger to the lorry driver, to other <Col N="203" /> vehicle drivers and their passengers, to pedestrians and cyclists.  Overloading can of course also do substantial damage to our roads and bridges, leading to increased maintenance and renewal costs which have to be funded by the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Many of our roads were not constructed for the numbers and weights of vehicles that are now travelling these roads.  As well as that, overloading by some hauliers means that those operators who comply with the law are at a competitive disadvantage.  In the past, the Garda Síochána were severely hampered in trying to enforce the legal weight limits.  They only had access to privately-owned weighbridges and then only on certain days and at certain hours.  Also some of the weighbridges had not the capacity to weigh the bigger and heavier lorries.  To overcome this problem, a weighbridge programme has been undertaken by local authorities with 100 per cent grant funding from the Department of the Environment.  The programme involves the provision of 14 weighbridges at strategic locations on national primary and secondary routes, at an estimated total cost of about £1.2 million.  To date, nine weighbridges have been completed and are operational and the balance should be completed by the end of the year.  These weighbridges are capable of weighing up to 60 tonnes.  They are available to the Garda on a 24-hour basis, seven days a week.  They are in addition to the network of 93 appointed weighbridges already available throughout the country of which 70 are owned by private firms and 23 are owned by local authorities.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister for the Environment is considering an increase in the operational radius of weighbridges from the present five miles to a more realistic distance &mdash; say ten miles &mdash; and that he would welcome the views of Senators on this.  Pending the enactment of appropriate legislation, the Garda have been equipped on a pilot basis with sets of axle weigh pads, which can be transported in Garda cars and can be used at any roadside location.  Overloading is <Col N="204" /> one of the few offences on the Statute Book where the convicted offender is liable to mandatory penalties which range from £50 for overloading a vehicle by between one and two metric tonnes above its legal gross weight limit to £650 for overloading a vehicle by five tonnes or more.  These are in addition to the ordinary maximum fine of £350.  I understand that the Minister for the Environment is also looking at the possibility of extending mandatory penalties to cover other overloading offences.</P>
    <P>The case has been made by Senator Farrell that a particular load on a rigid truck is less damaging than the same load on an articulated truck.  I understand that the Minister for the Environment is very willing to receive and consider any technical data submitted in support of this case.  Points have also been made to the effect that hauliers from outside the State are getting away with breaching the laws pertaining to vehicle weights and roadworthiness. These hauliers are of course subject to the same laws as our own hauliers.  There may be some legal difficulties in proceeding against offending hauliers once they have left the jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>With regard to Garda enforcement of the laws pertaining to vehicle weights and roadworthiness, the crime report of 1986 shows that in that year 30,651 proceedings were taken for offences of defective tyres, steering, brakes and overloading, and that 18,815 proceedings were taken for breaches of lighting regulations.</P>
    <P>With regard to (c), statutory speed limits and parking by-laws, a total of 15,568 proceedings were taken for exceeding the statutory speed limits in respect of all categories of speed limits including those for built-up areas.  I suppose a few of us have contributed to that statistic; I plead guilty.  In respect of parking by-laws there were 77,409 proceedings for breaches of local by-laws and 4,641 for offences under the road traffic general by-laws.  Breaches of certain parking offences are dealt with under the fines-on-the-spot system by the issue of notices by gardaí and traffic wardens. In 1986 484,953 notices were issued in <Col N="205" /> respect of traffic violations.  I believe, and I am sure Members will agree with me, that these figures serve to illustrate the high level of enforcement of the relevant legislation which I referred to earlier.</P>
    <P>I am sure you have all seen the sign &ldquo;SPEED KILLS&rdquo; and it follows therefore that realistic constraints on speed are of major importance in improving road safety and reducing road accident casualties.  A range of speed limits apply to roads and vehicles.  The maximum general speed limit on Irish roads is 55 m.p.h. This limit was prescribed in 1978 largely as an energy conservation measure. There is a widely held view that, taking into account the improvements carried out to our road network in recent years and the better standards of vehicle design, there is no longer an established need for a 55 m.p.h. limit and that a higher limit would be more realistic, more acceptable and easier to enforce. Proposals were put forward last January by the Minister for the Environment that the general speed limit should be raised to 62.5 m.p.h. or 100 kilometres per hour with higher limits for dual carriageways and motorways.  There was a response from many interested organisations and members of the general public and the Minister is at present examining their submissions.  I need hardly add that, irrespective of whatever statutory speed limits are imposed at any particular location, individual motorists must at all times drive at a speed and in a manner which takes account of the conditions which apply at that time.  Something we learn when we are starting to drive is know your car and know your driving.  A similar responsibility applies to motorists in relation to parking.  Despite the best efforts of the Garda and traffic wardens throughout the country, certain motorists fail to realise that illegal and inconsiderate parking not only shows scant consideration for the interest of other road users but is ultimately detrimental to their own interests.  The Road Traffic Acts provide a comprehensive range of parking controls.  There is power to remove illegally parked vehicles or those causing an obstruction.  Parking in a <Col N="206" /> dangerous position is forbidden.  The General Road Traffic By-Laws prescribe rules for the parking of vehicles which apply nationwide, while local parking controls are set out in local traffic and parking by-laws and temporary rules made by the Garda Commissioner.  These by-laws and rules cover a wide range of controls such as clearways, double and single lines and meter parking.  The &ldquo;on-the-spot-fine&rdquo; system applies to these controls and as I have said half a million on-the-spot fine notices were issued by the Garda and traffic wardens in 1986. This shows that enforcement is taken seriously.  It also reflects the selfish way in which a proportion of motorists totally disregard these controls, which are designed to improve the flow of traffic through urban areas to the benefit of all. I should mention that proposals for the introduction of specific controls on the parking of large vehicles in the Dublin area has been developed by the Garda in consultation with the Department of the Environment and Dublin Corporation and are being considered at present. These proposals involve the introduction of particular controls, initially on a pilot basis.  The question of extending them to other areas would be reviewed in the light of experience gained in the operation of the pilot scheme for the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>I would now like to comment on the amendment to the motion.  I am especially concerned that the drink-driving laws are strictly observed.  I am not saying that in any narrow sense because of the emblem that I have on my coat. The Garda Síochána are ever-vigilant in the detection of drink-driving offences. Nearly 11,000 persons were breath-tested in 1986 as indicated in the crime report I have mentioned twice and there were 7,000 analyses of blood and urine specimens. Proceedings were taken for various categories of drink-driving offences in over 8,000 cases.  The Garda authorities say that the publicity campaigns, especially those conducted over the Christmas period in which the public are exhorted not to risk drinking while under the influence of drink are having the effect of increasing public awareness to <Col N="207" /> the dangers of drinking and driving, not least the danger of being detected.  The substantial increase in the maximum penalties provided for under the 1984 Road Traffic Act must also be a deterrent and the seriousness with which drink-driving is viewed is underlined by the level of present penalties.  For instance, a person found guilty of a drink-driving offence may be fined up to a maximum of £1,000, receive a prison sentence of up to six months and will receive a mandatory disqualification from driving for a minimum of one year.  It should hardly be necessary to draw attention to the responsibility that rests on all drivers in regard to proper behaviour while in charge of a vehicle. Irresponsible behaviour can lead to loss of life and untold grief to the bereaved, as well as the risk to livelihood by convictions and disqualifications.  At this point I would like to acknowledge that, of course, the majority of fleet owners, car owners and drivers are conscious of their responsibilities, but it is the minority whom we have to pursue under the regulations.</P>
    <P>Lest it be taken that only the motorist has an obligation in this regard, no individual road user whether he or she be on foot or a pedal-cycle or motor-cycle should forget his or her obligation to the safety of other road users and to his or her own safety.  The Garda need the help and co-operation of all in their task to protect road users and make the roads safe, and there is a social and moral obligation on everyone to observe the road traffic laws.  In conclusion, I can assure the House that my colleague, the Minister for Justice, is determined to ensure that there is adequate enforcement of the road traffic laws and also that the Minister for the Environment is equally determined that there is an adequate legislative and regulatory framework for the enforcement of these laws.  Any suggestions or criticisms of the laws or of their enforcement which Members of this House have made will be carefully considered and acted upon where possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the motion <Col N="208" /> before the House.  At the outset let me say that we have no problem in the acceptance of the amendments put down by Senator J. O'Toole and Senator B. Ryan.  In connection with the first amendment, most of the damage to our roads is done in the area of main roads and county roads, about which I wish to speak at a later date.  It is of prime importance that our national primary and national secondary roads are constructed to the highest EC standards for the purposes of mapping and acceptance of the legal tonnage that will and can be carried elsewhere in Europe and right across the EC countries.  Our standards must be of the highest, not less than those of our partners in the EC.  Our spinal roads especially must be as good as any in Europe, and if we fall behind in that regard moneys must be made available from the EC to bring our national primary and secondary roads to the highest possible standards.</P>
      <P>EC trucks travelling right across the EC are what is known now as multi-axle trucks and are generally used by EC transporters.  They are of a very high standard and very high speed with a most efficient driver personnel whom I want to compliment when we meet them on our roads.  The courtesy, training and vigilance observed by the EC drivers, and, indeed our own drivers who use EC motorways are of the highest.  The multi-axle trucks are not causing a great deal of damage to our national primary or national secondary roads because the load is spread over five axles and does not exercise the same stress on our roads as might occur on an inferior type of road. Tonnage is the unit quoted at tender time by the firms so it is important that that be regulated here as well as in any other country where these lorries ply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that some breaches of the law occur in traffic across the Border on certain days.  Senators have pointed out that on Saturdays and holydays vigilance is not enforced as stringently as on other days.  Such practice must be stopped.  It is possible that smuggling to a high degree can occur on Saturdays and holydays <Col N="209" /> when vigilance and security measures are relaxed.</P>
    <P>Regarding the amendment which covers all roads, our national axle weight is in the region of ten tonnes per axle. If that weight is increased by even one tonne, then with a multiplier of four and for stress purposes that would mean a stress tonnage of roughly 27 to 28 tonnes. That is the technological assessment that has been reached now as a result of using a four unit multiplier.  It is a serious consideration if you increase your tonnage per axle by one tonne, to have a stress of something in the region of 27 to 28 tonnes.  I would like more information on this.  Now that the Minister has spoken I will not be able to get it.</P>
    <P>I was a bit disappointed with the Minister's reply to this motion in that it was very statistical.  Indeed that is only what I would expect from a reply that is coming from two Departments.  There is here an overlapping of functions between the Department of Justice and the Department of the Environment.  In the reply to this motion the Minister has adhered mostly to statistical evidence that is available on the records of the State.  I would have welcomed suggestions for further control of the tonnage on roads that are not national primary or national secondary roads.  The main roads and county roads are the most seriously damaged by merchants delivering goods regardless of the type of truck used.  They put as much as possible on to the truck and get it out to the customer as fast as possible.  There is no weight limit.</P>
    <P>County roads and main roads were not built to carry trucks delivering blocks, cement and builders' supplies, or to cater for low loaders carrying heavy machinery on bog roads with poor bases.  There is no control on the type of vehicles used and there is no control on road users.  It is all right to talk about providing weighbridges throughout the country, but in County Mayo there is not a local authority weighbridge in operation at the moment, and it is a vast county.  I, as spokesman for the Environment, spoke on a recent Bill going through the House and I thought at that time that weighbridges <Col N="210" /> would be available in each local authority district.  To date there is no official local authority weighbridge in County Mayo.</P>
    <P>The other arrangement whereby one uses private weighbridges is not the answer.  When a traffic corps identifies a truck overloading and damaging roads in Mayo, one has to take that truck out of Mayo to get it officially weighed.  That is something that should not happen.  I would welcome the establishment of a local authority weighbridge in the counties that have not got them already.  We must have a limit on the tonnage being carried on county and main roads.  Our roads are unable to take the type of traffic they are carrying at the moment and legislation was put forward here in order to cover overloading.</P>
    <P>I concur with Senator Daly in connection with the importation of secondhand buses and trucks from other EC countries.  Because of the high level of import duty on new vehicles here many people have been lured to Great Britain and other countries to purchase good secondhand trucks and coaches to be used here.  Indeed we are all to blame for having this import duty in force at the moment.  On our accession to the EC our manufacturers were told to get themselves geared, because in ten years time import duty would be lifted and they would then have to compete against vehicles manufactured abroad.  Import duty is still there and it lures people out of this country to purchase trucks that may not be roadworthy.  I am glad to see from the Minister's reply that he is now taking particular notice of that, and one can only licence a vehicle for a short period until such time as the trucks come up to the required standards for taxing in this country on a yearly basis.  That is something that we must all welcome.</P>
    <P>I would welcome the prospect of the removal of the import duty.  It would eliminate the traffic that is being generated because of this import duty, which causes our people to have to pay from £5,000 to £15,000 more than their European counterparts for vehicles.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment <Col N="211" /> mentioned new regulations with regard to the location of weighbridges, but they are impossible to implement.  In the old Bill five miles was the distance that one could impose to take a driver to a weighbridge. It would be unfair to ask people using the ferries to go back 20 miles or further to have a heavily laden truck weighed, when he might as a result of that check miss the ferry.  That would retard the competitiveness of that haulier in trying to complete with his EC counterparts. Any traffic corps check points for overloading should be in close proximity to the existing local authority weighbridges. When we get our full quota of weighbridges we can have a fresh look at the position.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the damage being done to our roads by overloading of trucks on our county roads and main roads.  A considerable amount of money is being wasted every year trying to continually reconstruct our county roads and bring them up to standard.  It behoves every one of us to take the necessary measures.  As legislators, it is our duty to ensure that the minimum damage is done to our roads and bridges.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, and to the Minister for the Environment to ensure that our county roads and smaller roads will not be distorted and broken up by overladen trucks.  It is happening day in and day out.  A traffic corps cannot control it because of the lack of weighbridges in remote areas.  I appeal to the Ministers for the Environment and Justice to examine the position.  That is where the whole distortion of our roads is taking place. Our national primary and secondary roads must be of the highest standards, and will be.  The hard core and method of construction of these roads make them as good as any other country.  We should ensure that they are.  Most of the damage is being done on our main roads and county roads.  Therefore I would ask the Minister to try, with the Minister for the Environment, to bring in some system to control the overloading on our roads in the remote areas across the whole country which are being damaged day in and <Col N="212" /> day out by the type of traffic that I have already mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief because there are many contributors to this motion.  I want to welcome the amendment to it as well.  I concur with everything Senator O'Toole said, especially in relation to the standard of our national primary and national secondary roads.  We should have the same EC standards here as they have all over Europe and I know we are moving in that direction.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to part of the Minister's excellent contribution.  A few alarming statistics came up.  It was found that 5,000 heavy goods vehicles, which include buses and ambulances, were deemed unfit to be on our roads in 1986.  That is a very high percentage for a very small population of three million people, 12 per cent.  I welcome the nine new weighbridges which are now in operation.  I look forward to the day when every local authority will have a weighbridge in its own area, and that includes County Mayo because that is a vast county, as Senator O'Toole said, and people there must travel up to 100 miles to Galway or any other county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the speed limits, I agree with the Minister that 55 miles per hour is a bit too slow on certain roads.  One hundred kilometres, that is 62.5 miles per hour, would be more realistic.  I would also advocate that the speed limit on our dual carriageways should be increased to 70 miles per hour because, with dual carriageways today and with modern technology now being used in motor cars, people can safely travel at 70 miles per hour.  In regard to the speed limit system, speed limit meters should be put in place, particularly on our dual carriageways.  In Europe they are placed on minor roads that cross dual carriageways.  They automatically take a photograph of any car that exceeds the speed limit.  Motorists stick rigidly to the 70 miles per hour because it is very easy to pick up eight or ten tickets if they do not and, at £50 a fine one will not travel very far.  If one is working for an employer it will not be <Col N="213" /> too long before one is dismissed.  Just knowing that those speed limit meters are there will ensure that the motorist will not take a chance because he will not know when he will come upon one.</P>
    <P>In relation to drunken driving, I concur totally with all that the Minister has said. I have no sympathy whatsoever for anyone driving a vehicle under the influence of alcohol.  Out of 11,000 persons breathalysed in 1986, 8,000 came before the courts.  This shows the serious situation that exists here.  I know we are not alone in this and it happens in most countries.  Driving under the influence of alcohol is irresponsible; it can lead to loss of life and untold grief for the bereaved. Unfortunately these things happen and far too often.  I will only be too delighted to lend my total and wholehearted support to anything that will tighten up the law here.  Not only does one have to look out for oneself but one must look out for the person in the other car.  There is an appalling situation and it is about time that something was done to make the laws far more strict.  I would go so far as to say that drunken drivers should be banned from driving for five years.  It is one of the greatest crimes, a person driving a motor car under the influence of alcohol can endanger hundreds of people.</P>
    <P>I fully support the motion and I urge the Minister to do all in his power to upgrade the standard of our roads.  They are at an all-time low at the moment. Communication by air waves and by telephone is important but road and rail are as important today as they ever were.  I fully support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion.  I do not want to repeat what has already been said.  I would like to see some of the allocation for national primary roads going towards the secondary roads as most of our national primary roads are up to quite a good standard.  Our national secondary roads seem to be in a bad state, and some of them carry as high a volume of traffic as the primary roads.  I would like if perhaps the Minister would take this into consideration and see if we could <Col N="214" /> get an allocation for national secondary roads as well.</P>
      <P>There has been a lot of comment made about overladen articulated trucks using our roads.  Our county road network was surfaced originally for the ass and cart. Then, in the last 20 years or so modern farm machinery came in and some of our county roads were turned back into mud tracks.  It looks as if some of those roads will be no-go areas soon unless the block grant is restored to local authorities.  The block grant was the backbone of the development and resurfacing of our county roads.  With a 14 per cent cut in our support grant, our roads will fall into a greater state of deterioration and that will be a sad day for the people of rural Ireland.  We have responsibility for the people who live off county roads as well as those who live off national primary routes.  We could even go further.  The local improvements scheme which was enacted approximately 15 years ago was a wonderful scheme.  Under it local roads which were nothing more than mud tracks were surfaced and made traversable. We are now in the position where we cannot make passible a road or a boreen to a person's house where there is only one holding.  Those unfortunate people who live in rural areas had no say about where they were born.  They were born in a backward part of the country but nobody has come to their rescue and given them a grant to improve the approach to their residences.  The Minister should consider extending the local improvements scheme to cover roads leading to a house where there is only one family using that road.  There may be only one person living off that road but others may have property alongside it. Those people whould be entitled to a local improvements scheme grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to dwell on imports and exports but it is important to point out that our road network has improved immensely over the past 30 years. However, in the past four or five years our country, main and national secondary roads have fallen into a state of disrepair. Most local authorities are concerned. Some of them, such as Longford County <Col N="215" /> Council, the second smallest county in Ireland, with 600 miles of county roads, have admitted that the allocation for those roads means that every 45 years we will get around to repairing a road. Having regard to the average lifespan of people, it looks like such roads will be resurfaced once in their lifetime.  Is that a christian way to treat people living in rural areas?  Their home is their castle and if they have not got a decent avenue into their home there will be a greater flight from rural areas than at present.  I am sorry I had to change from the emphasis of previous speakers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivianOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address this rather thorny subject of roads.  It evolves around road maintenance.  The motion seeks proper and adequate control over the activities of overladen vehicles and so on.  We want to at least arrest in some shape or form the huge deterioration taking place particularly, as my colleague Senator Doherty has said, on national, secondary and county roads.  It is a huge problem in rural parts of the country.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to one aspect which has not been referred to and which is particularly relevant to the Department of the Environment.  We will have to look very seriously in the future, under the aegis of our planning Acts, at whether the condition of roads adjacent to proposed industrial development areas are suitable for the kind of vehicular traffic that will increase by virtue of its proximity to this industrial location.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my own constituency the town of Castletownbere was designated in the mid-sixties as a major fisheries port.  Considerable Government investment has taken place in that port since then.  The initial costs to develop the port were in excess of £15 million but despite that very successful debate in that now we have magnificent fisheries facilities there is no proper road into the town.  The officials of the Department of Fisheries must have known that a fisheries port of that dimension would mean that there would be a constant convoy of 16-wheel articulated <Col N="216" /> refrigerated trucks traversing between Castletownbere and Spain, France, the U.K. and other northern European countries on an hourly basis.  It has reached the stage where certain hauliers, international and national, are now refusing to take produce from that port because of the serious deterioration that takes place in their trucking fleet by virtue of the requirement of having to go to Castle-townbere to haul fish.</P>
    <P>The other side of that coin is that as a result of the substantial development in our creamery industry once obscure branches of co-ops are now being serviced on a daily basis, quite often twice daily, by huge articulated trucks traversing on what can only be described as boreens which are deteriorating by the minute, because it is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment to direct our planning officials.  County councils quite often meet, deputations from co-ops complaining about the high costs to the co-ops of taxing their vehicles and so on but they are not particularly interested when the contra argument is put, that the high cost to the local authority of maintaining the roads arises because of the damage these totally unsuitable collection vehicles are causing to our county roads.  This has a planning dimension and it is something that should be borne in mind in the context of general overall industrial development in the future.  If we are to proceed with industrial development, particularly in rural areas, a contribution towards the up-grading of the road in that immediate vicinity will have to be an ingredient in the grant contribution either by the IDA or by the local authority or whoever is deemed to be the relevant authority to ensure that the road is kept in some kind of reasonable condition.  I ask the Minister to bear that in mind.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to one or two other points which relate to our desire for new legislation.  We have a great facility for introducing new legislation on a regular basis.  Traffic and parking by-laws are a classic case in point but, despite the sizeable proliferation in traffic control legislation in recent years one can walk <Col N="217" /> down any street in any town and find vehicles parked on footpaths, obstructing people trying to push prams, those of retarded vision and so on.  Quite often, I suspect it is a superfluous exercise to introduce all types of fancy traffic controls into our legislation when at the end of the day there is no great effort made to implement those regulations.  Yet if one drives at 41 miles an hour at the edge of town one may be stopped by a Garda who may say: &ldquo;Sorry, I must take your details because you are in excess of the speed limit.&rdquo;  Yet all the other equally relevant and equally important pieces of legislation that relate to the control of traffic seem to be totally ignored.  The same applies to the casual trading legislation for example.  Huge tracts of car parks in every town are being used for this purpose on a regular basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling, of course.  If I may touch briefly on the amendment in relation to the position of drinking and driving, we get some sanctimonious pronouncements from time to time about the necessity for imposing with great vehemence the drunken driving legislation.  Nobody would deny that necessity by virtue of the facts.  We all have occasion quite often to attend funerals of persons killed in traffic accidents and so on.  A serious way of redressing that situation would involve the occasions where people consume excessive amounts of drink.  I could cite discos, for example, as a classic case in point. We have had a number of very serious tragedies quite adjacent to this city in <Col N="218" /> recent years caused by people speeding on their way to or from discos and so on in the middle of night.  There appears to be no great degree of control over what is happening.</P>
      <P>There is a great deal of apprehension among people who do not consume at any time in their lives excessive amounts of alcohol or do not drive their vehicles when they have taken excessive amounts of alcohol and yet can be caught and prosecuted and put off the road, suffering all the other attached embarrassments involved in a drunken driving prosecution. Yet one only has to be in the precincts of a dancehall on a Sunday night to find, not one, two or three, but hundreds of cars being driven with great indiscretion and in excess of the speed limit.  This is something that should be looked at by the Garda authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion which was put down in the names of the Fianna Fáil group in the Seanad is one that has full support from both sides of the House. There is a need to ensure implementation of all laws involved in the enforcement of traffic regulations.  This morning anyone who drove up from the country would have seen that traffic regulations were not being adhered to, particularly in the case of a number of very heavy trucks from the North of Ireland going through this country at speeds definitely in excess of 60 miles an hour and with defective lights.  One should not ordinarily need lights in the morning, but this morning there was fog and very heavy rain.  These vehicles did not have adequate protection over their tyres and as a result the spray coming back made certain that nobody could pass them.  They were travelling at speeds in excess of 60 or 70 miles an hour. I would guarantee that if 90 per cent of these trucks had been stopped, they would not have been found to have tacho-graphs; they would not have been seen to have tyres which were of adequate standard; they would not at all have been up to the standards that people in the south of Ireland with trucks of the same size have to adhere to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not suggesting that all the problems <Col N="219" /> of the control of traffic relate to trucks from the North of Ireland or trucks which come in from the Continent.  But it has to be said that an Irish truck, on arrival from an Irish port at Liverpool, France or elsewhere is checked immediately. There is a check of the tachograph and in respect of weight.  There is also a check as to whether the driver has consumed alcohol to excess.  Trucks coming in here from the Continent are not checked to the same extent.  If an Irish truck is pulled in at Liverpool, it cannot leave the holding station there if the tachograph is not working or if the tyres are not up to standard.  But a truck coming in here from England will not be held in custody until the driver gets his tachograph or his tyres changed.</P>
    <P>I cannot for the life of me see why Irish vehicles going abroad have to adhere to normal EC standards when trucks coming in here from abroad do not have to adhere to the same standards.  If an Irish truck is stopped on the road in Belgium, France, Holland, Germany, Denmark, Spain, Portugal or Greece it will not be allowed back on the road unless it is brought up to standard.  Here, if a truck comes in from outside the jurisdiction it is stopped and the driver will get an indication of a fine for the problem, whether it be for bad tyres, overloading or not having a tachograph and then he can just drive away, whereas the Irish truck must remain on the side of the road until someone deals with the problem.  If we are going to have law enforcement in the EC, it should be across the board enforcement.  Irish road hauliers have to operate from a legal base that is much more strict than that which has to be adhered to by trucks coming in here from outside Ireland.  Again, an observation of the speed limit, in the North of Ireland the truck driver is the person deemed to be guilty of speeding, whereas if a truck driver in the south of Ireland is caught speeding, the owner of the truck and the driver are at fault.</P>
    <P>Our roads are not fit for some of the loads that are being carried, in particular, by vehicles coming in from outside.  It <Col N="220" /> was suggested that there should be an increase from 38 to 40 tonnes on the loads that could be legally carried by Irish road hauliers.  I would agree with this if they are going abroad.  If they are carrying a load from Ireland to the Continent, they should be allowed to carry the load which is the legal limit, at least the legal limit going abroad.  Very few of these trucks drive for many miles on Irish roads with heavy loads.  They get to the Continent and they are able to carry the 40 tonnes maximum.  If they are stopped before they reach an Irish port, they can be summoned for overloading.  An Italian truck coming in with 40 tonnes on board is legally entitled to carry 40 tonnes on board but why should an Italian truck driving on Irish roads be legally entitled to carry 40 tonnes whereas an Irish truck on Irish roads is not legally entitled to carry similar weight but only 38 tonnes? That truck gets to the Continent and it is all right.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned that Irish drivers in general are not great at observing the statutory speed limits.  We should have a legal system whereby certain roads had a higher speed limit than others.  There is no doubt that on dual carriageways or on motorways one can travel at a higher speed than on a national secondary or county road.  The parking by-laws, in certain areas are a farce.  In Kilkenny that is not the case because the by-laws are strictly adhered to and the number of cases being taken against those who park illegally is growing every week.</P>
    <P>The unroadworthiness of vehicles is a major problem.  There is no unroadworthy Irish registered vehicle because every Irish registered vehicle has to undertake a Department of the Environment test on a regular basis whereas those vehicles entering this country from Northern Ireland can move freely without a Department of the Environment certificate.  Vehicles from Northern Ireland which have a Ministry of Trade certificate from the North are operating here.  They are being used by hauliers from the North in the South because they <Col N="221" /> know there is nothing that can be done to them.</P>
    <P>This motion was put down in an effort to ensure that those who use our roads can use them safely.  It is a plea to the Minister to ensure that vehicles which are unroadworthy should not be on the roads.  Private cars in this country do not need to have a Department of the Environment certificate and it is about time they did.  A commercial motor vehicle has to go through a test on a regular basis and why should a private car not have to do the same test?  Anybody who drives from here to Cork or Kilkenny tonight will see the one-eyed monsters coming against them &mdash; the lads who have not even replaced headlights.  As they travel away from you, you will be able to see that they have not replaced their tail lights.  If they have not replaced either their tail lights or headlights one can imagine what their tyres and their suspensions must be like.  One of the reasons for putting down this motion is to ensure that from a very early stage we will have compulsory testing of all motor vehicles in this country.</P>

As of today and for the past three days this school is closed due to official strike because of the condition of the school.  That strike will be renewed in future weeks.  From next week there <Col N="222" /> will be a parents' strike when the children will be withdrawn for at least one day per week.  This will go on indefinitely until such time as this dispute is settled.</P>
      <P>The school in Frenchpark was built in 1950.  It was built of sub-standard and second-hand materials.  It is now in an appalling state of dereliction.  It consists of a main building, the one built in 1950, which has two classrooms and ancilliary facilities such as cloakroom and toilet space although they could hardly be described as such nowadays.  On the school grounds there is one prefab building which is 20 years old and totally rotten.  One classroom is accommodated in a local parochial hall which is situated about a half a mile from the main school building.  There are 110 pupils on the roll.</P>
      <P>Let me give the House a brief description of the building.  I will not give the House my description of the building, instead I will read from reports of the county medical officer for County Roscommon.  These reports were published in March 1984 and in April 1987. He said that the main school building is definitely unsuitable; that it is cold and damp; that it is intermittently rat infested; that it is overcrowded and has only partial toilet space; that the heating is effective in moderate weather and hopeless in cold weather and that the ventilation is very poor.  If the windows are opened they may fail apart and therefore, they must remain closed.  Regarding the prefabricated classroom along with most of the comments which had been applied to the main building were also applicable to the prefab.</P>
      <P>He summed up his report on this prefabricated building by saying that it is falling to pieces.  On the parochial hall housing one of the school's classrooms, the medical officer reports that the place is very poor and unsuitable and the heating is very poor.  His final comment was that it is totally inadequate and unfit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me elaborate a little further on this classroom in the hall as it is about half a mile away from the main school building. On each school day the school transport service drops 28 young children who are taught in this classroom at the main building <Col N="223" /> and they must be taken on foot for a half mile under the supervision of their teacher to the hall along a very busy national primary road, the N5.  This has to be done in all kinds of weather.  The age range of these children is from six to eight years.  I think the Minister of State will agree that this is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The campaign to provide better school facilities in Frenchpark goes back for almost seven years.  For a number of years, in the early stages, there was a lengthy debate with a lot of prevarication by the Department as to whether the old school should be extended and repaired or whether a new school should be provided. That argument was finally settled late in 1984.  Early in March 1985, after the Department had instructed him to do so, the manager applied formally for a new school and then the lengthy cumbersome planning process began.  The sketch plans for the school were prepared by the manager's architect and sent to the Department on 24 January 1986.  The Department approved the sketch plans on 21 March 1986.  On 29 April the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Enda Kenny, the then Minister of State at the Department of Education, visited and inspected the school.  He freely agreed that the buildings were disgraceful and he promised that he would push all the remaining stages ahead with all possible speed and this, I acknowledge in this House, he did exactly.</P>
    <P>The discussion on the level of grant was quickly out of the way.  The Minister sanctioned a grant of 92 per cent of total cost which an Opposition TD in the constituency described at that time as &ldquo;one of the highest levels of grant ever sanctioned&rdquo;.  Instruction was then issued from the Department of Education that the working drawings should be drawn up and this was done.  They were submitted and sanctioned by the Department in record time.  The bills of quantities were asked for by the Department and they were prepared and sanctioned at the end of 1986.  They were also done in record time.  Late in January <Col N="224" /> 1987 the Minister of State released the project to tender.  Tenders were submitted and the Department were in a position to appoint a contractor to build in April last.  But, alas, that did not happen because the Minister would not sign the order.</P>
    <P>In June of this year a deputation representing the management and parents met the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke.  She told the delegation that she could not sign the order to go to contract because the previous Government had not given her sufficient money to go ahead with the work.  She apparently forgot that the previous Government had been out of office for four weeks before the budget for this year and that the educational budget was also brought in by the present Government. In charity one can only say that an excuse of that kind is contemptible or laughable. However, based on the photographic evidence that was presented to the Minister on that day she did agree that the school was in an appalling condition and she promised that it would get top priority as soon as finance was available.  She stated also that if there was any finance left over from her school building budget for 1987 &mdash; which apparently will not now be the case &mdash; Frenchpark school would get the benefit of this.  All the rumours that are now coming forth seem to suggest that there will be very little money, some might say none, for school buildings in 1987.  This sends reverberations down the spines of people who are interested in this project in Frenchpark.</P>
    <P>There is an absolute duty on the Minister to sanction this project now.  She has described the building as appalling.  She used those words to the delegation who met her last May.  The Minister of State, Deputy Terry Leyden attended a public meeting in Frenchpark on 11 January last.  He was then a member of the Fianna Fáil Frontbench and was obviously talking with the full authority of the Fianna Fáil Frontbench when, as reported in the <i>Roscommon Herald</i> of 16 January 1987, he described this school as an educational ghetto and said it was the worst building he had ever seen.  He said it should be a <Col N="225" /> top priority of the Government, of any Government, to provide the money for that project.</P>
    <P>This building is a wretched, derelict, appalling, awful place.  I appeal to the Minister to sanction the grant now.  To anyone in power, with even the least sense of duty, this cries out for correction and we call on you, Minister to use your power to correct it.</P>

      <P>Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh agus mo bhuíochas, chomh maith don Seanadóir Conchubhair as ucht an seans seo a thabhairt dom labhairt ar an scoil seo.</P>
      <P>It is a cause of sadness to me and to my colleagues in Frenchpark national school and to teachers everywhere that we have one more time to draw attention to yet another hedge school.  This does not even deserve the title of hedge school.  The school in question is an eye sore on a public highway for any one driving past Frenchpark on the western side.  On this problem, the parents, teachers, management, the parish priest and everybody else in the community is of the same mind.  I am not going to go into the exact details because Senator Connor has outlined them clearly and very effectively in a way that cannot be matched.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school has been inspected by the INTO, by the local community, by management authorities and by health authorities and all have the same view, that is that the school is not a suitable place in which either to learn or to teach.  That is the precise position that must be attacked.  The main building is structurally unsound.  The question might need to be asked as to why it is structurally unsound considering that it has been in existence for only 40 years or less.  This school is falling to pieces.  The roof is leaking, the toilets are constantly flooding, windows are rotten and draughty and there is a totally inadequate heating system.  It is not a place in which there could be created a proper ambience for the education of children.  One might well ask what the children and the teachers in the school have done that prevents them having the same level of support <Col N="226" /> and the kind of surroundings that are available in other schools.</P>
    <P>The prefab in use at Frenchpark is 20 years old.  I do not know if people understand the long-term difficulties associated with such buildings, whether in respect of having to use them for the purpose of education or for living in.  Basically, they are too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter.  Research has shown that among those using the older prefabs, there is a particularly high incidence of health problems such as heavy flu and chest problems.  The prefab we are talking of has rotten floors and broken windows and there is a fear that the windows will fall out.  A member of the teaching staff has told me that when a lorry passes by items fall off the shelves in the prefab. There was a terrible situation in a school in Donegal a year ago when a prefab was blown into the sea.  The prefab at Frenchpark could be turned over, too, because it is so dangerously structured at present.</P>
    <P>The INTO representative, Michael McGarry, who examined the school said that it is a disgrace to the educational service and should be replaced immediately. The fourth classroom is totally unsuitable because, as was outlined by Senator Connor, it is on the far side of a national highway.  It is unacceptable that this level of risk and isolation should be imposed on the pupils.  The sanitary conditions are appalling; ventilation is poor; heating is hopeless; rats have been found in the school and vermin is a constant problem.  Luckily, the teachers have retained a sense of humour.  One teacher said to me that the place is becoming too bad even for the rats and the mice to come into it now.  It is unsuitable, cold, damp and vermin infested.</P>
    <P>I will not go through the health inspector's report except to say that in 1985 the school was considered by the health inspectors to be totally and utterly unsuitable as a school.  They said then that action should be taken without delay to deal with the problem.  Neither will I go through what happened in 1985, 1986 and 1987 in terms of the school project being at the stage of being ready to go to tender. <Col N="227" /> Senator Connor has outlined that.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister does not stand up and tell us what has happened over the last four years.  The people of Frenchpark have a right to know what is going to happen next because everybody knows precisely and <i>ad nauseam</i> what has happened so far.  All we need to know now is what the next step is to be.  The absolute insult and the final ignominy in this whole business was to hear the Minister for Education say this week that she was going to consult with the Department about the school.  Somebody should tell the Minister that she is the Minister and that she can make a decision in these matters.  She should do this immediately for the sake of education, of the service at this school and of the children who are trying to learn in those absolutely desperate conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what has been said about the condition of the school.  I visited this school during the summer and, like all others, I agree that the building is entirely unsatisfactory. Therefore I am anxious that we move as quickly as possible to have the school replaced.  However, I have to correct Senator Connor in regard to the situation. He was rather political in his description of events.  I want to set the record straight in that regard but this is not in any way to take away from the urgency of having progress made on this school, details of which I will talk about in a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This school has been in a bad situation since the beginning of 1985 when a decision was taken that it should be replaced.  On going through the various planning stages, I can find no evidence of any great degree of urgency in regards to a stage being reached where the planning and architectural drawings could be completed so that we could get on with the construction of this school.  Furthermore, I find that a considerable amount of time was wasted during the period of the last Government in carrying out a number of feasibility studies and other exercises <Col N="228" /> which if this school needed to be so replaced so urgently were not necessary. An aspect of the planning of this project which leaves me with little choice other than to be in the position I am now in.  The position is that my predecessor approved the invitation of tenders for this school together with 26 other projects just a couple of weeks before he left office.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor is incorrect in saying that allocations are based on budgetary decisions.  They are not.  Financial allocations are based on the Estimates.  The Estimate for 1987 under which I am now operating is the Estimate of the previous Coalition Government.  My difficulty is that my prececessor authorised 26 projects to go to tender in January of this year, knowing full well that he would not be in a position from the Estimate he had provided to proceed with the construction of those schools.  That is precisely my difficulty.  It has been my difficulty since I took this office.  We want to proceed with Frenchpark but we are not in a position to do so because of the fact that our allocation in the 1987 Estimate only allows us to carry out works which were in progress.  We are not in a position to start any of the 26 projects which went out to tender in January of this year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="229" /> It is only one of a number of schools in a similar situation which appalled me when I went to visit them throughout the summer.  There is an urgent need to proceed with the construction of a new school but the situation I find myself in in the current year prevents me from making any progress for the remainder of this year.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in addition to other serious problematic projects to be carried out throughout the country.  In view of the situation that pertains in Frenchpark I have asked a senior official from my Department to enter into early negotiations with the school authorities to see what steps it may be possible to take to improve the situation, pending the construction of the new school.  They are prepared to make a significant effort to improve the prefabricated building and, in fact, if possible to replace the prefabricated building without causing any delay in the overall project.  We are prepared to carry out other short term interim measures in order to relieve the present conditions.  I am interested in Senator Connor's comment on young children being left at the school and then having to walk half a mile.  Perhaps he might tell me, with your permission a Chathaoirligh, why they are not being dropped off at the hall?  Is there a reason they cannot be taken to the hall?</P>

      <P>On a point of information, I would like to clarify two points. First, an insurance problem is the reason they have to be dropped off at the school. Second, you cannot have a class in isolation from the rest of the school.  There will be times when they operate in joint activities and they have to communicate up and down through the school.</P>

      <P>I accept that.  I am attempting to improve a bad situation.  I accept there are difficulties and that it is not at all satisfactory that the school should be split in the way it is.  I am genuinely concerned about trying to improve the situation in the short term because, even if we started the school in the morning, it would not be built for 12 months.  I am anxious to carry out whatever short term interim measures will improve this situation in Frenchpark and, as soon as the financial situation changes, Frenchpark will certainly be one of the first projects to proceed.</P>
